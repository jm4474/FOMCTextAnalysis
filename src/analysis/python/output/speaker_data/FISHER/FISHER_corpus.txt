 [Statement--see Appendix]   We need to approve the System's $825 million participation in the intervention operation of August 19th  SPEAKER(?) So moved   [Statement--see Appendix] Mr Chairman, I'd be happy to answer questions on my report or to move on to Agenda item 4C as the Committee wishes   The System's reciprocal currency arrangements come up for renewal at this time of year, including the existing $700 million swap with the Bank of Mexico, which is relied upon as part of the package being prepared I have no changes to suggest in the terms and conditions of the existing swap arrangements and I request that the Committee approve their renewal without change I'd be happy to answer questions on the renewal of the existing swap arrangements Ted has something to say about the Mexican package being worked out now [We can proceed with] Ted or questions, either way   I'd like to add that I think the question of whether we would use them, given the current high level of balances, is a very different one than whether we would want to have them available for other central banks to use It's essentially a question of cooperation and whether having them in place isn't a good idea as a sign of central bank cooperation   $250 million   They're renewed annually They are one-year swaps which are renewed each year And at this time the Committee authorizes the manager to renew them for the coming year   Yes It's fortuitous   I will be referring briefly to two pages of color charts which Carol was kind enough to put on the table in front of you this morning [Statement--see Appendix]   [Statement--see Appendix]   Yes, undoubtedly   There were some days on which the criticism of hedge funds or leveraged funds or derivatives worsened the impact That impact wasn't very long-lived, but there were a few days when comments by officials, especially the ones by unnamed officials allegedly getting tough on hedge funds or derivatives, were counterproductive I wouldn't put that as a dominant effect but at the margin it was a factor   Thank you [Statement--see Appendix]   The dollar would trade off   It's very hard to put a number on that Let me start by saying that if the Committee does something in the range of what the market is expecting, I'm not sure the dollar will move up very abruptly I think it will tend to pip up and pip down a little bit as has happened with previous actions of the Committee I think inaction by the Committee could have a downside risk to the dollar The market is fairly neutral at this point In the interbank sense, its position is such that inaction could result in significant dollar sales   I think that the morning of May 4 began with President Tietmeyer's release of his statement that they did not have an interest in seeing the mark overvalued against the dollar One consultation in which I was engaged was a discussion of the nature of the dollar's reaction to the mark and that it seemed to move awfully quickly and without regard to where people thought interest rates were going in each of the countries The nature of the disturbance in the exchange market was the focus of my discussions with most of the other countries that I consulted with--I consulted with my counterparts in    5/17/94  the G-7 central banks and a few others When I say "disturbed" market conditions, I'm referring to April 29 when very seasoned professionals were unable to get business done, unable to get phones picked up, and where the exchange market was not responding to fundamentals in the sense of the direction of interest rates being pretty well laid out for them and they seemed to get caught in other backwashes in the market   With regard to the risk for the dollar going forward, I would again focus on the dollar/yen exchange rate I think the operation and the action of the Bundesbank last week and whatever the Committee does in the realm of the expected, if I can put it that way, will tend to stabilize the dollar/mark rate I don't see any big downward potential in the dollar/mark rate on its own terms The yen, though, will be the locus of attention particularly in the run-up to the G-7 Summit this summer That puts us back in the political context, and whether the Administration maintains its current formulation or reverses I think is a bigger risk for the dollar However, if the dollar can get through the G-7 Summit roughly at its current level against the yen, then I may be sticking my head way out    5/17/94  but I would see slightly greater odds for dollar strength thereafter than dollar weakness   I'm not quite reading you The monetary policy by the Administration or--   That will tend to disturb the foreign exchange market I think one of the very helpful official statements on May 4 was that by Mr Altman to the effect that he had no argument with the Fed over interest rates That really came on the heels of the Tietmeyer comment; that was a very useful setting for the operation So obviously, yes, if some of that Administration enthusiasm for the current Fed policy were lost, that would tend to be destabilizing to the dollar   I think they are more expected by the foreign exchange market than Administration statements; they may be in the same vein but I don't think they have the same effect   Well, if the history of the last three or four months is my guide, I'd have to say I would expect an impact on their long end It's hard to imagine there won't be some such impact I think, though, that we have seen more decoupling in this period-- between the last meeting and now--than we saw in previous periods So, in that sense I can be modestly hopeful that there would not be a negative impact on their long end I think the Bundesbank's actions last week are probably going to be the most helpful in that regard After the moves in mid-April had tended to squeeze out expectations of rate reductions, they have been put back in with last week's action and that may help decouple European rates   Thank you [Statement--See Appendix]   I think the market's immediate reaction was more the first of the two you mentioned I think that the extremity of the reaction, if I can distinguish the fact of the reaction from the extent of the move once it got going, was more of a gnawing anxiety about the general fiscal condition of Europe--of all the European countries put together But untangling those two anxieties in a relatively short time is quite a problem I would point out, if you'll forgive me, Mr Chairman, that the very technical aspects of the announcements were not handled as elegantly as they might have been The Italian announcement came with 60 seconds left in trading on LIFFE futures There were many people in London with very bloody fingers trying to cut back their positions That certainly    8/16/94  contributed to the very extreme reaction on that day Clearly, those two countries are the outliers on the fiscal side in Europe No one in Europe had been anxious about a general backup in short-term rates beyond the fact that everyone expected the UK to begin raising rates sometime soon As the market digests what happened and distinguishes the stronger countries from the weaker countries, there may be some improvement, but I wouldn't expect that very soon The markets may have a hard time digesting and untangling whatever it is the Bundesbank does on Thursday I think that there is likely to be a period of continued gnawing in European bond markets for several days to come   I think the market is faddish; I'll agree with you on that I think there is an opportunity for the market to be less anxious about the trade talks I'm of the school in interpreting the market's reaction to trade talk announcements that believes the market is biased in its reactions When the announcements tend to be explicit, mundane, and mechanical, however strongly articulated, eg "we are imposing a 60-day deadline," the foreign exchange market, dollar/yen, can shake that off fairly easily What is harder to interpret is what happens when the announcements come in a setting or context that the overall Japan/US relationship or the overall economic relationship including exchange rates and trade flows is at stake, and that's what is being argued about here or that's why this announcement is being made That then tends to undermine the confidence in dollar/yen and the confidence that the Administration would stick to a stronger dollar rhetoric So I think that there is a nuance that the market is really very quick at picking up on, whether the announcements are couched in this broad overall relationship or whether they are couched in the specifics of the trade announcement at hand I think that on reflection, the end of July announcement by the US side was seen in the mechanical context The market reacted negatively actually to the Japanese announcement that they would walk away on September 30th if sanctions were imposed Now, that announcement fell on what probably is the thinnest foreign exchange market in the world, which is New Zealand when Australia is on holiday in early August [Laughter] The big reaction we got was clearly related to the fact that no one was trading there Some people stayed in New York Sunday afternoon to sell into it and see what was there I think everyone then realized that was 60 days away and 60 days is eternity for the foreign exchange markets, so we will worry about that in the period to September I will say regarding the period to September, what has made me more anxious than anything is seeing a number of members of Congress write a letter to the Administration saying they hoped the Administration would be tough in the trade talks I think the foreign exchange market could very easily focus on    8/16/94  a date, but that is the sort of thing the exchange market can get riled up about If there were even a modest shift in a few members of Congress choosing to run on a trade issue rather than a health care issue, that could get the foreign exchange market very engrossed in the run-up to that date I think that could be difficult   [Statement--See Appendix]   I think it's rhetoric on either side--the United States or Japan And in this country it's rhetoric from anyone who is perceived to be expressing the inner thinking of the Clinton Administration   I don't think Congresspersons would be the issue; but anyone who the market could plausibly think is expressing the inner views of key Administration officials, whether in the Treasury or elsewhere, could be a source of pain to the markets   On the contrary, let me make a couple of points First, most major central banks are much more advanced than we in having some direct dealings in foreign currency government securities markets and in direct activity in those markets through private custodians I would say that we probably are the only G-10 country that does not have an account with Euro custodians, just as an example That is a normal activity of most of the other central banks Indeed, the Bundesbank really has been, if you'll forgive the expression, babysitting us by allowing us to keep rather large amounts of reserves on their balance sheets We have had quite preferential treatment--  So, I really would turn the point around I think that direct participation in the government securities market is increasingly the norm in terms of the investment of foreign currency reserves   They certainly operate in our markets in that fashion--Joan could perhaps tell you more about that than I could-- and certainly in the German market that has developed quite a bit over the last five to eight years We actually have been receiving quite preferential treatment from the Bundesbank So I would say in response to your observation that their tolerance for the slow rate at which I have been managing to move off their balance sheets shows rather high levels of friendliness and cooperation   Absolutely, yes I meant to include that in my initial remarks It could come from either side   I would remind the Committee--as I think I mentioned at our last meeting--that when the dollar dropped July 30th, 31st, and August 1st on the announcement of Super 301, my view was that rhetoric coming from the Japanese side had caused that drop, albeit as I mentioned last month in rather thin markets in New Zealand   Well, there are a couple of different layers of risk we have to consider On the one hand, the Bundesbank as a custodian is really not remotely providing the level of service that private sector custodians are capable of offering in terms of attention to detail and quality  It's a very big business and it's very hard for them to manage It's not a business they are in, really So, on one level we reduce risks at a sort of operational level by going to a custodian whose business it is to manage other people's securities and make sure they are all in the right place at the right time Another risk that gets reduced is simply the importance of having the tri-partite agent manage the collateral value--that is, ensuring that there is always enough margin held for the repurchase agreement Now, the Bundesbank simply won't even provide that service We would be doing that ourselves at some remove from German market custody arrangements  Those are two risks I would see going down quite a bit, indeed with some services being made possible only by using private sector custodians The principal risk that we face is the rather complex and subtle legal one of our confidence in the custody arrangement That is, do we have the confidence that the legal underpinnings are such that the securities will always be our own, and we won't have to worry about the loss of principal? That is the principal risk and one that the major providers of these custody services know that they are in the business of addressing But the whole RP process we will be going through is really focused on ensuring that we have confidence in the custody arrangement The final risk is the delivery-against-payment risk Most of the private sector solutions offer greater precision and clarity in reducing that risk actually than the Bundesbank currently does, but we take comfort under existing arrangements that it's the Bundesbank that is providing us the service But actually the Bundesbank does not currently assure us in any legal way that we have true delivery against payment for our purchase of the few existing government securities with low remaining maturities that we hold I hope that's helpful   I will mention one thing that I may want to bring back to the Committee in February The System Foreign Account is currently limited in its investments to maturities not exceeding twelve months When that limit was put in place, it was a simple and relatively effective means of insuring that we did not take too much price risk But it also was based on the notion that we would make sure we were always liquid Now, in my view this has resulted in a slight irony We have accumulated a fair amount and have the potential of accumulating more of the decayed securities with a remaining life under one year--German government securities--since I can't buy anything longer than 12 months Now, while that limits the price risk, it subjects me to rather high levels of liquidity risk This stuff is not highly liquid In terms of having liquidity and the    9/27/94  assurance of being able to get out, I would much rather have some portion of the System Account invested in actively traded five-year issues, for example What I have been intending to do, and this is part of the process, is to exhaust my existing authority so I could look this Committee in the face and say that to do any more of what I need to do I need to change the maturity ceiling And so I would very much like to have the authority and the ability to invest in repos It's a very flexible, liquid instrument Perhaps after we have begun that process, we would consider changing the maturity ceiling to a duration ceiling where the Committee would specify that the overall portfolio should not have an average duration of longer than X and no subportfolio should have a duration of longer than Y This would permit having some small portion--10, 15, 20 percent--of the portfolio invested in the actively traded five-year securities I'm not there yet myself in terms of our management planning, but the repo business is something, if we could get it organized, that would be the principal, and really the only, next step I would see   The Bundesbank officials are rather firm in not wanting to give us any assurance of that Now, whether they would if asked is uncertain, but they are very firm in not giving us any advance comfort   Starting with the last, yes, it is comparable There is a range of practices that runs from being identical to our market to being somewhat less collateralized at the margin than our market But the range exists The repo market in European government securities has really been evolving from infancy in--   Yes Certainly we couldn't put all our reserves into the repo market, and I wouldn't want to I would imagine always trying to have some balance between directly held or under repo government securities in the BIS and perhaps some amount still at the Bundesbank; we'll have to decide how much Having a diversity of institutional arrangements as well as maturities is part of our goal   The length of my remarks this time was really premised on the fact that we had gone to some efforts anticipating the election and I wanted to follow through I suppose I could have summarized my remarks by saying how smoothly the Mexican markets and the peso went through the election   Yes My own focus on it is not following the trade account as much as the anticipation that New York banks and dealers, who are in the list of 100 firms planning to open offices in Mexico City, will be trading peso instruments more actively As a footnote to that, I would note that I asked my counterpart at the Bank of Mexico whether he wanted me to include the dollar/peso in our turnover survey of the foreign exchange market Some banks had suggested it to us,  I presented this conundrum to my counterpart and explained that this survey was for next April He thought about it and said, "yes"   [Statement--See Appendix] Mr Chairman, I wasn't quite sure how you wanted to proceed I could take questions on the report, or I could go on and ask for ratification of the operations and renewal of the swap lines Should I just go on with each of those?    11/15/94   I will need the Committee's ratification of our operations on Wednesday, November 2; we sold $400 million equivalent of Japanese yen and $400 million equivalent of German marks for the System's Account On November 3, we sold $250 million of yen and $250 million of marks for the System's Account Thus, over the period we sold $650 million equivalent of each of the two currencies for the System Account  Mr Chairman, the System's reciprocal currency arrangements are up for renewal for another year with the exception of our Mexican and Canadian arrangements I have no changes to suggest in the terms and conditions of the existing swap arrangements and request that the Committee approve their renewal without change   I admit it is rather hard to fathom I think it is this combination of foreign demand surprising the dealer community which has for some time now been playing the dollar from the short side I think the two factors continue to operate together The surprising election result last Wednesday produced precisely that sequence, that is, the resulting foreign demand for the dollar surprised the US dealer community a bit and the dealers rushed to cover shorts Monday morning, the same thing seemed to be occurring again The dealers saw a slightly surprising level of foreign interest in the dollar and the dealer community once again tried to play catch-up with their customers, as best I have been able to understand There was a rather quick mark-up yesterday If you look at the charts, it really happened rather quickly I have not been able to ascertain what in particular was happening at that time   The very fact that we are effectively at parity on the funds rate with German rates suggests that any move we make now will give the dollar a cost-of-carry advantage against the mark One of the things that some people talk about and that I perceive as important is that the foreign exchange market generally is not focusing on that That is, during the spring, that was the "be-all- and-end-all" of the exchange markets People talked about the point in time when fed funds would be higher than overnight German rates I think that that is in effect the sleeper that could catch up with the market If fed funds were to be trading between 50 and 100 basis points above German overnight rates as we went into year-end, that would begin to shift the whole dynamic of leads and lags in corporate deposits and the like That again would slightly shift the burden of proof to the speculative community If they start to lose money by running a short dollar position on cost-of-carry, that will begin to work on their calculations   Let me answer that in a couple of ways It obviously varies depending on the institution The point is that the Fed being perceived as behind each of those curves means it is rather hard to justify and means that foreign demand is around the corner There are extraordinarily high real returns in foreign bond markets, and that is a cause of major concern to our European counterparts There are incredibly high yields in France at present and German real yields simply calculated are extraordinarily high That in itself is the problem One way of looking at the problem is to ask when investors will be prepared to buy our bonds For example, if there were to be a sense of stability and the sense that a capital gain was available in the intermediate term, that might overcome the lack of a real bond yield advantage for the dollar I don't mean to suggest that it is a necessary condition for the Fed to be ahead of each and every one of the curves Rather, the negative sentiment is premised on the fact that, no matter what the analytic frame of mind, one can look at the exchange market and see that the Fed is behind each and every one of the curves That's been feeding on the market   Do you want to ratify the foreign operations or do you want to save that for later also?   This is kind of the reverse of a beating-your- wife question!   Yes! I'll mention one thing, Mr Chairman, that relates to the commentary earlier by Governor Lindsey Maybe this will inspire questions from those who are reluctant to dig in I recognize in your comment the idea that intervention takes place and it seems to box in the Committee; the bridge had better go somewhere I think both in the way you pose that and in other remarks at previous meetings, one has to say "compared to what?" We don't always have the counter-factual of what would have happened had we not intervened I think the hypothesis I worked with and why I thought it was a good idea to intervene was the risk of an extreme event--that in early November the dollar could have dropped another 3 percent rather quickly The range could have dropped to the mid-140s on the mark and to 94 to 96 dollar/yen The market would have interpreted that move as entirely related to the inaction of the Fed I think the Committee could then have found itself at this meeting in a very different kind of box, one that you would have liked a lot less It would be a box that is much harder to get out of, one that was similar to the box in which the Committee found itself in July where to do anything plausible or reasonable on interest rates would have looked very bad from an exchange market point of view because it was not going to be adequate That is, the reasonable change in fed funds for domestic policy purposes would look like a sop to the exchange market That is not a counter-factual thing one can put one's hands around, but one has to think of what the counter-factual is to devise recommendations --whether the risks are leading one to think it is a good idea to intervene versus not   I just wanted to add a footnote to your comment, Mr Chairman, about taking the profits on the long position One of the things that people in the market do focus on is that the accumulation of reserves since the late 1980s implies asymmetry in the US appetite for intervention That is, we are more prepared to hold down the value of our currency than we are to defend it That in itself is a major market negative among the analysts who look at our behavior That's not a particular reason to intervene on any day or for any kind of operation, but it is a reflection of the negative market sentiment about the US authorities in general   We need two votes   It was really my two votes that I was after, Mr Chairman   We have most of our reciprocal currency swap agreements up for renewal; those with Mexico and Canada come up at a different time now   Yes, a year from now   What we have now is no change in the terms and conditions of the existing swaps with Austria, the United Kingdom, Japan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the Bank for International Settlements, the Belgian National Bank, the Danish National Bank, the Bank of France, the Bundesbank, the Bank of Italy, and the Netherlands Bank These are all swap lines that have been in place for many years I have no changes to recommend I seek the Committee's approval for their renewal without change   Thank you [Statement--See Appendix]   [Re-entering the meeting] Actually, we do The peso has traded at 383 to 386, down about 11 percent from yesterday; it has not approached the outer band at all Screens in New York are not quoting the Mexican stock market, but talking to people in Mexico, the decision seems to have been taken well in Mexican markets Even though the ADRs--Mexican stocks traded in New York--were down, reports indicate that Mexican stocks are trading up in Mexico So, the market seems to be taking it well in Mexico so far, and the peso hasn't traded out to its limit   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   I think a number of central banks are holding more dollar reserves than some people within those central banks think they ought to be holding I wouldn't pretend to say that is the official posture of all the central banks, but I think the leakage into the markets occurs as a result of that There are a number of central banks in Asia that both have accumulated large dollar reserves and have a rather active approach to foreign exchange trading as a potential source of central bank profit In those central banks, some people may have a view that they would rather hold fewer dollars, and since the banks' foreign exchange desks tend to be somewhat active, the market then is free to interpret that when they move one way that must be a secular trend It is more frequently just trading back and forth, but that sort of activity certainly has provided some credence to that general story   I talk to them from time to time about that They are not happy about it, but the Bundesbank is fully committed to a single reserve currency--the dollar They have no appetite for diversifying their portfolio I think the Bank of Japan at a policy level is still more or less committed to a dollar reserve policy They have diversified somewhat and are holding a few more marks It's still a tiny, tiny fraction of their total reserves   I'll take the short term and leave Ted with the long term! In the short term, I think the fiscal picture weighs on the dollar as I mentioned principally in terms of the competence issue as it relates to US economic management, not in the sense of forecasting a macro economic effect Whether analytically correct or not, market participants do in a sense add up the two deficits, the current account deficit and the fiscal deficit, and say we can't manage anything so they can't find any reason to buy dollars or hold dollars In the short run, at least in the last three months, I don't think the markets have really tried to digest the implications, as you have, on a much more sophisticated basis But they are negative in the short run Now, I'll defer to Ted on the tougher question   No   That is our sense that the short end--   I am very sorry if that was not clear I was referring to the 2-year maturity of the coupon curve   No, I don't think there has been a big rush of foreign demand for Treasuries The sense is that the money has been coming out of the investment community, the mutual funds, and the real money crowd into the dealer community The dealers have been surprised by that Their tendency had been to play the market from the short side during this period It gave the market a bit of a choppy feel from time to time, and in fact contributed to some of the rise in prices There was a phenomenon of the market doing better during the afternoons, which was sort of curious We feel that was a bit the result of the dealers just catching up with their own customers But we don't have any sense of foreign demand There is constant chatter going on about how the capital flight from Latin America is fueling the bond market Capital flight from Latin America, however defined, is not of a sufficient size to drive the  -13-    3/28/95  overall dollar exchange rate It is large relative to the peso and other Latin American currencies It's hard to see if it is not big enough to affect the dollar exchange rate overall how it is really big enough to drive the bond market, which is rather large   So, these stories are more in the nature of anecdotes floating around than anything we have been able to pin down   We have data on what they hold with us as custodian, but that is only a portion of what most central banks hold   I don't have an exact view I don't have any of those data here   In the last 10 weeks they have gone up We had an extraordinary rise of $10 billion in one reporting period There has been some back and forth movement in such holdings   No, it didn't include the Caribbean The market all read it as entirely the Bank of Japan  Ironically, it was to a substantial extent other Asian central banks who were thought to be sellers of dollars   Who just happened to be shifting   We did have a period when our custodial accounts went down quite a bit, net, but I haven't looked at the figures There was a period where some of the Asian central banks--  --went into bills, came out of them, and went back That created some volatility in our custody holdings So those holdings probably are a little higher over the past 10 or 20 weeks, but not dramatically, I would think   If I could comment, going back to the reserve currency status issue, it is interesting that the markets all chatter about how the dollar is losing its reserve currency status Yet, the dollar bill is in heavy demand around the world   The hundred dollar bill, yes The greenback It's an interesting offset to the concept that the dollar is losing its reserve currency status   A tiny tiny bit I don't particularly! [Laughter]   I think we have a dollar problem, as I mentioned, in the way the foreign exchange market looks at the relationship between our interest rates and our current account I don't mean that should drive the policy decided around this table, but that is the chain around our ankle, if you will, that we have to deal with; it's the load we are carrying The mark is at extraordinary highs on a trade-weighted basis The mark clearly is strong--however defined--against us, against Europe, against everybody There also is a problem of an ever appreciating yen Now, something may break that at some point, but until it does I think there are problems in each corner; each leg of this stool has its own problem And that in my view is how we get the historic lows or historic highs--when there is something that is pushing the exchange rate on both sides in the same direction   Thank you, Mr Chairman I will first discuss current conditions in interest rate markets and then some of the factors contributing to recent exchange rate movements before reviewing foreign and then domestic operations [Statement--see Appendix]   If you are taking a short position on the expectation that the data will lean the other way or the market will not continue to rally, you begin to lose a lot of money and you have to cover your shorts There are people who believe that there will be a rebound in activity by the end of the year, but it is too expensive for them to try to express that position in the market   We talk to people, and there are some well known losses that are now reported We certainly talk to the dealers about major positions that go against them So, yes, there are informal surveys and some more formal surveys   I think, as Don said, you lose a lot of money There were people who were priced out of the market in December They thought that the fed funds rate might not be raised 200 basis points    5/23/95  in 1995 and that the yield curve had moved well beyond where it would go But they chose not to express that view in the market in December   Sure [Laughter]   There were various stages in their announcement process One of the earlier, more definitive, announcements actually had a positive effect on dollar/yen--modestly positive I think I have described my views to the Committee before on this When the markets perceive trade policy statements to be just saber rattling and no action is anticipated--just a lot of angry words--that tends to be negative for the exchange markets because they don't perceive that anything concrete will be done But on the few occasions when our trade representative has announced concrete trade policy steps, whether sanctions or invocations of statutory authority, the exchange market for dollar/yen generally has responded positively on the theory that at least the sign is right for the impact on our short-run trade position   No, I don't, and I would like to look into and clarify some of the criteria that we use to approach this task The presumption for several years has been that we are really replicating the portfolio as it exists So, there is simply an effort to maintain roughly the current maturity mix That is the policy that I inherited and it can be seen in effect in the new tables that we provide at the back of our report It is a policy that I have been trying to understand better and to think through some of its implications It    5/23/95  is something that we have begun to work on We contemplate having a few staff people devote a fair amount of time over coming months to thinking through the criteria that we use as we approach each auction The tradition has been to assume that we wanted a relatively high component of bills to permit the portfolio to run off rather easily without the need to sell a lot of securities into the market and disturb the structure of the yield curve, if such an occasion were to arise So, that is the nature of the received wisdom and how I intend to proceed   Yes The presumption as to the size of each pass is sort of built into the assumptions about how we operate We have to look at the two together   We will be looking at that There are arguments for smaller passes with more frequent operations; there are arguments for larger ones I have had some very interesting discussions with other central bankers in my position about the nature of a central bank portfolio and how to think about it There is not much divergence in practices, but there is a wide range of views about how to think about this One central banker feels very strongly that a central bank's portfolio should never contain on-the-run securities A central bank, after all, makes its own liquidity Why does the central bank need to hold on-the-run issues? The central bank should exclusively be buying everything that is off the run But in practice, of course, that would involve the Herculean effort of being the vacuum cleaner of the securities market   Yes   And to who   Yes   That's fine   So, there is a wide range of views A number of central banks that apply very sophisticated approaches to their foreign currency portfolios--really as profit centers--have been    5/23/95  backfitting some of that financial technology into thinking about their domestic portfolios   By normally leaving the market a little short, we continue to push the rate in that direction The rate expectations can be seen in the fed funds futures contracts Both my report and Don's report indicate that the market is looking for the funds rate to be edging down, or skewed slightly in that direction, over coming months We do not feel a great deal of pressure in the reserve market itself I wouldn't relate this to the substance behind your question, but there have been some occasions where demand for excess reserves seemed a little on the soft side in the last few weeks I think that is more of an anomaly, but it is something that I am intrigued with There was one period in which the demand for excess reserves was really extraordinarily soft; we still have not gotten our hands on the reason for that excess level below $1/2 billion I don't see that as a profound change but more as a fluctuation in the reserve market itself But the market's forecast certainly is leaning in that easing direction I don't think we have quite felt that in our reserve management yet   [Statement--see Appendix]   You're asking me to put myself inside their minds I am a little squeamish about doing that   I don't see it as an either/or situation I think the Treasury feels very strongly about the commitment made in the G-7 communique in April that they were seeking an orderly reversal of previous exchange rate moves At that point, they were referring to the downward movement of the dollar from January through the end of April When they say they are seeking an orderly reversal, they really mean that I think the financial sector difficulties in Japan and the weakness of the Japanese economy are an additional reason why the Treasury was concerned about exchange rates when they reached their lows But I don't think it is really an either/or situation They would like to see a stronger dollar and now we have a somewhat stronger dollar, though I would note that it is not yet back to the levels of mid-January I don't think anyone thought the dollar was over-valued in mid-January of 1995 I tried in my remarks to be rather careful to say that the dollar is off its lows and we have had a big move, but it was a bigger move down   I think the Treasury is looking at the decline of the dollar from January through the spring and seeing that as something that is not positive for US financial markets or the perception of the US economy It's really the time horizon that is involved here You can think about disorderly markets as a fifteen minute phenomenon; you can think about them as a 24-hour phenomenon; or you can worry about whether there wasn't a bit of an overshoot on a quarter-by-quarter basis I think the Treasury's focus has been more on the quarter-by-quarter basis   I think this Treasury has tried to shy away from putting it so pithily They are trying very hard to shake the image that there is any effort to depreciate ourselves into prosperity So that would be their rather direct rebuttal to the point you are making They are trying to shake that image   I am not aware of any exchange rate target or particular objective other than the sense that the dollar was a bit low this spring   Thank you Before permitting myself to take advantage of the new high-tech toys in the ceiling and because of the number of topics I need to cover, I thought I would try to exhaust the potential of older technologies Thus, you should find an outline of my remarks on the table in front of you together with a single page of colored charts [Statement--see Appendix]   Yes Beginning in the spring and continuing over the summer, the German banking community seemed to awake to the possibility of capturing some of the flows by placing them in Swiss investments This coincided with some revelations about the use of Luxembourg accounts by Germans for tax avoidance So, there was a double incentive for the German investment community to move out of Luxembourg and find some other place German banks in Switzerland, not just Swiss banks, seem to have taken advantage of this opportunity initially through mark Eurodeposits in Switzerland but funds clearly also were moved into Swiss assets for "safe haven" reasons as well There has been much talk in Germany about how far out the yield curve investors can afford to go, given the uncertainties about future returns That has been part of the marketing pitch the bankers have used to stimulate this flow   Yes, precisely things like that   I failed to mention that the Swiss lowered their rates and saw their currency keep appreciating last week   They are down to 2 percent on their discount rate   In the implicit division of labor between Don Kohn and myself, I am working on issues that would not involve legislative changes There are questions about possible changes in reserve requirements that might involve new legislation, and Don may be better placed to talk about those At the Desk, we are looking at some very simple issues such as what time of day we can operate; what level of information we have to operate with at different times of the day; whether there is a different type of repo with which we might be able to conduct operations in the market late in the day; and whether we could change the discount window in some informal way, or perhaps some statutory way Reserve requirement changes would be another approach   No If the dealer community does more of its financing early in the day, they generally have fewer securities left to finance by the time we would normally enter the market at 1130 am It is a very mechanical issue   It is just the domestic players and they are just completing their financing Certainty is better for someone looking to finance a large portfolio than uncertainty, and waiting to find out whether or not we will enter the market has its risks for them It is not a major issue On Monday of last week we received only $57 billion of propositions The next day we were looking at a need between $8 and $10 billion at the time we made the decision We did end up injecting about $8 billion, after getting about $10 billion in propositions as a result of operating earlier   The claim is that this high official of Daiwa's New York branch had been trading in US bills and bonds in the straight bill and bond markets He managed to lose between $1 and $15 billion over the last 11 years; that is the amount that is unaccounted for It's a rather extraordinary tale The relevant authorities in New York are looking into the matter   They are not a primary dealer, excuse me This is the bank The securities firm is an entirely separate legal entity   The securities firm is the primary dealer This is a branch bank trust department    -10-   I'll just insert there A number of the European countries continue to prefer to hold a relatively large portion of their reserves in dollars for investment purposes But in a crisis, they want to convert those into marks to be able to defend their own currency There are two effects on the market that in the very short run can create this sort of disturbance Even the expectation of it can create the disturbance   No, it shouldn't   Yes I'm referring to a very short-run effect Countries have a tendency to hold large quantities of dollars and then convert them into marks to defend their own currency They also have a preference for acquiring reserves that way Even if their ultimate goal is to acquire marks, they will try to move into the dollar out of their own currency and then into marks in the event of a crisis The other very short-run phenomenon, which certainly hurt us last week, occurs when the situation that Ted was referring to becomes acute As Europe closes up for business and investors are looking to defend  -11-    9/26/95  themselves, then they really have to go into the dollar/mark because they simply can't get liquidity in the Paris/mark or the peseta/mark in the New York trading day after Europe has gone home This then tends to accelerate the movement in dollar/marks in the very short run It's very short run but it's very pronounced   I think the support of the Chancellor for the process is really the only thing standing in the way of the deluge of public opposition   All of the above!   Thank you As you can see on the agenda and also on an outline of my remarks that has been circulated with some attached charts, I am going to take up four topics separately I will be asking for the Committee's questions and relevant vote at the end of each of the first three topics so that we can get through this rather meaty portion of the agenda in an orderly fashion I will turn first to the report on foreign exchange market developments and Desk operations [Statement--see Appendix]   The Mexicans paid down part of their swap line drawings, and I rolled over the remaining portion on October 30 for the third time I am requesting Committee ratification   Yes, at the end of January   Thank you [Statement continued--see Appendix]   No, I don't see how At the very bottom of the list of our swap lines that I have given you, you can see that the Treasury has two swap lines of its own with Mexico and the Bundesbank   They are entirely separate So, I cannot see any way that a drawing on the System swap lines would have any necessary connection with System warehousing for the Treasury   Thank you Before turning to my report on the domestic markets and operations, I would like to give the Committee a bit more background on the Desk's cooperation with the Japanese monetary authorities in managing the liquidity of their portfolio of US government securities as part of their broader effort to aid the dollar liquidity of the Japanese banks [Statement continued--see Appendix]   A spike in year-end rates is always there I don't think it's out of line with--   But it's entirely in line with the normal end- of-year pressures   But the problem there, just to go into detail, is that we have to look at the futures contract for December, take account of the limited probability of a Committee action to ease in December, and then look at the December contracts The market normally does some smoothing in its pricing of the futures contracts If there is an assumption of an aggressive easing in policy three months out, the end contracts tend to edge down a little and to provide a bit of trend line toward that lower funds rate That makes it hard to judge futures prices   Yes   Well, their fiscal year-end is March 31st, and there is some pressure in their funds market then There are occasions when the deutschemark money market experiences rather sharp spikes These stem both from the German banking system and from foreign demand of which the Japanese may be a part, but I don't think quite as significant a part as in our market   Yes   The answer is no Some central banks realize that if they are talking about $500 million or $1 billion, they can sell bills to the Desk and we will execute such transactions for them relatively effectively There are some less subtle or more anxious central bankers who approach the Desk to ask if we can guarantee that we will do a $5 billion repo with them if they need some liquidity suddenly What they want to avoid is having to sell the securities outright and having to take a gain or a loss We explain to them that, no, we don't provide guarantees So, the question frequently comes up conversationally in that way As I say, the subtler central bankers understand that when relatively small amounts of Treasury securities are involved we can help them by either selling the securities in the market or taking them into our portfolio The larger amounts are not in the nature of what we do routinely and that was the tenor of our conversations with the Japanese when larger amounts were clearly what they were interested in   Yes We would try to choose an area of the yield curve, say, the two- to three-year area or the five-year area, define it for the dealers, and then take propositions only in that portion of the curve   It might the first few times that we use the procedure But my hope is that things would smooth out over time, as the dealers got used to it and they saw that we are like any big customer who might come along and buy up a certain maturity I also want to be clear I don't think we would necessarily be mechanical about day one, day two, day three, day four and conduct these transactions on consecutive days We might do it that way; we might break it up and have a day fall in between depending on what other things are going on--a bill auction, for example   The community to talk to first and foremost is the dealers, wherever they are located, since they are the ones who have to do the bidding and put in the propositions   Obviously, once we begin it we'll have to have guidance for Peter Bakstansky in our press office and figure out what we are going to say more generally so that the Fed-watching community doesn't jump on it and misinterpret it   Yes   You are raising a good point I think we have always thought of swaps as a bit of a hybrid Given our focus on having a short-term means of repayment, we have tried to think of the swap lines, or I try to think of them, as merely a liquidity arrangement with a central bank like the Bundesbank, notwithstanding the fact that they hold a lot of US government securities Conceptually, I think the swap line can still be used, but obviously its use is problematic given our concern about the short-term means of repayment if a borrower really runs through every asset in sight In the episode to which you refer, there certainly was a sense, and related anxiety, on our part that they did not merely want to draw on the swap line as they ran out of assets but that they already had gone deeply into debt We weren't going to be the first creditor in line Returning to the Bundesbank example, what has clearly eclipsed all this is an increasing sophistication in the liquidity management of the portfolio of the Bundesbank As I have described to the Committee in the past, they maintain a large amount of immediately available liquidity in case they need dollars for intervention purposes and they structure their portfolio accordingly So, the likelihood that the Bundesbank is going to look to the swap line for liquidity purposes is quite low As the Chairman said a year ago, we realize that the swap    11/15/95  lines are somewhat anachronistic, but getting rid of them could be more painful than carrying them forward I think we might all benefit by rethinking the nature of our central bank cooperation Maybe when we are through with this exercise with the Japanese and have been repaid on the Mexican swap line, it might be useful for the Committee to review the purpose of these cooperative facilities   Those securities had already been selling off a bit, and that's rather awkward for a security with a short remaining maturity   The amount is small in absolute terms, but it is noticeable that dealers are turning them down   I don't know it off the top of my head, I'm afraid I think we discussed it in the document we submitted as a special report Sandy--please go ahead   We need a vote to ratify the domestic operations   No, no, I'm not seeking another vote [Statement continued--see Appendix]  Mr Chairman, I would be happy to answer any questions from the Committee on this final part of my report But maybe you are all tired of listening to my voice, and I wouldn't mind if you pass   In recent months and years, we collectively have been targeting a balance of about $5 billion for them But we all recognize that forecasting the Treasury balance is in part an art, not a science, and the risks exist But it's in the nature of a forecast that we are always forecasting tonight what the cash balance will be when we wake up tomorrow morning and then tomorrow what it will be when we make payments on the Treasury's behalf We at the Desk were very pleased that the Treasury made their announcement as early as possible this week because of the various uncertainties we would face in our forecasts of their balances if we waited until the 1lth hour to worry about default and the market did the same, and given the computer systems that release payments early in the morning So, the  -10-    11/15/95 -11-  Monday morning announcement was very much what we had urged on them in terms of the number of days that we needed for guidance   260 something   Virtually all   On any one day?   Most of them   It would send a very negative message   No, I said nothing in my remarks that suggested that I said the Desk was eager to find a way to demonstrate that they would be accepted as collateral in temporary operations   Temporary operations are open market operations   My point was that I did not think that an intentional preemptive strike to buy the particular defaulted securities outright would be an appropriate action in the circumstances that I mentioned   Yes, we are   We do outright purchases relatively infrequently --to wit my discussion about coupon passes--a handful of times a year I am suggesting that we raise that to three or four handfuls a year for reasons of operational simplicity without changing the amount we would buy over the course of the year relative to reserve demands The question is whether we take defaulted securities in temporary operations In repo operations, we take whatever securities the dealers offer We are not going to announce in advance that we are going to turn down any particular Treasury security in repo operations The idea that I urge the Committee to put on the back burner for much later consideration is the question of whether we would buy outright preemptively those particular issues that the Treasury had defaulted upon   If they were presented to us as propositions for temporary overnight or four-day System operations, and they were at the better end of the prices, we would look at what are the best prices and draw a line at an amount that meets our objective My desire would be for the Desk to be indifferent to what the CUSIPs are, whether the CUSIP underneath is one that has missed a payment or not Now, maybe these securities will end up among the better prices; that's a likely hypothesis if the dealers are on their toes They might be a large portion of what we did or they might be only a small part of our overall operation given the uncertainties about the volume we would be doing So, yes, there is a certain likelihood that we would take in some, or many, or all of them in temporary operations  -12-    11/15/95  where the legal risks of an extended duration of a Treasury default remain with the dealer   Thank you, Mr Chairman I would like to begin with the Mexican swap renewal before turning to the market reports All of this is summarized on the one-page outline of my report that you have before you [Statement--see Appendix]   That was part of the package   There are two $3 billion swap arrangements; think of it that way There is the basic $3 billion, which was what we already had in place Then we added a supplemental one last December of $15 billion, which was increased to $3 billion on February 1 It's just a coincidence that it was $3 billion Now, we are letting that whole supplemental arrangement expire, and we are going back to the original, regular $3 billion   There are lots of threes   It's drawn under the regular swap line They never drew enough to get into the supplemental or temporary $3 billion   I think you need to separate the question of whether the market had a good sense of a number of data points from their balance sheet and macroeconomics and whether we had good information about their reserves There were only a very few days in December 1994 when we were, I think, at a loss and a little anxious about what their reserve levels were But I don't think, if you take 1994 as a whole, that we had a sense that we weren't getting a good level of cooperation and understanding of what their reserve balances were That's internally That's different from the public issue that I think the IMF was addressing   I think it's important to keep in mind that we have not thought of Treasury takeouts as the presumption under which we have swap lines It was a presumption under which the Committee undertook this drawing in the set of circumstances that existed in January, including the President's program, but reliance on Treasury takeouts has not been a presumption for the existence of swap lines   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   The long bond is at 622 percent, I think, so it is backing up a bit The middle of the maturity range is also backing up   Yes, 1/2 point In yield, the long bond traded up to 622 percent early overnight in Tokyo, came down to 618 percent, and was back up to the 622 - 624 percent range in the last hour   Thank you [Statement--see Appendix]   Thank you [Statement--see Appendix]   Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to the two pages of color charts distributed this morning [Statement-- see Appendix]   We have not tried systematically to segregate those episodes We have observed the phenomenon that you referred to, and that is something we could try to do, although it is quite tricky I think the causation tends to run in both directions at times such as those you are referring to So I am not sure--   I do not want to be quoted as saying it is hopeless, [laughter] but it may be akin to looking for a needle in a haystack   It will be quite a challenge Let me think about that, and maybe Don Kohn and I can come up with ways to sort it out It really is tough to do much better than to talk to as many of the major market participants as one can and get a sense of what they were seeing major accounts doing Sometimes those accounts are liquidating bonds and moving out of the dollar at the same time, and sometimes they are not doing it coincidentally, but the effect may be the same if they are doing it over a period of time    8/20/96  I strongly share the impression that bond markets are traded more and more each year as we think foreign exchange markets are traded, that is, as a collection of currencies Traders are consistently thinking that if they move out of one currency or government bond maturity, they will move to some other currency or maturity automatically It is not automatic in the sense of being by rote because traders do make a conscious decision as to what to move into So, we think people are trading bond markets as if they were currencies but it is very hard to pin that down   Yes, we will   Let me try to answer that, and I invite Don to jump in after I have made the first stab Your three factors were sweep accounts, demand for currencies from overseas, and then just general demand for reserves   Right The nexus that we have been looking at is really the first and third together As sweep accounts continue to "sweep" the nation, the level of vault cash that is applied to bank reserves becomes much more important What we are observing here is a weekly, moving phenomenon, with Friday flows in and out for weekends, and we are experiencing some difficulty in tracking total required reserves as vault cash becomes a larger and larger, and in some cases a dominant, share of the reserves of major banks So, I would link your first and third points I do not know if we have any sense--I look to both Sandy Krieger and Don Kohn--that there are other sources of demand for reserves that are giving us a problem of interpretation We are certainly focusing on this one Don, maybe you want to comment   This week-to-week, day-to-day problem is clearly something we are spending a great deal of time focusing on I think this episode reflected a unique confluence of events; everything conspired against us at the same time But we are still focusing nonetheless on how to track the week-to-week changes   [Statement--see Appendix]   To put the market's reaction in a nutshell, I think the market is focusing on the question of whether the politicians can pull a rabbit out of the hat Maybe they can Having a commission in Brussels bless the French budget is one aspect of how the politicians may be able to do that The markets are not going to underestimate the ability of the politicians Those who are positioning in the expectation that EMU will implode fear that the politicians may pull a rabbit out of a hat and when they see something like that happening, they back up and reassess the question of speculating against the EMU   In the short run, it may work that way The market practitioners are concerned that they could lose a lot of money if they underestimate the politics   Certainly we have We have not thought about reducing the D-mark position That is, I take my responsibilities in the investment of our foreign currency reserves to be independent of their level So, I am left with the task of taking a given quantity of deutsche marks and investing them There are other avenues and other conversations the Committee can have about the desirable level of our foreign currency reserves We have not looked at that Once I take as given roughly the level of foreign currency reserves that we  -40-    9/24/96  have now or that we have had on average for the last five years, there are only a few alternatives that have any practicality We already have about one-third of our reserves on the balance sheet of the Bank for International Settlements I see that as a rather high number, although we could go higher As a rule of thumb I was stopping at about one-third, but we could decide on a larger exposure to the BIS We could, as in fact most central banks do, go into the commercial deposit market--the Eurodeposit market In effect, the BIS is a veil for us They are in the Eurodeposit market; we are not We avoid, therefore, the rather time-consuming exercise of credit assessment It is my sense, but it is a very strong one, that we would find rather awkward the process of making differential credit assessments among banks and taking commercial bank or commercial credit risks in the securities market and making relative assessments about the extent to which we should be exposed to or invest in individual private institutions But that is really the only alternative that exists today  Now, we have just begun to invest some of our reserves in the deutsche mark repo market, and I think there is some room for growth for us in that market in terms of our overall balance sheet In my memo, you will see that I am worried about our promise to the Bundesbank that we would get off their balance sheet completely What I am proposing here will reduce our D-mark balances at the Bundesbank to about one-third of our total D-mark reserves Another third will be in the German government securities market either in the form of repos or direct investments, and about one-third will be in the BIS It is my hope that the German repo market will grow and that we will be able to push the envelope a little more there than we have But if we invest too much there, we will become a rather large piece of that market So, the alternatives that seem realistic are rather uninspiring because they would involve taking on additional credit risks and the credit assessment process We would face the prospect of pulling the plug on private entities if we became concerned about their creditworthiness   It does nothing unless the Board changes the accounting rules, and we start marking the securities to market We currently do not mark the securities value of the SOMA portfolio, the domestic portfolio, to market We have not marked to market the securities value of the short-term foreign currency bonds that we hold now There are some strong arguments in favor of marking them to market, but I am not persuaded by them Indeed, I would be a vehement opponent of marking the securities to market, either the foreign or the domestic securities, out of a rather strong fear that, as the Account Manager, I would end up chasing my own tail as the balance sheet went up and down and I moved things around to change the duration of the portfolio So, absent a change in the accounting rule, moving 15 percent of our deutsche mark holdings into a sub- portfolio of German government debt will have no appreciable impact on profits and losses The huge impact will continue to be the monthly revaluation of the foreign currency holdings to translate them into dollar values  -41-    9/24/96   I would like to comment on that After spending much of the last five years looking at the foibles of other central banks and their investment strategies and trying to make sure that we do not fall into some of those traps, I think there are two problems-- you point to one of them--that can arise in using any kind of benchmark, particularly a duration target One is the problem of too much discretion and the other is the problem of too little On the potential problem of too much discretion, as the memo and the investment principles in the quarterly report make clear, we do not trade on interest rate expectations We are going to design the benchmark and replicate it Period; full stop  The other problem is one of too little discretion Are we going to design a benchmark that leads us to do goofy things, to churn the portfolio in order to maintain a perfect target duration? In designing what we might want to do, I tried to address that problem by  -42-    9/24/96  setting the 10-month duration target that I am telling the Committee I would intend to implement while permitting actual investments to vary over a very wide seven-week window on either side of that Essentially, the portfolio can decay for an entire quarter without our having to do anything to address or move back toward a center point If exogenous shocks occur in the market, my inclination--and I hope the investment principles we will be revising will make that clear-- would be as apt to look at whether the benchmark itself, the 10-month target, should be revised as I would be to change our behavior Over the last decade the single largest move in a five-year interest rate in Germany was about 250 basis points The sub-portfolio that we have described in the memorandum has a 5-year duration target, so it is a rough proxy for that maturity A 250 basis point move would translate into a change of about 2 weeks, perhaps a little more or a little less, in the average duration of a sub-portfolio targeted at 5 years, and that would translate in turn into a change of just a few days in the overall structure that I am proposing The reason for having the wide latitude, if I may digress, between the 18-month ceiling I would like the Committee to set and the 10-month target is that there are a number of factors that could lead the duration of the portfolio to move away from my intention and that would be beyond my control as investment manager The Germans are notorious for not holding regularly scheduled auctions So, we are always subject to a big surprise, a big shock, as to when an auction takes place and its timing can move the duration quite a bit  The other reason is that I very much want to separate the question of intervention and its size from the question of how the portfolio is managed and what kind of limit the Committee places on the Manager If 50 percent of the portfolio were to be liquidated through intervention, there are different ways that could be done We might liquidate everything at the short end; we might liquidate across the spectrum That could swing the duration quite widely, and I would not want to have too short an overall limit placed on the portfolio that would in effect, because of intervention, lead to violations of the Authorization   I have begun to think about that It has been my assumption that we would leave our deutsche mark holdings unchanged as they are transfigured into euros And when that happens, we would then be a participant in the novel question of what the euro yield curve will be--whether, for example, German paper will determine long euro rates but French paper will determine the short rates There is enough noise in how that will work out that I cannot see very clearly in my crystal ball That is about as far as I have gotten   Yes   Our deutsche mark reserves will not disappear; they will be converted into euros The euro will be a major reserve currency of the world even if it is subject to a great deal of volatility It is my forecast that there will be some volatility, indeed quite a bit I would think, in the early years of the euro And I believe that it would be in the interest of the US monetary authorities to have some capacity to participate in reducing what I personally see as a rather significant risk of market disturbances I am not suggesting any particular intervention or any particular type of intervention, but unilateral disarmament ahead of the event is not something that I would be urging on the Committee But I want very much to separate these two questions, Governor Lindsey, if I can  The question of how these reserves are managed and invested and how we stand as the prudent manager of what essentially is a public asset is different from the question of the level In my six years of association with this question, whenever marginal improvements in the prudence with which we manage these reserves are brought to this table, the question of level is what comes back I do not think the question of level ought to dictate the manner of the investment We can have a debate about the level--   If we just take the norm of historic interventions, we would not have to go out to 18 months in order for me to have a 10-month maturity duration target But the day could come when the decision would be made to intervene using, say, half of our reserves, which would be three times the largest intervention amount used historically The Committee has procedures for approving the amounts of intervention I think this investment guidance I am seeking should be a separate issue and not become a constraint on future intervention A much shorter duration, whether it is 15 months or 14 months rather than 18 months, is not the be-all end-all But if you start squeezing and impose a shorter total duration and we were forced to intervene in very large amounts, I would run the risk of violating the authorized duration limit if I were to liquidate a great deal of our holdings at the short end Let me just repeat that I propose setting a 10-month target, and I will not change that target without coming back to the Committee and soliciting your views on a change So, the two things are separable in my mind   We have been spelling out some of the risks in the quarterly report that we have been sending you The immediate answer that I have to your question is what I referred to in the memo We did a simulation over an entire interest rate cycle and looked at what would happen if we were marking to market the entire portfolio, including deposits   There was no quarter in which a deutsche mark portfolio structured as proposed would have had a net loss; that is, the capital value loss would have been exceeded by the earnings   Yes, over the last 10-year interest rate cycle Moving 15 percent of our holdings as proposed implied a pickup over a normal investment cycle of about 20 or so basis points over the income produced by our current approach to investing Now, I do not have immediately in mind an answer to your question in the way you structured it  -45-    9/24/96   We tried to make clear several other points in the memo First, I do not urge the Committee to adopt the 18-month duration limit solely for its liquidity measurement purposes I think it is a replacement for the current 12-month maturity ceiling which was intended to limit both price risk and force a certain amount of liquidity into the portfolio It has had some perverse effects We are a major owner of very illiquid government bonds at the very short end of the German yield curve If I continue to try to get off the Bundesbank's balance sheet without some increase in our duration, I am going to be buying more and more illiquidity in these short-dated cats and dogs of the German yield curve, which is contrary to the objective of wanting to be liquid So, I will be buying less and less liquid paper It is less liquid than buying securities "on the run" out of recent auctions and permitting them to decay and having a sub- portfolio spread evenly all along the yield curve That is a bit of the background that I think changes the complexion of what you are pointing at  I am also doing this because I feel a necessity to get off the Bundesbank's balance sheet A decade ago we were entirely dependent on their balance sheet Between 1/4 and 1/2 of the reserves of the German banking system were owned by us through the Bundesbank's balance sheet We are down to a much smaller proportion in part because we have moved off the balance sheet and in part because the Berlin Wall came down and reserves expanded in the German banking system That was a major shift But I think we ought to recognize that the Bundesbank is in a very different position than we are Let me just turn it around A couple of months ago, when this Committee discussed the question of facilities for foreign central banks on our balance sheet, the Committee members expressed a great deal of reluctance, skepticism, and concern We are going to come back and try to address these issues in a modified proposal We currently maintain tens of billions of dollars of deutsche marks on the Bundesbank's balance sheet with zero liquidity cost We can liquidate these at zero notice and contract their balance sheet at our whim  -46-    9/24/96  Now, to put that in context, the need here is to get off their balance sheet We have been rather slow in doing so, and they have been rather good natured about the tardiness of our response to their request If I take that need as a given, I now have to look for a place to invest I think a reasonable first step in how I diversify off their balance sheet is to invest in "on the run" German government securities or purchase them at auction, and build up a small sub- portfolio So, it's a different mix of factors than I think we were--   They are similar   I'm sorry; I meant to answer your question there as well I do not mean to say that I will automatically liquidate only at the short end when there is a need to liquidate large amounts Indeed, many central banks--the European central banks--discovered during the period of market tensions in the early 1990s that it is very efficient to repo out long-dated securities for immediate liquidity That provides the luxury of selling those securities very slowly and gradually over time That may be another source of liquidity We will try to develop liquidation rules that may have an either/or flavor to them We may liquidate significantly at the short end or we may repo out the long end and rebalance the portfolio more gradually That is very much my intention because of the enhanced liquidity of holding the "on-the-run" German government securities So, your point is very well taken   It would be my hope and something of an expectation that in the event we move to euros, we will find a deeper short end And when it is all denominated in one currency, we may  -47-    9/24/96  find it much more comfortable to be invested in French government bills and to have a shorter duration to the portfolio   Yes, I think it is Let me make one comment because it might help other members to comment on it I wish I had made this point clear in my memo In addition to the two different kinds of neutrality you are pointing to, there are two very different kinds of sell-side neutrality One is a very short-run, sell-side neutrality that relates to the impact on the market today The other is a very long-term, sell-side neutrality that has to do with how the public portfolio is affected by the selling In some of the hypothetical cases that the Meulendyke memo points to, if we were to liquidate $50 to $100 billion and did it all through the short end, that would have a rather profound impact on the public portfolio and thus would not be sell-side neutral or market neutral in a long-run sense So, there is another balancing going on there I think much of the history of the portfolio has reflected a tension between these two different kinds of neutrality Obviously, there are market situations where we would not want to sell across the yield curve, but there might be some where we would Clearly, it is generally most convenient to liquidate principally through the short end But with that caveat, I agree entirely with your formulation of the problem   While Sandy Krieger thinks about how long the transition might take us, I would note that to move in that direction we probably would need to have the Treasury treat us explicitly as an "add-on" in the bill auctions They do not do that now because, as deficits have come down, they have been contracting their bill offers and we along with the foreign central banks have become a rather large share of the competitive auctions But I think that issue is solvable and that the Treasury would amenable, if that is what we want to do, to working with us on that Once we had their agreement that we would be an add-on--I am trying to think off the top of my head how quickly the portfolio behaves--I would guess that it might take five years to move our holdings of bills up in a smooth way from 50 percent to 60 percent of our portfolio   I do not have a sense of a definitive answer from the Treasury on that   I do not know of any constraint on that   That is a good question I am somewhat uncomfortable with our current securities lending program, to say the least The program itself goes back to the period before government securities were in book entry form It was designed to deal with the tardiness in the paper clearing process With the development of book entry, I believe that the Desk became eager to discontinue the program and was on the verge of doing so at the time of the Salomon Brothers episode But that just seemed to be the wrong time to make the change To put it bluntly, I am desperate to find an occasion to discontinue the securities lending program, and if I can find the right cover I will urge the Committee to discontinue it I do not think, however, that this issue raises itself to the issue of the overall structure of the portfolio   But perhaps on another occasion I may come back and talk to the Committee about some of those more mechanical issues   We might be able to I might add that even if our coupon portfolio went down to 20 percent or 30 percent or 40 percent of the total, we would still have plenty of securities to lend, given the kinds of limits that we impose But that would not be an obstacle to me, and I do not think it would be viewed as a serious matter in the market   Absolutely I am hearing some encouragement of the super preeminence of liquidity, which will be reflected in our effort   There is certainly a good deal of depth to the long end of the yield curve, but given the history and current structure of the Treasury securities market, there is no doubt in anyone's mind that the bill sector is much more liquid Now, I think that we have to stay in touch with a possible evolution at the Treasury on this Over a long period of time the relative liquidity of bills could change For example, in the German yield curve it is the short end that is illiquid and that I am trying to get out of   That is not an immutable fact, but it is a fact today and has been a fact for the last couple of decades   I would just note that we are also using the traders' definition of liquidity, which is the ability to execute transactions in volume without moving price Clearly, the long end is less liquid in that sense The further out the maturity curve we go and the more we are selling, the bigger the price effect we will have   I will take a stab at the next step Thank you   Why me? [Laughter]   Thank you [Statement--see Appendix]   Yes, I think congratulations are due at the other end of the table, but since I get beat up occasionally down here, I will take what I can get!   The Committee would be giving me the authority to negotiate their renewal   To ratify our domestic operations   [Statement--see Appendix]   Members of Ted's staff and my staff have been working on this, and I am afraid there is nothing that we can come forward with that is conclusive or very satisfactory Staff are arguing back and forth, and I do not think there is anything that we can put our fingers on that provides a systematic explanation The work is going along I think what is most on market participants' minds is the abrupt decline that the dollar suffered in July when our equity markets experienced a reversal The dollar-mark lost 3 pfennigs very rapidly and the dollar-yen also came under pressure I am very cognizant of the fact that markets are driven to a great extent by habit They look at the most recent episode to see what other things might happen and to give them a clue as to how they should behave In July, we had pressure in equity markets, and it translated immediately into a weakening dollar Many people were expecting that to happen again as they looked for pressures in our asset markets So, I am just reflecting on market participants' observations that that did not happen when they expected it to   Yes, that is right The lags are a bit long in that regard I would also note that in addition to the mechanism that you are referring to, there is another mechanism If risk appetites are large at the end of the cycle and these happen to be expressed in long dollar positions, people might collapse dollar positions in a period where risk aversion comes to the fore because of uncertainty    12/17/96  and might do so independently of whether they actually are liquidating dollar assets That is, there may not be a direct pass-through from the closing of a stock position to the sale of dollars There may also be some management of foreign exchange market exposures that simply implies just a reduction in risks and a reduction in positions   I have been exposed to them for a while!   Yes That is the historic practice we have continued Now, I may have gone too far in explaining this, but I think that in all likelihood customer operations may die on the vine I do not want to announce that we will never do another customer operation, but I am hard pressed to see circumstances when I would be tempted to do it   Yes, I think there are some pros and cons to announcing the quantity in advance The pro is that telling the market the amount of the contemplated operation is normally thought to be helpful The con is that we like to look at dealer appetites as one indicator of funding needs, so I am rather uncomfortable in situations where we announce we are doing a $1 billion customer operation and we get so many bids that we do $2 billion, which is rather typical I am not saying that the amount of the bids is always double, but that is rather common The amount of dealer bids for financing is actually a very helpful piece of information in assessing the amount of reserves we think we may need to inject As we have focused increasingly on day-to-day operations because of the much reduced operating balances and related uncertainty, the size of dealer bids has become a variable of growing importance I accept in principle that it would be better to announce the size of intended System operations, but that makes me somewhat uncomfortable because I like to see the dealers' appetite as an indicator that may lead me to shade the size of the operation one way or another In my view, announcing the size of the contemplated operation becomes problematic   As I explained in the memo   Well, it has been a while since the Desk had any kind of habit of going into the market multiple times a day--I guess twenty years or so I certainly have no hands-on experience with such multiple daily operations Among the things we would look for would be an unexpected shift in the Treasury balance that could be a big factor that we would become aware of later in the day The drain of reserves from a rise in the Treasury balance is information that is available to us, as would be an unexpected shift of funds and drain stemming from our customer operations These are the first order of flows about which we would become aware with some degree of certainty Another reserve factor about which we are certain relates to those occasions, which I am hoping avoid, where we do not get to add as much in reserves as we wanted to Then, it would be nice, if we did not shock the market in the process, to be able to come back and conduct further operations because we did not get enough bids the first time That is another sort of fact, certainly  The harder issues are those where the funds rate just stays firm and, in the current environment where we operate once a day, we are left to wonder in the early afternoon whether we made a mistake We talk to brokers and funding desks to find out where something is going wrong; sometimes we can determine the reason, such as funds getting trapped in a bank that is having wire transfer problems The bank may continue to have a wire transfer problem throughout the day, and adding a little reserves could be helpful in that situation I think that is the sort of issue that we have to look at Don Kohn and I have talked about this at some length over the last couple of years What we are really rather hopeful for, but is still even further off, is some way to be able to operate truly late in the day, that is, at 300 pm or 400 pm--which would require a change in Fedwire rules and perhaps the window--or even later at 600 pm We certainly would have more information then about a number of factors and would know whether there is a reserve miss or not and could try to respond to it   So, in terms of the new framework for conducting operations, I think multiple operations on one day would be used infrequently but would be available to us So, whether we operated at 930 am or at 1030 am, we would have the option of coming back at 1130 am if we became aware of something very tangible about the Treasury balance or other developments unexpectedly affecting    12/17/96  reserves But I am also trying to set the dealers up for the time some months or years hence where we might try to create a window for the Desk late in the day if the combination of low operating balances and volatility late in the day really becomes an issue We do not know that that will happen, but in case it does, I want to alert them to that possibility   I would like to echo that concern I agree with you and I would want the Committee to have that discussion I also am quite worried that if we jump too quickly into multiple daily operations, we will actually reduce the incentive for intermediation in the fed funds market Clearly, these incentives have been declining As reserve balances have come down and sweep accounts have taken hold, there has been less juice in the system for an individual bank desk or treasurer to intermediate in the market, so their incentives to do so have been coming down We have to be careful not to reduce those incentives further by our behavior That means intervening only when we think the market really is not working, when something looks as if it is broken   In terms of bids?   Well, in the last couple of weeks, as you will have observed, we have operated a number of times at 1030 am, in part responding to firm conditions in the funds market and the large need that I was worried that we might not have enough bids to cover I should have this statistic on the tip of my tongue, but I don't--I think we almost routinely saw something like a doubling in the amount of propositions from the dealers when we have operated at 1030 am    12/17/96  rather than at the normal time of 1130 am Now, whether that is a function of the surprise value of our being in the market and their knowing that we were looking to fill big needs, I could not sort out But, clearly, we have seen a substantial improvement in the amount of propositions by going in one hour earlier   I have thought quite a bit about the pros and cons of providing some sense of our reserve forecast Clearly in one sense, that would provide some modicum of certainty, but as soon as I have that thought I realize that it does not provide a modicum of certainty Our forecasts are really quite movable feasts, and I will start at the end of my own analysis of it One of the things that I have come to realize is that the forecasters who work for Don and me are actually most valuable in telling me what the probability distribution is of their forecast error That is, on which side do they think their errors are most likely to be? That actually is the most useful bit of information for me in the whole exercise That is because we can then think through which way we want to lean on the basis of our own utility function Now, that would be impossible to communicate to the market unless we sort of did it by shading the forecast  That leads me back to the start of my own analysis When I look at the whole issue of transparency, whether it is the Committee's transparency on policy or our transparency in operating in the market, I think those are two things about which we need to be clear In my case the objective is simple You have told me that the target rate is 525 percent It is in our operations where we have not been as transparent The process that drives our decision-making is a little fuzzier and a little harder to communicate, particularly while we are going through a shift in market behavior associated with low operating balances and a heightened degree of uncertainty If I had much greater confidence in the accuracy of our forecasts and in turn in the relevance of our two-week forecasts to the day-to-day volatility in the market than I have today, I would be leaning more on the side of reporting our forecasts But given where I am now in my own uncertainty about the relationship between our two-week forecasts and day-to-day demand for reserves, I really am quite squeamish about it So, I think there are definitely pluses and minuses, pros and cons, but it is--   Yes, they do, and I think that raises an interesting question They have a one-day maintenance period If the decline in reserves balances and operating balances in the System led us to conclude that a two-week maintenance period was becoming irrelevant--it does not look like that is going to happen but we are on that trend even though there is no certainty about it--then I think we would have to come back and think very hard about operating on a de facto one-day maintenance period basis We would have to decide how much money the banking system needs each day The Bank of England with its one-day maintenance period has 3 or 4 windows every day during which they may operate They announce what their forecast shortage will be for the day, decide whether to provide some money or not, and whether to enter the market immediately or later in the day With the one-day horizon, there is not much intermediation across time, which is something I think we would want to encourage our banks to do If we get to that point, we will have to rethink quite a number of things A one-day horizon gives rise to questions of what the target should be, the forecast itself, and whether, given the implications for incentives as President Melzer pointed out, we should be operating multiple times a day on an ongoing basis   Absolutely Don Kohn and I had the benefit of being on a conference call with all the discount officers from the Reserve Banks, and we gently urged them to encourage greater flexibility in thinking about the use of the discount window I think that group is very helpfully working on a number of issues, including the consistency of collateral management across different Districts and the implicit messages that are sent to banks about the use of the discount window Quite frankly, one of the issues that we have now-- and I don't have a sense of which Districts are relevant--relates to the fact that, as discount officers have noted, major banks in some Districts just never want to come to the discount window Now, that translates very rapidly back to us at the Desk with regard to developments in the fed funds market That is because certain regional banks are not going to the discount window but they are coming into the funds market when they have a miss or an unexpected heightened demand for funds late in the day That is one source of pressure in the funds market So, I agree completely with the desirability of discussing the role of the discount window    12/17/96   We have not had more trouble At some point, I would like to bring an analysis forward to the Committee; it is not finished yet We have begun using internally a standard deviation of the prior day's effective federal funds rate in volume-weighted terms We have the raw data that are used to calculate the effective rate, and we currently look each day at a standard deviation of that There has been considerable volatility this year, concentrated roughly speaking in the middle half of the year as I recall But it does not appear to be anywhere near the kind of volatility that we experienced in 1991 Interestingly, even though it has been high for the year as a whole, there are some months this year in which it has been lower than in some months in 1994 or 1995 So, we are nowhere near a crisis in our ability to manage the fed funds rate, but volatility has been moving up Some of the fed funds watchers have printed charts that show volatility, but they only cover the last two years From a longer perspective, the volatility this year is still well below that experienced in both 1991 and the early 1980s One would expect that for the early 1980s, of course, and it is more relevant to look at the broad sweep So, we are observing developments, and I would like to bring that analysis forward to the Committee at some point The people who work for me wonder whether we shouldn't publish the daily standard deviation along with the effective rate That is an issue we will be thinking about, and we will bring it back to the Committee   Right That applies to the rates at which funds have traded without taking volume into account For example, it does not tell us how much trading there was at the higher rates during the day   I think the shift in expected interest rates that occurred in the first week of December can hardly be attributed to the presence or absence of the Federal Reserve in the coupon market Trading volume in that market is $70 to $100 billion a day, and whether or not we bought $4 billion would hardly seem to matter It is true that many people talked about the absence of a coupon pass, but how that could have affected the March futures contracts has challenged me a little It is awkward--I will be blunt about this-- that the last remaining business for the Fed watchers is predicting when we will do coupon passes That is what the franchise has been reduced to since we adopted the current practice of announcing policy changes So, that is about the last thing that the people who write the weekly reports and screens have to offer to their subscribers To leave that thought with you, we have a certain feedback problem   Some analysts who write these screens got it right There was one who was absolutely on the money when he explained that the Desk probably was concerned about having to drain reserves in January That is exactly what I told you, and I could have read his analysis here instead of my own   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to a package of six  colored charts with a peach FOMC Class II cover [Statement--see Appendix]   Yes, it is extraordinary I'm sorry that I don't know precisely how  it compares with large movements in the past, but I think the shift over this period of several  days now exceeds the dollar/yen move during February 1994 after the Clinton/Hosokawa  disagreement on trade I can't recall any larger move over the last 5 years   No   That goes one step further than I would be comfortable with Let  me try to explain what I only hinted at in my statement, namely, the impact on the dollar of    5/20/97  intervention by the Bank of Thailand and other Asian central banks- I will try to be pithy  about this I think the simplest example is to take the Hong Kong dollar but only as a  hypothetical case; that currency did not come under much pressure in this period As you  know, Hong Kong runs a peg to the US dollar If $20 billion, for example, moves from  Hong Kong to Japan and the peg is maintained, the one thing that we know will happen is  that the dollar will go down against the yen Now, if we extrapolate that to Thailand just for  purposes of an example, that country runs a peg against a currency index in which the dollar  has a roughly 80 percent weight When the Thai authorities defend their currency, funds  flow out of Thailand to repay leveraged financing in Tokyo Thailand defends the baht by  selling dollars either spot or forward, and the net effect shows up in dollar/yen movements to  the extent that the Thai authorities are successful in maintaining their peg to their index,  which they have so far So, I think the dollar/yen was affected to a significant extent by  some of the intervention in defense of Asian currencies and other currencies in this period It  was not a direct effect   Yes, the dollar's weakness occurred on the days when the Bank of  Thailand initially intervened in size, May 6 and 7, but not so much in the days that followed  May 6 and 7 were days when the Bank of Thailand's defense of its currency was building  up, although there were indications that they had been defending their currency for a while    5/20/97  on a modest scale It was at the start of that week of May 5 to 9 that Thailand announced  some disappointing forecasts for its budget and economic growth for the coming year  Pressures began to build on their currency, and the exchange market activities were thought  to be related to that   No, no   Yes, precisely   That we all need to go back to the drawing board on forecasting  taxes, and I will not pretend to be the expert on that subject I think our projection problems  were universal--New York, the Board, and the Treasury None of us had it right Mike Prell  may be able to offer more insights into this than I Such a study clearly will require a major  effort We had some rather big surprises last year, and to be candid we thought we had  learned from them So, that is a major area for study   No, we do not There is a rather disappointing inability to take the  Treasury tax information and quickly derive statistics that we would find useful   The other part of your question, Governor Rivlin--or the other part  of my answer--is that I was very pleased that our announcing the quantity of RPs helped the  market get a quicker handle on how far off we all were on our forecasts, and that I think was  a help We did operate twice in one day on two occasions That was not to fine-tune the  rates but because of the paucity of propositions we had from the dealers and how far off we  were going to be unless we tried to add some reserves by going back into the market I think  the dealer community responded rather well to that in terms of not thinking we were flying  off the handle The added flexibility to the Desk was helpful I think the tools worked fairly  well The first time we had a big miss in propositions, it did occur to me that it might be nice  to be able to do foreign exchange swaps to inject reserves when there was a paucity of  collateral I don't think it was really necessary, but that thought at least crossed my mind   Anecdotally, we at the Desk have heard the same stories I have  not been able to see that in any data anyone has shown me, but there are some lags in this  process   There will be some data on that I have heard it said by a number  of people whose views on the markets I respect that they think the very sharp movement in  the dollar/yen means that US Treasuries are now at attractive levels for Japanese investors  to purchase on the principle that they have taken losses and it is done I think that the net  impact of these movements has been to produce a fairly good two-way market Clearly,  there was some aggressive verbal intervention, both public and private, on the part of the  Ministry of Finance I think that is regrettable, given the nature of the volatility it has  engendered   I just mean that this is only an initial round of market expectations  that the Bank of Japan may start tightening sometime later this year Differentials remain  rather wide against yen fixed-income assets I do not mean to draw a perfect analogy from  this, but in 1994 the Committee started raising rates in February and we all remember the    5/20/97  Orange County bloodbath in December That was a full thirteen months after long bond  yields started to back up in October and November of 1993 There are different  mark-to-market conventions in Japan Some institutions do not have to; they can just hold  their fixed-income assets at historic cost Others have to mark to market We have a more  mark-to-market financial system than the Japanese That does not mean the losses in Japan  are not buried there somewhere They are, but they do not come to the fore as quickly  Foreigners who borrow at low interest rates in Japan are subject to a mark-to-market  discipline   Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to the several pages of colored charts distributed this morning 1  In reviewing recent market developments, I will try to describe what I see as the causes of the recent, abrupt repricing and volatility of equity, bond, and currency values  1 Copies of the charts used by Mr Fisher are appended to this transcript (Appendix 1)    8/19/97  First, since your last meeting, there have been noteworthy shifts in the interest rate outlook for the United States, Germany, and Japan While each of these movements may appear small, in perspective and in conjunction they can be understood as causing a significant increase in risk to which market participants responded  Second, to my way of thinking, it is not helpful to view the dollar's movement--or exchange rate movements generally--as "causing" the sell- off in bond and equity markets The dollar's recent movements appear to reflect the same reassessment of the outlook that has affected other markets  Third, I think the recent volatility in markets can, in part, be attributed to the difficulty all market participants are having in coming to grips with the extraordinary performance of the US economy In this sense, the recent volatility reflects the contest between "old" and "new" paradigms  Looking at the first page of charts, which depicts forward rate agreements and Euro-deposit rates from August 1996 for the dollar, the mark, and the yen, you can see the backing up of the 9-by-12 dollar FRA-- indicating three-month deposit rates, nine months forward--which occurred following the August 1st release of the nonfarm payroll data and the NAPM survey In the blue lines, you can see the consistent rise in German forward rates from mid-July At the bottom, you can see the recent, continued decline in Japanese forward rates  The rally in US interest rate markets, which started in the spring, continued in the last two weeks of July That rally was propelled by the combination of reduced expectations for any near-term Committee action following the Chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony and expectations for reduced Treasury issuance as a consequence of the improved fiscal outlook  The August 1st release of the nonfarm payroll and NAPM reports caused a modest increase in expectations for a tightening by the Committee before year-end, with the December Fed funds futures backing up by 14 basis points in six days As you can see in the FRA chart, late last week the backup in interest rates reversed at the time of the rapid decline in equity markets But through last Wednesday's close, the 9-by-12 backed up by 32 basis points in the nine trading days from July 3 1st   Looking back across the past year, this move is comparable to the increases in the 9-by-12 that occurred in December and February In December, beginning a few days before the Chairman's speech at the American Enterprise Institute, the 9-by-12 backed up by 30 basis points in thirteen trading days; in response to the Chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins    8/19/97  testimony in February, the 9-by-12 backed up by 28 basis points in just six trading days  Trend reversals such as these, reflecting only a modest increase in the probability of a tightening of monetary policy, also tend to cause market participants to reassess the likely consequences of still seemingly remote events Most market participants still think that an increase in rates by the Committee is not likely to occur at this meeting or the next But given the lofty levels to which bond and equity markets had traded, even a small increase in the likelihood of an event which could have such extreme, negative consequences for asset values causes traders to reduce their exposures  To put the same thought differently for those still working in the "old paradigm," uncertainty premia were squeezed awfully tight by the end of July, when the two-year Treasury yield traded within 25 basis points of the Fed funds target rate; some backup in interest rates and a collateral selloff in equities were accidents waiting to happen In conjunction with the reversal of the US rate outlook, after the mark began to weaken sharply in mid-July market participants also have had to respond to the escalating rhetoric from Bundesbank officials threatening an increase in rates  On July 24 th, the Bundesbank Council met and announced that their repo operations would continue at the fixed rate of 3 percent but only for the first two weeks of their four-week holiday until the next Council meeting This suggested that the Bundesbank Directorium would have the opportunity to change the repo rate by either moving to a variable rate tender or raising the fixed rate last week However, they announced one more operation at the fixed 3 percent rate last week, and this morning they announced one more operation at 3 percent  From the Bundesbank's perspective, this saber rattling has had two beneficial effects It has created a much greater sense of two-way risk in the Deutsche mark and itself in the pre-monetary union environment  Now, the Bundesbank faces something of a dilemma--or a couple of dilemmas First, the German economy is providing mixed signals some measures of activity are picking up and, as a consequence of the decline in the mark this year, officials expect import price inflation to begin to show up in the data On the other hand, high unemployment continues; ongoing problems in implementing tax reform suggest that consumption demand will remain weak, and M3 growth continues to slow Thus, on strictly domestic grounds, a decision to increase rates would be finely balanced    8/19/97  Second, it is not clear how markets would respond to a rate increase in the context of European monetary union To the extent that an increase in rates by the Bundesbank were to be perceived as hostile to the EMU process, causing delay or postponement or a narrowing of the field of likely member countries, it might then be expected to cause the mark to strengthen  However, much of the Bundesbank's rhetoric of the last few weeks has been in service to the idea that an increase in rates would be consistent with and supportive of EMU, suggesting that European monetary policy should not be frozen in place until the ECB is created and that the convergence process could be completed by German rates rising to meet Italian rates To the extent that market participants believe this, in the event that the Bundesbank were to raise rates, it is not clear that German long-term rates would move very much, or that the mark would appreciate much more than it did last week  Japanese forward rates reflect the continued unwinding of expectations for any near-term firming by the Bank of Japan, particularly following the July 24 th release of the Bank of Japan's Quarterly Report and the July 30th  release of weaker-than-expected June industrial production data As you can see at the bottom of the page, the rise in rates that occurred in May--in response to official pronouncements that things were not as bad as they seemed--has now been completely reversed as market participants have come to see the Japanese economy to be as weak as they originally feared  The 9-by-12 forward rate is now returning to the levels where it was trading in March, at the end of the last Japanese fiscal year when gloom was widespread On August 15th and again today, the yield on the benchmark No 182 Japanese government bond hit a new, historic low of 2065 percent  Turning to the next page, a further jolt to the global outlook has come in the rush of currency devaluations in Southeast Asia Over the course of the spring and summer, media attention has shifted back and forth between describing these events as "speculative attacks" on the one hand and "competitive devaluations" on the other Increasingly, emphasis is now placed on the latter While much of the focus has been on the devaluation of these currencies against the dollar, shown in the top panel, their declines against the yen since May 1st have been even more impressive, which is not likely to do much to improve the outlook for the Japanese export sector  Turning to the third page of charts--    8/19/97   All right As I mentioned at the outset, [laughter] a 9-by-12 is the  3-month rate traded 9 months forward So, 9 plus 3 is 12--   I think the new technology is spreading it out all the way to New Jersey  and Westchester! The 3-by-6 is the 3-month rate as it trades 3 months forward   Where were we? [Laughter] As I mentioned at the outset, I do not think it is helpful to see exchange rate movements generally, or the dollar's movements in particular, as an exogenous "cause" of bond and equity market volatility Rather, I think that exchange markets have been responding to the same shift in outlook that has influenced other markets  In the first panel you can see the dollar's movements against the mark, in blue, and against the yen, in red, since May 1st In July, the dollar rallied sharply against the mark as the idea of a broad and timely EMU process became generally accepted The dollar came off against the mark in early August when the Bundesbank worked hard to suggest the risk of upward movement in German rates; as these risks declined, the dollar has jumped back up a bit against the mark in the last few days The dollar appreciated modestly against the yen in July as the Japanese outlook deteriorated and recently has been more stable against the yen than against the mark Looking at the movements in bond and equity markets, depicted in the second and third panels, I see a case of correlation in their responses to common impulses, not causation  Finally, just as members of the Committee have been surprised by the performance of the United States economy in sustaining low inflation and    8/19/97  relatively strong activity, so too have market participants Surprises--even pleasant ones, like the combination of last Wednesday's PPI and retail sales releases--tend to create uncertainty, and uncertainty needs to be priced into markets  Another way to view this, depicted on the fourth page, is as a contest between the old and new paradigms and, specifically, among the diverse views now being expressed in market behavior "Old paradigm pessimists" think that inflation is about to break out; it has just been hiding in the lags They think the Fed is "behind the curve," providing too much liquidity In response to last Wednesday's data, old paradigm pessimists would be inclined to sell stocks and bonds short  "Old paradigm optimists" think inflation is probably coming soon, but it's hard to tell They think the Fed is doing a good job and that maybe this benign inflation behavior can be kept going for a few more quarters Many old paradigm optimists are reformed old paradigm pessimists, whose pessimism became too expensive a few thousand Dow points ago Thus, they remain cautious buying stocks and bonds on dips and selling them on rallies  "New paradigm optimists"--who have done rather well over the past year or so--think that we have entered a new era in which productivity growth, hidden in the macro data, is taming inflation They think the Fed is doing a great job and are great admirers of the Chairman In response to low inflation and strong activity, they do what they always do buy loads of stocks and some bonds whenever they can  "New paradigm pessimists" are only recently getting the attention they think they deserve The lack of corporate pricing power, the industrialization of China, the chronic weakness of Japan and Europe, the competitive devaluations of the United Kingdom and Italy a few years ago and, now, of all of Southeast Asia, are signs of the coming global capacity glut They think the Fed is much too tight They look at the PPI and retail sales data and see deflation staring them in the face and the last gasp of the US consumer before the deflationary reality sinks in; they, therefore, sell stocks and buy Treasuries--not corporate bonds, just Treasuries  While some of the recent volatility can perhaps be attributed to thin, August markets, as I see it the volatility is also a consequence of the interaction of these four archetypes' diverse responses to the same data and of the movement of market participants among these four types Much of the rally of this year can be thought of as having been propelled by the migration of old paradigm pessimists to old paradigm optimists and of old paradigm optimists to new paradigm optimists Much of the recent    8/19/97  retrenchment can be thought of as old paradigm optimists hedging against the risks of either old paradigm pessimism or new paradigm pessimism  Turning to domestic operations, reserve needs were somewhat more moderate than in preceding intermeeting periods and we tended to use shorter-term operations to meet those needs The next page of charts contrasts the volatility of Fed funds trading and operating balances in comparable periods from last summer and this summer The daily range of Fed funds trading is shown in blue; the one-standard deviation of funds trading around the daily effective rate and the effective rate are depicted in red; below each is a bar chart showing daily operating balances At discernibly lower levels of operating balances this year as compared to last, we have actually had modestly less volatility in the funds rate, as measured both by the range and by the standard deviation  Mr Chairman, we had no foreign exchange intervention operations during the period Committee members have received materials describing how we intend to manage the diversification of a small portion of the System's Deutsche mark holdings into a sub-portfolio of longer-dated German government securities, which the Committee approved in principle last September  I would be happy to answer any questions about this material, or about any aspect of my report this morning I will need the Committee's ratification of the Desk's domestic operations during the period   It is certainly worthy of note I do not have an exact read this morning,  but the forward exchange rates have backed up quite a bit in the last 10 days I am told anecdotally  that the pressure is from prudent asset managers who are hedging risks, not speculators poised for  an attack I don't know how much value I can place on that information   That's a very good thought Let me make a few observations for the  benefit of the whole Committee First, we are treated as an "add-on" in the Treasury's issuance at  the long end, so our purchases do not reduce what the Treasury issues to the public Whether to  buy such obligations at all was a bit of a dilemma for us If the Treasury launches a new program  and we do not buy any of the securities, there is a risk of a negative inference for the new  instrument that the Treasury is marketing There is also a risk that if the new type of security  becomes a major vehicle for Treasury funding and we have not bought any such securities, we will  need to buy them in order to keep the SOMA portfolio invested in the deepest area of the  Treasury's issuance On the other side of the dilemma, obviously, the notion of central bank  purchases of inflation-indexed securities has a certain odd ring to it   But as I noted, we are not a net subtractor of market supply because the  Treasury treats us as an "add-on" An additional reason for holding some of these securities was to  have them available for our securities lending program You inspired me to comment on that  program at an earlier meeting, and I have told the Committee that we are trying to come up with a  new program I hope to come back to the Committee during the fall with some new ideas for that  It might well help the inflation-indexed market if we were in an improved position to lend  securities to that market    8/19/97   Not that I'm aware of   Yes, the Board of Trade is considering those, but when you said  "forward" I thought about the over-the-counter forward market   The futures market is what the Board of Trade is working on   Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to the four pages of colored charts in front of you under the Class II cover 1 On the first page are current 3-month deposit rates and 3-, 6-, and 9-month forward, 3-month deposit rates that for the United States are shown in red, for Germany in blue, and for Japan in green Looking at the US forward rates, you can see that there has been relatively little net change since the Committee's last meeting Indeed, after rising during August, the forward rates are now back to around their levels at the time of the August meeting and almost back to the recent lows they reached at the very end of July The single biggest decline in US forward rate expectations came on the release of the August CPI on September 16 That followed a smaller decline the prior day after the retail sales and the PPI data for August were announced Looking at these rates going back to late March and given their recent declines, I see relatively little, if any, pricing in of expected further action by the Committee in the months ahead  Looking down to the German forward rates shown in blue, you can see that the rise in German rate expectations that began earlier in the summer has continued While both German and some other European data have been somewhat firmer, I believe the bigger impact on German rate expectations has come from the rather loud whisper campaign that the Bundesbank has directed at financial markets The message in effect is that in order for the European monetary union to work, German and Italian short-end rates will have to meet somewhere in between their current levels With the German short-end rates now around 3 percent and Italian short- end rates around 6 to 6-1/2 percent, this implies a 150 basis point rise for Germany and a 150 basis point decline for Italy The rather public whisper campaign has been driving German rate expectations up, and you can observe on the right side of the chart the rather pronounced upward shift following the ECOFIN meeting the weekend of September 13 and 14  Looking at the Japanese forward rates in the bottom panel, you can see that the various forward rate maturities have continued to collapse on top of  1 Copies of the charts used by Mr Fisher are appended to this document (Appendix 1)    9/30/97 2  the current rate The release of the 112 percent (annual rate) decline in second-quarter GDP added to the gloom in Tokyo Rather than try to parse out the green muddle of rates at the bottom of the chart, let me observe that the 9-month forward, 3-month yen deposit rate now trades at 3 basis points over the overnight Libor rate The JGB benchmark yield has traded down to 186 percent in the last couple of days These relative shifts in interest rate expectations have had a fairly predictable impact on exchange markets, with the yen depreciating about 2-1/2 percent and the mark appreciating about 5-1/2 percent against the dollar since August 1 I think this impact on the dollar-mark exchange rate is precisely what the Bundesbank had in mind when it engineered its whisper campaign  Turning to the second page, you can see that recent developments had a somewhat more complex impact on bond markets The four panels on this page depict the basis-point changes since July 1 in 9-month forward 3-month deposit rates implied by the FRAs and in 10-year government bond yields In the upper left panel, you can see the story of US interest rate markets as the red lines move across the chart We had the rally in July followed by the upward spike in early August There was little net change subsequently until the more recent rally associated with the release of the August price data during September In the top panel for Japan on the right, the persistent decline in Japanese rates, both for 10-year bonds and forward interest rate expectations, is evident In the bottom left chart for Germany, we see a different pattern of interest rate movements throughout the period The 9-month forward 3-month deposit rate has risen by 72 basis points since July 1, while the 10-year bond has traded more or less sideways; it rallied a little in September, declining 18 basis points in yield  The truly dramatic impact of the Bundesbank's whisper campaign was felt in Italian interest rate markets where participants heard the Bundesbank to be saying three things First, the Bundesbank would be raising rates Secondly, the Bundesbank was so convinced that Italy would be in EMU that they were prepared to act on that basis And third, the Bundesbank thought it would be an EMU-friendly act for the Bank of Italy to lower rates 150 basis points As shown in the panel at the bottom right, the 9-month forward 3-month lira deposit rate declined by 125 basis points from the beginning of August through last Friday and there was a similar decline in the 10-year bond yield One of the questions that have come out of this experience is how to explain the stability in long-term German interest rates From Frankfurt, the markets have heard that when central banks with real credibility threaten to raise rates, the long end of their yield curve    9/30/97  remains stable or rallies And much to my surprise, a great number of market participants have adopted this view as their own There is an alternative view to which I am somewhat partial It begins by noting that over the last several years the Bundesbank has been of the view that the long end of their yield curve has followed the lead of the US and the global bond markets, and it has not really followed expected changes in short-term German interest rates The pattern of the solid blue line for Germany does have some echo of the solid red line for the United States One could also note that relative to US and Japanese 10-year rates, German rates have backed up by 25 basis points since the beginning of the summer So, I think there is some excitement yet to play through in European bond markets as we move forward toward EMU  The third page of charts shows percent changes in equity indices for the second and third quarters of 1997 I have included that chart to make two obvious points First, equity markets were somewhat more volatile in the third quarter than in the second Also, there was a much greater diversity of outcomes in the third quarter That is true globally and also if we look at some of the internal comparisons For example, the NASDAQ performance was quite different from that of the Dow The Milan MlBtel, the German Dax, and the French CAC all had quite different outcomes and, of course, the Tokyo Topix and its construction sector, reflecting the Japanese domestic economy, also turned in rather different performances than other equity indices  Turning to domestic open market operations, the daily effective federal funds rate averaged about 555 percent over the intermeeting period, a little higher than the intended rate This outcome reflected principally a few days of elevated funds rates I'm not going to take you through all the detail on these charts, but I did want to make a point The vertical blue lines in the top panel show the daily range of federal funds trading; the horizontal red lines are the daily effective rate; the vertical red lines represent one standard deviation in the volume of federal funds trading each day and give a sense of the concentration or dispersion of funds trading The middle panel shows our misses, that is, the actual level of free reserves less the intended level; the yellow bars indicate negative misses and the blue bars show positive misses In the bottom panel, you see operating balances as they occurred each day  My reason for showing this chart is to focus on three days in September on the right hand side of the page--the 15th, 16th, and 17th--and to point out that neither changes in operating balances alone nor even our misses of some size really tell us everything we might want know about what drives volatility in the federal funds market The 15th, 16th, and 17th were corporate tax payment dates On the 15th, you can see that we had an elevated effective rate on the day but a very narrow effective range, as    9/30/97  market participants priced up for the pressures they anticipated and traded funds in a very narrow range However, looking at the middle panel for the 15th, we had a rather sizable miss of $2 billion on that day Even so, we had a relatively contained federal funds rate On the 16th, the effective rate was right on the target at 5-1/2 percent The one standard deviation trading range was somewhat wider on that day, but we again had a miss and, if you look at the bottom of the page, a very low operating balance In fact, we almost hit the historic low operating balance, but we did not have a terribly volatile day or upward pressure in the funds market The next day, the 17th, funds traded over a quite wide range at rates up to 15 percent and the one standard deviation volume of trading was much wider We had a very large miss and again a low operating balance  The difference between the 16th and the 17th was in the distribution of reserves, with the need falling on the large regional banks whose behavior pattern tends to be to bid up the funds rate So in this case, the behavior of those banks determined the volatility of the funds rate a great deal more than the level of operating balance or even the size of our miss I do not want to overstate that, but I think it is a significant point to emphasize The level of the operating balance is not the only factor  Since your last meeting, we have conducted two legs of outright purchase operations, both in the coupon sector The bill market remains quite tight, and I have been reluctant to enter that market So, I expect to continue to operate in the coupon market There is some possibility that with the new fiscal year the Treasury will be issuing a larger amount of bills and we will be able to return to bill purchases  Mr Chairman, there were no foreign exchange operations for the System account during the period since the August meeting I will need the Committee's ratification of our domestic open market operations I would be happy to answer any questions   No, I do not I think the market understands as well as any of us the  implications of low operating balances and how they may foster market volatility on some days    9/30/97  So, no, I don't think such volatility has had any effect on policy expectations Don and I have  worried that it might at some point I don't want to make too much of this, but we are making an  effort to refine our ability to measure volatility so that we can provide the Committee with a better  basis for judging and deciding whether this is something it should care about   I have spoken with people at the Bank of Italy, the Bank of France, and  some other European central banks For the Italians, there is a hierarchy of objectives Getting into  EMU is the first, the second, and the third objective! So, I think they are prepared to pay some  price for EMU membership If they cannot get their rates all the way down to match German rates,  they are prepared to go half-way Now, most people in the market anticipate another interest rate  reduction from the Bank of Italy once the Italian budget passes I believe that may occur in coming  weeks, and there may be one or even two Bank of Italy actions before year-end in light of the  Bundesbank's implicit announcement that short rates ought to converge somewhere in the middle    9/30/97  The Bundesbank's comments fell on very fertile ground in the markets They seemed to be waiting  to see when something might happen, and they got a pre-blessing out of Frankfurt It seems clear  that people in Europe wanted to see rates converge on the low German rates and felt a certain  reluctance to suggest that the convergence be somewhere in the middle of current rate levels On  the plus side, one reason the German action can be seen as positive is that it is creating a greater  flexibility for the new ECB when it comes in People previously had been assuming that the ECB  would simply pick up whatever repo rate was set by the Bundesbank and that would be that This  has introduced an element of uncertainty  On the other hand, I think the French are the ones who will really feel they have been  misled They went through the pain of getting their rates all the way down and having them  converge on the low German rates Now they hear that they will have to suffer the pain of going  half-way up to meet Italian rate levels, and they do not think that was the understanding That is  painful for them There are two ways to think about this "meet-in-the-middle" story One is in  terms of mood music it sets a positive tone and gets the process going But if it is taken literally, I  think it can be quite toxic You can fix exchange rates and let interest rates float or you can fix  interest rates at the short end and let exchange rates float Trying to fix both in advance of the  EMU event is a high-wire act   Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to the package of charts that should be in front of you' It has a Class I cover and begins with a color chart showing 3-month deposit rates Today I will be going over four distinct subjects To give you a roadmap First, I will discuss market developments in general, focusing particularly on some of the causes of events in Hong Kong Second, I will discuss recent open market operations Third, I would like to take a few minutes to bring the Committee up-to-date on the performance of primary dealers I think it is important for me to give you a sense of what I have been doing with the dealer community After that, I will be seeking two votes One is the normal vote to ratify the open market operations since the September meeting I also will be asking for an increase in the intermeeting leeway After that, I will come back and comment on the swap line renewals, which are a separate agenda item I will seek a vote to renew the swap agreements for another year  Focusing on market developments, the first page of charts shows 3-month deposit rates, including the current rate, 3-month forward, 6-month forward, and 9-month forward for the United States, Germany, and Japan In the first panel, you can see that interest rate expectations began to back up here in the United States following the Chairman's testimony before the Budget Committee on October 8 The next day, the Bundesbank hiked their repo rate by 30 basis points, as you can see in the middle panel To many people in financial markets around the world, this indicated, perhaps inaccurately, a concerted effort by the industrial nations to raise interest rates globally Many  1 Copies of the charts used by Mr Fisher are appended to this transcript    11/12/97  people talked very seriously about how the tide had turned and interest rates could be expected to go higher in the industrial world Both in Germany and the United States, rates continued to back up for several days until the events beginning on October 23, a date I will come back to in a minute That was the day when financial pressures first emerged most acutely in Hong Kong You can see that interest rate expectations in both the United States and Germany came off rather sharply beginning that Thursday, October 23, and bottomed out on the day of the sharpest US equity market decline the following Monday, October 27 Forward rate markets were already stabilizing to some extent, at least here, by the time of the Chairman's testimony before the Joint Economic Committee on October 29  I would like to note that US interest rate expectations, as measured by the forward rate agreements, did not subsequently back up They stabilized more or less at levels slightly above the lows reached before the Chairman's October 8 testimony, whereas German interest rate expectations, reflecting a rise that occurred in market rates, are still quite a bit higher I think this goes a long way toward explaining the relative movements in the dollar and the mark One does not need to look anywhere else even though many financial market analysts are looking under every rock and in every nook and cranny You can see in the bottom panel that Japanese interest rates, as measured by forward rate agreements, are still quite flat I will come back in a moment to some events leading up to this morning's developments in Tokyo  Turning to the charts on page 2, I will focus on the causation of the events in Hong Kong, or as the Chairman sometimes puts it, a discussion of who sneezed last This discussion is not necessarily to point a finger at anyone but to delineate the series of events that led up to the financial pressures The first panel shows the percent changes in the foreign exchange value of the Taiwan dollar, the South Korean won, and the Hong Kong dollar since September 30 The middle panel shows 1-month interbank rates for Taiwan, South Korea, and Hong Kong, and the bottom panel shows percent changes in key equity indices for those countries and for the United States, Japan, and Brazil  Working across the top panel--the Hong Kong government announced in early October that they would hold another land auction This is a more or less routine event for them, but the announcement did indicate they were coming back to the market and would be putting some pressure on land prices They held the auction several days later, on October 15, and found a bogus bid for one of the largest parcels of land that were up for sale The bid was made by a woman in the name of a major firm and she certainly did not have the billions of dollars necessary to purchase the real estate The    11/12/97  Hong Kong authorities are reviewing their practices for accepting bids, but it was rather shocking to think that an auction for this kind of real estate could involve someone who was a mental patient, quite literally  Several days later, Taiwan ceased intervening in the exchange market and allowed its currency to depreciate significantly This posed a question in the minds of many foreign exchange market participants the world over--a profound question If a country with such a high level of foreign exchange reserves was not prepared to defend its currency, who would? The Taiwan government certainly had the capacity to defend their exchange rate, but it turned out they did not have the will The question in everyone's mind after Taiwan's decision was whether the People's Republic of China, and not so much Hong Kong, would need to devalue For many people the answer to that question appeared to come when, on October 23 or late in the evening of October 22, the People's Bank of China announced a reduction in interest rates They reduced their lending rate by 150 basis points and their savings rate by a little more than 100 basis points This appeared to answer the question for many people by showing that China was worried about their competitiveness The markets very quickly tried to price that in, but they could not price it into the yuan The only place it can be priced is in a proxy for the yuan, the Hong Kong dollar So, the pressures began to build and you can see in the middle column that the Hong Kong monetary authorities squeezed their money market rather tightly I don't think they expected overnight interest rates to go to 300 percent They expected the rise to be considerably less than that, but there were a number of players who held onto long positions hoping to make money in subsequent days In the bottom panel, you can see them play through to the equity markets, with whose performance you are familiar  Turning to the third page of charts, I want to draw your attention to the impact of these developments in credit markets While equity markets had some sharp losses, the real fear and adjustment that took place in financial markets seemed to be, as I heard it, in the credit markets In the first panel, you can see that absolute spreads of Asian Yankee and stripped Brady Bonds over US Treasuries backed up rather considerably These are measured in hundreds of basis points The backup was more or less triggered by the pressures on October 23 and thereafter, obviously with many contributing events In the middle panel, in order to get the scaling right, I simply have the basis point changes in two Merrill Lynch corporate bond indices, one for high yield and one for investment grade, over Treasuries since September 30 Clearly, there has been some widening of spreads over Treasuries What is worth noting is that the corporate yields have not moved at all; it is the Treasuries that have moved As shown in the bottom panel, 10- and 30-year    11/12/97  rates were down 20 basis points over this period, and that was the full extent of the backup, the widening of the spread if you will, both to junk and investment grade paper It was very hard to chart in the bottom panel how odd the bond market has felt over the last few days because there has been a tortuous back and forth between those who want to trade on fundamentals and the flight to quality that seems to be taking place I cannot show you last Friday's developments in a chart because the adjustments happened so quickly Following the release of the employment data last Friday, bond market and fed funds futures backed up and then, after about 90 seconds, came right back down as the market returned to its flight-to-credit posture  The fourth page displays three charts to make a very simple point Each panel shows the percent changes in one of the G3 currencies against the other two G3 currencies In the first panel, you can see that the mark has appreciated against both the dollar and the yen since September 1 In the middle panel, you can see that the yen has depreciated against both the dollar and the mark And in the bottom panel, you can see that the dollar is being pulled somewhat in two directions That is, it is considerably weaker against the mark but a little stronger against the yen, the dollar having been stable for most of this period  I want to go back to what I referred to earlier, namely, that I think interest rate differentials between the United States and Germany explain most of the movement between the dollar and the mark, although market participants do look eagerly at the question of whether there is a flight out of dollars into marks and whether the mark is something of a safe haven I think it is reasonable to pause and note that in terms of financial flows, there probably was some movement out of dollars, given how many of the assets that have been under pressure are dollar-denominated So, when portfolio managers sustained losses on Bradys and Asian Yankees and equities that are more or less dollar-linked, there was going to be some marginal movement out of the dollar That is a very different question from one about the macroeconomic consequences; this is a financial flows issue I think Ted Truman will be coming back to the broader macroeconomic question  Let me pause here to discuss some of the events of the last few days in Tokyo The yen has weakened overnight; it was below 126 this morning The Japanese government bond yield is up to 170 percent after backing up 10 basis points in just a few days A week ago, with the announced bankruptcy of Sanyo, a very profound event happened in Japanese financial history The authorities let a major firm go bankrupt It is something our colleagues at the Bank of Japan have been working on earnestly for 10 years and are very proud of Obviously, the timing was another matter It took the    11/12/97  markets a few days to begin to price it in But the number of financial market participants around the world who have been trading with Japanese counterparties on the assumption that the government stood behind them is very large By Friday of last week, some Japanese names, the weaker ones, were finding it hard to get quoted in the forward interest rate market in New York Today, people are talking about Japanese institutions needing to liquidate government bonds The Nikkei was off 434 points earlier and is now down again We see a grinding out of some of the worst fears one might have about the Japanese financial sector That is beginning to show up in forward rate markets For example, in the Euro deposit market as of the end of October, there was no credit premium in the 3-month rate for Japanese institutions This morning, it is already 250 basis points as compared to zero at the end of October   Excuse me I should have said 25 basis points I am very sorry I'm  trying to catch up with everything that happened overnight  On that note, let me turn to domestic open market operations and try to get my numbers right On the fifth page, there are two panels illustrating developments in the federal funds market The top panel shows the behavior of the federal funds rate The blue lines indicate the daily range of actual trading, the red vertical lines depict one standard deviation of funds rate trading on either side of the effective rate, the horizontal red line is the daily effective rate, and the green dotted line is the Committee's target In the upper right of the sub panels for each of the three full maintenance periods, you can see the period average effective rate In the lower panel of the chart, the blue bars show the daily level of free reserves, and the numbers on top of each of the bars indicate our daily projection misses There is one exception related to a labeling problem that I will come back to in a moment  The intermeeting interval unfolded more or less as we had expected In the first biweekly period, September 30, the last day of the quarter, was a difficult day in the market The market priced up for that statement date, initially producing a high rate, and we came in a little later in the day and added quite a few reserves That resulted in a very wide standard deviation in the federal funds rate on September 30 On the last day of the middle period, the settlement day, the very tall blue bar, is labeled 99; that number does not indicate the size of our miss; it refers to the level of the bar, which was cut off at the top of the chart Our miss that day was only 03 This was a day when we supplied quite a few reserves to the market, but given the    11/12/97  skewing up in the rate, we underestimated a bit the demand for excess during this period Actually, the point I want to make, which we describe in our written report, is that the demand for excess reserves has been growing We target demand for excess reserves of $1 billion in each reserve maintenance period on a period average basis, but actual demand has been creeping up on us Independent of the turmoil of the last few weeks, the rising demand for excess reserves is in all likelihood a function of declining operating balances Bankers appear to be looking for a little more excess reserves, but this is something that we are still looking into  In the final period, you can see that we did have to deal a little with the effects of the large volume of trading in equities The largest volume day was on October 28, and with a 3-day settlement, the settlement of that trading fell on October 31 That was a month-end, already a slightly complicated day for us We more or less had a day that looked like a maintenance period settlement day where we had to add a sizable amount of reserves and the funds market had a quite wide standard deviation  Stepping back, I would like to ask the Committee for an increase in intermeeting leeway to purchase securities on an outright basis during the intermeeting period between now and the December meeting The temporary increase would be from $8 billion to $12 billion We began another sequence of outright coupon purchases last week We have a significant amount to execute going forward We estimate that our holdings will need to grow about $15 billion by the maintenance period ending around the time of the Committee's next meeting and that the cumulative need will increase to up to $20 billion in the period immediately following the December meeting I would like to complete the portion we are planning to do on an outright basis in the market before we get that late in the year So, by the time of the December meeting, I expect to want to add around $10 or $11 billion through outright operations, principally in coupon securities However, given that the Treasury issuance of bills seems to be increasing somewhat, I also hope to buy some bills a little later this month or early in December  Before turning to your questions and your vote, I would like to talk to you for a few minutes about the performance of the primary dealers, as shown on your next page I will try to go through some of the background on our primary dealer relations  Criteria for primary dealers were revised in February 1992, as most members of the Committee will recall At that time, we identified some drawbacks in the existing system We described as one drawback the public impression that because the Federal Reserve Bank sets standards for selecting    11/12/97  and maintaining these relationships, the Fed was in effect the regulator of the primary dealer firms Another drawback was that the primary dealer designation was viewed as conferring a special status on these firms in that it carried with it elements of franchise value As a consequence, we dropped the requirement in 1992 that dealers maintain a 1 percent share of total customer activity We also discontinued our dealer surveillance activities, which had led to the impression that we were supervising the dealers In 1992, we also reiterated our standards for maintaining dealer status All primary dealers were told that as in the past they were expected to (1) make reasonably good markets in their trading relationships with the Fed's Trading Desk, (2) participate meaningfully in Treasury auctions, and (3) provide the Trading Desk with market analysis that could be useful to the Federal Reserve in the formulation of monetary policy Primary dealers that failed to meet these standards in a meaningful way over time would have their designation as primary dealers discontinued by the FRBNY I think that spells out, as I have been describing to the dealers, essentially six criteria that we look at in judging our trading relations with the dealers As listed at the bottom of page 6, these include their performance relating to our RP operations, our outright operations, the Treasury's bill and coupon auctions, the Desk's trades on behalf of foreign central banks, and the provision of information to the Desk  Bluntly put, we have not succeeded in removing the "Good Housekeeping" seal of approval There are many customers in the market who insist that they will only deal with primary dealers There are municipalities and other public bodies in this country that have such a requirement in their enabling legislation, and many other customers follow that practice informally So, we have not been successful there At the same time, it has been hard to motivate dealers to perform I frankly face something of a moral hazard because there is no longer a volume requirement Previously, that was an easy thing for the dealers to measure They knew that if they maintained their volume, they would be kept on our dealer list and that kept their minds focused  What I had hoped to do is provide the dealers with report cards that they could take home and share with their management and really understand how we saw them I then decided that I did not want to read about those in the Wall Street Journal So, we came up with a formula for sharing their relative performance with them, at least on the first four criteria, without giving them something they could take home The following four charts give you some sense of the performance of the individual dealer firms, though they will not enable you to master the details    11/12/97  The first panel shows primary dealer performance in financing Desk transactions The horizontal axis shows the percent of our volume in repo operations that any one dealer actually does with us, that is, it measures the propositions we accept The vertical axis measures pricing competitiveness in which zero represents the stop-out rate on our operations, that is, the lowest rate at which we operate Plus basis points indicate better yields we earn and minus basis points measure poorer yields The vertical axis reflects all propositions, not just the ones we take On average, we do not take most propositions For example, we may accept only $2 billion when we get $10 billion of propositions So, on average most prices will fall below the stop-out As a first approximation, poor performance is reflected in the lower left corner; strong performance appears in the upper right corner However, there is another twist If a dealer firm is too much of an outlier and too eager to price through the stop-out rate, that may say something about its ability to finance elsewhere and whether there may be something of a credit risk associated with its name In some sense, if a firm is in the very lowest quadrant, it is hard to know whether it has no business at all to be financed or whether it simply has numerous internal sources of funding that are cheaper than what we provide them So, that is another element of interpretation on this chart  The next chart illustrates primary dealer performance in Desk outright transactions The horizontal axis again shows the percent of volume they actually do with us The vertical axis is in effect a pricing competitiveness index in which zero in this case is a snapshot of the yield curve before we operate The prices we then see may give us more yield than the yield curve or they may give us less yield Again, the lower left in this chart indicates poor performance, and obviously something more toward the upper right indicates a stronger performance from our point of view  The third and fourth charts show the dealer performance in Treasury auctions for bill and coupon issues respectively The horizontal axis measures awards in their name as a percent of total tenders accepted by the Treasury, and the vertical axis is a measure of their capital that both we and the SEC use We call it "liquid capital;" the SEC calls it "tentative net capital" This chart again shows, more or less, that the lower left reflects a weaker performance and the upper right a stronger performance I chose to show the information to the dealers in this form because it indicates that there is not a very strong positive correlation on capital That is, some dealers that have relatively low capital can compete rather effectively in underwriting the Treasury's debt Their ability to do so is not just a matter of capital    11/12/97  We have shown these charts to dealers in the last few weeks, but with only their own name indicated and 38 black dots depicting the other dealers The charts provide a rather powerful indication of the absolute and the relative performances of the individual dealers from where we sit I tried to calibrate my message to the dealers When I showed them this information, I was able to point to both 12-month data, which are depicted on these charts, and four-quarter data, quarter by quarter, because trends were quite important for some dealers I told the dealers that my goal was to improve median performance I wanted better performance on their part I was rather blunt with eleven dealers in saying that they were not doing much to meet our current business needs Of that eleven, I told four flat out that they were not meeting our business needs currently However, I proposed that we work together over the coming six months to enable them to describe to me their intended business strategy for meeting my business needs and to make an effort to do so I will meet with them again two quarters from now to review fourth-quarter and first-quarter data I warned them that if they took no initiative to describe to me how they intended to meet my business needs and could show no performance over this period, we would discuss at our next meeting in the spring whether they wished to announce the termination of their dealer relationship with us or whether they wanted me to announce it As I noted, four of the dealers heard that message Another seven heard a message that they were near that category I think they all understood it, and they all thought the process was reasonable Again, the pictures on these charts are rather stark, and the dealers did not have much to argue about in that sense  I wanted the Committee to be aware of this process that I am going through I think it is reasonable but, obviously, I am sharing it with you to solicit your views if you have any I want to emphasize the sensitivity of these data I have assured the dealers that I was not going to share it publicly, and I informed them that I did not want them to share it publicly I did not let them take copies with them, but I did let them take notes I did not want to read about it in the Wall Street Journal, and I am sure many of them did not want to either  Mr Chairman, we have no foreign exchange operations to report for this period I need the Committee's ratification of our domestic open market transactions Separately, I would like to seek a vote to increase our intermeeting leeway from $8 billion to $12 billion I would be happy to answer any questions on my report as well as on my memo about our desire to publish the standard deviation of the federal funds rate for each trading day    11/12/97   I completely agree with you It is a dilemma, and I think we are stuck  with that dilemma I personally would rather take a hard look with the Treasury on whether the  primary dealer system makes sense in terms of underwriting Treasury debt issuance The  Treasury still feels strongly, as it has for many years, that the existing system is important So,  they wish to retain it We are going to conduct our operations with someone, and until we can  get to the point where we do not publish a list of the firms we deal with, which is what I would  be happiest with, I think we are in a dilemma It is very expensive for us to maintain relations  with 38 institutions, some of whom are deadbeats from our perspective We could create a  two-tier system I would be happy to talk to the Committee about that It would involve our  ignoring a lot of firms that provide no value to us but that might continue to sit on our list  Unfortunately, that does not foster very good performance from anybody That is the nature of  the dilemma We get poor performance from everybody or a franchise value, which sets up the  dilemma   My colleagues and I have thought about that, and we have not come up  with a way that might be done directly I think there are assets that could be sold--   We would get better prices We would earn more for the US  taxpayer We would have more flexibility in our operations the more propositions we received  I very much hope to avoid the situation that we had in April when we had the large miss in  forecasting Treasury tax flows and an insufficient volume of propositions forced us to go back  into the market to purchase more securities I want to see a healthier volume of propositions so  we can have much more flexibility That is very important to me Frankly, we can operate more  efficiently overall if we get better information from the dealers and they execute our trades more  expeditiously Our costs should in some sense be covered by the value we produce as a trading  operation   No In this case, what I would like to see is movement of the median  volume line to the right and a cluster of dealer performance around the intersection of the two  medians Where the auction falls vis-a-vis the stop-out rate is really a matter of how much we  are doing because we want more propositions than we can use Forgive me for my analogy, but I  would like to see what Pete Rozelle always said he wanted for the NFL, that on any given  Sunday, any football team could beat any other football team I would like this money market  operation to be very competitive We should have every dealer bidding at a reasonable price,  and that would give us the greatest flexibility So, if we succeeded, we might move the median  volume line to between 2 and 3 percent or maybe all the way to 4 percent, with every one of 30  or 40 dealers getting a roughly equal share of volume Maybe it would be a 2-1/2 or 3 percent    11/12/97 13  share, and the pricing could be in a tighter cluster on that chart That is what I would be looking  for, and that is what I told the dealers   Out more than up is what I would expect   I referred earlier to the paper that we put out in February 1992 to  establish the current ground rules That paper indicated that the arrangements between us and  the dealers were business relationships and that we could terminate an individual arrangement if  no business relationship existed There are a lot of lawyers in the country, and anyone who can  find a lawyer can sue But I think that the dealers are on notice I don't want to say that any of  the dealers were happy with the message I was giving them, but as businessmen they understood  it because I was able to document it in black and white That is what I have been trying to do I  felt there was no way I could come down hard on them unless I could show them something  concrete As businessmen, I think they understood that I have been taking this degree of care to  minimize the risk you are referring to   I have been working very hard for a couple of years in every meeting I  have had with the primary dealers to remind them that ours is a business relationship and that we  want them to treat us as a valued customer I gave a speech about this business relationship to    11/12/97 14  the Bond Market Association in Phoenix in which I emphasized that they should treat us as a  valued customer, not as a mere regulator   A little, but it is a language they understand   Yes, I think that is right I do not want to put too fine a point on it, but  I think most people in the market understand that I don't think people have been making too  much of the shift in that spread I agree with you   I share your view about that We have developed this measurement for  slightly different purposes I find it very useful in talking to you about our operations, and I  think it may help you to judge what we are doing That's how I think of the standard deviation  As is illustrated in some of those charts, there will be days when the standard deviation is going  to be wide, and we can do nothing about it It is on days when perhaps we could and should do    11/12/97 16  something about it that I want to focus my attention The standard deviation does not tell me  anything automatically  For a long time, people in the market have asked us to publish the underlying data that  we get on trades in the federal funds market They want us to give them the actual data on how  many trades are done at each rate level I am very uncomfortable with that, and I think other  people in the market also would be uncomfortable if we started doing that The reason is that the  data might help market observers figure out who needed to do what volume They could then  determine at what rates the trades were done even if the names of market participants were not  attached to what we published I think the standard deviation data give the market a very good  sense of the volume done at various rates, and that matters to them in their effort to understand  trading activity So, the information on the standard deviation is intended to give the market  something that is helpful to them in return for the statistical information that they provide to us  I share your view on market volatility   I will respond to the second question first The Desk collected  profitability data from the dealers for a long time When I became Manager, I looked at that and  discontinued it What we were getting was apples and oranges and kumquats We had no  ability to insure that we were getting apples compared to apples from the dealers The dealers  were very unhappy with that decision, but I felt that we should not be putting our name behind  something where they had not done the work to develop standard accounting conventions I  viewed that as a very risky and potentially embarrassing situation for us   Yes, and I want to distinguish two sorts of information that we get  from the dealers From our conversations with the dealers, it is clear that there is some disparity  among the firms There are some firms that are doing rather well and others that are not What  also comes out in our conversations is that the nature of the underwriting process is changing  Many of the dealers understand this With the Treasury's use of Dutch auctions, they already  have been disintermediated in certain sectors and they feel it I think this is a profound issue that  the Treasury has to grapple with, and Don and I have been urging them to grapple with it  We have looked at individual firms, and we can see dramatic trends The  quarter-to-quarter data are very helpful for that There are some firms with very fine names  globally but whose performance as dealers has deteriorated markedly over the last 12 months  because of business decisions they have made These firms are profitable as global entities As I  have explained to all the dealers, we ask them to compete in the thinnest margined, most  competitive sector of global fixed-income markets It is a tough market, but that is the business I  am in I cannot change that    11/12/97   There are numerous efforts Bill McDonough might be able to say  more about his contacts in New York with the Securities Industry Association The Federal  Reserve has been talking about those issues in many ways with the securities industry generally  I have not singled out the dealer community because there are so many initiatives going on in  securities markets   Yes   On that issue, we are trying to work with the Securities Industry  Association and the Bond Market Association Again, we do not want to become their regulator  as primary dealers As securities firms, we are trying to make sure we are talking to them, but it  is a little awkward, qua primary dealer, to discuss the century date change issue with them   On the last page of my package, there is a list of our existing swap lines, a note on the Treasury's two swap lines, and the new maturity date if we go ahead with the normal renewal process This is the time of year I ask you for authority to begin that process, which involves a lot of exchanges of telexes and telephone calls over the next month I am asking for your approval to renew our existing swap lines, and I would note that that includes both the swap lines listed here and the North American Framework Agreement, which covers the use of our swap lines with Mexico and Canada in certain circumstances The two swap lines of those countries can be used separately It is a stand-alone framework in the event of trilateral drawings  Last year, we had a rather lengthy discussion of our swap line agreements We discussed the possibility that some of these swap lines might fade into the sunset once European Monetary Union proceeds apace At that time last year, the members of this Committee agreed that we would begin discussions with our colleagues at the other central banks in the spring of 1998, and we intend to do so I think that will be an uphill struggle given the relative priority that the ECB and the NCBs will place on this issue vis-a-vis other issues But your humble servants will begin that effort in the spring before we are back here again a year from now with this issue   Yes, humble!   Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to the package of colored charts, which you should find in front of you  On the first page are charts covering the same information we have shown in the past, but we have changed the source of the data for the current 3-month deposit rates Traders have persuaded me that the LIBOR fixing provides a better comparison than the Eurodollar series we have been using, so that is a slight change  Focusing first on US forward rates, there are two points to which I would draw your attention One is that there has been relatively little net change in these rates since the November meeting, as shown by the red lines, but clearly some compression has occurred as the money market yield curve has become increasingly flatter in the period since October I think  1 Copies of the charts used by Mr Fisher are appended to this transcript    12/16/97  the updrift in the solid line, the current dollar LIBOR, reflects a fairly typical year-end phenomenon I would not attach any significance to that  Looking at the German forward rates, Mr Tietmeyer said rather publicly on November 14 what other Bundesbank officials have been saying for some time, namely, that the market should not expect German rates to go up by 120 basis points between now and next May to meet Italian rates halfway, as the market had come to believe was going to happen In effect, Tietmeyer was saying that the German economy is stronger but not really all that strong You can see the gentle drift downward in German forward rates If you look at the solid blue line, the current mark LIBOR, it is quite interesting that the spike in early December parallels the spike in the yen LIBOR, shown in the chart below, at the time of heightened concerns about the Japanese premium Now, this is interesting for those of us in the money market business, as it were, because the calculations really are quite different In the British Bankers Association panel for the yen LIBOR fixing, there are eight Japanese banks, whereas in the panels for the dollar and the mark, there are only three and the calculation is done by throwing out the highs and the lows So, I think the spike in the German money market rates reflects the demand for funds from the Japanese banks It is not a reflection of the credit premium, as it were, from the demand side but a pushing through of the demand coming from the Japanese banks  Turning to the Japanese market, we need a little magnification of the bottom panel to see what is going on in Japan So, if you turn to the second page, I will work through some of the events in the Japanese markets Three rates are traced in the top panel the current yen LIBOR 3-month deposit fixing in dark purple, the 9-month forward 3-month yen deposit rate in orange-yellow, and the Japanese overnight call rate in green In the middle panel, we have plotted the excess reserves in the Japanese banking system I talked to Bank of Japan officials at some length about their calculation of this measure It is not quite how we would calculate it, but it is the way they do it The chart illustrates the heightened generosity that the Bank of Japan was practicing by leaving their market in considerable surplus following the closure of Yamaichi and subsequently in the last few days The bottom panel has two measures of the Japanese premium in dollar interest rates the solid line is the difference between the 1-month LIBOR rates at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and at Chase, and the dotted line is the Fuji rate minus the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi rate There was some modest differentiation among Japanese names at the height of the crisis, but clearly the dominant difference may be seen in the comparison between the best Japanese name and Chase as shown in this example    12/16/97  Going back to the top panel, I would like to draw out two points One is that in the last few days the Bank of Japan has pushed the overnight call rate down into the 20 basis point range A Bank of Japan official has told me that "you may call this a temporary easing" I took that to mean that the emphasis was on "you" because they were not going to call it that out loud quite yet But clearly, they have pushed the overnight call rate down The gap between the purple line showing the current LIBOR and the orange line does tend to indicate that the current premium is expected to wash out on the other side of the fiscal year That is, the high premium, high demand for funds coming out of the Japanese banks is thought by the market to be something that will wash out 9-months forward when we get happily to the other side of the Japanese fiscal year-end in March  Turning to the third page, I thought I would give a little background on events in East Asia I know Ted Truman will be speaking more about that The main purpose of these panels is to remind us that this is not just a bad thunderstorm but something more like the 100-year flood The top panel shows the exchange rate movements since July 1; the middle panel has percent changes in equity indices; and the bottom panel depicts 1-month interest rates Focusing on the currency panel, I think it's easy to say that the currencies have overshot their fundamental values But I think it's important to recognize that there is still a very large position overhang weighing on these exchange markets In effect, a leveraged convergence trade as we would have called it in Europe a few years ago, short dollar or yen external currencies and long internal currencies, was embedded on the balance sheets of businesses throughout the region, and they have not yet completed hedging those exposures In these thin markets, both bankers and traders have a very hard time thinking of these currencies as having overshot because they are aware of how much more there is yet to hedge that is weighing on the exchange rate  A second inference I would draw from this page is to note that the downward slope of the foreign exchange and equity values is somewhat steeper than the upward slope in the 1-month interest rates at the bottom Another point I would note is that so far Taiwan, the red line, has managed to distinguish itself In the top panel you can see that its currency has declined against the dollar only slightly more than the yen; and in the middle panel, you can see that their equity market has really broken out of the pack While looking at this chart overall, I think it is possible that we will look  back and see that the end-of-year effect for some of these currencies and values provided something of a nadir for them, given the risk aversion that is generally typical at this time of year But I think it would be risky to count on a bounceback after the New Year for all of them    12/16/97  Turning to the fourth page, I have depicted in the top panel both the March Eurodollar contract and the March fed funds futures contract as they have traded throughout the fall There is relatively little net change in both those series from just prior to the November meeting to today The middle panel shows the US Treasury constant maturity yields for 30, 10 and 2 years You can see that we have had a continued decline in bond yields in the 30- and 10-year areas, while the yield on the 2-year note has been more or less flat over that time horizon Clearly, this is something that is quite difficult to interpret I think that with the worsening of the Asian crisis, market participants have inferred that there will be no action at this meeting, and more of them have come to adopt the deflationist outlook or at least are taking it more seriously than they did some time ago While point estimates for inflation have moved down a bit, I think the better explanation is that market participants have shaved off the upside risk in the inflation probability distribution, that is, the risk that inflation will rise over the next six months That is what is tending to bring down the yield curve in combination with the flight-to-quality, end-of-year effect, making market participants more comfortable about moving their duration out the yield curve in this end-of-year environment  The last page of charts relates to our open market operations in this period The top panel covers daily fed funds trading the blue lines show the daily ranges, the vertical red lines show the standard deviations, and the horizontal red lines indicate the effective rates The panel at the bottom has the level of free reserves and indicates our daily misses from the projections I should point out that at the start of the middle period, which included Thanksgiving, we raised the allowance for excess reserves from $1 billion to $14 billion The demand for excess reserves clearly has been inching up I do not want to suggest that this is a precise science, but we are trying to get a handle on how much it has drifted up I think it will be some while before we are confident that we know where it has settled We had some volatility around the Thanksgiving holiday and the start of December As you can see, excess reserves averaged around $2 billion in that period, and we still had a slightly firm funds rate We may have slightly overcompensated at the beginning of the current maintenance period, but the market was quite tight Yesterday was a corporate tax payment date, and we tried to prepare the market for that  We purchased a total of $156 billion on an outright basis since the last FOMC meeting and a total of $172 billion since early November The total included a small amount of bills, $15 billion, and those purchases seemed to go quite well I was trying to leave something of a marker with the market and the Treasury--a notice that we were not forgetting about the bill sector, that we plan to come back to it In making these permanent    12/16/97  reserve injections, we did change our pattern of operations from last year A year ago, we left a larger need in the market, but we reverted to our traditional pattern this year by adding a large amount of permanent reserves That may put us in a position of having to drain reserves to a modest extent toward the end of January when the Christmas demand comes out of the market At that point, we also will be reaching rather low levels of operating balances, but I think we are ready to handle the effects of being on the drain side at what are likely to be new lows in operating balances  We had no foreign operations in this period Mr Chairman, I will need the Committee's ratification of our domestic operations, and I would be happy to answer any questions   They exist They are quite thinly traded, and I'm not sure how much  confidence people put in them, but they are there They are not the kind of market instruments  that one can click on a Reuters page and see   I think the problem is that we do not have a time horizon where one  ought to find fundamental value There is not enough confidence in markets that one would  want to have a contract with a maturity of that length That is a long duration exposure to take  on a currency that is declining so rapidly now   I don't know I have not heard that story   I think what we are seeing is the implosion of the intermediation  process in these exchange markets The exchange markets for the won and the baht have  disappeared There are not a lot of people who are excited about participating in those markets   We had been monitoring their trading exposure to us rather carefully  for many, many months We had an arrangement where if they needed to elevate their demand  for financing in our RP operations from the agreed routine amount, they would call Sandy  Krieger and give us some advance notice and information to enable us to understand their need  The process of getting a resignation letter from them was really a formality The lag can be  attributed to all the things they had to do other than type out a letter and send it to us, but I think  their management understood that was something they would have to do in the course of winding  up their affairs Was that helpful?   Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to a package of materials that you should have in front of you It begins with a one-page summary of my comments 1/  1/ Copies of the materials used by Mr Fisher are appended to the transcript (Appendix 1)    3/31/98  Going over the summary, the first point is that the short-term and forward interest rate curves for the G-3 countries remain relatively flat Second, I will be commenting that greed eclipses fear in asset markets, except in Japan My third point will be that the flat forward pricing of short-term interest rates reflects, in my view, a "clearing price" for divergent views about the direction of the Committee's next move, not a conviction about the likelihood of steady policy If I am right about that, then there is something of a problem Why hasn't the risk premium associated with this uncertainty been more evident in the Treasury yield curve? I offer two tentative answers to that One is that, in general, expanding risk appetites have consumed the uncertainty for the moment Secondly and more technically, reductions in Treasury supply both actual and anticipated, combined with the flat forward money market curve recently have been encouraging dealers to extend duration, and that has tended to flatten the Treasury yield curve Finally, I will discuss Desk preparations for the heavy tax inflows in April and May that will cause a sharp rise in the Treasury balance and lead once again to a need for much larger operations than normal  Turning to the charts on page 2 that show current, 3-month forward, and 9-month forward deposit rates, you can see that these rates remain relatively flat in all three charts Only in Germany, the blue lines, is there much of a spread between the current 3-month rate and the 9-month forward 3-month rate In the chart for the United States, the red lines, you will note see that forward rate expectations backed up following the Chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, but they have not backed up to the levels where they closed at the end of last year  Looking at the chart for German rates, you can see that there continues to be a wide spread between current and forward rates relative to the spreads for Japan and the United States That spread reflects the anticipation that the European Central Bank, when it comes into existence next January, probably will have a policy rate somewhere in the mid 3 percent range; 3-1/2 percent is what most people in the market expect The Bundesbank's current rate is 33 percent Even with that in the background, I think the German economy and the European economies more generally are perceived to be doing a bit better than they were earlier, and it is noteworthy that both Finland and Norway raised their rates So, if anything, the market has a sense of some upside risk to interest rates in Europe, even if the potential increase is very moderate  Finally, in the bottom chart you can see that Japanese deposit rates, both current and forward, declined in February and March This reflects some decline in the Japanese bank premium Unfortunately, this is not so much the result of an improvement in the credit standing of the individual institutions but rather, in my view, a reassertion of the convoy system and    3/31/98  the implicit government guarantee behind the major Japanese banks The Japanese government simply will not let those banks fail, and that has pulled some of the risk premium out of the forward rate market  With that rather muted monetary policy outlook in the G-3 countries, the charts on the next page suggest in my view how greed has eclipsed fear in a number of the asset markets In our written report, we detailed that phenomenon across a number of individual markets This is a quick summary  On the left side, we have equity indices re-indexed to July 1, 1997, and total return bond indices for the United States, Germany, and Japan The red lines show the equity indices trading up from a 100 value on July 1 and the blue lines indicate the total return on 10-year bond indices  On the right side, we have indexed the option implied volatility on equity and bond futures in the G-3 countries We plotted the price of an option and its implied volatility on each of the contracts, but they are indexed to place them on comparable terms, again with 100 on July 1, 1997 You can see that the upward shifts in volatility that occurred in October and November have been reversed, especially in US and German equity markets  Generally speaking, you can see that financial asset prices in the United States and Germany have been consistently rising since the November period and their volatilities consistently falling, although it is noteworthy that in the last few days there has been some uptick in the implied volatilities in both the United States and Germany  The bottom panel, of course, shows that Japan is quite a different story You can see the poor performance of the Nikkei, but it did rally early this year, and total returns on Japanese government bonds have improved The authorities were working quite hard over the last quarter to get the Nikkei to close at the 18,000 level, an effort that did not succeed On this index scale, 89 would be equal to the 18,000 level In Tokyo, they even invented a new term for this effort Traditionally, the market has referred to PKO, meaning price keeping operations, where public pension funds and the like are used to support equities In the last month or so, they have relabeled these PLO, price lifting operations As you can see, the Japanese authorities had their only success in early January, and since then they have succeeded only in lifting the level of volatilities, illustrated on the right  I did not chart the last few days With the failure of the Nikkei to close at the 18,000 level at Japan's fiscal year-end, the markets are quite anxious at this point The yen has been weakening a bit, reflecting something of a sense in the markets that the Japanese authorities are without a policy at this    3/31/98  point While we hear that one more package is coming, it is not clear that the package is going to do anything for the financial sector, and the markets are quite cynical about what is likely to happen  The next page provides another way of thinking about how risk appetites have been expanding I return to a table that I showed to the Committee last August in which I introduced the different philosophies of four characters in their search of a return in financial markets--the optimists and pessimists under the old paradigm and the new paradigm  The top half of this table is identical in form to the one that I presented to the Committee last August It shows the old paradigm pessimist who is worried about an imminent breakout of inflation and the old paradigm optimist who thinks inflation may be coming but the Fed may be able to delay it for a few quarters We have the new paradigm optimist who thinks the economy has entered a new era and he does not worry about inflation at all We have the new paradigm pessimist who thinks that deflation is upon us I introduced these four characters last August to help explain the volatility we were then experiencing in the markets, including intraday volatility, and these four characters were duking it out in the markets I reintroduce them here to show briefly how they would have fared to date  Had you run a portfolio consistent with the views of the old paradigm pessimist, shorting stocks and bonds as shown here at the bottom, you would have been crushed, to put it bluntly The new paradigm pessimist, who would have been short stocks and long bonds, would have done a little better, but his positive return in bonds would not have come close to offsetting his negative return in stocks  The two optimists would have done fairly well, obviously The point is, of course, that the pessimistic views, the skeptical views, have simply been priced out of this market and are not being reflected in the performance of the market If you were trying to manage money on the basis of those views, you were stopped out long ago  Turning to the next page, I depict in the top panel three different trajectories of the implied yields on the fed funds futures contracts The blue line shows these yield trajectories at the time of the August meeting, the green line in early January, and the red line as of last Friday My view, as I mentioned, is that the steady path of the fed funds rates implied by these contracts reflects a clearing price among divergent views regarding the direction of the Committee's next move  Forgive me if you saw it, but Friday's Wall Street Journal had a lovely item in it that summarized a recent poll of the 36 primary dealers It showed that none expects the Fed to change interest rates at this meeting    3/31/98  But the survey also revealed "that there is no clear consensus on the direction of the Fed's next policy shift" Sixteen dealers predicted a tightening, twelve an easing, seven saw the Fed on hold for at least the foreseeable future, and one said it was not possible to assess accurately what the Fed will do   With that degree of uncertainty, why isn't there more of a risk premium evident in the yield curve? I think, as I said, that expanding risk appetites associated with the bull market in financial assets have consumed the premium and therefore partially obscured it The charts showing the bond and equity market returns and the implied volatilities speak for themselves Around the middle of last week, both the implied volatilities on bonds and equities and the yield curve did begin to back up I certainly would have been a buyer of volatility at the low levels reached in the middle of last week  In my view, this backup in volatilities and in the yield curve probably reflects two things One is that the market is beginning to price in some uncertainty in recognition of the greater uncertainty about direction Secondly, the market may also be pricing in the very small probability that the Committee will act at this meeting, even though it still views a move as an extremely unlikely event When markets begin to get anxious, they sometimes price in a little of that anxiety That adjustment may come out of the market after the meeting if the Committee does not make any change The other kind of adjustment may be more enduring  Turning to the next chart, a second explanation that I mentioned is that the reductions in Treasury supply, both actual and anticipated, combined with a flat forward money market curve recently have been encouraging dealers to extend duration, tending to flatten the Treasury yield curve I hope you will bear with me while I explain this chart  At the last meeting, I showed the Committee a chart of the yield curve on a constant maturity basis as each of the on-the-run issues traded through the funds rate I noted that with numerous issues trading through the funds rate, many saw that as encouraging an expectation in the market that an easing move was coming But showing you only the yield curve relative to the fed funds target rate was an incomplete picture In pricing on-the-run Treasury issues, dealers are not significantly constrained by the level of the funds rate Rather, their cost of carrying on-the-run issues is reflected in the term-to-date repo rates    3/31/98  In the top panel, the red line indicates the 10-year on-the-run yield The bottom blue line is the term-to-date RP rate for the on-the-run 10-year maturity as it traded over the past year This rate is a declining maturity repo On the first day of a refunding cycle, it is a 90-day instrument; on the last day, it is a 1-day instrument So, it has a declining maturity as it moves across the chart  There are a number of factors that influence this rate, obviously One is the remaining term A second is the scarcity of a Treasury issue As we move through each auction cycle, the outstanding Treasury issues become more and more scarce The on-the-run issue is purchased by people who actually want to hold it, rather than just to trade it or to hedge with it So, as you come to each of the dotted vertical lines on the chart, you see a greater and greater scarcity value Of course, the term structure of the money market also affects this rate  The purpose of the top panel is to help you understand the bottom two panels by putting them in context On the left, you can see a snapshot of the entire yield curve and the term-to-date repo rates for the on-the-run issues as of the Friday before last March's meeting On the right, you see the same as of this past Friday Each of these dates is roughly in the middle of the auction cycles--the first-quarter refunding and the second-quarter refunding They are off by only a few days What you can see is that even though the yield curve has moved down, there is still a positive carry across the entire curve What you also can see is how much more attractive the carry is on the 10-year now relative to the short end than it was last year  The purpose of this rather complicated picture is to make two simple points First, to be clear, the marginal buyers and sellers of on-the-run Treasury securities are not significantly constrained by the funds rate itself but rather by the cost of financing, particular on-the-run issues in the repo market There, the rates are significantly affected by the supply and demand conditions for those particular issues and by the term structure of the money market  Second, at present the positive carry in the market is making it relatively more attractive for dealers to extend duration into the 10-year sector So, while real investors or nonleveraged investors are being drawn out along the yield curve in search of higher absolute returns, the dealers are being pulled to some extent into the 10-year sector in search of the carry These are not the only factors that affect the level of the yield curve by any means, but I think they are important ones for us to understand  Finally, turning to domestic operations on the last page, our operations over the last period have been detailed in our written reports, and I thought I would focus on the upcoming period Last May, Governor Rivlin chided    3/31/98  me and my colleagues for the $50 billion positive surprise in the Treasury balance relative to our projections That positive surprise reflected a positive Treasury income surprise I thought it might be helpful to review how we are doing so far this year and to anticipate the Desk's operations in April and May  At the top of the page, we have shown the forecasts and actual results for last year's first two quarters At the top left you can see the forecasts by the Treasury, the Board, and the New York staffs of first- quarter Treasury budget receipts The actual is shown in red and the percent errors of the three forecasts are indicated on the right side of that first box In the right side panel at the top, you can see the 7 to 10 percent misses in projected Treasury revenues for the first quarter that created the positive surprises of some $40 to $50 billion  The next two panels show how we are doing this year On the left are the forecasts for the first quarter by the Treasury, the Board, and the New York staffs and the preliminary actual outcome The Treasury's forecast was right on the money, and the Board and New York are doing a little better than last year in their forecasting In the right panel, you see the April-June forecasts We have a rather wide range of about $30 billion separating New York and Washington, with the Treasury right in the middle  The bottom picture translates this into our estimates of the daily Treasury balances at the Fed The latter rise sharply once the Treasury reaches the ceiling on its TT&L account capacity in the banking system The differences between the New York and the Board estimates, as I understand it, are not related to differences in nominal GDP forecasts but in some of the nuances of tax collection We do have a bit of a gap here, but the estimates bracket last year's actual Treasury balances, the dotted green line  I want to offer this as background to help you understand that in the coming weeks we are likely to be changing some of the normal aspects of our operations--not permanently, but to deal with this situation First, we are likely to conduct another coupon pass in the next couple of weeks for $5 to $7 billion to lay a bit more of a reserve base  Secondly, when the need for reserves starts to rise sharply, we are likely to want to enter the market quite early in the morning, 800 or 830 am, so that we can insure that we get sufficient propositions from the dealers to cover our needs On those occasions, we are likely both to announce the day before that we will be coming into the market at, say, 830 am the following morning, and we would plan to conduct two operations that day We would do one in quantity, on the order of $10 or $20 billion, and come    3/31/98  back later in the day to fine-tune the total I certainly hope that the fine-tuning operation is going to be in the same direction as the morning's operation There is some risk it might not be, that we would be adding reserves in the morning and draining reserves later in the day If we did that, I would certainly hope that we would be doing them in different maturities We might have met our basic reserve objective for a week or so in a big operation in the morning and then have to fine-tune it later in the day with an overnight drain I hope that does not happen, but that is a possibility we have to bear in mind if the reserve needs expand to levels close to either the New York or the Board estimate Both estimates indicate the need for quite sharp reserve growth, and how quickly we will have to expand the scope of our operations will depend on how soon that need arises  Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations to report for this period I have provided the Committee with annual reports on both our domestic open market operations and our operations in foreign currencies I will need the Committee's ratification of the Desk's domestic operations during the intermeeting period; they are detailed in our written reports I would be happy to answer any questions   I'm afraid I don't have that number at my fingertips It's on the order  of a $30 billion surplus for this quarter   Yes   I wish I knew the answer to that question I certainly share your  assessment When I said "no policy," I want to be clear that I was referring to the market  looking, seeing, and feeling that nobody was home There is the LDP; there is the cabinet; there  are the members of the Diet; there are the agencies; these are the different decision-making  poles I think the perception in the market is that they do not seem to be talking to each other,  which is what I am implying by no policy There is no center of gravity being provided, and that  is what I was focusing on On the question of whether this matters, how otherwise sensible  people--    3/31/98   I think the counterparties of the major Japanese banks are looking,  unfortunately, at the implicit Japanese government guarantee that appears to have been  reaffirmed I don't think they are trading on the basis of the capital adequacy numbers when  they are trading with Japanese institutions   It has come down to under 20 basis points   Oh, it is still positive; we can still see it   I don't think I need to I think you've said it very well   I don't think the Street's focus on that hypothesis would be at the short  end of the coupon curve, but if there were an anticipation of an easing move, the Street would  talk about expecting a rally further out on the yield curve In January, in fact, we observed what  I was talking about in the chart that I showed at the last meeting As I said then, I think the  market was responding to recent speeches by the Chairman and Governor Meyer, which were  interpreted as indicating an increased likelihood of an easing action That is when the short end  of the coupon curve traded through the funds rate I do not dispute that what you have described  can happen and the Street does talk about it that way, but what was happening in January was the  other scenario   Absolutely! I put in last year's actuals to show that the range of  misses was 7 to 10 percent That had a huge impact in dollar terms But I was also offering that  experience to provide some scale of the forecasting errors involving big numbers If we could  get Desk operations to have misses of only 10 percent over a 24-hour horizon, we would be  doing awesomely well   Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to the package of color charts that should be on the table before you1/ The first page shows the 3-month deposit rates including the current Libor, the 3-month forward, and the 9-month forward rates  Looking at the US panel, you can see that there has been little net change in these forward rates since your last meeting on March 31, but there has been a  1/ Copies of the charts used by Mr Fisher are appended to the transcript (Appendix 1)    5/19/98  very modest uptrend since the nonfarm payroll release on April 3, when forward expectations troughed So, we have seen a gently rising trend since early April, with a punctuation mark associated with the April 27 Wall Street Journal story  Looking at the panel for Germany, you can see that forward rates had been drifting up at the time of your last meeting and they did not stabilize until after the EU summit on May 1-3 at which the president and the board of the European Central Bank were selected That pattern is contrary to the expectations of many observers in the market I think the earlier updrift was the consequence of the same factors that I have been talking about for some months These include the perception of slightly stronger-than-anticipated growth in the German and other European economies that has been viewed as leading to a slightly higher probability that the Bundesbank might raise rates before year-end or that the ECB might establish a slightly higher opening rate next January than previously had been assumed  The Japanese rates are shown in the bottom panel You can see that the announcement of the stimulus package on April 9 and the foreign exchange intervention on April 9 and 10 had little impact on the forward rates, with the 9-month forward 3-month rate not moving at all on the announcement I think that is worthy of note However, on May 7 Deputy Governor Yamaguchi of the Bank of Japan commented that he saw more positive than negative effects from a rate reduction, and forward rates moved down a bit following his remarks  Turning to the next page, I hope the Committee will find it worthwhile to bear with me while I try to go through some of the different components and ways of thinking about the Japan premium I think this explanation might be helpful now I will first go over the mechanics of the top three charts, and then discuss some issues and problems that come up Let me say in advance that I am presenting this to show you how skeptical I am that we really understand the Japan premium phenomenon  The first panel shows a measure of the premium in dollar terms It is expressed as the spread between the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi's 1-month Libor rate and Barclay's 1-month Libor rate You can see that during the first quarter of the year, from the start of the year to the end of the Japanese fiscal year which also was the date of your last meeting, the premium averaged around 20 basis points, though it moved around a bit That is the measure of the premium that most people were talking about Since the end of Japan's fiscal year, it has moved down into the 9 to 10 basis point range  The second panel with the green line is a crude, but I think still useful, measure of the premium in yen terms, which is expressed as the spread between 1-month Tibor and 1-month Libor Tibor is the Tokyo interbank offer rate; Libor is the London rate The Tokyo panel is made up almost exclusively of    5/19/98  Japanese banks If you threw out the high and the low in that panel, you probably would eliminate the 1 or 2 western banks that are in it, so it would become an exclusively Japanese panel Libor is overwhelmingly non-Japanese If you threw out more of the highs and the lows, you would end up throwing out all the Japanese names that usually operate in Libor You would end up with a measure of 1-month yen funding comprised mainly of non-Japanese banks in London and Japanese banks in Tokyo That spread is important to underscore because it gives you a sense of the premium for the best Japanese names It covers only the banks that everyone thinks are implicitly guaranteed by the government, not the smaller more anonymous banks  The left-hand scale of the third panel measures the asset side of the Bank of Japan's balance sheet The shaded blue area depicts the growth of assets The right-hand scale refers to interest rates The blue line is the overnight call rate; it recently has been mostly below the solid black line, which is the official discount rate  Let me now go back over some of the issues that come up First, it is worth noting that both the dollar and the yen premiums have come down quite a bit in recent days It is quite noticeable that the dollar measure still indicates a premium in the 9 to 10 basis point range One might ask whether this premium should be arbitraged out; it ought to be an easy thing to arbitrage away But, of course, an investor would have to take on the credit risk implicit in doing business with Japanese names What interests me is that when I talk to bankers, many of them will tell me very frankly that their credit lines to their Japanese counterparties are completely full That is, their traders are taking maximum advantage of trying to capture this premium and arbitrage it But the bank credit departments are now in charge on an individual trade-by-trade basis, and they are up against their limits With that in mind, I find it quite impressive that the spread is still only 9 to 10 basis points--that even with greed restrained by credit departments, the spread is still in that neighborhood  If you look at the yen measure, you can see that the premium has been squeezed down to 1 or 2 basis points at present I believe it is important for us to ask whether we are looking at a single phenomenon that we can measure consistently from last fall When we talk to Bank of Japan officials, they point to what they call the twin peaks of the premium--one prior to the calendar year- end and the other prior to the fiscal year-end They view the premium principally as a liquidity risk, not as a credit risk I would note, however, that the first peak occurred in late November when we began to see closures of Japanese financial institutions, bringing to mind a larger question of credit risk Also, given the dubious quality of assets on the balance sheets of Japanese banks, this does not seem to be a very useful time to be drawing a fine distinction between liquidity and credit risks A Japanese bank that cannot fund itself is really a credit risk to me if I am a market counterparty    5/19/98  The third panel shows the growth in the Bank of Japan's assets In our conversations, Bank of Japan officials explained what they were trying to accomplish when they were aggressively expanding their balance sheet around calendar year-end and fiscal year-end By doing so through 1-month repos, they wanted to provide the market with a sense of confidence by injecting liquidity for a relatively long period The growth of the asset side of their balance sheet depicted that They are rather defensive about the low growth on the liability side of their balance sheet because they say that various measures they have been publishing for a long time are misleading They actually have been draining reserves at times by issuing their own bills That is, they issue their own liability on one side as a Bank of Japan bill, but they also drain reserves That is a swap on the liability side and not really growth in the balance sheet In any case, these transactions have not given me much confidence  I will offer you my own interpretation, my words not theirs It seems to me that for the last six or seven months, they have been doing something of an "operation twist" at the very short end of their yield curve They have been intervening in the 1-month interest rate area, pushing money out Then, because they target the call rate and try to keep it in the neighborhood of the overnight discount rate, they have been draining funds out of the shorter end-- overnight and for two or three days at a time--against the backdrop of the overall expansion of their balance sheet That leads me to the tentative conclusion that when I look at the yen funding premium, I am not measuring a single consistent phenomenon expressed on the demand side That's because, overall, there has been a net increase on the supply side of the money market But at the margin, it makes me even more nervous to think that they really have been price-targeting the 1-month interest rate to push it down while draining funds out overnight to try to keep the overnight call rate close to the overnight discount rate If I am right about that, then interpreting the premium is even more complicated than I thought I believe the risks of a sudden backup going forward, if there is bad news, are even greater  The bottom panel is a place holder to show you widening corporate spreads, expressed in some Moody's indices that we found, over comparable Japanese government securities I think this panel is interesting for three reasons First, many people talk about the fact that they cannot find deteriorating credit spreads in markets in Japan They suggest that Japanese markets do not work that way, that they are not Western, but we can see the deterioration quite clearly in this chart Secondly, these widening spreads are those of the banks' customers, and things are getting worse and worse for them Finally, I think it is a useful reminder that we are approaching the Japanese bankruptcy season The bankruptcies do not actually occur at the end of the fiscal year; they take place later when the fiscal year results have to be made public Much the same thing happened in November of last year when we began seeing reports of    5/19/98 5  bankruptcies relating to results in the fiscal half year that ended September 30, 1997  Turning to the next page, let me briefly note some of the dollar's movements You can see in the top panel that the Japanese government stimulus package did little to improve market sentiment toward the yen, and perhaps the kindest thing one can say about the of intervention they carried out on April 9 and 10 is that it had only a transitory effect on the exchange rate Over the last month, many market participants have been full of brave talk about dollar/yen going to 150 and 160 When we ask them why it is not there already, they express a strong conviction but they do not make a very persuasive case Even so, since the close of the G-8 summit this weekend and the absence of compelling talk about intervention, the yen has been weakening against the dollar for the last two days, bumping up through what the market thought was the very significant 135 level  On the mark side, for all the fireworks involving the personalities at the EMU summit on May 1-3, I think one should not ignore that the summit did make a certainty out of EMU when previously there was at least a one-in-a- hundred chance that the process would be delayed or derailed The removal of that uncertainty has made the mark rather more significant as the predecessor of the euro We can see some slight firming of the mark But overall, except for the slight uptrend of the dollar against the yen since February 1, what impresses me about this panel is how very little has happened to the dollar in 1998 We have had shifting expectations regarding Committee policy, sharp fluctuations in equity markets, crises in Southeast Asia and in the world's second largest economy, and an historic monetary union in Europe Taking a step back, this panel suggests to me that the dollar has been out on a Sunday stroll  In the bottom panel, you can see that Treasury yields have tracked the movements in short-term expectations shown in the upper panel of the first page of these charts These yields have changed very little on net since the date of your last meeting, but there has been a gentle uptick since the nonfarm payroll release on April 3 I have talked to a number of traders and speculators who complain rather loudly that there is not enough volatility in this market for them to make money  Let me turn to our open market operations on the next page and give you an update on the tax inflows in April and May In the top panel, you can see that the Board and New York staff forecasts for second-quarter receipts converged at the higher level, closer to the New York numbers In the chart below, you can see that this did not help New York very much in forecasting the daily reserve levels As the red line shows, the actual balance came in much closer to the Board's estimate than to New York's, which is a good lesson in the difficulties of making daily forecasts    5/19/98  The first reason for this is that receipts did not come in as strong or as early as the staff in New York was forecasting This is indicated in the first notation line at the bottom of the page The first row of numbers, which shows total actual Treasury balances less the New York forecast, indicates how far the actuals came in below our daily forecasts, particularly early on But the gap narrowed quite a bit as we got into late April and early May  The second reason why it was so difficult to forecast the day number is that on April 17 the Treasury announced some changes to the TT&L program that were designed to make it more attractive to banks While we had been working with them on this and are very supportive of these changes, the timing of their announcement frankly took us, the market, and the Treasury's own forecasters by surprise As you can see, the notations in the bottom row show how much this affected our own day numbers by indicating the extent to which the TT&L accounts were holding higher balances than we were forecasting, meaning lower balances at the Reserve Banks  The next page shows various indicators of trading activity in the fed funds market since your last meeting The vertical blue lines are the daily ranges of the federal funds rates; the horizontal red lines or ticks are the effective averages for each trading day, and the vertical red lines each represent one standard deviation of trading around the daily effective rates The increase in TT&L balances at major banks may have been one of the factors contributing to the softness in the funds market in the middle two maintenance periods; the increase substantially reduced rather suddenly the purchasing needs of some of the major banks that often are active in the morning More importantly, demand for excess reserves appears to have shifted lower, particularly during the April 22 and May 6 maintenance periods, a development that we do not yet fully understand Moreover, banks apparently were able to use positive carry- ins from the April 22 period into the May 6 period to a much greater extent than we previously viewed as the norm That may be the result of little more than a random distributive effect or it may be something more profound; we do not yet know  The softness in the funds market in the May 6 period, I think in looking back, reflected a combination of this apparent shift in demand for excess reserves and our desire to remain symmetric with respect to the risks on each day To put this somewhat more precisely, even as we became aware that bank demand for excess reserves was lower than we had expected, we were reluctant to pare back the cumulatively higher excess reserves because to have done so would have required aiming for quite a low daily excess number Moreover, this would have occurred at a time when the absolutely high level of Treasury balances at the Fed meant that a small percentage point miss in the Treasury balance estimate could have completely drained the funds market and left us with a very negative day number and a big surprise on the upside However, based on this experience, we revised down our assumption about period    5/19/98  average excess reserves by $200 million to $12 billion I think excess reserves are going be very much a moving target for us  Finally, we had no foreign exchange operations to report for this period I will need the Committee's ratification of our domestic open market operations I have distributed to the Committee a memorandum on proposed changes to the securities lending program I am not seeking a Committee vote at this time, but I would like to share the details of these proposals with the primary dealers and I did not want to do so without giving Committee members an opportunity to react first I would be happy to answer questions about my report, our operations, or the securities lending memorandum Thank you   Noon is rather late in the cycle of daily trading and clearing in the  market The book entry side of the wire closes at 300 pm We want to try to provide some  elasticity to both the trading and the clearance functions of most major firms A noon auction  would enable them to get their results around 1230 pm, and that is already a little late in the day  How we would respond in a period of acute stress is, I think, a good question I would emphasize  that if the market knew securities were to be auctioned at noon and they could look forward to  relying on that auction on days of some stress, that might help to comfort them Beyond that we  have considered two possible approaches One might be to announce early in the morning a change  in the limits for the noon auction, which might provide some additional comfort I would begin by  using that device in a period of particular stress Another possible approach would be to hold the  auction earlier in the morning in such circumstances    5/19/98  In terms of selecting a routine time, however, we are trying to pick a slot that is in  between our operations, Treasury auctions, and other noise in the markets As a routine matter,  noon seemed about as good a bet as we could find, but we would have to remain flexible in  thinking about the timing of our auction if we were responding to a particularly acute problem   Obviously, if we state the problem in the extreme form of market  failure, it is hard to point to a market failure What I would emphasize is that we rely on the very  smooth operation of this market because it is the vehicle for our principal policy tool I think that is  why, in looking back through years and years of memoranda and reports on this issue, we see a  consistent concern from the Fed's point of view about making this market work efficiently A  number of central banks do not rely as much as we do, almost exclusively, on our own government  debt to comprise the asset side of our balance sheet We are the "hog" of the government securities  market We hold about a third of the bill issues and a rather significant portion of the longer-term  obligations--10, 15, 20 percent of individual issues as we move along the yield curve So, it is in  our interest to make this market function as smoothly as possible The market certainly views us as    5/19/98  a large holder of these instruments The initial System securities lending program in the late 1960s  was established in response to the request of the dealers, and our proposed revision is also a  response to the dealers who claim that the existing program no longer works We are in a period of  declining debt issuance by the Treasury, and the stresses in the market feel particularly acute All  that said, I think it is very important to emphasize how much on the margin of the market we  should try to position our program We will be a very small part of the securities lending market  even at the higher proposed limits--our share will be a single digit percentage There is a vast  securities lending market that we think works well The question is whether we are part of the  problems that exist and whether we should be part of the solution to getting more efficient clearing   I would prefer that we be predictable and transparent in the rules  under which we operate We thought long and hard about trying to design a more discretionary  program where we would just respond to dealer needs But that began to feel more like  intervention in the "specials" market It was very hard to see how we could get comfortable if we  established rules of the road that involved decisions about whether to make securities available for  lending today or some other day It seemed most effective and most efficient and most transparent  to say, here is what a dealer is able to do every business day of the year In acute circumstances,  we could change some limits if there were to be, say, another Drexel Burnham But normally, we  will try to be transparent, predictable, rule-based, and let the market come to us through a price  mechanism    5/19/98   We have been in the business of lending securities on a daily basis for  30 years   We get requests every day, which essentially end up being rationed on  a first-come, first-served basis and very small amounts being lent with great awkwardness The last  time I spoke to the Committee about this, I indicated how uncomfortable I was with our rule of  lending only to dealers who were not short It is a nice idea, but we just cannot enforce it I do not  even have a fig leaf of protection here   I admit that I am stuck We have been in the business of lending  securities for a long time, and we would have a problem if we tried to get out of it now I think the  dealers and the Treasury would raise a hackle   I'm proposing going principally to a price constraint with some  quantitative limits One reason I want to have a concrete proposal to show the dealers is that I  anticipate a spectrum of opinions There are some who will think this proposed program is great,  but others will say that it is not a good idea and that it will jeopardize the securities lending  business We want to hear about that so we can see if there is anything we can do to address  legitimate concerns I think this is the best way to approach a new program I want to underscore    5/19/98  that on both the quantity limits--the totals per dealer and per issue--and on the 150 basis point  spread, I think we are going to learn from experience and we will adjust going forward The  quantity limits and the spread may be too high or too low to enable us to adhere to the principle of  operating only on the margin of this market The Treasury is also very interested in making sure  that we keep our securities lending operations on the margin and that we do not become too  important a part of that market We are going to have to watch that very carefully   Yes, they are comfortable They support, as I said, our going forward  There is some delicacy in that it is our program and not theirs This function is right on the edge of  both open market operations and debt policy They see some risk that while we could generate  additional revenues from the new program, of which they are the ultimate beneficiaries, we might  squeeze out more of any market price premium than we generate in added revenues I don't think  that's likely to happen, but it is something we and they will be watching   Yes, that is another feature I did not mention You can see that in  their balance sheet I don't have the figures in front of me, and I'm not sure it is an overwhelming  number But, yes, there has been a certain amount of credit substitution that the Bank of Japan has    5/19/98  arranged largely by issuing its own bills while it has added reserves principally by taking in private  paper as well as government securities I should not say "principally by taking in private paper"  They have been taking in a fair amount of such paper in addition to Japanese government bonds  So, they have ended up with more customer or bank paper on their balance sheet and have put out  their own credit into the market A number of traders in Tokyo have noted that it seemed to them  that the Bank of Japan was caught in a dilemma Having taken in private paper, if they disgorge it  now, very strange things may happen to the prices and yields that private entities in Japan get on  such paper   I don't have any evidence of this other than anecdotes in the market,  but the impression in the market is that the private paper the Bank of Japan is taking in is not of the    5/19/98  top 18 banks but of the lower tiers As I see it, this makes it a slightly bigger problem The Bank  of Japan may have an implicit guarantee for the whole financial sector We may yet get a financial  shock there, but I think it is more likely to come from the hinterlands, as it were   As I understand it, it is a mix of both It is similar to what we take in  at the discount window   That's an interesting way of putting it!   Yes, they are taking in some   The collateral is the private paper It is like our discount window If  we take in a "Trump" note from a bank, our collateral is--   I think Cathy Minehan is pointing to a real problem, Mr Chairman  At the margin, that is the direction I'm not sure one would assert that the Bank of Japan is now the    5/19/98  bad bank for the banking system, but as people now talk about it in Tokyo the marginal change  seems to be in that direction That is what I am reporting   Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to the package of color charts, which should be on the table in front of you 1/  The first page as usual shows the 3-month deposit rates current, 3-month forward, and 9-month forward Since your last meeting, there have been small but noteworthy changes in interest rate expectations In the United States, the top panel in red, you can see that the 9-month forward 3-month rate has slipped below the current 3-month rate Even though this negative gap is small--a dozen basis points or so--it is the widest on the chart since the January period I think it reflects a growing chorus of voices in the market, particularly in the last 10 days, who are increasingly confident that the Committee's next move will be an easing action  In the middle panel, as you can see, the German 9-month forward 3-month rate also has crept a little lower in recent weeks I think it still reflects the anticipation of an increase in European rates sometime over the coming months I believe it is particularly noteworthy that the 9-month forward 3-month rate is actually trading around levels just above 38 percent where most people just a month ago were expecting the European Central Bank's 1-month policy rate to be set next January So, that reflects quite a reduction in expectations over the last couple of months  1/ Copies of the charts used by Mr Fisher are appended to the transcript (See Appendix)    8/18/98  In the bottom panel in green, you can see that both the 3- and 9-month forward 3-month rates in Japan dropped distinctly below the current 3-month rate following the selection of the new LDP leadership team, but those rates recently have bounced back up a bit  As I look at the last 14 months of interest rate expectations in the leading industrial nations, two things strike me First, the current trepidation in global capital markets is not a consequence of the perception that the leading central banks are about to do anything There is no such expectation Secondly, it strikes me how far markets have come over the last 12 months in giving weight to the risks of deflation, however they imagine them to be A year ago at your August meeting, I introduced my four characters in pursuit of a return, the old and the new paradigm pessimists and optimists At the time I introduced the new paradigm pessimist who was anxious about deflation and global capacity glut leading to competitive devaluations, I think only Governor Kelley had a kind word to say about the new paradigm pessimist who he thought should not be overlooked   Today, at least as the market sees it, the nation with the second largest economy in the world, Japan, and the nation with the largest share of the world's potential labor supply, China, are both experiencing distinctly falling prices Moreover, the premier of China is no longer worrying about maintaining the pace of  investment in order to prevent inflationary bottlenecks Instead, he is now talking about how China is trying to invest its way out of deflation It is this context that I think we should keep in mind in our effort to understand how the markets are looking at the question of whether China will devalue its currency I think that implicitly this question is seen, rightly or wrongly, as representing something of a turning point for the markets--from a world they are familiar with to one they are less familiar with, that is, a deflationary world  Turning to the second page of charts, on the left side are three panels showing foreign equity prices, German and US equity prices, and German and US 10- year yields over the period from last July to the present On the right hand side are three panels depicting the same market movements since the beginning of July this year Markets have gotten a little ahead of me since I prepared this chart, but let me focus on the right hand side first and make a point I think we can see in retrospect that the combination of the Chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony this July and Mr Obuchi's selection to lead the LDP were turning points for global market expectations Now, I want to be very clear In both cases, the outcomes were as the market expected but not as the market hoped Market participants were engaging, I believe, in some wishful thinking, hoping to be pleasantly surprised    8/18/98  With respect to the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, the market was hoping that the Chairman would say something rather kind and benevolent Instead, they heard him say exactly what he said in June at his JEC testimony, namely that he was more concerned about the risks of inflation than those of deflation, and they heard him testify with what might be characterized as a "make no mistake about it" delivery With respect to the selection of the LDP leadership and the new Japanese government, again the market was hoping to be pleasantly surprised, thinking that perhaps the Japanese could find their own FDR So far, it does not appear that they have Thus, looking back, I think the market's two self-generated disappointments can be seen as the last sneezes on which the start of the recent equity market declines might be blamed  I do not have charts depicting some of the market movements in the last two days that reflect the Russian devaluation Let me just note that on Friday both the German bund market and our Treasury market experienced some extraordinary inflows There is still a flight to quality into both core Europe and the United States The details are still coming out for the Russian devaluation and debt restructuring announced yesterday Market assessments are that the Russian program is better, at least insofar as can be judged in the first day or so, than they might have feared However, I think there is also a great deal of anxiety about how trades will be settled, and this is causing considerable market commotion The ruble was fixed today at 68 to the dollar, but it is trading around 7, at least in the interbank market But according to the reports that we have, the ruble is already trading around 9 in the black market I do not pretend to understand, and therefore I am not comfortable explaining, how it is that the Dow thinks this is great news while the Bolsa and other emerging equity markets think it is bad news I think we will have to wait a few days to see how this plays out  I would note that the devaluation of the Thai baht had looked pretty good on day 2 also I think we have quite a few risks ahead of us particularly in the days ahead when the collateral that has underpinned much of the leverage in the Russian financial markets starts to be liquidated as counterparties figure out what trades are being settled and what trades are not There is still a great deal of uncertainty there, but I cannot pretend to be up to the minute on these developments  Turning to the third page, you will see three different charts that depict changes in dollar exchange rates since July 1997 In the top panel dollar exchange rates, indexed to last July, are shown against a number of currencies as well as the Bank of England's trade-weighted dollar In the middle panel dollar movements are shown against the yen and the mark The changes are comparably scaled in the middle panel That is, given percentage changes for dollar/mark and dollar/yen are the same on the chart and permit a comparison of how the dollar has moved against the yen vis-a-vis its movements against the mark The bottom panel, again comparably scaled, shows the movements of the yen against the mark since the beginning of July 1997    8/18/98  Given the dollar's movements indicated in the top panel, my point, Mr Chairman, is that we are quite fortunate in my view that the world is not talking about too strong a dollar but rather is focusing its attention on too weak a yen There are some reasons for our good fortune Not the least is the fact that policy inertia is most evident in Japan and that the yen is weak against both the dollar and the mark, as you can see in the bottom panels The fact that the yen is weak against both currencies has translated into a remarkably stable dollar-European currencies relationship over the last year and a half as evidenced by the green line in the middle panel for dollar/mark As I noted a moment ago, investments both in the last few days and over the last few months have been pouring out of emerging markets into core markets This flight to quality is what has made our 30-year yields so low and has reduced German 10-year yields to below 4-1/2 percent Because Europeans historically have been the loudest to complain about too strong or too weak a dollar, I think the relative stability of dollar/mark is obscuring the public's appreciation of the dollar's strength against a lot of other currencies For example, we passed through new highs against the Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar  Another way to think about the strength of the dollar is to look at how stable the dollar/mark relationship has been and to realize that we are in the middle of the period in which, as I would have expected and we hear anecdotally, there are significant flows into Europe in anticipation of the creation of the euro Those flows are not going to occur in January after the euro is a fact, but people are trying to position themselves in anticipation of its creation Again, with bund yields at 41/2 percent, we see that the bund seems to be the happy place to invest in anticipation of a successful launch of the euro and also to hedge against its failure  Turning to the fourth page of charts, you can see in the top panel the September Eurodollar futures contract as it has traded from May to the present and the November fed funds futures contract I want to make two points here First, you can see the slight decline in yields in the last few days as expectations of an ease in policy, not immediately but in the future, have come into the market What I think is much more noticeable in the top panel is how flat and boring these movements have become since your July meeting compared with what they were earlier in the spring There is much less a sense of "push me/pull you" in the interest rate markets and expectations have gone very flat without a lot of rate movement  The bottom two panels show something that I depicted several meetings ago, which is the positive carry of on-the-run Treasury issues The on-the-run Treasury yields are shown in the red dots and the blue dots represent the term-to-date financing for each of the on-the-run issues The gap between the two gives some sense of the positive carry that the dealer community and leverage participants are still experiencing in pricing on-the-run Treasury issues I want to make clear that the general collateral rate that applies to most Treasury securities is still close to the funds rate, and therefore there is not as much positive carry for most off-the-run    8/18/98  issues However, the price discovery process is dictated by the on-the-run issues where there is depth, liquidity, and trading volume Even as the yield curve has been squeezed to below the funds rate, you still can see the very modest positive carry in the on the-run issues  Turning to open market operations on the next page, activity in the federal funds market has been mostly uneventful since your last meeting Funds traded at very elevated rates on one day when wire transfer problems bottled up a very large amount of funds at a major money center bank That bank sold funds in the market after the wire was extended Given the very firm rates we saw around the turn from June to July, we tried to anticipate similar pressures at the latest month-end turn from July to August, and we laid in some repos in advance We seem to have succeeded more or less in calming the market in this case Yesterday, we had quite an elevated funds rate, which is not depicted in this chart August 14, the last date shown in the chart, was on Friday, and the somewhat higher range of trading on that day occurred in anticipation of market pressures associated with the settlement of the Treasury's refunding yesterday There was in fact a great deal of pressure in the market yesterday, but that seems to be behind us We made an outright purchase of $1 billion of securities on August 3, and we will be looking for opportunities to make additional permanent injections of reserves in the coming days  One final point, Mr Chairman On the last page of my handout is a list of primary dealers A number of Committee members and others in the System have asked me how many dealers there are You need a scorecard to know the players at present In the top half of the page, you can see the 26 dealers whose status has not changed in the last year On the left side of the bottom half of the page, you can see the list of dealers 27 through 39 as of August 1997 At the bottom, you can see the three withdrawals that have occurred since then Yamaichi, Eastbridge, and Sanwa Sanwa was the most recent firm to withdraw from dealer status They were aware that we thought of them as one of our weaker counterparties, but their decision to close their operations was unlike that of Yamaichi and Eastbridge It was not forced on them by the market or other events but reflected a business judgment on their part A dealer operation was not in the mix of activities that they thought would be profitable for them in New York  In the middle column for August 1998, we have listed the mergers that have been effected to date On the right side, you can see that we expect a couple more mergers to take place and have two pending applications for dealer status I want to make clear that we do not have the "aspiring dealer" category, but it still takes some time to work things out with a firm that has approached us to become a dealer  Mr Chairman, we did not conduct any foreign exchange intervention operations during the intermeeting period I will need the Committee's ratification of the Desk's domestic open market operations, and I will be happy to answer any questions    8/18/98   The right answer is that I do not know   It is the only correct answer that I am able to give I think the most  important point is to be very skeptical about the interbank fixing at 68 or 7 rubles to the dollar It is  best to assume that that is a number that someone in the central bank or a couple of banks have  decided to post on the screen I don't know whether there is any volume behind it at all   By definition, we don't know how to measure that We don't even know  whether the black market is experiencing a deep day or a thin day   Yes I'm afraid I cannot help you there, Mr Chairman   That is not an easy question!   I don't think the world or market participants disagree with your  analysis I believe the dominant view is that the yen will grind lower from its current level That  is the market consensus forecast for exactly the reasons you described Now, the market has  gotten itself into a bit of a loop by becoming persuaded that a depreciating yen will force the  devaluation of the Chinese yuan I don't think that follows from a macroeconomic perspective It  is the absence of Japanese demand that is affecting the rest of Asia, not the behavior of the yen per  se, even if that makes things worse But there is a deeply imbedded expectation in the market that  further yen weakness will lead to a devaluation of the yuan and the Hong Kong dollar That is  where the market gets itself into a tizzy and thinks that such an outcome will be the end of the  world as they know it I am impressed by the number of unabashed dollar bulls I talk to who say  that if the Japanese do the right things, if they suddenly find their FDR and start to clean up their  banking sector, the yen will continue to weaken But if they don't get their act together and they  continue to dawdle and delay, the yen is still going to weaken The result would be positive for  the dollar in either case The dollar bulls are unabashed in asserting that view, essentially along  the lines that you outlined It is the Chinese connection that I think causes the anxiety    8/18/98   How is it going to be resolved?   I think they recognize a certain tension there That is true even of those  who assert that the best probabilistic forecast of dollar/yen is that it will go through 150 and keep  going If we ask the same people who make that forecast when they plan to start to "bottom fish"  and buy cheap Japanese assets, the quick response is that the time to start cost-averaging in is  now They do not see any contradiction there I think that is the traders' answer to your question  They are in effect acknowledging that the turn may occur sooner than they are forecasting, which  itself is ironic   One thing I alluded to is the continuing demand for bunds and  Treasuries, which is indicative of uncertainty The reason for the uncertainty is that investors do  not understand the deflationary world, and the result is a flight of capital The flight is not  motivated so much by a search for quality as it is for certainty, to something investors think they  know how to price As I have said a few times before, 18 months ago I could not find anyone in  Germany who thought Germans would hold 10-year bunds at a yield under 6 percent They saw  that rate as a rigid floor Now the yield is below 41/2 percent Something affecting global investor  sentiment has changed That is how I would put it Now, that is not an entire explanation, but it's  the best that I have   I may be too much of an optimist here, but I think there is a growing  appreciation that credit quality may matter some day   Absolutely In a deflationary world, lenders and investors had better  start figuring out who is going to remain in business because not everyone is going to make it   Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to the usual package of colored charts with an FOMC cover and also to three pages of black and white charts showing standard deviation data that I will refer to briefly Those two sets of charts should be in front of you 1/  Looking at the first page of 3-month deposit rates--the current 3-month, the 3-month forward, and the 9-month forward--you can see that the 9-month forward 3-month rate is now trading at a level of about 47 percent, reflecting in my judgment a market expectation and pricing not of a single easing of monetary policy but of a whole series of easings through early next year You can see that these expectations began building after the Committee's last meeting and the contemporaneous Russian devaluation and moratorium They have become much more pronounced in recent weeks  In contrast, the forward rates in Germany and Japan have now collapsed onto the current 3-month deposit rate, so there is no expectation of up or down rate movements in those two countries, just sideways I always like to point to instances when movements in exchange rates are consistent with changes in short-run interest rate differentials I do not want to suggest that the changes in the rate differentials were the only cause of the dollar's slight weakening, but it is gratifying when we find consistency there  At your last meeting, I suggested that market participants were on the edge of their chairs with respect to the risk of a Chinese devaluation of the yuan It turns out that the Russian devaluation and moratorium of the prior  1/ Copies of the charts used by Mr Fisher are appended to the transcript (See Appendix)    9/29/98  day was sufficient to strain, and in some cases nearly to shatter, investor confidence around the world, particularly in fixed income markets  Turning to the second page, we have depicted a series of yields on fixed income instruments Let me work up from the bottom of the page At the bottom, we have the 10-year Treasury note and a Merrill Lynch high grade agency index in yield terms The dark blue line above the red line is the 10-year US swap rate, that is, the fixed component of the "plain vanilla" 10-year fixed rate to floating rate interest rate swap The lighter blue line is the Ford Motor Company's 10-year bond and there is a Fannie Mae coupon issue as well  Moving up the page, the middle panel is on the same scale as the bottom panel We are looking at a jump of 150 basis points to get up to this Merrill Lynch index of high yield securities That index covers more than 900 companies rated BBB or lower  The top panel is on a completely different scale in order to fit the JP Morgan emerging market fixed-income index on the same page One reason for presenting this in this form, which I will come back to in a moment, is that a widely emulated trade in the financial markets has been a spread trade It is based on an expectation that spreads would be narrowing between higher yielding credits and, for example, Treasuries You can see here that spreads between the higher yielding issues in the top two graphs and the Treasuries widened considerably after the Russian devaluation on the day before the Committee's meeting in August While some of the yields on higher grade credits are lower in absolute terms, the spreads themselves also have been widening So, trades constructed even against those credits have been under considerable stress despite the fact that their yields in absolute terms have shifted lower  The rush out of emerging market and higher yielding instruments in late August obviously put significant strain not just on those who are carrying higher yielding instruments but on those involved in trading on spreads The result has been an acceleration both of purchases of Treasuries and sales of higher yield securities It is worth noting that while the yields on higher grade credits have come down, at least part of the explanation is an expectation in the market that there will not be the normal pace of new issuance In these very volatile markets, firms that have higher grade credit ratings like the Ford Motor Company are not going to try to price new issues, so some of the reduction in yield is in anticipation of that supply effect Of course, the treasurer of Ford Motor Company is not complaining that yields on Ford's bonds are lower, but he does face more volatile markets The 900 or so companies represented in the Merrill Lynch master index of high yield securities, however, are facing both higher yields and an inability to borrow in these very volatile markets    9/29/98  Turning to the next page, we see another way of looking at similar data In the top panel, we have the 10-year swap spreads that I referred to earlier The panel shows the 10-year fixed leg of a fixed-floating swap against the government bond for the same country--France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States are shown You can see the tremendous widening of these spreads after the Committee's last meeting  The bottom panel, unfortunately, is poorly labeled; it should be called "swap-spread spreads" What is depicted here is the difference between the UK swap spread and the French swap spread in blue and between the UK swap spread and the German swap spread in yellow This is a trade that is based on what a number of people have expected to occur--the long-run convergence of the United Kingdom into the EMU Eventually that is going to happen and this is one way to take advantage of that expected event Instead of converging, however, you can see that the spreads have tripled since late August  Yet another way of looking at the same data is reflected in the black and white charts that I have handed out The point here is that the events that have occurred recently in fixed-income markets produced a shock not just for those who have been trading for the last year or two but also for those whose trading goes back as far as June 1992 What we are looking at here is the standard deviation in basis points of these spreads, as measured over 20-day intervals, from the mean for that interval This chart indicates how many basis points need to be encompassed to include one standard deviation For the UK 10-year swap spread, the average 20-day standard deviation from June 1992 through July 31 of this year was 26 basis points As you can see, the prior high for any 20-day period was an average of 95 basis points in 1994, while for the 20-day period through the end of August it was 148 basis points So, we had a huge explosion in the volatility of the swap spreads in August The same essentially can be seen on the second page for the US10-year swap spread   Yes   The 10-year maturity So, we have a 10-year gilt It is a 10-year swap  among the prime bank names, not necessarily British banks; it involves the major players in all  the markets   Yes, in sterling It is that spread we are looking at as it widens out and becomes more volatile I don't need to go through all the data, but you can see essentially the same for the US 10-year spread and the JP Morgan emerging market bond index My point is to underscore that the shock to fixed-income markets that occurred in late August was of considerable significance to the players in the markets and in historical terms  Turning to the next color page--I will try not to dwell long on this--on the left side, we have re-indexed to May 1 a total return, 10-year bond index in blue for the United States in the top panel, Germany in the middle panel, and Japan in the bottom In red, we see the local equity index, in each case also re-indexed to May 1 The obvious point here is that bonds have been a better investment over this period than have equities That may not have required rocket science expertise to figure out! [Laughter]  On the right hand side, we have a measure of volatility Here the blue line is the At-the-Money implied volatility of options on futures of the 10-year bond contracts and the red line is the At-the-Money implied volatility of options on the equity indices, both indexed back to May 1 So, this is the change in the level of the implied volatilities on the futures contracts This shows how extraordinarily implied volatility has increased, particularly for equities Please forgive the lack of JGB data for June and July in the bottom right panel The point here is in part the extraordinary increase in volatility in the equity markets but also how much money an investor might have lost in late August if the investor had written a lot of option contracts in the expectations that volatilities would be coming down The loss could have been an extraordinary sum of money   And some did  Finally, Mr Chairman, in the chart on the last page relating to our open market operations, you can see that fed funds generally have traded uneventfully since your last meeting We did purchase $79 billion on an outright basis, and we will have to make more such purchases because reserve needs have been growing  Finally, we had no foreign exchange operations in the period However, we are working on a number of issues and I would like to mention those One on which we are working with Board staff is that of opening accounts for the European Central Bank on our books and trying to open a Federal Reserve account on their books It is not quite clear what, if anything, we can do with our account on their books We don't know what services they will be offering But in the spirit of bonhomie and camaraderie, we are looking to open an account with the ECB There are a number of technical    9/29/98  issues for them that are proving to be very time-consuming to work out With respect to their accounts with the Federal Reserve, they want to maintain a very complex structure of 13 different accounts for the national central banks as well as for the ECB itself and to have it all under one umbrella We are trying to work that out  We also are working on a number of technical issues related to the advent of the euro that have to do with our payment facilities and how we operate the accounts I am opposed, however, to undertaking any planning at this time of changes in the investment of our reserve holdings I would much rather wait and see how markets develop There may be some diversification options for the management of our deutschemark reserves, but I think the markets are going to be very uncertain and in any event the operational issues are consuming our time at present  Our holdings at the BIS, the Bundesbank, and in German government bonds and German repos are in the wholesale markets where they will all be converted and denominated in euros We would have to resist rather strongly and seek out bankers prepared to help us out if we wished to maintain them technically in deutschemark denominations We have not been resisting that conversion but have been trying to work with the flow  Ted Truman and I have sent you a memo on the status of discussions of the swap arrangements, 2/ and we will be happy to answer any questions about those discussions  Mr Chairman, as I said, we conducted no foreign exchange operations for the System during the intermeeting period I will need the Committee's ratification of our domestic operations during the period, but I would be happy to answer any questions about them   I would fall in your third category, and I'm glad you offered that  option to me As you described it, Mr Chairman, there was some sense of stabilization or  calming in late July when extreme movements in the Bradys and other securities seemed to  moderate I think there was a hope at the time that the IMF program for Russia announced at  that point was going to tide Russia over No one thought that program was going to be the last  word on Russia, but it was seen as a brief sign that things could be held together Over-optimism  about that may have led some to double up their trades In any event, when their confidence was  lost there resulted, through either of the channels you are suggesting, a bigger balloon to explode  or to collapse That is, some nebulous force in the world of financial contagion was closing in or  the official sector did not have an answer Bailout is an answer, but it is not a plausible one for  the whole world, as I think your second alternative was suggesting It doesn't matter for  investors which of the two hypotheses you described is correct; both of them involve an extreme  loss of confidence The market movement itself causes enough losses to concentrate the mind    9/29/98  and begin a delevering process I must say, as a side note to this, that in a meeting in Basle  earlier this month, a number of my fellow central bankers discussed with me their view that  money does not disappear I disagreed When markets delever, money goes away and credit  comes in In the macro sense, one can look at the Japanese money supply; money really is  disappearing in Japan In a shorter-run sense, if the parties financing counterparties take away  the financing, borrower balance sheets shrink and in one sense money is disappearing   Absolutely   Financial wealth can be destroyed Obviously, other people probably  have views on this very important question that you raised   I think one has to think of that in terms of the issuers or borrowers of  debt That is, the role of the financial sector is to take on the financing requirements of people  actually building factories and the like So, the other side may be those who issued bonds and  built factories and did so by borrowing on BBB or worse credit some time ago   The borrowers made money They borrowed at a good rate and they  built nice factories umpteen months ago So, as I see it such borrowers involve a fair number of  those on the other side of these trades It is not a zero sum outcome within the financial sector in  that sense    9/29/98   Yes, some people in the financial community undoubtedly are making  money on the other side   Cathy, clearly there are trades where people on different sides make  money   Yes, I agree with your analysis, though my point to Cathy Minehan  was more limited, namely that initially we have to be careful to separate the financial sector from  those who borrow We might call it the real sector for the moment If we have had years and  years of IPOs and junk bond financing, the real sector has already taken its money and invested it  somehow The financial sector is now faced with a collective writedown of the value of that  paper as the balloon is pricked There will not be an offsetting gain within the financial sector  for every loss within the financial sector as the air comes out of the balloon   I'm not sure what data you are working with I gather your study was  historical   On an historical basis, working from the data in my head, I think that  is right I have not compared the July 1 to September 15 period with other periods What I was  showing you was implied volatility on equity and bond futures, which moved up sharply from  levels in prior months Again, I do not know precisely what an historic comparison would show   Dino Kos just gave me a specific reference that helps to illustrate the  point I think the current level of implied volatility is double the historic; that is a very skewed  result The rush to try to hedge in the options market has been making the options market, which  people rely on, very thin So, I was focusing on that That is a pithy point   Let me first discuss the mechanics There clearly is a lack of supply in  relation to demand, whether it reflects a flight to quality or a closing of the spread trade I think  a number of people in the market are now realizing that they have to shift their basic assumptions  about how to think about the Treasury curve relative to other credits Supply is down, demand is  up, and they have to think of the Treasury curve in a different way As I see it, they started  trading the indexed bond against an internal mental benchmark of how the normal 10-year bond  has traded over the last five years The typical trader, I think, has a 5-year moving average of  recent experience in mind, if they are senior traders The junior traders have a 1-year rolling  average! [Laughter] Traders started out with a presumption of how to price the inflation-indexed  bonds against their notion of a 5-year average of a normal yield curve, and there has been a    9/29/98  sudden shift in that norm, a break in behavior because of the heightened demand and reduced  supply I think they're going to have to work that out Don Kohn may have a more profound  answer   I don't think you should interpret it as a good forecast I don't think  that's what the market is doing I think the trade you are suggesting is a very good one and  might be very profitable for you if you or anyone wants to make it at this moment [Laughter]   The illiquidity of the indexed bonds is notorious The dealers do not  like trading them   I agree with you   I don't think they had an August balance sheet on September 1   They may have had one during the weekend, eight days ago I don't  think anyone had seen one before the weekend of September 19 and 20    9/29/98   Let me try to answer your line of inquiry, Mr Chairman, with a  hypothesis I want to be very clear that this is just a hypothesis On August 31, the firm has a  $125 billion balance sheet against $28 billion of capital, which they have lost Essentially, $125  billion of assets are out under repo There are no assets in the firm One kind of transaction they  are doing with their counterparties is a repo transaction   US Treasuries, Danish government bonds, BBB credits--you name it   There is a fair amount of government credit in these assets, but there  are a lot of other assets also Swap agreements are their instrument of choice, and that is how  they got to a $145 trillion off-balance-sheet position on August 31 By the time we were  looking at that position during the weekend eight days ago, the firm clearly had lost a lot of  capital Other firms that looked at their position in greater detail than we were able to thought  the off-balance-sheet had shrunk to around one trillion dollars by the third week of September  The balance sheet leverage ratio was 55 to 1 by the time we looked The off-balance-sheet  leverage was 100 to 1 or 200 to 1--I don't know how to calculate it Let me try to explain by  way of a hypothesis    9/29/98  A counterparty looking at LTCP and contemplating secured financings involving repo  transactions and a lot of total-rate-of-return swaps and other swap transactions might decide not  to take any initial margin The counterparty would consider itself secure because it had taken  five years of data and seen what the daily and two-day price moves can be It would be  managing its risk exposure on the basis of the same five years of data that the experts at LTCM  were using and had concluded that not all the correlations would go to one Both counterparties  would be using risk management systems--this is now a hypothesis--where they have become  increasingly comfortable with zero initial margin because the daily cash flow is enough to let  them think they only have a 1-day move to consider That is, when they look at five years of  data and a potential 1-day move on that basis, they conclude that they can handle that 1-day risk  On the basis of that same five years of data, the partners inside LTCM have persuaded  themselves that the correlations will never go to one between Japanese, German, and US  government bonds They are making the assumption that they will have a globally diversified  portfolio That in part is how the counterparties also get comfortable with zero initial margin  But from the System's point of view, zero initial margin permits an essentially unlimited amount  of leverage There is no constraint other than exhaustion on the part of counterparties   If I lend $100 to LTCP they give me an asset worth $100 If the  market value of that asset goes up 5 percent today, I give them back $5 dollars; if it goes down 5  percent tomorrow they give me $5 dollars   Right   It was the latter The collateral lost market value   I want to be clear, Mr Chairman We are talking about a balance sheet  of $125 billion and an off-balance-sheet of $14 trillion Now, we know the total was not all    9/29/98  collateralized at 100 cents on the dollar It was only the balance sheet financing that was fully  collateralized   I realize it is notional, but we do not know how to scale the notionals   Let me try to work through some of the sources of the losses that were  discussed Long-Term Capital Management did an analysis of its top 17 counterparties on just  12 trades These represented a very small percent of the hundreds of trades that they had on their  books, but they were their big trades For example, 2 of these 12 had losses of $1/2 billion over  a period of 30 days; there were some offsets involving very complicated transactions The  scenario that LTCM worked out attempted to take into account negative movements in each of  the asset markets That is, if the market moved against the position in the direction where  liquidation was likely to occur, there would be an acceleration of the losses But neither the  people at LTCM nor I nor others who looked at this thought a meltdown scenario was involved  The losses actually were the result of discrete bad days in each of these markets They had  generated a counterparty loss of $28 billion that was spread among the top 17 lenders That was  at a time when the net asset value of the collateral was about $1 billion or $1 billion plus, so  there were $1-1/2 billion or so of losses to be shared among the top counterparties I think a  number of us who eyeballed that analysis thought that it was one thing to focus on just the trades  in question; but if all the trades of those firms were included, this direct loss could rise to $3 to  $5 billion That was a number that the other firms that were actively looking at the numbers also  thought was a plausible forecast of a liquidation scenario involving just the top 17 lenders   I would like to offer one final perspective on the numbers that I  discussed One of the surprises for people who went to look at LTCP's position, myself  included, was the tremendous size of their equity and equity volatility positions People knew  they were dabbling in that sector of the markets, but everyone including a lot of the press had  thought of LTCP as a fixed-income shop Some of the firms who looked at LTCP's position in  more detail than I, who had the weekend to investigate, felt that the preponderance of the  exposure, if one uses the $3 to $5 billion number, that needed to be stabilized was the equity  position and the equity volatility position That's in trades with LTCP in total-rate-of-return  swaps A lesser part of the losses was in the fixed-income financing area So, the bigger risk  was this huge equity volatility position that LTCP had taken on   It was something of a signature for this firm to insist that if a  counterparty wanted to deal with them, there would be no initial margin Not many other firms  have gotten away with that   All this relates to the question of how this financing got to be so big  and nobody realized it was happening   Thank you, Mr Chairman I am going to be referring to a package of colored charts that you should find in front of you1/ My report today will be in two parts First, I will discuss market conditions and review domestic open market operations, answer your questions, and seek your ratification of our open market operations After that vote, I will seek your approval on the two special matters identified in the revised agenda  Turning to the first page of colored charts, the top panel shows forward rate agreements in red for the United States While the forward rates have backed up from the lows they reached in late October, both the 3-month forward and the 9-month forward 3-month rates are still trading below 5 percent The 9-month forward rate is still trading slightly below the 3-month forward rate This certainly continues to suggest a decidedly downward slope to interest rate expectations here in the United States  Turning to Germany and its forward rate panel in blue, I would make four points First, it is interesting to note that German forward rates broke below the current 3-month rate following this Committee's September 29 decision to lower rates by 25 basis points Secondly, it is worth at least observing that rate cuts in the periphery of Euroland had no impact on German interest rate expectations Indeed, the German rates have backed up gently and consistently throughout a period of rate cuts by other European countries  Third, much ado has been made of the political pressure on the Bundesbank to lower rates following the German election, but we do not see that in the forward rates At least we don't see any downward or upward movement after the initial break downward in the forward rates following this Committee's action I think there unfortunately is also a certain sense  1 / Copies of the charts used by Mr Fisher are appended to the transcript    11/17/98  of irony in that political outbursts may be preventing both the Bundesbank and perhaps the European Central Bank from making a rate cut that they might be inclined to make absent the political outbursts  Finally, it is worth noting that the German 9-month forward rate is also trading below the 3-month forward rate So, there still is a decidedly downward tilt to interest rate expectations in Germany  In the bottom panel relating to Japan, we can see the rather steady trading in a clump of forward rates around and just below the current 3-month rate, reflecting the Bank of Japan's policy of providing ample liquidity But these narrow ranges, I think, mask a number of other developments in Japanese money markets  If you turn to the second page, in the top panel, you can see one measure of the Japan premium, which is expressed here as the spread between the 3-month Bank of Tokyo/Mitsubishi $LIBOR rate, and the $LIBOR rate fixing in London You can see that the spread is rising much earlier this year than it did last year The real shock that occurred to the Japan premium last November and into the year-end followed the bank closings in Japan This year, we see more of a persistent updrift from the summer through the fall, reflecting I think the broadening and now generalized negative sentiment toward the Japanese financial sector and, more recently this autumn, the effects of risk aversion and credit line cutbacks to Japanese banks by non-Japanese banks  In their search for alternative sources of dollar funding, the Japanese banks have turned away from the Eurodollar market and toward the foreign exchange swap market where they buy dollars and sell yen spot, and simultaneously enter forward contracts to sell dollars and buy yen As the Japanese banks have swarmed into the swap market eager to swap out of yen and into dollars, implicit costs of yen funding have fallen toward and through zero for non-Japanese banks, as you can see in the bottom panel Here, the red line depicts the 3-month yen interbank borrowing rate in Tokyo--the average borrowing rate for Japanese banks--and the green line is the implied yen borrowing rate for non-Japanese banks taken from the prevailing spot-forward swap and $LIBOR rates, assuming covered interest rate parity  The extraordinary movement into negative territory reflects at least two factors There is reduced demand for yen funding in general in global financial markets, with the general delevering and the unwinding of the carriage rate that has been abruptly occurring throughout the fall There also is the increased supply of yen coming into the swap market from Japanese banks looking for dollar funding These two, the demand/supply nexus,    11/17/98  together caused the non-Japanese banks to express their reluctance to take more yen by posting zero or slightly negative yen/LIBOR rates at the fixing in London  Not depicted here but occurring simultaneously is another effect you may have seen reported in the papers, namely the glut of yen in the hands of non-Japanese banks that they now seek to invest to avoid credit risk This is driving Japanese Treasury bill rates toward and through zero, not at the auctions but in secondary market trading  Turning to the top panel of the next page, you can see selected credit spreads in the US markets depicted in various time slices first, at the time of your last meeting; second, just before the intermeeting rate cut; and third on November 13 which was last Friday The table also shows the highs and the lows for this year The simple observation one can make is that spreads are down from their highs and from where they were in mid-October, but they are not down a great deal  The more interesting problem in my view is that it is very hard to judge where spreads should be I don't want to pretend that I have any idea I think that uncertainty is a real problem for the market Most people know and understand that the highs were somewhat uncomfortable Most people understand that the lows of last spring were probably unsustainable But what that means in these rather risk averse year-end funding markets is that the market as a whole has yet another challenge of just trying to find a new equilibrium for these various credit products That in itself is quite a challenge  In the bottom panel, we have depicted the spreads between the top tier and second tier for 90-day and for 30-day commercial paper, with the former spread shown in the blue line and the latter in the red line I should be careful to point out that these spreads are based on indices This panel, in brief, shows the more pronounced than normal year-end effect we are experiencing this year There usually is some year-end aversion to A2/P2 paper This year it is a bit more pronounced than it has been in the past, reflecting the general reluctance to hold the lower grade paper over the statement period at year-end  Turning to domestic operations, we did not do quite as well as I would have liked since your last meeting in containing the fed funds rate around the Committee's target So, I thought this might be a useful time to show you a little about how we assess our own performance On page 4 we have depicted the distribution of daily observations of one standard deviation of the fed funds trading range and of the deviation of the fed funds effective rates from the target On the vertical axis, we have a measure of volatility    11/17/98  expressed in terms of the number of basis points of the trading range contained in one standard deviation On the horizontal axis, we have similarly measured the negative or positive divergence of the daily effective rate from the Committee's target, expressed as zero Each dot represents one day The red dots represent days when we know there is going to be some difficulty because of high payment flows, such as a quarter-end, a month-end, a maintenance or a coupon settlement date The blue days are all other days The period here is for the year through the end of July of this year  In the upper right-hand corner, you can see the little red dot for last June 30 when the effective rate was almost 160 basis points above the target and one standard deviation of the trading range was almost 350 basis points As you may recall, that day was a rather volatile day Luckily for us, most of the other observations are clustered much more tightly around zero, which indicates the Committee's target This cluster is depicted on the next page, where we take the same sample of data for the same 12-month period within the constrained range of approximately 50 basis points  The two small boxes drawn on the chart depict the two smallest areas in which we can contain 25 percent and 50 percent of the observations, respectively Luckily for us and gratifyingly, the 25 percent box falls exactly plus or minus 1/16 percentage point around the Committee's target, the 50 percent box being of course somewhat larger This gives us some notion of the norm for the calendar year through the end of last July as a comparison for how we have done in the last few months  On the next page, we show in the same constrained range the data from August 1 through last Friday, distinguishing two subperiods within this more recent period The hollow dots are for the August 1 to September 28 subperiod and the filled-in dots for the September 29 through November 13 subperiod The contents of the two boxes are summarized in the lower left- hand corner of this chart You can see there that from August 1 to September 28, we got about 30 percent of the observations inside the 25 percent box and 58 percent inside the 50 percent box Now, this included the period of late August and September when there was considerable volatility and convulsion in global financial markets, but that disturbance did not flow through to the funds market However, in the next period from September 29 through last Friday, we had a much tougher time Only 19 percent of the observations fell within the 25 percent box and only 25 percent within the 50 percent box It is rather hard to avoid the conclusion that the market conditions that have prevailed since your last meeting indicate at the very least that we have not lived up to our own standard that we set during the prior year    11/17/98  On the next page, there is a chart that I normally show you to illustrate conditions in the federal funds market In the top panel, the green dashed line is the Committee's target, the blue vertical lines represent the federal funds trading range on each day, the red horizontal tick is the daily effective rate, and the red vertical line shows one standard deviation of the fed funds trading range In the bottom panel, the blue bars depict on the left-hand scale the daily excess reserves we in fact provided to the banking system, and the red dots indicate on the right-hand scale the deviation of the daily effective federal funds rate from the target  Looking at both of these panels at the same time but focusing on the top panel, two background factors came into play that I think are useful for you to note First, there was a rather significant shift of volume into the fed funds brokered market in late September and October This shift reflected a cutting back of credit lines and a general aversion to risk in the term funding markets by both buyers and sellers On the lending side, there was an aversion to lending money at longer term and over year-end, and that created a reluctance to post offers On the buying side, there was an aversion to be seen placing bids high enough to attract the limited amount of money the other side was willing to sell--a reluctance to post bids So, we saw a literal thinning out of the market, with a paucity of offers and bids and a consequent shift of both demand and supply to the overnight market But the rush of this volume into the overnight market induced the kinds of behavior patterns that contributed to volatility  The second consistent background factor during this period was that the major banks that normally would be willing to act as two-way traders tended to hold on to funds through most of the day in this period They were willing to sell those funds late in the day at very low rates, which they viewed as the expected cost of minimizing the risk that they might have to come to the discount window This was true not only of banks that were subject to rumors Discount window aversion affected the full range of depository institutions  The first challenge we faced after the rate cut at the September 29 meeting was the month- and quarter-end on September 30 when markets usually are quite tight You can see that we had a wide trading range and a firm market on that day We supplied reserves in an effort to lean against the market's firmness on that day and on subsequent days when the firmness seemed to carry over The resulting excess reserves led to the soft rates that were hard to counter toward the close of that period  During the second maintenance period, it was widely assumed that the intermeeting announcement of lower rates at 315 pm on October 15 reflected an abrupt action to deal with one or two troubled institutions This    11/17/98  then caused an extreme level of discount window aversion over the subsequent days, particularly as you can see in the chart on October 16, 19, 20, and 21 We faced a trading range that was consistently above the target, the blue line, during the morning on those days as banks held on to as many reserves as they could to avoid late day surprises and the risk that they might have an overdraft on their reserve account Once they reached a comfort level where they felt they were not likely to see an overdraft at the end of the day, they were all willing to sell their funds in the market at quite low rates The surplus reserves we had been providing to lean against the heightened rates then began to show through  I should acknowledge that during this period we were reluctant to be stingy late in the period for fear that a negative miss on our part might spike the funds rate upward or force a reluctant bank to the discount window That would make it even harder for us to lower the rate to the intended level on subsequent days We faced similar difficulties around the October month-end, which was in the next maintenance period, but as you can see on the chart market conditions may now be stabilizing It is my hope that we can do better, but I think, to be candid, that we may continue to face an extreme form of discount window aversion and some volatility through year-end and into January  Finally, I would like to discuss a few matters relating to our outright operations We have reduced the size of our normal purchases of Treasury coupon securities that we do at one time to about $600 or $700 million In the relatively illiquid conditions we have seen, going into the market for smaller and smaller bites at any given time means that we cause less and less disruption in the market I am quite pleased that despite the volatile conditions we have experienced, our operations have become something of a non-event That is precisely the objective toward which I have been aspiring  A second item I want to mention--and give you an opportunity to express an opinion, if you wish--is my intention to purchase inflation- indexed securities in our outright operations We have not been purchasing such securities in the secondary market We have been acquiring them at auction I know that when we began doing so, a couple of members of the Committee expressed a degree of reluctance, wondering why the Federal Reserve needed inflation protection [Laughter] I would like to be clear We do not buy them because we need inflation protection We buy them because the Treasury issues them The general asset class involved in all our purchases is US government credit As the Treasury has shrunk the size of its bill issues, we have not been able to purchase bills in the same proportion to coupon securities as we did in the past We do not purchase agency securities outright We accept them in repo, and I have no particular    11/17/98  desire to acquire them on an outright basis But if we should have the good fortune to confront federal government surpluses going forward, we are going to face the challenging question of finding new asset classes to add to SOMA over time So, as long as the Treasury is issuing indexed securities, I think it is useful for us to buy them at least in rough proportion to their issuance by the Treasury  I mention this because as an operational matter, it doesn't make any sense for us to purchase the indexed issues at the same time we're buying the regular coupon securities We cannot judge the relative value of regular coupons and indexed securities So, to make this operationally practical, I propose to go into the market and do a mini pass of the entire index yield curve I suppose we would start out by purchasing around $300 to $500 million I'm not entirely sure how much we might purchase in a mini pass of the index yield curve For every $5 to $7 billion that we purchased of regular coupon securities, we would periodically conduct one or two passes to buy a small tranche of the indexed securities benchmarked against each other to allow us to make some relative value choices about the prices the dealers were showing us But I did not want to do this without informing you in advance and giving you an opportunity to express your views on the subject  Mr Chairman, we had no foreign exchange intervention operations during the period I will need the Committee's ratification of our domestic operations I would be happy to answer any questions on any aspect of my report, but I think our plan is to seek a vote on the ratification and then go on to the two special items   That is a very good question, and I wish I had a precise answer to it I  think that it is important to look at the last two months I didn't talk a lot about the big move in  the dollar/yen that we had That was an extraordinary event, obviously, in terms of the standard  deviation of the move It was also an extraordinary event in terms of the factors that came into    11/17/98  play One major fund began to move rapidly out of a series of positions as has been reported in  the markets Other funds then had positions that triggered--   This was the unwinding of the yen-carry reversal and a move down in  the dollar/yen   Right! I see the big move down in the dollar/yen as just a reflection of  the delevering That delevering was going on in many places, and one place where it showed up  was in the dollar/yen exchange rate The latter then triggered a series of extraordinary  movements that developed into a big technical move down, forgive the term In the general  back-up of the dollar against the yen in markets dominated by considerable uncertainty and  reluctance to take risks, I think we were seeing precisely the effect that I believe you are trying to  explain The glut of yen has been spilling over gradually and not in the shocking way in which  the downward move occurred But we are getting a move back up in the dollar The market has  gone from 111 back to the 120-123 range If we were not looking at that against the standard of  a move from 124 down to 111, the size of this move back up would seem impressive   Yes   There is something of a "Catch-22" about the liquidity issue I'm  particularly sensitive to that issue because, while Wright Patman was free to have his views, one  of the jobs the Committee has assigned to me is to worry about what I would do if I had to sell  large amounts of securities within a short period of time What if I have to make changes to the  System's balance sheet along the lines that we talked about a couple of years ago? In that  context, I feel I need to be as diversified as possible among the full range of assets that I am  allowed to hold, so that I will have maximum flexibility in the event that I have to shrink the size  of the SOMA portfolio to a major extent We currently hold about 30 percent of the Treasury  bills outstanding, about 10 percent of the coupon issues outstanding, and 5 percent of the  index-linked securities outstanding Now, the share of Treasury bills in SOMA has been    11/17/98  declining recently because I can not in good conscience, and the Treasury is rather  uncomfortable as well, continue buying such large amounts of Treasury bills as to dry up the  supply in the public market So, I am constrained on the bill side  On the coupon side, our operations currently are geared toward trying to smooth out  our holdings so we will have roughly a 10 percent share across the coupon spectrum Once we  have reached a smooth distribution across all maturities, then we will have to step up our  purchases of coupon securities In my discussions with the dealers, I tell them that they are  responsible for fostering a deep, liquid market; and, in turn, they suggest that I also have some  responsibility in that regard Now, you may feel that this is a camel's nose coming into the tent  but if the System, having purchased Treasury indexed securities at auction, were never to  purchase them in outright operations, the market would see that as a rather big black eye for  those securities But I'm not sure I want to be providing such a negative signal to the market  about a type of security that the US Treasury is offering  Consistent with the spirit of your concern, President Jordan, I want to proceed very  carefully I certainly have no intention of holding a larger share of the outstanding indexed debt  than I do of the regular coupon debt, and I would move in that direction very gradually and  episodically However, I have a problem in terms of the asset classes that I hold, and I feel some  constraint on where I should go And as you and I were discussing before the meeting, it will  only get worse next year in the Y2K environment So I'm feeling somewhat hemmed in, and if  people have alternative solutions for me, I am all ears   You would have to authorize me to do that I think! It is a choice of  asset class   The discount window aversion is probably the message Don Kohn  and I have been working for several years with the discount officers in the System We have  been talking with money center banks, trying to get them away from the discount window  aversion that was prominent in the late 1980s and early 1990s We have seen all our good work  evaporate in a very short period of time The problem is that the people who were the CFOs  eight years ago are now the chairmen of the big banks So, they have been there and it didn't  take much of a scratch of the old wound to have it all come back It will be interesting to see  whether this is just a year-end effect or we are really going to see a new round of discount  window aversion    11/17/98   Yes   Yes, absolutely There is going to be a headline effect When I enter  the market to do a coupon pass exclusively for TIPS, it will generate a certain amount of news I  have the authority to do this, but I didn't want to do it without informing you in advance   That's why I'm raising the issue   If I can first respond a little further to President Poole, I then will  address your question, Governor Kelley The Treasury knows in advance what we are going to  be buying They make the decision regarding the size of a floating supply they want to have  Part of their decision is based on knowing what we will tend to hold on average along with a  recognition that our securities lending program gives a little elasticity to the floating supply By  the way, I'm going to be coming to the Committee in the near future to seek some changes in the  lending program  The Treasury's reaction to the question of our participation in the first TIPS auction  was one of encouragement We wanted to participate so that we would have securities to lend  out, to provide elasticity to the public supply as a means of avoiding the problems of squeezes  and so forth We are not interfering with the Treasury's judgment about what the floating supply  should be, and I don't think we're going to make a big difference in the liquidity of the market  by buying $300 or $400 million periodically That is not going to be a big issue However, it    11/17/98  already is a big issue that we have not bought any So I see the shoe as being on the other foot,  at least from where I sit, Governor Kelley Dealers are asking the Treasury, and occasionally  me, why the Treasury and the Fed are not doing more to promote these securities when the  Treasury requires that dealers bid on them in auctions But I take your point We can not make  this market liquid all by ourselves It's up to the market to create the liquidity   We are part of the US monetary authority and the largest holder of  US Treasuries The dealers view our periodic coupon passes, through which we expand our  holdings of securities, as a normal part of our support for the Treasury market And our  purchases are seen by the dealers as a process that thins out their inventories of securities   We will be adding a fair amount permanently to the System portfolio  over the next 30 days It would be nice to make the purchases in the next 30 days, but we will  see how it goes It is not vital I think you've made a very good suggestion, Chairman  Greenspan   There are very few foreign central banks that have the kind of  permanent portfolio that we have There is also information from the UK and other countries  about their experience with inflation-indexed securities I don't think it is going to be apropos  central bank operations   I need a vote on my operations during the period   I have two other items, which I hope can go a little more quickly  First, I need a vote authorizing renewal of our swap agreements with the Bank of Canada and the  Bank of Mexico By my silence and your inaction, all our other swap arrangements would lapse    11/17/98  as described in Mr Truman's memo and my memo to you of September 28 This is consistent  with what we have discussed in recent years Karen Johnson is working with other central banks  to insure that the announcement of this action in the FOMC minutes that will be released shortly  after the December meeting will be consistent with statements that might be issued by other  central banks That issue is still being worked on With regard to the second item, I am seeking  your approval of an amendment to the Domestic Authorization to allow repo operations of up to  a 60-day maturity This was explained in my memo to you of November 10 I would be happy  to answer questions on either of those two items I seek your vote on both   If I may add, our Canadian colleagues, who face the Quebec issue at  this moment, feel even more acutely than the Mexicans that this is not the time to let go of those  swap lines    11/17/98   We certainly have that in mind   It is very much about solving a problem for me, though the dealers are  comfortable with the notion, so in that sense there is reciprocity here We had been discussing  this long before the emergence of the credit market conditions of the last two months We had  been thinking about this particularly in terms of Year 2000 problems when we expect a rather  large increase in the demand for currency, which we hope will run off rather quickly But it is  also something that Sandy Krieger and I have talked about for several years in terms of the  difficulty that we sometimes have in getting collateral for shorter maturity RPs When we have a  hard time getting collateral for a large volume of two- or three-day repos, we often find that the  dealers are willing to offer a lot of collateral for 10-day operations That has led us to believe  that it might be worthwhile to try to do a 20-day or 25-day repo to meet occasional longer-term  peaks, and in the case of the year-end, maybe 30- or 45-day RPs This would let us to lay a  foundation by doing occasional smaller operations at longer maturities, so that we would not be  put in a bind in the infrequent circumstances when we need to do a big operation for which we  cannot get enough short-term collateral I want to be clear that it doesn't happen very often that  we get insufficient propositions from the dealers, but I think it should never happen and it is not  a situation I want to be in I am proposing it now because I want to practice this year-end before  I come to year-end 1999   First, I think it is important that we are working in the repo market, not  in the fed funds market There are very different dynamics involved There are different supply  and demand dynamics for funds and securities Secondly, I do not think we are going to affect  the term structure; we are price takers; we do not set a price The dealers know there is risk  involved if the Desk does a 30- or 60-day operation and there's an FOMC meeting during that  interval And they are going to price accordingly That also is relevant to our outright open  market operations vis-a-vis TIPS; we hold an auction We do not publish the price at which we  operate in the repo market The dealers attempt to discover the stopout rate, but I don't want that  to be an issue and so we don't publish it Their estimates of stopout rates reflect only rumor and  gossip You are raising a good issue, but I think we are unlikely to affect the term structure, and  we certainly have no desire to do so   Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to the four pages of colored charts you should find in front of you 1/ Beginning on the first page with the deposit rates, you can see by the red lines in the top panel that the US forward rates are little changed since your last meeting But it is worth noting that both the 3-month and the 9-month forward rates continue to trade below the current 3-month deposit rate, suggesting some expectation of an ease coming in the first half of next year, but without much specificity to it The two forward rates are trading on top of one another, so it does not look as if they imply a series of easings, but some further easing seems to be priced in here  Looking at the German forward rates, you can see that those rates partially anticipated, in late November and into early December, the December 3 rd Euroland rate cut And the forward rates continued to drift a little lower after that Also, the forward rates in Germany are trading below the current 3-month rate, suggesting again some expectation of an easing in the coming year You can't see it in this chart, but let me note that there is very little evidence of greater year-end pressure this year than last year in German funding markets It does seem to be worth noting, given the coming of the euro that the markets do not seem to have priced in any extraordinary year-end effect That is also in contrast to the pronounced year-end effect we are seeing already for the year after next--for the year  1/ Copies of the charts used by Mr Fisher are appended to the transcript    12/22/98  2000 So there's not much special pressure in German funding markets surrounding the anticipation of the euro  In the bottom panel showing the Japanese rates, you can see that on this scale, which is comparable to the top two panels, the deposit rates show a barely detectable rise But, as small as it is here on this chart, by Japanese standards this really is noticeable Let me say that I think we have found too many, rather than too few, explanations for this gentle backing up in Japanese money market rates whether it's that the economy is expected to bottom out in the first half of the year or that the yields on Japanese government bonds (JGBs) are backing up, as I will get to in a moment, or that the Bank of Japan is not being quite so generous in its provision of reserves None of the explanations is entirely satisfactory to me, but there clearly has been a gradual backup in Japanese money market rates  Turning to the second page, the three panels give something of a review of the last six months in financial markets In the top panel, we have major exchange rate pairs indexed to 100 as of July 1st It shows marks per dollar, yen per mark, and yen per dollar, and their percentage change over the last six months  In the middle panel are the three major equity indices, also indexed to July 1st at 100 In the bottom panel, for the moment please ignore the red line which depicts the JGB yield; I will come back to that shortly But the other three colored lines in that bottom panel show various spreads as they have traded from July to the present  My point in bringing these three panels together is to show that there were really two very distinct episodes of delevering, which occurred roughly in the weeks following the Committee's August and September meetings There has been a third more modest delevering event in the last few weeks associated with the year-end The very pronounced decline in both the mark and the dollar against the yen seen in the top panel coincided with the significant turmoil in early October You can see in the bottom panel that the three triangles point to the peak spreads reached also early in October In the middle panel you can see where equity markets, at least in Germany and Japan, reached their nadirs during that period, and the Dow almost reached its nadir and began coming back  More recently, there has been some gradual decline in the dollar against the yen, but it has been relatively muted, more or less associated with year-end thinness, with some reversal of that move in the last day or so Also in the bottom panel you can see that swap spreads and the on-the-run/off-the-run spread have backed up a little I would emphasize the thinness of markets rather than anything else here But in the middle panel you can see the somewhat manic behavior of our equity markets It    12/22/98  seems to me rather pronounced and in contrast to the events in the other markets  Focusing now on the red line in the bottom panel, which depicts the benchmark Japanese government bond yield, in the last few days--and since your last meeting in fact--there has been an extraordinary backup in this yield The bond was trading at a yield of around 80 basis points at the time of your last meeting or just before It traded at 150 basis points yesterday It was off a further 40 basis points earlier today, or up to 190 It has come back a little from that level, having traded the limit down today both in the Tokyo and London futures markets, and it is now at about 180 basis points  The Japanese government first began leaking and then yesterday announced its borrowing plans for the coming year, which in their forecast will amount to roughly a 65 percent increase in the amount of Japanese government bonds to be absorbed by the public portfolio--that is, by private sector demand The bond market has begun to price this in  Back in September Japanese banks were given a choice by the Ministry of Finance either to treat their bonds on a mark-to-market or on an original cost basis Most of the banks, virtually all, elected to do it on an original cost basis In my view, that simply is going to delay the day of reckoning as yields back up, given that the holdings of JGBs on the balance sheets of all kinds of financial intermediaries are rather significant as a credit substitute As the yields back up and approach the average cost of any one institution's JGBs, that institution will have an extraordinary incentive to sell out its positions That already seems to be under way and is providing something of a continuing accelerator for the backup in Japanese government bonds Given the extraordinary scope of this backup in just a couple of days, I think it is reasonable that the US and European bond markets have been backing up a little, as Japanese accounts experiencing these losses are off-loading some of their holdings of US and other fixed- income instruments  Now, all this is in anticipation of the rather exciting year Japanese government bond markets are going to have in 1999, so we have that to look forward to We in all likelihood have the specter, in my humble opinion, of the Ministry of Finance trying to change the accounting rules again at the end of the fiscal year if these losses become too extreme on insurance company and bank balance sheets  Turning to domestic operations on the next page, the funds market has been a little less stable than normal, but there has been some improvement over the last intermeeting period in terms of some reduction in the extreme volatility This chart is similar to the one I presented at your last meeting On the vertical axis are the basis points contained within one standard    12/22/98  deviation of the daily trading range, and on the horizontal axis is the basis point variation of the daily effective rate from the target The hollow dots represent observations in the intermeeting period between your September and November meetings The filled in dots represent days since your last meeting And as I did last time, I have summarized in the lower left-hand box the results, roughly speaking, against the benchmark period of the prior year before August  As you can see, while we had fewer days with very low volatility, where trading was in a tight range around the expected rate, we had roughly the same number of days within the 50 percent box Without counting the dots, let me point out a different way of looking at this In the September- to-November period, fully 1/3 of the days observed had a standard deviation of greater than 4, whereas in the more recent period only 1/6 of the days had a standard deviation of more than 4 So we haven't come to the point of a quiet market, but we have reduced some of the extreme volatility I think this has been caused by a reduction in credit concerns and some greater access to term funding markets, which have opened up to a wider number of participants Also, early in this intermeeting period we leaned rather heavily against firmness, being quite generous in our reserve- supplying operations, and when we began to take that away from the market, it actually took the market a while to figure that out They assumed, perhaps, that we were being more generous than we in fact were  On the last page I have shown the comparable data for the same period exactly one year ago I would note that the red dots represent the days with high payment flows--tax payment dates, bond settlement dates, or maintenance period settlement dates They are really the days when one would expect to see the higher volatility, and that is what we see here In the 1997 period the dots on normal days are much more densely clustered than in the comparable period this year, where we see a mix of blue and red dots at the higher volatilities, indicating the higher volatility we still are facing But I think that has calmed down somewhat  Let me note that we did conduct a pass to purchase indexed securities and we also undertook three longer-term repo operations These elicited relatively little market reaction and went much as I had hoped We already have $12 billion in repos on the books for the turn of the year, which will help us unwind automatically as reserve needs diminish after the peak year-end period  Mr Chairman, we had no foreign exchange intervention operations during the period We have completed the renewal of our swap arrangements with our Mexican and Canadian colleagues, but all our other swap arrangements have lapsed I will need two votes, however I have circulated to the Committee a request to add the euro to the currencies in    12/22/98 5  which we are authorized to operate I would propose to come back to you at a meeting early in the new year to discuss removing the legacy currencies But for the moment I thought we would leave those alone So, I am seeking a vote to add the euro to the foreign currency authorization I will also need ratification of our domestic operations I would be happy to answer any questions   My understanding is that once the price of the JGBs declines below the  cost at which they were purchased, the banks will have to recognize a loss   It is cost or market, whichever they chose They were given a choice  Virtually all chose cost I may be wrong, but I went over this with the Ministry of Finance  representative in New York just yesterday, and my understanding is that once the market price  reaches cost, the banks will then have to recognize a loss   That's right But I think the way they will view this is not on a  bond-for-bond basis They will look at the average cost of their JGB portfolio And as the  market price approaches that level, they will want to be liquidating the portfolio before the  breakeven point is pierced   Well, would it surprise you if that were--   I have not found an acceptable explanation of that myself It is  something I have tried to follow So my first response is that I see it as a bit of a mystery I  think it's especially a mystery if you realize that these swap spreads, as most of us measure them,  are from a common panel of major international banks So the difference in spreads should be a  credit issue, but it is hard to pull that out when one is looking at a common panel of global  players who are the ones we look to for quotes on these swap spreads That mean that is  somehow embedded in--I don't even know how to express it No term comes to mind to express  this; I'm at a loss    12/22/98   There are some in the market who think that European central banks  are active in this market   Yes, that would be   It is coming in through the demand side rather than the supply side, if  you will But I have not interrogated my foreign central bank counterparts enough to determine  this   Yes, I may be able to do so   Yes, we will try to look into that further   You saw a rather significant 1-hour reaction, President Poole I think  the 1-day and 3-day and 3-week reaction was rather muted So, my first point is that trying to  measure this on a minute-by-minute basis involves working with too short a time horizon My  second point is that I really do not understand the logic of your position We are active  occasionally in purchasing securities on the other side of this spread whose purity you care  about; we purchase 30-year and 10-year and 5-year nominal bonds If what you care about is the  clarity of the spread, the logical position is that we should operate either on both sides of that  spread or on neither I do not see the logic in suggesting that we should operate on only one side  of the spread I view the market reaction to which you refer as a short-term reaction to our first  purchases of these securities I would expect an abrupt reaction on the first day we operate in  any new area of the market But I think it largely disappeared and was very hard to find on  subsequent days   That is one thing we look at; it is not the only thing We are also  looking at our holdings of securities and trying to keep a balanced portfolio across the whole  yield curve That is really the first order of importance   No, I disagree with you completely on that That is precisely why I  wanted to do a TIPS-only pass So the only relative value statement we would be making would  be vis-a-vis other TIPS issues Thus, when we purchased TIPS I would make a judgment as to  the rough order of magnitude, how many hundreds of millions should be purchased Then the  traders' judgments are restricted to making a relative value choice across the range of TIPS  propositions they are given That's precisely so we will not be making a comment on the  appropriate spread relative to the nominal yield   Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to the three   pages of colored charts that should be on the table in front of you 1/   As you can see in the top panel, this time I have added in the 6-month  forward 3-month rate as a black dotted line; it should not be infected with  any end-of-year Y2K premium, at least for the next few days You will  recall that I used to include routinely the 6-month forward rate in all of  these panels until all three of the money market yield curves became so  compressed that they were too hard to see on the charts   Looking at the top chart on the US dollar forward rates, you can see  that the upward drift in money market rate expectations began in mid-to- late January and was accelerated significantly by the market’s initial  reaction to the Chairman’s Humphrey-Hawkins testimony These  heightened expectations began to unwind rather quickly over subsequent  days, however, as data came out indicating an absence of price pressures  and comments by members of the Committee suggested an absence of  urgency for a monetary policy move But even ignoring the peaks of late  February and early March, as shown in the chart both the 9-month forward  3-month rate and the 6-month forward 3-month rate are almost 40 basis  points higher today than they were in mid-January In particular, I would  note that the 6-month forward 3-month rate, the black line, has been trading  for the last few days at a premium of about 15 to 20 basis points over the  current 3-month rate And that is the widest spread between that forward  rate and the current rate since the June-July 1997 period   The middle chart depicts the German mark and euro forward rates It  is intriguing to see, even with an eventual further ease by the ECB being  widely discussed, the extent to which those forward rates moved up in late  February and early March coincident with the rise in the dollar forward  rates In the bottom chart, on the Japanese forward rates, I would suggest  that the spread shown there between the 9-month forward and the current   1 / A copy of the material used by Mr Fisher is appended to the transcript (Appendix 1)     3/30/99 2   rates probably reflects a Y2K premium and should be interpreted that way  and not as the anticipation of a significant upward movement in Japanese  rates   Turning to the second page, let me go over some yield and spread  relationships In the top panel you can see yields on selected 10-year  government bonds for the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, and  Germany and for the 10-year US inflation-indexed security A very  simple point to note in this panel is that during the period from October  through December some rather dramatic changes in the relationships  among major G-5 government bond yields emerged, and those changes  occurred abruptly But from January forward--dating roughly from the time  of the real float on January 15th--you can see that these bond yields began  to march in parallel, giving the market a rather strong sense that UK and  continental government bond markets are following the lead of the US  Treasury market   The middle panel shows a series of spread relationships over the on- the-run Treasuries In the top orange line, you can see that there was a  narrowing in the mortgage-backed spread as long-term rates backed up in  this country, reflecting a reduction in the prepayment risk for the mortgage- backed portfolios It is interesting that the other spread relationships have  remained rather constant, notwithstanding the backup in the US Treasury  yield curve and the rather heavy issuance of securities in the fixed-income  market I think this at least suggests a growing comfort level in fixed- income markets with the current spread relationships On the other hand,  the bottom red line, the twice off-the-run US Treasuries, shows that while  this spread has narrowed a little to around 15 basis points, or roughly half  its October peak of 30 basis points, it is still 3 times its pre-Russian-crisis  norm of around 5 basis points So, while there has been some unwinding  of anxiety in that area, there still is a rather pronounced desire for liquidity  in fixed-income markets; market participants seem anxious to hold  instruments that they can sell quickly if they want to   In the bottom panel, you can see that both Mexican and Argentine  Brady spreads have returned to, or just past, their pre-Russian-crisis levels  And the Brazilian bond is now trading at a spread against Treasuries that  prevailed in December of last year, before the intensification of the  problems in Brazil   Turning to domestic open market operations, page 3 has a scatter plot  similar to one I have shown you before in which each dot represents a day  The horizontal axis shows the divergence of each day’s effective funds rate  from the target rate And the vertical axis depicts a measure of volatility     3/30/99 3   expressed by the number of basis points contained within one standard  deviation of trading around the effective rate The blue dots on the chart  cover the period from September 30th of last year through February 3rd  and the red dots cover the days since your last meeting   Eyeing the chart, you can see that the red dots are giving us a rather  better cluster around the target rate, showing a tendency toward lower  volatility than we experienced in the rather difficult period from the end of  September through your February meeting In the lower left corner is a  panel with a more precise measure of this to give you a sense of how the  funds market is calming down That panel shows the median value of the  daily divergence of the effective rate from the target rate regardless of sign  and the median value of the daily standard deviation Looking at the first  line, in 1997 there were as many days on which the effective rate diverged  from the target by less than 7 basis points as there where days on which it  diverged from the target by more than 7 basis points Similarly, on roughly  half the days the standard deviation was less than 9 basis points and on  roughly half the days it was more than 9 basis points As you can see,  those values were more or less maintained through much of 1998 until the  end of September After that we experienced a rather significant period of  volatility, when roughly half the days had an absolute deviation from the  target of more than 15 basis points and a volatility standard deviation of  more than 24 basis points But, as seen in the red line covering the period  since the last FOMC meeting, the values have returned to more normal  levels   Looking back, I think it is quite clear that in the fourth quarter of last  year we faced a very anxious funds market, with elevated and erratic  demand for excess reserves leading to volatility and firm rates To be  candid, in January we on the Desk probably were slower to reduce our  anxiety than the market; we were just a little behind the market in  unwinding those anxieties and we were probably tending to be a bit  generous in the provision of reserves But that effect was overwhelmed by  the generosity that the weather-induced float provided, giving us some  rather volatile and squishy-soft days in January But we seem to have  come through that, and in the last intermeeting period the funds market  appears to have returned to much more muted and normal conditions   Let me conclude by noting that starting this coming Monday we will  be moving our routine operating time to around 930 am, one hour earlier  than has been our practice I want to thank the staffs of the Board and the  Reserve Banks as well as the Treasury for their efforts to provide data on  reserves to us more quickly so we can do this and participate in the market  when it is a little more deep and liquid than later in the day     3/30/99 4   We had no foreign exchange intervention operations to report We  concluded the foreign currency rebalancing that the Committee authorized,  which we will report on in full in the written quarterly report we will be  sending you during the month of April I will need the Committee’s  ratification of our domestic operations I will be happy to answer any  questions    I have data going back about 15 years, and the difference has   been around 5 or 6 basis points    No, it is not    Yes, the 5, 6, 7 basis point difference was the long-term trend   for many, many years    I don’t have that on the tip of my tongue    No embarrassment as long as my staff gets the credit!    Thank you I will be referring to the package of charts in front of   you1/   I will be discussing three distinct topics this morning first, recent  interest rate and exchange rate developments; second, the recent behavior  of the funds rate and Desk operations; and third, some preliminary  thoughts about the Y2K issues the Desk may be facing   Turning to the first chart on forward rate contracts for 3-month  deposits, you can see in the top panel that after the last meeting US  forward rates drifted lower and then began rising, intriguingly, from about  the time of the European Central Bank (ECB) rate cut Subsequently, they  rose significantly further after the release of the first-quarter GDP data and  the Chairman’s May 6 remarks in Chicago Of course, last Friday the CPI  data caused an even bigger jump in the forward rates, with the 9-month  forward 3-month rate backing up 21 basis points to 551 percent and the  3-month forward rate backing up 10 basis points to 518 percent The  September fed funds futures contract rose 8 basis points on the day to 450  percent and the long bond backed up 17 basis points to around 592  percent   In the middle panel you can see that the ECB managed to surprise the  markets a bit with a 50 basis point cut in its repo rates about a week after  your last meeting And forward rates have shifted lower more recently,  with the 3-month forward 3-month rate right on top of the current 3-month  rate   The bottom panel shows rate movements in Japan While a few  brave souls were suggesting a few weeks ago that there may be evidence  of a reviving Japanese economy--the Wall Street Journal, for example,  brought out the old hackneyed story about a rise in golf club memberships  --there are no such signs in the forward interest rate market Looking at  interest rate markets, it is hard not to notice that at this point, almost   1 / A copy of the material used by Mr Fisher is appended to the transcript     5/18/99 2   halfway through the year, the US economy seems to be chugging right  along, while the rest of the world is at best sluggish   Turning to the second page, the top panel shows selected 3-month  deposit rates in terms of the change in basis points from January 4 and the  bottom panel shows the percentage change in various currencies against  the dollar, indexed to January 4 Without going through all the details--the  specifics are covered in our written report--twelve central banks have cut  rates since your last meeting, six of them more than once As you can see,  much of the world has declining 3-month rates and declining currencies  relative to the dollar But as can be seen clearly in the bottom panel, two  interesting exceptions are Mexico and Canada, whose currencies have  been strengthening against the dollar However, it may be worth  considering the possibility that the weakening of our exchange rate with  our North American counterparts could reflect the strength of the US  economy and its spillover to the north and to the south   The charts on the third page display changes in the Treasury yield  curve over the last two years The top panel shows rates for on-the-run  coupon securities from May 1, 1997 through May 14, 1999 and the bottom  panel depicts selected yield curves Again, as a consequence of the CPI  release last Friday, you can see that the long end of the on-the-run curve  has backed up to about where it was a year ago That backup is a little  hard to see in the top panel because of the brownish-orange vertical line,  but the bottom panel shows it more clearly; the yield on the 30-year bond  rose to 591 percent and the 10-year rate went to 561 percent But it is  worth pointing out in the micro picture of the last few days that the  30-year bond had backed up--you cannot see it in this scale--to 586  percent on Wednesday in anticipation of the PPI numbers to be released  on Thursday Those data gave the market something of a pleasant surprise  and the bond closed Thursday at 575 percent So the market had been  bracing itself for a negative inflation shock, got a head fake from the PPI  numbers Thursday, and then got faked out again Friday This morning,  the long bond is actually trading at 587 percent, only 1 basis point higher  than the close on Wednesday It certainly was a big move, but it is worth  noting that some of it had already occurred, was taken away, and then  given back   Of the four yield curves shown in the bottom panel, the steepest was  on May 1, 1997, which is before any of the pressures developed in  Thailand The panel also depicts the rather flat yield curve of May 1998,  the inverted curve of last October, and last Friday’s yield curve The  floating diamonds reflect the twice off-the-run 30-year bond yield, which I  have noted there as a placeholder I think of that rate as providing  something of a crude measure of market uncertainty about the level of  long-term rates Which way to look at the liquidity premium is something     5/18/99 3   worth pondering To anticipate what the Chairman may ask me after my  remarks Yes, bid/ask spreads on both on-the-run and off-the-run  securities are a good bit wider today than they were at the time of your last  meeting They had come in a little further by the end of April, but the  noise of the last few days has moved them out a bit   Turning to open market operations, the top chart on page 4 shows the  trading range of the funds rate over the last four maintenance periods As  shown in the upper left portion, covering the first maintenance period from  March 25 to April 7, we supplied a high level of excess reserves to try to  get through the quarter-end and month-end period, but we faced fairly  typical pressures for such a period However, the intriguing interval was  the second period, depicted in the upper right portion of the chart, when  we never quite appreciated the speed with which banks shifted to a desire  to be on the short side of meeting their reserve requirements You can see  there how softly the funds rate traded over the period, when we supplied  only $900 million of excess reserves on average Initially, lower-than- expected tax receipts through most of April were a contributing factor, as  receipts lagged our daily estimates They caught up at the end of the  month, leaving the market initially in the next period with higher reserve  levels than we intended There also seems to have been some hangover  effect from last year when we had a very soft funds rate   To bring pricing back in line, we left excess reserves in rather short  supply at the start of the April 22 maintenance period, which was  compounded by a bit of a miss and gave us a rather firm market on April  26 with a standard deviation of 197 basis points That did seem to shock  the market back to a trading level a little closer to the target But, again,  we have seen some oscillation Yesterday’s funds market was a bit firmer  than we had hoped, but rather typical for a quarterly refunding day; the  effective rate was around 501 percent The average rate for the period we  are in now is still just 476 percent, including yesterday’s firm rate   Turning to the next page, I’ve provided a quick summary so you can  see that this year’s tax season was roughly similar to last year’s tax season  The blue dots represent 1998 and the red dots 1999 Funds have traded  around zero for the effective rate minus the target rate, as is evident by the  cluster of dots near zero on the vertical axis showing the standard  deviation If you look rather carefully--perhaps if you squint--you can see  that the softness of last year was not entirely repeated The shorthand way  to see that is to note that there are slightly more red dots than blue dots to  the right of the zero, ie on the firmer side But the pattern was roughly  similar to last year’s   Let me mention a few other issues regarding our open market  operations We commenced the securities lending program on April 26     5/18/99 4   Since then we have lent securities on 16 different days, and on 5 occasions  we had overbidding in the 30-year bond, beyond our lending limit of 25  percent of our holdings There were also 3 occasions when we had more  bids than we needed in the 10-year area There were 4 days of no  borrowing Interestingly, on 8 days we lent bills and coupons that were  not being actively traded I view that as a very good sign for the program  --that it really involved securities loans that were very close to maturity  and might have led to fails; so, that was very helpful Let me be clear that  I think this program is going well As I mentioned last time, I am likely to  want to raise the limits at some point in the future, but before doing so I  will complete a more thorough analysis of our experience with the  program, which I will share with the Committee and the Treasury   In our outright operations since your last meeting, we added a net of  $1174 billion to the SOMA portfolio in 16 different pass operations over  12 different days We did a TIPS pass where we purchased $303 million  of inflation-indexed securities against bids by the dealers of $39 billion  The reaction to our purchases in the TIPS market was very muted   I would note that currency in circulation has been growing more  rapidly this year than last year, which explains in part the extent of our  outright operations through April The currency component of M1 has  grown at an average annual monthly rate of 109 percent versus 67  percent last year For the coming intermeeting period, we are now  forecasting a $99 billion growth in currency as opposed to $53 billion  over the same period last year   A number of you have asked me about our preliminary thinking at the  Desk on Y2K issues I thought it would be helpful to share with you some  thoughts on this, but I want to be clear that these are very preliminary  views I am not committed to these ideas, but it might be helpful to take  you through them, even though I am not looking for approval or  concurrence at this time   If you turn to the next page, I have listed some of our preliminary  thoughts on this subject First and most importantly, I think there is an  increased likelihood that later in the year the Desk will be operating on  both sides of the market, alternately adding and draining reserves in any  given period of time Secondly, the Special Lending Facility that the  Board addressed yesterday, if used as intended, will provide a means for  the System’s balance sheet to expand as we lend to small banks, who may  be perceived to be less well prepared than the large banks to handle any  Y2K problems Small banks may lose deposits either through outright  withdrawals or transfers of deposits to larger banks that are perceived to  be better prepared     5/18/99 5   Now, the large banks may not be comfortable with either holding  high levels of excess reserves or recycling deposits back to lesser credits  This could lead to a tiering in the funds market, with the System acting as  an intermediary--providing added reserves to the small banks through the  Special Lending Facility and perhaps needing to drain reserves from the  large banks Thus, the System’s balance sheet may expand through the  use of the Special Lending Facility as well as through our outright and  longer-term repo operations We are likely to need to fine-tune more  frequently, alternating the use of repos and matched sale transactions  Perhaps the simplest way to put this is just that we may have greater  uncertainty; and in a period of greater uncertainty, the Desk is likely to  need to be on both sides of the market   A separate and much narrower issue is that as we approach the year- end, if there appears to be a developing scarcity of collateral, as some fear,  we may be inclined to oversupply reserves intentionally early on with term  repos Then we can fine-tune total reserves over the turn of the year  through matched sale draining operations, where we provide the collateral;  thus we would not be dependent on the securities markets to come forward  with the collateral for our operations   Also, we are giving some consideration to the need for late-day  operations We are still thinking this through, but we think we might need  to conduct some operations late in the day; otherwise there might be  pressure around the time of the regular 3 pm close of the securities wire  To drain reserves, we might do matched sales late in the day, though we  would have to find some means of crediting the collateral to the dealers’  accounts after what would be the normal close of the wire To add  reserves, we are giving some consideration to the use of a third-party  custodian--really just Chase and Bank of New York who could act as  custodial agents for us--in the acceptance of certain types of collateral  The Desk’s systems simply are not geared up to take some forms of  collateral that in fact are eligible for use in our operations   Finally, the next page is a chart of the year-end butterfly trade for  1999/2000, the red line, and for the previous three year-end periods The  difference between the yields on the 3-month December Eurodollar  contract against the average of the two surrounding contracts is an  expression of year-end funding anxiety You can see the rather  extraordinary levels to which that differential rose over this past year-end  and early this year It has come off quite a bit since then While it was  trading at the higher levels, we gave some consideration to the question of  how we might respond, if you wished us to, to anticipated year-end  pressures in the funding market The only tool that we have in our arsenal  now would be a forward RP--to inject reserves by doing forward RPs that  the dealers might execute with us I have to say that gives me some pause     5/18/99 6   in terms of putting on our books operations that may not be necessary It  seems to me to be a less-than-optimal approach Conceptually, a tidier  tool would be the use of options We would sell options on both repo and  matched sale transactions at strike prices out from the Committee’s target  and allow the dealers to bid for those as a way of getting assurance that  year-end financing would be available I want to repeat that this is really a  conceptual issue regarding how we might respond if this premium began  to rise again and the Committee were concerned about funding in the year- end market That is really all I can say at this point on these Y2K issues  that a number of you have asked me about I hope this gives you a sense  of our thinking on the subject   In conclusion, Mr Chairman, we had no foreign operations during  the period but I will need the Committee’s ratification of our domestic  operations I have a separate issue to bring before the Committee about  the renewal of our Mexican and Canadian swap lines I sent a memo to  the Committee explaining that the appropriate timing for a vote on that is  now rather than later in the year So, I will also need a vote on that issue  I would be happy to take questions on any aspect of my report, and then,  as you wish, we could take the two votes separately    I would not consider myself the System’s leading expert on the   subject I think they have collateral At the discount window we can take pretty much   anything they have in terms of customer notes    Well, if your question relates to what collateral we currently   have in our possession, I should note that we also take on-site collateral in some cases   The discount officers have been working on this issue, writing letters encouraging the   banks to get their collateral in and pledge it, but we are not there yet    Yes    That is the issue that I think the most thoughtful institutions in   the market are anxious about in terms of Y2K concerns What will be good business   practice with regard to closing out counterparties?  How many grace days are going to be   appropriate?  Will this be a one-day hurricane and then everything will be back to   normal, or will it be something more than that?  Swap agreements have three days, repo   agreements have two days; a grace period is written into the contracts So having the   loan as collateral makes things a bit easier, but there are a huge number of instruments   out there that are on what might be considered hair triggers It is a very awkward subject,   and not just for us We will be part of a larger community that will be grappling with that   question    Absolutely But if you think of banks as big as Chase or   Citibank, it’s a virtual certainty that some of their customers will have computer   problems    Yes, I sent the Committee a memo on May 13 about the renewal   of our swap arrangements with Mexico and Canada that were established under the North   American Framework Agreement A reading of the fine print--indeed Mr Truman’s   reading of the fine print--made us realize that under the terms of these swap arrangements   6 months’ notice is required to terminate them Therefore, the appropriate time for the   Committee to decide to renew or not to renew them at year-end is now and not, as has   been our custom, in November Given some of the Y2K issues as well as the separatist   issue still afoot in Canada, our counterparts in Mexico and Canada may be particularly   anxious about them So it is my recommendation that the Committee vote to renew these   two agreements at this time     5/18/99 11    Thank you, Mr Chairman In front of the members of the Committee   is a package of charts, similar to the one I usually show1/ I will begin by addressing agenda   item 3, my report on markets and the Desk’s activities   The first page, covering the period from June 1 through August 20,  presents a slightly different configuration of charts than I usually show  you The top panel depicts US deposit rates, current and forward; the  middle panel shows yields on US Treasury securities; and the bottom  panel shows the percent change in various equity market indices   In the top panel, you can see that from the time of the Committee’s  last meeting on June 30 until the Chairman’s Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony on July 22, current and forward 3-month deposit rates moved  more or less sideways They began rising fairly consistently after the  Chairman’s testimony through the time of the release of ECI and GDP  data and the nonfarm payroll employment numbers, and then came off  noticeably following the publication of the PPI on August 13 and, two  days later, the CPI Even more interesting than that movement in rates is  the changed structure of the forward rates from the beginning of June to  the beginning of August On June 1, shown at the far left-hand side of  the chart, the 6-month forward 3-month rate and the 9-month forward  3-month rate were trading rather closely together at around 58 percent  and the 3-month forward rate was around 54 percent Now, I would  suggest that the proximity of the 6-month forward and the 9-month  forward rates had to do with the market’s expectations that the  Committee was likely to tighten a bit in the future They didn’t quite  know when, and they didn’t know what would happen after that There  might be just one move So, some of the term premium between those  two maturities was squeezed out   By August 1, you see that the 6-month forward rate had shifted and  was then trading in line with the 3-month forward rate Several things  happened in the month of July, I think  Obviously, the market’s attention   1 / A copy of the material used by Mr Fisher is appended to the transcript     8/24/99 3   was focused on the Chairman’s Humphrey-Hawkins testimony,  particularly his comment that the Committee would act promptly and  forcefully There was increasing attention during the month on the  funding pressures anticipated in the fourth quarter and in early January as  a result of the century date change Also, there was the rolling forward of  the maturity of these contracts, which changed each day   To make the point very specifically, on August 1 the 3-month forward  3-month rate involved a deposit whose term covers precisely the period  when the greatest pressures are expected--November, December, and  January If you look at the early August period on the chart, you see that  the 3-month forward rate actually traded below, even if just a few basis  points, the 6-month forward rate Now, I’m not sure the market’s  expectations are correct But the forward rates are showing us that the  market is pricing up considerably the deposit rates for this 3-month  window, erasing whatever term premium one might expect to exist  between the 3-month forward and the 6-month forward because of the  anticipated pressures around the year-end   Turning to the middle panel on Treasury yields, you can see that  those yields more or less followed the same pattern relative to the data  releases However, just before the release of the nonfarm payroll data on  August 6, there was a two-day rally across the yield curve after the  Treasury’s refunding announcement in which Treasury officials  discussed the introduction of buy backs and the elimination of the  30-year auction in November That rally was short lived, unwinding after  the release of the nonfarm payroll data I’d note that the 30-year bond  from Friday, August 20 through today traded at a rate identical to the rate  at which it closed on June 30, the day of your last meeting, whereas both  the 10-year and the 2-year rates are roughly 10 basis points higher   In the bottom panel you can see that equity markets here in the United  States more or less tracked inversely the movements in yields If we  include yesterday’s change in the DOW on that panel, the increase in the  DOW would be 66 percent   Turning to the second page and to European markets, the top panel  shows the forward rates and current rates for 3-month deposits on euros  As is evident in the middle of the top panel, the 9-month forward  3-month euro deposit rate jumped appreciably following the European  Central Bank’s press conference on July 15, during which President  Duisenberg suggested that there was bias creeping into the ECB’s  deliberations Several days later, on the release of German IFO survey  data on business confidence, which was somewhat stronger than  expected, there was a very abrupt jump in the 3-month forward deposit  rate; but that was completely unwound subsequently What I think is     8/24/99 4   noticeable both in the top panel and in the middle panel depicting  European bond yields is the extent to which these rates moved in  response to US data releases and moved more or less in a pattern similar  to that in US markets   The bottom panel shows the euro-dollar exchange rate One can see  that the euro has moved up a bit off its lows against the dollar,  particularly in the week of July 19 to July 23 There are two stories  circulating in foreign exchange markets about movements in exchange  rates One is that a revival of global growth, especially in Europe and  Japan, will be narrowing growth differentials with the United States The  second is that the Fed is about to tighten and that that will be bad for US  assets and bad for leverage and, therefore, for the dollar Now, both of  these stories could be true I don’t mean to discount that possibility But  I would note that many observers, particularly in the foreign exchange  markets, have tended to focus in their conversations on the first story--the  narrowing of global growth differentials But it seems to me that the  asset market movements reflect more of the latter story--that is, the fear  that a Fed tightening will be bad for assets and bad for leverage   In the bottom panel, one can see that in the week beginning July 19,  following Duisenberg’s comments about creeping bias, the dollar came  off quite abruptly That Monday morning several large asset managers  thought it was an opportune time to buy euros They did not expect the  kind of exchange market reaction that occurred They found a very, very  thin market and the dollar moving downward quite briskly It appears to  me and to others, in hindsight, that the market was very thin partly in  anticipation of the Chairman’s Humphrey-Hawkins testimony That  dollar trend accelerated some on the release of the German IFO survey  data even though, as you can see in the other panels on the page, the IFO  survey had very little impact on forward rates or on the yield curve   I would underscore that the dollar is still quite strong against the euro  If my chart depicted it through this morning, it would be trading at 105  Translating this morning’s rate into a rate more familiar to us all, the  dollar-mark, that rate would be 186 So, I just want to emphasize that,  regardless of its movements against the euro, the dollar in historic terms  is quite strong   Turning to the third page, which depicts Japanese markets, you can  see on the left side of the top panel that Japanese forward rates rose a bit  following the release on July 29 of stronger-than-expected Japanese  industrial production data for June Japan’s IP was plus 3 percent on a  month-over-month basis as opposed to minus 1 percent in May But it is  hard not to notice that, again, Japanese forward rates more or less in their     8/24/99 5   own muted way also are tracking the pattern of US forward rates and  US interest rate expectations   There has been much attention paid to the Japanese equity market of  late, and its movements are shown in the middle panel But all that  chatter is now overshadowed by the extraordinary performance of bank  shares in the Japanese market following the merger announcement of last  week On this scale, if the bank index included Monday’s trading, the  Topix Bank Index would show a 268 percent increase over its June 1st  level   The bottom panel shows the value of the yen expressed against the  dollar and the euro Since your last meeting, the Japanese authorities  intervened on three occasions--on July 5 in conjunction with the release  of the Tankan Survey and again on July 20 and 21--for a total of   We acted as their agent on one occasion I think there are two  distinct periods to focus on here in terms of the dollar’s movements  During the week of July 19, the dollar weakened against both the euro  and the yen But as you can see in the blue line on this panel, the euro­ yen rate was mostly unaffected That was the week during which the  markets were most intensely interested in the global growth differential  story, and bond yields started backing up I would note that the anxiety  about a Fed tightening being bad for assets was particularly acute in  Tokyo Market participants and also Japanese officials, I’m afraid, have  coalesced around the view that a Fed tightening in 1999 is likely to have  the same impact on the dollar as the 1994-95 Fed tightening episode I  don’t share that view I think that’s a bit of a stretch But that view has  become rather widely held in the Tokyo market and also by the Ministry  of Finance   In the more recent episode last week, the yen appreciated against both  the dollar and the euro At the start of last week Governor Hiyami  suggested to Japanese corporate leaders, I think wisely, that they should  take more responsibility for hedging their own foreign exchange  positions That had quite an impact on the mood in Tokyo Later in the  week, former Vice Minister Sakakibara somewhat less wisely let slip that  further intervention by the Japanese authorities was not likely until the  yen/dollar rate reached 110, and the market promptly obliged him and  traded down toward that level   Turning to the next page, the chart depicted there for the period from  May 1, 1998 to August 20, 1999 is similar to a chart I’ve shown before  on various spread relationships between private instruments and  comparable US Treasuries Several of these spreads have widened to  levels above those of last October In particular, note that the 10-year  Fannie Mae benchmark and the 10-year US swap rates, shown at the     8/24/99 6   bottom of the chart, have backed up above their prior peaks of last  October 12 and 7, respectively The index of 10-year A2 investment  grade corporate securities, the green line, and the mortgaged backed  securities, the red line, haven’t quite backed up to their prior peaks, but  they also have been rising Corporations and federal agencies have been  eager to lock in what they perceive as rather low rates They used the  swap market initially to try to lock in those rates, and the aversion of  swap market intermediaries to holding on to fixed rate risk has led to the  sharp backup   Now, I want to be very clear that I think this is quite different from  what was happening last October There is no sense of panic in these  markets That said, however, we have to recognize that these markets are  quite thin and that the intermediaries are quite reluctant to hang on to  risks We have triple checked the data for the period of marked volatility  in the swap rate last week, when it oscillated 10 and 15 basis points from  one day to the next, and those are valid data points   The other thing I would point out is that the lower grade credits, the  more risky credits if you will, such as mortgage backed securities which  are shown on the chart and junk rated issues not depicted here, have not  backed up to their peaks of last fall I would not want to suggest,  however, that that is an indication that everything is warm and fuzzy in  those markets--on the contrary But there is very little being issued in  those markets as opposed to the rather strong issuance of higher grade  credits So part of the reason why those rates haven’t backed up further  is because of a reluctance to issue in those markets   Finally, turning to domestic operations, on the next page you can see  that there was very little of note in the fed funds market during the  intermeeting period Deviations of the funds rate from target and the  intraday standard deviation in the volume were quite moderate The only  point of note was that the demand for excess reserves appeared to run a  little below the allowance of $12 billion that we had in the path   Mr Chairman, during the intermeeting period we had no foreign  exchange operations on behalf of the System or the Treasury  I will need  the Committee’s ratification of the domestic operations in the period   Also, I sent to the Committee a memorandum on August 9,  explaining my intention to raise the per-issue limit in our securities  lending program from 25 percent to 45 percent I would be happy to  answer any questions about that at this time or on any other aspect of my  report, before your vote to ratify the domestic operations    Let me distinguish a couple of things First, if I thought the   management of any dealer firm was not taking seriously the intent of our program, we   would escalate the issue rather quickly I believe the problem we’ve had in the first three   months of the program is that some traders looked to take what advantage they could of it   and did not understand the last resort nature of our program So, in each case where this has   happened--where a dealer appeared to have a large position and was also bidding in our   auction--we suspended their bidding for that issue until such time as we were persuaded that   their position was more in line with the intended usage of our program   We have discussed already, Cathy, that if there were multiple infractions from a single   dealer and the management didn’t amend its ways, the first step would be to suspend them   from use of the program for a year or some period like that We are still discussing what   constitutes a “strike” and whether our rule should be two strikes or three strikes and you’re   out I would be inclined to pursue it that way--by prohibiting them from using the program   I think the analogy to the Salomon case is a little extreme I don’t want to overplay it, but   raising the limits per issue-­   But not changing the per-dealer bid I am hopeful will reduce the   potential for dealers thinking they can make something of this So that is one incentive for   us to raise the limits at this time    There are quite a few different US Treasury securities outstanding   For any one of them, I don’t think the frequency of use is continuous other than for on-the-  run issues But one of our major incentives in this program was to try to reduce the risk of   fails to deliver in the on-the-run issues So we always anticipated that the use would likely   be frequent with respect to those issues It is not the same dealer borrowing every time   That gives me some comfort, and I hope would give the Committee comfort, that the   program is being used by the vast majority of dealers appropriately as a last resort I want to   underscore the overnight borrowing constraint we put in the program We only lend   securities overnight now, whereas previously we lent them for a one-week term The   dealers themselves view that as a fairly onerous condition They would much rather finance   a short position for a one-week or a one-month term To have to come back every day   means that in an operational sense borrowing from us truly is much more like a last resort   for them So in that sense I think it really is consistent with how we set up the program,   although in a period when Treasury supply is contracting as rapidly as it is, I believe one can   understand why the facility is being used as much as it is    Yes    Thank you, Mr Chairman Included in my package of charts are two   pages of outline notes that you can follow as I speak You also have a one-page document   containing a revised list of the votes that I will be requesting They provide a guide to my   specific requests In that regard, there is some revision from those in the memo I sent you   on August 17   To begin, as I explained in my memo of August 17, my first proposal is to remove the   constraint of the guidelines that restrict our operations in federal agency securities These   “Guidelines for the Conduct of System Operations in Federal Agency Securities” have been   in effect since 1977 The formal proposal I would like to make is to ask the Committee to   suspend the guidelines until April 30, 2000 At the FOMC meeting in March of next year I   would expect to review thoroughly our experience with temporary operations in agency   securities and, as I’ll explain in a minute, our use of tri-party arrangements in our operations   in agency securities in general So, that is the first item I would plan to request     8/24/99 10   As my memo spells out, Board staff and New York staff see reasonable potential for   reserve needs to grow during the fourth quarter by around $100 billion I want to be clear   that that is not a forecast; it is a scenario I’d also like to be clear that my own seat-of-the-  pants judgment is that our range of potential error is about the same size; that is, reserve   needs might be $50 billion or they might be $150 billion I don’t know how I could tell you   with any confidence where reserve needs are going to fall within that band If they come in   at $50 billion, that will be just terrific and we won’t have the kind of strain that I’m   concerned about If they come in at $150 billion, triple the amount we’ve ever injected into   the banking system at a time of peak demand for reserves, we will face some considerable   challenges   As I outlined in the memo, but perhaps I should have given some more emphasis to   this, the supply of Treasury securities and straight agency debt in which we conduct our   temporary operations is going to be subject to some considerable demand The entire   private sector is going to be engaged in a flight to quality and will be looking for liquidity   There was an article in yesterday’s Wall Street Journal about the many corporate issuers   who were so proud of themselves for borrowing all the money they need through year-end   in the third quarter instead of the fourth quarter Nowhere in the article did it mention what   they were going to do with that money now that they’ve borrowed it They aren’t going to   put it under their mattresses! They are going to try to put it in Treasury bills or in short-term   deposits and make the banks put it in Treasury bills I’d also like to underscore the fact that   foreign central banks are busy changing their operating procedures in order to accept US   Treasury securities as collateral for their open market and discount window lending   operations So the whole world is thinking that around the year-end the place to be is in   US Treasuries and, as a close substitute for that, straight agency debt--precisely the   markets we have relied upon for our collateral   Therefore, I’d like to expand the pool of collateral that we can accept in our temporary   operations around the year-end In framing this proposal we focused on the language of the   Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations itself  That authorization allows the   Desk to operate in all US Government securities, “securities that are direct obligations of,   or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States”   Significantly, that would include mortgage-backed securities that are agency pass-throughs     8/24/99 11   because they are “guaranteed as to principal and interest” and thus would fall within the   scope of the Authorization There are two constraints on our ability to do this One   constraint is the Desk’s own custody systems and our competence in valuing mortgage-  backed securities I’m not trying to disparage my colleagues and our staff, but we simply   have never developed the skills to value mortgage-backed security collateral We do not   have the custody systems And I blush to think what kind of supplemental budget authority   I’d have to request for the second half of the year to try to build those systems, which   probably would be impossible, or to acquire the necessary staff, which would be nearly   impossible   The other constraint relates to the 1977 “Guidelines,” which in practical effect   constrain us in two ways First, because of the structure of the Authorization for Domestic   Open Market Operations, we presume that we can conduct temporary operations only to the   extent that we can conduct outright operations Since the Authorization limits the types of   securities that can be used as collateral in our repo operations to those securities that are   eligible for purchase--and since the Guidelines set rather low thresholds for outright   operations in federal agency securities--that restriction would carry over and constrain our   temporary operations In today’s market, however, when we accept collateral we simply   aren’t in a position to pick and choose the collateral dealers offer us or to set very precise   limits on that collateral That is not how the repo market works today The other principal   effect of the Guidelines is that they effectively preclude us from operating in GNMA   securities, which is particularly counter-intuitive given the structure of the three major   agencies   Therefore, in order to expand the pool of collateral during the fourth quarter and early   in the first quarter, we need to set up tri-party custodian arrangements with the two major   clearing banks, Chase and Bank of New York The entire dealer community uses these two   banks; half of them are with one and half are with the other And we would simply try to   piggyback in this very short time horizon on their existing tri-party custody arrangements   As noted in my memo, this would be more or less identical to the arrangements we currently   have with Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt for the management of our euro-denominated   German government securities posted as collateral on the repos through which we invest   System and Treasury foreign currency reserves     8/24/99 12   I should add, as mentioned in my memo, that the tri-party custody arrangement would   also permit us to take Treasury STRIPS, which our current systems are not configured to do,   also expanding somewhat the pool of collateral I guess that about summarizes the major   points So, focusing on this first request, my view is that suspending the 1977 Guidelines   until April 30, 2000, as I mentioned at the outset, would give us a window of opportunity to   expand the collateral pool so we can hope to meet the year-end upside risks Then, as I say,   we would review at the time of the March meeting the tri-party arrangements and all our   operations in agency securities before the temporary authority lapses I’d be happy to   answer questions on the reserve needs or on this proposal    As you may recall, in my August 17 memo I proposed that the   Committee act upon my request with the understanding that we would still adhere to the   principles incorporated in those first two paragraphs I suggested that a statement to that   effect could be included in the minutes of this meeting I’m agnostic about the precise   wording on which the Committee votes The Secretary of the Committee may have a view   I’d be happy to suspend only paragraphs three through six of the document    It is identical in spirit to what I was suggesting in my August 17   memo I’d be happy not to suspend those first two guidelines    The Treasury is forecasting its total cash balance at roughly double   what it was last year I’m not expert in this; Don Kohn or someone on his staff may be   better qualified to respond, but $20 billion of that has to do with the rules Congress passed   for--   So that bumps the level up considerably Then the rest is a safety   buffer for the Treasury    Let me underscore that our problem in this area is that the Treasury’s   starting point, when they told us about this, was that they were going to put all this cash   comfortably in Treasury Tax & Loan (TT&L) accounts I just don’t believe it is going to sit   there I think the banks are going to push that back to us I might even be more comfortable   if the Treasury were to leave some rather large share of that cash on our balance sheet That   would put us in a better position to reduce the volatility of day-to-day fluctuations stemming   from what comes out of the TT&L accounts and what comes back to us    Yes, but the TT&L banks will have to have additional-­   That’s right If the cash is in the TT&L system, the banks have to have   collateral against that; and if it is on our balance sheet, we’ll have to get collateral   somewhere It won’t be one-for-one in Treasury bills There will be a little more supply out   there, but the asset side of the balance sheet-­   Yes    Yes    We have been doing some thinking about this in New York One   issue that is novel, at least in my thinking in the last month, is that if currency is going to   flow more quickly through the banking system--that is, when banks draw on us and the cash   goes out--there will be less of a benefit in holding vault cash That’s because, having moved   to lagged reserve accounting, they actually take a debit They ask for cash from the Fed and   they have to pay us, so that’s a debit to reserves They get the cash in their vault and it     8/24/99 15   counts four weeks later If it’s moving faster through the system, that vault cash is never   there to be counted as reserves for them If it’s still on hand it can be counted, but if it is   flowing more quickly-- I don’t fully understand the implications of that yet, but we think   there may be a little difference in how we view that    Yes, I think you’re right There are a lot of uncertainties here    Turning to Item B, I would like to ask the Committee to amend the   Authorization permanently to give the Desk authority to operate for periods of up to 90 days   in our repurchase agreement operations To be candid, as my memo says, with the benefit   of hindsight I wish I had asked for that authority last year when the Committee raised the   maximum maturity on repos to 60 days I think the normal difficulties we face over almost   every year-end period would be well met by 90-day repos The 90-day term is also the   standard in the marketplace and I see no reason why we should intentionally be different   from the standard market practice If we had a good reason, I’d be happy for our practices   to be different, but I think there is some benefit in trying to operate in a way that is   consistent with market practice And particularly this year, we would like to start to address   the buildup of pressures as we approach the year-end through term operations that would   roll off in early October and then extend them through the end of February As I said, I   wish I had asked for 90 days when we discussed this last year I think it is the right place   for us to be permanently in any event So I’d like to ask for 90-day authority    Item C, to amend temporarily the Authorization for Domestic Open   Market Operations to authorize reverse repurchase agreements, I would like to try to explain   in some detail     8/24/99 17   Matched sale purchases and reverse repurchase agreements are functionally equivalent   transactions But the prior view in the System had been that we were only authorized to do   matched sale purchases and not reverse repurchase transactions In recent years, as I think   the various memos in your package explained, the evolving view was that reverse repos are   within our authority The dealers have for many years been strongly urging us to move   from the matched sale paradigm to the reverse repo paradigm Our outside auditors have   been pressing us to do this They are much more comfortable with the accepted market   practice of reverse repos and would like us to get away from the involved accounting   methodology used for matched sale transactions The legal memos in the package suggest   that the switch would be acceptable to our lawyers, though recognizing that it would be a   change from a prior view   Let me be clear that I have been planning for some time to ask the Committee for the   authority to do reverse repurchase transactions--as you can see from the dates of the memos   --in conjunction with the Desk’s acquisition and development of a new trading and   processing system We are currently finishing up a proposal that we will be bringing to the   Board to seek approval to spend the monies on a new system As part of putting in place a   new system, I had been intending to ask for this authority However, we won’t be able to do   reverse repos as part of our regular operations until we build a new system, which will be at   least 18 months or 2 years from whenever we begin and maybe longer We plan to have a   phased introduction of the new system in all our operations   Now, in considering the use of tri-party arrangements, we realized rather early on in   our thinking that tri-party operations offer us the opportunity to operate later in the day, as   Cathy Minehan has already alluded to, on both the add and the drain sides The add side   presents us with no particular problem; we can pursue that as we talk to the clearing banks   But on the draining side, if we are trying to get this done for year-end and just want to   piggyback on their existing systems, there is no possibility of getting the dealers and the   clearing banks to rebuild their systems They might not want to do it anyway, but there is   certainly no prospect of accomplishing it ahead of the Y2K date change to accommodate our   current matched sale accounting system   So if we want to pursue the development of a contingency plan--and I want to be very   clear that I’m not certain we can make this work, though I’m hopeful that it could be a     8/24/99 18   useful tool for us--it will depend on some systems we haven’t yet built And it will depend   on the willingness of the dealers to accommodate us late in the day, to change their balance   sheets in response to our needs If there’s too much liquidity in the banking system, they   ought to be willing to do that, but I don’t want to pretend to you that I can go out and make   this happen all by myself However, to do that we would need to adopt the reverse   repurchase authority so that we could do those transactions through tri-parties Given that   we’re not going to be able to put this in our new system for at least a couple of years,   temporary authority to do reverse repos is certainly what we need just to get us through the   fourth and the first quarters But you are on notice that I’m interested in this for the long   run, too We can see how it goes over the turn-of-the-year period   So, I’d like to ask the Committee to amend temporarily the Authorization for   Domestic Open Market Operations to authorize reverse repurchase transactions by adding   the language shown as paragraph 1(c) in Attachment VIII of my August 17 memo    Mr Chairman, turning to Item D, I’d like to ask for temporary   authority to sell options on repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase transactions, and   matched sale purchase transactions through the end of January 2000 The language, which   we will come to, was in Don Kohn’s memo to you of yesterday, which was included in your   packages last night Let me give my views on this and explain why we’re seeking this   authority   As the Chairman said at the outset, there is a small risk of some extreme events at the   end of the year that I think it prudent for us to lean against From my perspective, I’d just   like to offer the view that to a certain extent we are seeing some expectations among market   participants that are already a problem There is a problem now Cathy Minehan referred to   it and the Chairman was alluding to it    Yes, I understand I just want to focus on the problem that we already   see today of growing levels of anxiety and uncertainty on the part of financial   intermediaries, both banks and securities firms, which they are communicating to their   customers in ways that are very unhelpful Let me elaborate on that The banks are telling   their customers “We may apply quotas We may not take your deposits We may give you   a zero or negative interest rate” And securities firms are telling their customers “Don’t   count on us; we may not be able to finance you in the last week of December Go look   elsewhere” And that is creating uncertainties about the functioning of financing markets,   particularly repo markets, in the weeks around the year-end which go beyond the problem   just of how much collateral we can get   One of my motives for this request is to try to put some limit on the upside risk of that   potential development It is not just a quantity issue That is, if the markets are not   functioning--if the dealers are not willing to be on both sides of the market for us in some   depth--regardless of the amount of collateral we’re prepared to extend, we may find it quite   difficult to carry out our objectives So I see appreciable risks that market conditions may   frustrate the Desk’s ability both to add and drain reserves in the period around the year-end   and to keep the funds rate trading around the Committee’s target I feel it would be     8/24/99 20   imprudent of me not to seek your approval for the tools that I believe are necessary for the   Desk to carry out the directive   As I outlined in my memo and as I mentioned, I think, at the May meeting, our having   the ability to write options on repos, reverse repos, and matched sale transactions could be   quite effective In my view it has not just a reasonable prospect but the greatest prospect of   enabling the Desk to carry out its mission in what could be extraordinarily illiquid markets   Whether or not something goes wrong in the markets, we are reasonably certain that these   markets will be very illiquid Now, whether some triggering event or some extreme   circumstance will occur is the risk we’re uncertain about, but I’m reasonably confident that   these markets will not be tame The idea, as my memo explained, is to auction options on   repos and matched sale purchases for exercise during the days or weeks immediately   surrounding New Year’s Day at rates that would be in some band around the Committee’s   fed funds target Now, I want to be candid about a dilemma we face I believe the greatest   impact this device could have is the announcement effect Its secondary impact would be in   actually providing low-cost assurance to the intermediaries that the money markets would   not become dysfunctional and that funds would be available in some band around the   Committee’s target rate However, it would be a measure of success of the program if very   few of these options were exercised If they are purchased, that will give the market some   comfort So if they are exercised, that would be fine; but it would be even better if market   players came to the conclusion that they didn’t need to exercise them   The dilemma is that, while I believe the greatest impact would be in the announcement   effect--at least I hope it would be--I’m not quite sure that we can develop the precise details   of the program I would like to ask you to approve without talking to the dealers I think we   need a candid back and forth flow of discussions with the dealer community on how to   structure this program We have some ideas I outlined them in my August 17 memo But   a practical issue is that we have to put a good face forward and show that we have some   confidence in announcing this and also work out the details with the dealers to make sure   this approach is really practical and will have the intended effect And thus Don’s memo to   you of last night indicates that we seek this rather broad authority--I’ll be candid about that-­  fully understanding that we’ll have to work out quite a few details to make it actually fly   I’d be happy to answer any questions I can about this request     8/24/99 21    If I could respond, President Parry, I think a major difference between   this institution and the private institution you’re referring to metaphorically is that our cost   of covering this option is quite different If a private firm were to write options on   financing, their cost of cover would be market-based They would have to find financing   out in the marketplace That is the risk of options to private participants  In this case, we   would only be writing options on our own balance sheet While there are upside risks in   terms of the growth of our balance sheet, and that’s obviously what I’m trying to constrain,   our cost of cover is not a real constraint I think the challenge for us is how to price the   premium sufficiently low, because in market-based terms we face no real risk here We   have some transactional risks There are risks, I want to be clear, but we don’t face the kind   of risk a private institution would face in providing this service And that is really why it   works at all  If we were a private institution, this would be a very risky undertaking Early   on in my thinking about this--this was a month or so ago--one dealer told me that a customer   approached them and asked them to provide an option on over-the-weekend financing for     8/24/99 23   December 31 The dealer thought about it and said “no” He said there was no premium   they could charge that customer that they would be prepared to have known publicly   because of how they saw the risks In their view, the risk to their reputation was too great   They would have to charge such a high premium that they didn’t want the charge for that   risk known in their customer base For our balance sheet, just the reverse is true It’s hard   to figure out how low to price this because we do not face a market-based risk of covering   the option I do think that makes a considerable difference in a comparison to a private   institution    I’m sure it would be appropriate if I thought we could do it You’ve   seen the confidence interval I have on my estimate of reserve needs for the fourth quarter   It’s around $100 billion I ask you to think for a moment how much better I could do in   trying to anticipate what the use of this program would be, especially where the ultimate   goal is not to have it used Our hope is to minimize the exercising of the options    Obviously, and I think my memo was candid about this, the problem of   setting a reservation price and what we would ask the dealers to bid for in the auction is a   major challenge and one of the primary reasons I want to talk to the dealer community I   think an auction sale is the right approach to take; the problem is how much to auction We   want to have it open; we want to have competitive bidding and a reservation price set quite   low I don’t have an absolute answer on what the right quantity is to auction each day or   how to conduct the auction Again, that is why I want to talk to the dealers So I want to   give you a scenario that’s in my mind but I don’t want you to think that I’m invested in any   one of the details   I would imagine that there would be a two-week period on either side of the year-end   in which the dealers could exercise overnight options either on matched sales, reverse repos,   or repos I’d say that sometime in October we would begin auctioning each day a set   quantity of overnight options for any one of those 20 business days One way of thinking of   the arithmetic would be that we might be prepared to put up to $200 billion on either side of   our balance sheet If we had 40 days’ worth of auctions, we’d be auctioning $5 billion a day   for each of the one-day overnight windows the dealers could bid on I think I will have to   put out some proposal like that as a straw man in talking to the dealers in order to get their   creative juices flowing on how to think about the reservation price  We want to set it very   low, but we don’t want the option to be a free good They will want it because it’s cheap,   but not because it’s free In earlier discussions about this I said I didn’t want them to think   it was as cheap as water, but under the drought circumstance I’ve learned that everything   has a price!   So it would be something like that I’d be tempted to begin discussions by talking   about setting a rather low limit It’s easier to raise the auction limits than lower them in that   environment I’m just trying to think about ways of creating an auction process the dealers   would participate in The idea of having a small amount auctioned each and every day   would be a way to get the dealers to anticipate their demands and not wait until the end--to   try to smooth out their demand and buy a little each day For this to be successful and   involve the right kind of pricing, it is not that I want to see the price start high, but I’d like to   see it trend lower as the market relaxes about the availability of year-end financing   Nevertheless, I want to be clear that I don’t know today what the right limits are I think     8/24/99 26   there are limits There are some very tricky issues we would have to think about, such as   what assets we would be putting out for doing the matched sales and whether we’d be doing   them through tri-parties or through our DVP system, which is why both are mentioned in   Don’s proposed paragraph    I mean to offer these as examples, because I believe the reactions are   likely to be quite diverse The anxieties of the major money center banks, and therefore of   the major bank dealers, tend to be focused on what to do with the surplus cash they’re going   to have They are afraid of being excessively liquid So I think they would likely buy in on   the cash-put collateralized option drawn on us My hope is that that would permit them to   be less obnoxious in talking to their customers about the risks of zero or negative overnight   interest rates on corporate deposit accounts because the banks would be more confident that   they can pay some kind of market-based rate So that’s a behavior we do want to see   changed On the dealer side, the premier dealers in the world have been telling customers   not to count on them for financing around year-end and it’s making their corporate   customers very anxious I think the behavior change we’d like to see among the major   dealers is that they would be less obnoxious in telling their customers to go away and not   count on them to finance their inventory of securities during the last two weeks of   December and the first two weeks of January So those are the two behaviors I know I want     8/24/99 27   to change I agree with you that there are bound to be other behaviors that would change   that I haven’t anticipated But those are the two I’m aiming at; I’m trying to get the   intermediaries to behave more like intermediaries and less like risk avoiders My hope   would be that the markets would behave more as we would like them to    Forgive me for interrupting, but I would like to underscore what Don   just said I think the only reason to do this is to have the dealers pass the benefits through   directly or indirectly There are accounting issues that I'm not going to be able to think   through here as to how this would all work, but we will strongly impress on the dealers that   they are to make the benefits of this available to their customers That’s the purpose of the   exercise It is not to have the dealers sleep better at night while their customers don’t    Could I add a comment?  In your package of charts, page 10 is a   background chart that I did not discuss but would like to point out to you, President Hoenig   I have given some considerable thought to adverse consequences, and the one I’m most   concerned about is whether we would discourage market intermediation in some way when,   in fact, we’re trying to encourage it I’ve at least thought through what the worst perverse   consequences would be if we discouraged market intermediation and arbitrage   opportunities    What the chart shows, starting from October 15 of last year across the   top panel and March 23 of this year across the bottom, are the rates on repos on Treasury     8/24/99 29   collateral in blue, the rates on mortgage-backed securities collateral in red, and the morning   federal funds rate The latter is based on an informal survey we take in the morning that   tells us where funds are trading There is an extraordinary correlation here, which is   wonderful to see; it shows that markets work and arbitrage takes place Most of the spikes   on the chart are at month-end or on Treasury refunding dates or tax payment dates It’s all   rather predictable behavior I’m drawing it to your attention to show that even in the chaos   of last fall, shown at the upper left, the range in which these repo rates moved during the   morning, the most active time of the day, was contained at 425 to 575 percent And that   even includes the period through the year-end last year, and I’m sorry that precise date isn’t   shown So, in my memo I discussed a 150 basis point corridor on either side of the then-  existing funds rate target That’s something we will want to talk about I think it is going to   be hard for it to be any tighter, with the precedent of the special lending facility on the one   hand and the coincidence of the negative 150 basis points, which is our minimum bid when   we lend out securities and put out collateral So if we were to do matched sales and put   collateral out at a tighter spread, I think we would be creating some perversions Now, I   want to be able to talk to the dealers about this and think about it As you can see, the   corridor in which rates actually vary is very narrow So a range of 150 basis points is   considerably wider than the range in which normal arbitrage takes place Therefore, with   respect to the issue of the most perverse unintended consequence, I think anything like the   spreads we’re going to talk about is really going to be the disaster insurance We’re trying   to offer the market disaster insurance to get them more comfortable intermediating within   that range I just wanted to be clear that we’ve done some of the work here    I’m not aware of any that are using this in their management of   domestic interest rates I know the ECB has made a point of saying that they have the   authority to use all instruments; if they want to use options and other derivatives they can   They have often stated that they have the full arsenal of weapons if they need it A number   of central banks use options in their investment activities in foreign currencies, in managing     8/24/99 31   their foreign currency reserves and limiting the risks The Bank of Mexico uses a   nonsymmetric option in its intervention strategy That is, when they’re accumulating   reserves they do it through an option that avoids having their operations exert an impact on   the day’s price In other words, it is always backward looking When the exchange rate   strengthens, they accumulate a few reserves The bank’s exercise of options is one-sided I   may be mistaken, but I’m simply not aware of any central banks that use options for   domestic interest rate management    I think there is that risk today in our money market, which is why   we’re proposing these extraordinary measures As I alluded to earlier, the Bank of Japan   wants to find ways to be sure it can take US Treasuries as collateral when they lend yen to   their banks European banks and others are doing the same thing The world is focusing on   our money markets and financing markets as their adjustment mechanism I think that’s   where some of the pressures are coming from that we’re seeing So, yes, if we’re trying to   address our money market problems, I think there is a risk that the benefits and the demands   will spread beyond our nation’s markets But that’s the reality we confront to begin with, so   I don’t think we can do anything about it    I didn’t mean to say it should be viewed as a risk It may be good that   somebody in this whole world is going to do this But these are the implications    That is even more challenging than the reservation price My guess is   that we will go out with a proposal of $200 billion, as I suggested, telling the market that   with the Committee’s review and approval we might raise that limit if we saw a demand I   would try to go out with a program involving a limited number of contracts per day and tell     8/24/99 32   them they should price accordingly, but give them notice that there’s a risk that the quantity   could be raised if we saw the demand    There’s an interaction of limits and pricing    As I say, it should be low enough so that we are making insurance   available to the market to calm it down but high enough to provide some constraint on   demand    Exactly    It’s my recollection that the publication of the primary dealer list is a   consequence of the New York Fed asking the dealers to report to us their inter-dealer   transactions  The dealers said, in effect, “We’d love to report our inter-dealer transactions;   you just have to tell us who the other dealers are” And that is how we got backed into   having a list It has already occurred to me that we will want to ask the dealers--“ask”   politely--to report to us secondary market transactions on similar contracts so we can keep   track of the pricing     8/24/99 33    It is with that in mind, though my plans are a little inchoate, that I have   thought of auctioning set amounts each day That way there will be a price today, but more   will be coming online tomorrow and more will be coming online the next day    Yes, precisely    Absolutely That is another reason daily auctioning somehow seems   preferable to me    No, I mean to set a minimum price We don’t want people to put in a   bid of zero or $1 at the auction We’d have a minimum or reservation price and they would   bid upward from there    I don’t think so    Because we are uncertain about the supply--whether we are going to   provide an unlimited supply That is, we haven’t yet figured out-­   I just mean that we are talking about a reservation price because we are   uncertain about whether we are going to set an upside limit on the supply and, if so, where   Those are two ways of talking about the same thing I am agreeing with you, I think, Mr   Chairman    I alluded to the timing--probably too briefly--in my memo of August   17 I believe it is very important for us to work with the custody banks, BONY and Chase,   before we go public, so we can set a reasonable date certain on when we could begin tri­  party operations We would propose to begin immediately, tomorrow morning, working   with the two clearing banks in the hope that over the next business week and a half we could   resolve the various issues Then we would be in a position shortly after Labor Day to   announce at least a date certain My hope is that by the first full week of October--for the   reserve management needs I mentioned earlier--we will be laying in the 90-day RPs so that   we could begin tri-party operations in the broader collateral pool then Now, that’s my   hope We want to work out some of the nuts and bolts details with the clearing banks so we   can announce with certainty that we will be doing tri-party operations, using the collateral   pool, and doing 90-day repos   So, a day or two after Labor Day, we certainly will be announcing that we have the   authority We would begin working with the senior leaders among the dealers about the   same time we would be making public that we have this authority and plan to offer these   options We would be developing the details with the dealers, and I would hope to be able   to conduct the auctions on the models I’m roughly thinking of, if not by the first full week   of October, by the middle of October That would give us roughly two months of     8/24/99 35   auctioning until we get to the period when these options are likely to be exercised by the   dealers in the last two weeks of December    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to the package of colored   charts that should be in front of you 1/   I offer the array of forward rates shown in the first chart as a precaution  against any thought that there is a simple, single description of interest rate  expectations, given the pronounced Y2K effects we’re seeing in conjunction with  some shifts in expectations about the outlook around the world In broad brush  strokes, you can see in the top panel of this chart that US rates drifted sideways  after your last meeting and then moved a bit lower before ticking up late last week  on some data releases that suggested continued strength in demand in the US  economy Euro rates have moved up more or less consistently since your last  meeting And they increased quite a bit at the end of last week, as forecasts for Euro  area growth were revised up and as the market became filled with the thought that  the European Central Bank might actually raise rates before the end of this year  Japanese forward rates generally declined throughout the period and were down  substantially until the speculation around the time of the Bank of Japan’s September  21st policy meeting created some noise But clearly, the show was stolen by the  current 3-month Libor rates, which are usually the sleepy flat line at the bottom  As  we moved into the fourth quarter and the end dates of that contract included the turn  of the year--both the December 31st and January 3rd dates--those rates shot up Now,  this may be just a brief effect and may calm down a bit, as we have seen with other  Y2K spikes over the past year I hope so, but I don’t think we know in any way for  certain   There is also, as you can see particularly in the Euro rate chart, a sort of  fanning out of these rates as one reflection of the uncertainty Anecdotally our  traders report, as we have moved into the fourth quarter, increasingly diverse pricing  by our counterparties for a number of instruments--sort of idiosyncratic firm  approaches to pricing for the year-end Some firms think one thing is going to  happen and other firms think something completely different is going to happen So  a lot of the data sources we look at--the data points we take off of Bloomberg, for  example--are going to be the blended averages of some very disparate rates as firms  take increasingly idiosyncratic approaches to the uncertainties about the year-end  And I think we should be even more cautious than usual in interpreting these interest  rate charts   1/ A copy of the material used by Mr Fisher is appended to the transcript     10/5/99 2   Turning to the second page, the top panel shows exchange rates since the start  of the year yen per Euro in green; yen per dollar in red on the left-hand scale; and  dollars per Euro in blue on the right-hand scale Interestingly, the two scales happen  to match in percentage terms with a slightly different location of the decimal When  I look at this chart, what I see is the herding behavior of Japanese institutional  investors rushing back into the yen in the third quarter You can see the shift  beginning at the time of our meeting on June 30th Now, it may be that economic  fundamentals change abruptly with calendar quarters, but to my way of thinking it is  much more likely that it is investor behavior that changes abruptly with calendar  quarters I don’t know what to expect with this change of calendar quarters, but  when I look at the third-quarter picture I see a rush of Japanese investors back into  the yen   The bottom panel depicts 1-month option implied volatilities on each of these  exchange rate pairs If there are anxieties being expressed in foreign exchange  markets, those anxieties to me seem focused on the yen and not the dollar, at least so  far this year As you can see, the green and red yen-based volatilities tracked one  another and spiked as we came to the end of the third quarter The euro/dollar  implied volatilities traded at a rather calm pace   Turning to page 3 and domestic open market operations, during the three  maintenance periods since your last meeting, with the exception of last Thursday  and Friday, the fed funds market behaved in a fairly typical and calm manner The  deviation of the effective rate from the target and the intra-day volatility, expressed  in the standard deviation, were both moderate and similar to the experience of other  recent months Last Thursday, September 30th, was actually a fairly typical month- end day Friday, October 1st, also a day of big flows in the market, was a little less  typical We ended up providing sufficient reserves on the day to have the effective  rate trade on the target, as you can see with the red horizontal tick right on the dotted  line But in doing so we clearly provided a sufficiency of reserves that was more  than the market looked for in terms of the standard deviation, and we had a very  wide trading range and a whopping 60 basis points standard deviation of the trading  range But that’s in effect what it takes to try to get the fed funds rate to trade on  average at the target on a day of volatile payment flows   I’d just note that currency in circulation has continued to grow at a rather  rapid clip of about 10 percent per year That is consistent with the rates we have  seen this year, but well ahead of past years I don’t know about the Board’s staff,  but we have not found any evidence suggesting that consumer demand for currency  is Y2K-related We do see what appears to be some stockpiling of currency by  small banks in anticipation of consumer demand, but we don’t yet see anything we  could pinpoint as indicative of consumer demand for notes   Turning to the next page, the fourth chart depicts spreads on selected longer- term instruments to comparable US Treasuries I included this chart to emphasize  the noticeable impact on September 8th when we announced our special year-end     10/5/99 3   operations and again on September 14th when we had a meeting with the primary  dealers to discuss the details of our operation and get some feedback You can see  that both of those events seemed to have had a pronounced effect, particularly on  mortgage-backed spreads, the 10-year swap spread, and the Fannie Mae benchmark,  but they obviously had hardly any effect on the corporate index I want to be careful  not to overstate the impact Our announcement came just a few days after Labor  Day when traders were coming back and were likely to bring more volume into the  market The backup in spreads that occurred in the thin markets of late August was  going to unwind at some point in September absent some exogenous shock We  may have just provided a bit of the impetus to pull the spreads down a bit--and a  little more quickly than they might have come down otherwise But all in all we  were pleased with the market reaction to our announcement and we received quite a  lot of feedback on it   In the next few pages I have outlined some notes to try to take you through a  number of issues associated with our year-end operations Forgive me for this  format, but I thought it would be the most efficient way With respect to the  expanded collateral, tri-party, and longer-term operations, we’ve now completed the  legal documents The basic operational procedures are in place and we expect in the  next few days to be able to start the tri-party operations with a broader array of  collateral I want to be quite blunt that I think we are going to scuff our knees a few  times as we try to figure out the best way to do this We have different classes of  collateral, and a number of dealers have urged that we provide separate pricing for  each of the major types of collateral  At the same time, there is a difference between  tri-party settlement and fed-wire settlement, and some other dealers want us to price  that We cannot do all of those things at once It would just be an operational rat’s  nest if we tried to do all that So we are going to learn something from doing and  we will just try to get a feel for how we can slice the operations to try to let the  dealers price as efficiently as possible   Another point is that I’d like to announce the pricing details of the Desk’s  temporary operations By tradition, the Desk has not announced the lowest repo rate  at which we operate nor any details of dealer propositions The philosophy has been  that we’re managing quantities of reserves and that there is no operational--and  certainly no policy--significance to this stop-out rate, or lowest rate at which we  operate However, given the intense interest in turn-of-the-year financing rates and  to avoid rumors about rates paid on our operations, I’d like to begin announcing the  details of rates submitted in our operations, both for repos and matched sales It  would be possible to limit these announcements just to those operations that span  the year-end But I think trying to maintain that distinction would be awkward and  probably unsustainable given dealer interest in pricing other time horizons, not just  the turn-of-the-year period Moreover, a number of central banks now routinely  provide this information and, taking a step back and thinking about it, I concluded  that we also should provide this information I would plan to include a review of  this announcement practice in March of next year when we present the Committee  with a complete review of our year-end operations     10/5/99 4   At the top of page 6 I have listed in detail what we propose to announce after  each operation the range of repo rates submitted by dealers; the total volume of  propositions submitted; the stop-out rate, ie the lowest repo rate accepted; the  volume-weighted average of repo rates accepted; and the volume of propositions  that we accepted, and thus the reserves we injected The latter we have been  announcing for some time now We would make similar announcements on the  breakdown of information on matched sales used in reserve draining operations  And, obviously, if we have different classes of pricing, we would make the  announcements for each class of collateral that we price   Turning to the standby financing facility in the options proposal, we received  a number of comments from the dealers and we sent the dealers another revision to  that program last Wednesday, which I circulated to you in memo form last  Wednesday I would plan to announce the details of those auctions also Along  with the results of the auctions, we would provide pricing information to the dealers,  the range of bids submitted, the volume of bids submitted, the lowest bid accepted-­ which in the Dutch auction would be where all awards are priced--and the volume- weighted average of all accepted bids Consistent with our practice of announcing  the amount of reserves injected, we would also plan to announce the dollar volume  of options exercised each day during the period of time when options can be  exercised   We’ve received from the dealer community and from other market  participants a fairly wide range of indications of the potential demand for these  options If one listened to the money market mutual fund managers and some of the  big corporate players in financing markets, one would think we would be writing  $100 billion or $150 billion of these options Making a guesstimate on the basis of  listening to the CFOs of dealer firms, the number of options we would write would  measure roughly in the tens of billions, probably in the several tens of billions If  one listened just to the repo dealers, who are very picky and think these things are  deeply out of the money and rather a nuisance, they suggest that we might need to  provide an amount in the $5 billion to $20 billion range So we have a full range of  reactions from the market Just in the last few days, in response to our revised  proposal, we’ve gotten the sense of the demand going up a little even in the CFO  community--the ones who really do want to take out the flood insurance And I  think we’ve structured this whole package on the premise that we’re going to meet  demand We’re going to sell enough for that constituency to be comfortable So,  we may need to revise up the amounts for our initial auction that I put in the revision  last week and make those a little higher Inevitably, we’re going to need to adjust to  the demand as it becomes evident in the first auction and over the series of auctions  But I’d like to be clear, since meeting demand is one of our objectives, that an  unfilled auction is not going to be an embarrassment but one sign of success We’re  not looking for a high bid-to-cover ratio here but rather the opposite We’re trying  to meet the communities’ demand   After we have launched the expanded collateral and tri-party operations and  the stand-by financing facility auctions on repos, we will then turn our attention and     10/5/99 5   the dealers’ attention to the practicalities of late-day operations and possibly provide  options on matched sale transactions As I noted on the last page of my package,  some dealers and some money market fund managers have continued to press us to  write options on matched sales and reverse repos The longer one scratches the  surface of that, though, it is clear that the impulse behind that request is the desire of  the money market funds to save a few basis points It really isn’t an issue of the  functioning of markets; they’d just rather get a slightly higher rate of return We  will continue to listen to their views once we get the other pieces in place and will  talk about this some more But my interest has shifted to just trying to ensure that  we have the flexibility to add or drain reserves on any day Even some of the money  market fund managers admit that if we are leaving the market roughly in balance  each day, that really addresses their concern, even if we are not addressing their  individual set of leaky pipes, if you will   But if demand for Treasury securities becomes sufficiently high to push the  general collateral rate on overnight repos toward zero for a prolonged period of  time, that could create a negative spillover on confidence and the functioning of  financing markets If that were the case, we might then want to consider  undertaking matched sale or reverse repo transactions in order to add to the supply  of Treasury collateral available in the market But we’d look at the systemic issue  of the functioning of the markets, not whether some money market funds feel they  are missing out on a few basis points in their return   Mr Chairman, we had no foreign exchange operations during the period I  will need the Committee’s ratification of our domestic operations I would be happy  to answer questions on any aspect of my report, including our year-end operations    Earlier this summer we raised the amounts we’re auctioning off through that   program and it is in a sense on autopilot Without getting too far into the arcana, that program   actually is one of the things I’m worried about We price that at a negative spread, 150 basis points   off of the general collateral rate If the general collateral rate were to trade down toward zero   because of the scarcity of Treasury collateral, we could be running with a negative rate there, which   we would have to think through That’s not somewhere we’d want to go While that’s on autopilot   and will be available to the dealers, it really will not address a systemic issue--if, say, all Treasury   securities were trading at such a premium that they were being financed at rates approaching zero   It helps at the margin, but it is not going to be an answer That’s one of the issues of concern We   are consistently providing supply through that program at predictable amounts, which we spent a     10/5/99 6   long time designing it to do The dealers are happy with that If we divert our supply of Treasury   bills into some intervention in the market, we’ll then be crimping what we can put out through that   structured program So that’s exactly one example of the issues that create complexities for us in   the matched sale area    I think two factors are involved that are hard to put one’s finger on Traders   at many different firms have talked to us about the fact that our options program provided them   some relief but in their minds provided the Committee with more flexibility to raise rates in   November and December As I say, they talk about that, but it is hard to find evidence of it in the   fed funds futures pricing The other factor is that as we approached September 30th, a whole host   of contracts--like the 3-month Libor I showed on my first chart--then captured the year-end date   And all sorts of rates traded up in sympathy with that year-end pressure--some rationally and some   maybe not so rationally I think that had a general and pervasive effect on a lot of interest rate   pricing Those are the two stories that I can cite    The dealer firms certainly now feel a little more comfortable that they have   a flexible tool or “flood insurance” to manage their balance sheets at the end of the year I think   that has put them in the position that they can’t turn around and tell their customers, “Gee, we just   can’t do anything for you” It has forced that discussion, rather awkwardly, clearly onto price   That may be having a spillover effect in some of the interest rate markets It is all about price now;   it’s not about availability That’s how I would put it    I’m sorry I got that term in my mind in late August and I should take it out   again I have some neighbors who had some serious flood damage who didn’t have flood   insurance     10/5/99 7    Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to the usual set of  charts and some additional materials that should be on the table in front of you 1/   As usual, the top chart in the package shows the current 3-month deposit  rates implied by traded forward rate agreements Looking at the top panel of the  first chart, you can see that in the United States forward rates continued to back  up after your last meeting and peaked with the release of the CPI on October 19th  They have been declining since then, particularly on the release of third-quarter  GDP data and the ECI Thus, 3-month expected rates for most of next year are  now at the same levels as they were just prior to the Committee’s meeting in  October   In Europe, forward rates have roughly the same pattern, but moved up to  twin peaks on the release of our CPI and the release of Euro area M3 data on  October 27th; they also have come off their peaks Thus, despite a 50 basis point  rate increase on November 4th by the ECB, expected 3-month rates in Europe for  next year are now at the same levels as in early October It seems to me that what  has happened in Europe is that one or two rate increases that for some time had  been expected to occur in the first half of next year have been brought forward  into November of this year and nothing else has changed   In Japan, despite interest in political circles in Bank of Japan policy  meetings, you can see from the bottom panel that forward rate expectations took  quite little notice of those meetings However, there has been an updrift in the  current LIBOR 3-month rate, the black line in that panel This appears to reflect  some increased tiering in yen money markets of the type we have seen in past  years but it is not yet anywhere nearly as severe It also suggests, as I understand  from our traders, some shifting back and forth in views about who will and who  won’t be lending money over the end of the year, causing changes in expected  rates for the turn of the year in Japan   Turning to the second page, the top panel shows 10-year yields in the United  States, the United Kingdom, and Germany On the left side--the little numbers   1/ A copy of the material used by Mr Fisher is appended to the transcript     11/16/99 2   there are basis points--are the 2- to 10-year spreads on July 1st and on the right  side are the 2- to 10-year spreads as of last Friday What I enjoy about this chart  in particular, as it relates to what is of interest to me, is how little I understand  about what’s going on here German and other Continental yields began to rally  just ahead of, but through the release of Euro area M3 data, which to all observers  were higher than expected But the bond markets took off on a nice rally that  continued with the release of our GDP data and then continued through the 50  basis point ECB rate increase Now, this has been explained different ways in  Europe Most have focused on the idea that uncertainty about near-term ECB  intentions has been removed and a related perception that the ECB is now on  hold Another theory is that the ECB has gained credibility by being pre-emptive  and is now ahead of the curve   The first theory uncomfortably suggests to me that the uncertainty premia for  anticipated central bank actions have a larger positive basis point impact on long- term rates than does an actual central bank rate increase For the second argument  about credibility to hold water, Europe would have to be more sensitive to short- term rates than to long-term, because otherwise the decline in long-term yields  would undermine the restraining influence of short-term rates But throughout my  career and through current events, my colleagues in Europe have always told me  that Europe is more sensitive to long-term rates than those silly Anglo Saxon  economies that are so focused on short-term rates So, I am not quite sure how  the credibility argument plays here either   Looking at the United Kingdom, it’s intriguing how the 10-year gilt yield has  marched along with German and other Continental yields despite the fact that  these countries are at very different points in the economic cycle To draw a point  on it, the 2- to 10-year spread in the UK is inverted to the tune of 85 basis points  while the German spread, as you can see, is positive from 2- to 10-years in the  amount of 115 basis points Notwithstanding the economies being at different  points in the cycle, these yields are marching along rather in lock step Maybe the  rally in gilts is what is pulling Continental yields lower   Looking at US yields, I’d just note that with 2- to 10-year spreads having  narrowed from 26 basis points on July 1st to 15 basis points last Friday--and I  think to 12 basis points this morning--one might understand that there are few if  any voices in our bond market who are prepared to join the “bubble-ologists” in  proclaiming that the Fed is behind the curve   Looking down the page, the next three panels depict yield spreads of various  instruments over US Treasuries In the first of these three panels you can see  that the emerging market index spreads to US Treasuries have been narrowing  consistently since last summer’s highs; and they have narrowed by an additional  150 basis points since the October release of the CPI In the next panel you can  see that the spread of the Merrill Lynch high yield index, or junk bond index, to  Treasuries has been relatively stable but has widened recently, moving in just the     11/16/99 3   opposite direction of the emerging market spreads Market talk is focused on an  explicit shift of funds out of US high-yield instruments into emerging market  high-yield instruments and also on increased sensitivity to rising default rates in  domestic high-yield markets Finally, in the last panel you can see that spreads on  10-year swaps and the Fannie Mae benchmark have come off their recent highs of  last summer and returned more or less to the levels of early July And corporate  spreads are off their highs, but are still just a tad wider than in July   Turning to the third page and year-end funding markets, this chart shows the  three components of the current butterfly That is, it depicts the November,  December, and January LIBOR 1-month contracts As you can see, the decline in  the December contract from late October to mid-November has been noticeable  That seems to reflect at least a couple of things coming together First, in an  exaggerated way the December contract follows the same pattern as the  November and January contracts, I think reflecting the ebb and flow of  expectations for rate action by the Committee, particularly following the release  of the GDP and ECI data However, it also seemed to get quite an impact from  our third round of auctions of options on November 3rd and particularly from our  announcement on November 4th that the Desk would hold four more rather than  only two more auctions   Turning to the next page, let me go over the details of each of the auctions  we’ve held The vertical columns give you for each of the three strips the actual  auction amounts, the total propositions, the bid-to-cover ratio, the awards we gave  out or the stop-out rates on a Dutch auction, and the high and low bids Having  told the dealers we would try to meet demand for these options, we felt a need to  respond to the high bid-to-cover ratios of the first two auctions In all cases these  were at rather elevated levels 4 to 1, 47 to 1, 64 to 1, etc So we raised the  amount sharply for the third auction, doubling the amounts for both the turn of the  year strip and for the January strip   While the bid-to-cover ratio came down in the third auction, the stop-out  rates and thus the Dutch awards came in quite high You can see that in the  awards column in the third entry in each panel 11 basis points, 16 basis points,  and 115 basis points So, after the third auction we left the amount for the turn of  the year strip constant at $50 billion but raised the amounts for the surrounding  strips We also announced that we would hold at least four more auctions for a  total of seven, rather than just two more for a total of five   We think this helped calm the dealers and their customers considerably,  as reflected both in the December LIBOR contract and in the much reduced stop- out rates for the fourth auction We’ve reduced the amounts for the fifth auction  to be held tomorrow for each of the three strips to $15, $30, and $20 billion and,  obviously, we will see how the subsequent auctions go     11/16/99 4   Looking forward, as I’ve mentioned previously, I would consider this  operation a complete success if none of these options is exercised The  motivating principle still seems valid to me that the more we sell, the less likely it  is that they will be exercised But there still is a risk that they will be exercised  If relatively small amounts are exercised on any one day for reasons specific to an  individual firm--its own funding position or its own collection of collateral--we  should be able to drain sufficient reserves to manage the impact on the funds rate  that day through our own matched-sales operations But if all, or even substantial  amounts, are exercised on any day it is harder to anticipate the impact on the  funds rate Any shock sufficient to cause a large-scale exercise of these options  can also be expected to have a profound impact on the funds rate and on other  short-term market interest rates So, it is hard to know in advance with any clarity  what it is we would be doing vis-à-vis that day’s funds rate In any event, if such  an exogenous shock were to happen, we would likely be trying to drain reserves  not to manage that day’s funds rate, but to try to moderate the impact on  cumulative excess reserves for the period--the impact over the rest of the period  But that is obviously something we’ll have to decide on a case-by-case basis   Turning to the next page and our more traditional open market operations,  the top panel depicts various forecast scenarios involving a cumulative reserve  drain from currency in circulation Reserve needs have continued to grow  recently--reflecting, it seems to us, typical seasonal growth in currency in  circulation and the strong demand from banks for increased vault cash in  anticipation of Y2K-related demands of the public Shown in the bottom dotted  line of this panel is the New York staff’s previous “low” projection for currency  in circulation We called that a base-case scenario in which we imagined there  would be no Y2K impact The higher dashed line is what we called a “high”  forecast--not a worst case scenario but just a strong Y2K effect The two solid  lines reflect how we’ve revised up both of those forecasts because the actual  levels have come in more or less right on track with our high, but not worst case,  forecast So, we’ve revised up our low forecast for currency by almost $20 billion  for the turn of the year, based on the experience we’ve seen through mid- November   In the bottom panel is a chart depicting the pricing of our long-term RPs Let  me give you a little background on that before I describe the chart We have  conducted five long-term tri-party RPs that run through the turn of the year,  totaling about $27 billion We have done more than 20 overnight and short-term  tri-party RPs In each of these RPs we have separately priced US Treasury  securities, agency debt, and mortgage-backed collateral and have carefully tried to  maintain a consistent relationship between our sense of current market rates for  each type of collateral and our stop-out rates, consciously choosing not to violate  the existing spreads   What is depicted in this chart is the cumulative propositions we’ve received  on all five of these long-term--through the year-end--RPs The vertical axis is the     11/16/99 5   dollar value expressed in millions; therefore, the top amount is $55 billion of  collateral propositions Across the horizontal axis is the deviation of the rates  given us from our sense of where market rates were for each type of collateral  So, the lower left corner represents 4 basis points above where we think market  rates are and, moving across that axis, the progression goes to 44 basis points  below our sense of market rates   In the table at the bottom is listed the collateral we accepted--about $137  billion of Treasuries, $22 billion of agency debt, and $105 billion of mortgage- backed collateral On average, our stop-out rate has been about 4 basis points  below our sense of where market rates were Now, some observers in the markets  have been disturbed about the quantity of Treasury collateral we have taken off  the market--$13 billion--through our year-end operations I felt pretty strongly  that we should not be disturbing the existing spread relationships unless we made  a very conscious decision to do that So we have been trying to take collateral as  the dealers have priced it And the fact of the matter is that the dealers have  shown us very lackluster--and they will concede greedy--pricing, particularly on  agency debt and to some extent on mortgage-backed collateral They have been  more aggressive in pricing the Treasury collateral to us We will continue to be  disciplined about this At some point the time may come when in order to calm  widening spreads we might intentionally change our behavior and take  disproportionate amounts of agency and mortgage-backed collateral My sense at  this point is that we would probably do that by simply reverting to one pricing In  that case the three types of collateral would all be given to us in one set of  propositions, which would automatically advantage the higher yielding collateral  But so far we’ve taken the spreads as we have found them rather than taking on  the job of setting the spreads ourselves   Finally, on the last page you can see that in the period since your last  meeting the fed funds rate has traded slightly on the soft side except in the last  couple of days, even though daily volatility has been relatively contained For my  taste, there appear to be too many unsatisfying explanations for this softness  rather than any single persuasive one Many have focused on our novel long-term  operations and the general perception that we will be generous about year-end  funding, but that doesn’t quite get me far enough to explain the softness in the  first two maintenance periods   In the last couple of days funds have been quite firm, and yesterday we had  an elevated effective rate of 56 percent, even though we had $10 billion of excess  reserves on the day But yesterday was quite an extraordinary day We had a  Treasury refunding, a minor corporate tax date, some security problems at Bank  of New York that delayed the close of the securities wire, and moves of 1/16th or  1/8th or so in the market in anticipation of Committee action today All those  factors contributed to a rather elevated rate yesterday And the hangover from  yesterday is with us today as the funds rate is trading at 5½ percent     11/16/99 6   Mr Chairman, we had no foreign exchange intervention operations during  the period I will need the Committee’s ratification of our domestic open market  operations and, of course, I’ll be happy to answer any questions    They would give us notice of exercise We would then do RPs with   them through the tri-party vehicle Anyone who exercised an option would have to deliver   collateral to the custody banks And we would then be putting out the funds to them through the   custody banks    Yes On the reserve adding side, we have looked at this to make sure   we have the capacity to do it We are still reviewing it but we think we can handle the exercise   of the options with no problems The question is going to be how many matched sales we can do   if we want to drain all the reserves back out again We are working on that There is a limit on   our bill portfolio Our traditional means of doing this is just against bills; we are mostly geared   up to do matched sales against bills, which involve easier pricing than against coupon securities   That is one issue we are looking into We are also looking into whether we can do matched sales   or reverse repos through the tri-party agents, as I mentioned at previous meetings There are   operational issues that are throwing some sand into the gears--which we had a faint fear of   before--causing us concern as to whether that will actually work The bigger constraint, I feel, is   whether we could do as much as $150 billion or $200 billion of matched sales to drain out the   reserves we’ve put in But I think it is possible that we will be able to drain amounts of around   $100 or $125 billion or maybe even $150 billion It will be a complicated operational exercise to   do it But we think the capability is there on both sides The quantity of the reserves to be   drained back out is the issue, not the exercise of the repos in the first instance    Absolutely That is just what I meant by my remarks that our   focus will really be on the impact on the cumulative average of excess reserves in the period As   to whether we will actually drain them all out that one day, I doubt it But we will try to if what     11/16/99 7   is involved is the sort of exogenous shock that you are imagining That is just what I meant We   would not be pretending that we know where the funds rate should be trading or that we are   trying to target it   Now, to get the scaling right, it’s important to keep in mind that the total balances   traded in the funds market run about $15 to $25 billion daily; $25 billion is more likely at year-  end Who knows what the upper range of the repo market is? But $600 billion and up is the   turnover in the repo market, so the scale there is quite extraordinary It is possible that once we   announce significant exercise of these options, the fed funds traders will realize the rate is going   to go to zero regardless of any exogenous shock That is, we will smother whatever pricing up   for fear may be there That is going to be in the minds of the fed funds traders and the bank   treasurers and it is very hard to anticipate    That is a likely scenario    Yes    It is the vault cash that clearly has exhibited an extraordinary buildup   As for the rest, we think of it as a slightly stronger than usual seasonal impact but still in the   range of the normal seasonal increase    Yes I wanted to elaborate a little on Louise Roseman’s memo to   Don Kohn about the unresolved difference between the internal accounting records of the   Markets Group Accounting and Control Unit and those reflected in the Integrated   Accounting System regarding the System’s net interest accruals on foreign currency   investments I thought it would be helpful if I gave a couple minutes of background, if you   will bear with me   Last spring, as members of the Committee will recall, we entered into a series of   transactions with the ESF to re-balance our euro and yen holdings so we could come to a   better split both in terms of total holdings and the currency mix This involved a number of   transfers of ownership of a series of investments and resulted in quite a significant amount   of accounting activity In the course of reviewing that, our own accounting staff identified   an error that had been introduced in the prior year in our treatment of the premium on bonds   held in the accrual account, overstating the accrual account by about $5 million In the   course of confirming that, they identified an additional $266 million overstatement in the   accrual account for interest on foreign currency investments We have had a number of staff   members working full time trying to trace the source of that $266 million overstatement   They have worked back through the records to December 1994, before which detailed   records at the transaction level just no longer exist due to the routine and appropriate   destruction of documents   The Board examiners were at our Bank to conduct an examination of the System   Open Market Account in September and PricewaterhouseCoopers also has looked over our   methodology to try to trace this overstatement back through time and find its source   PricewaterhouseCoopers is confident that we have traced it back as far as we can They     12/21/99 2   have tested our work papers and agree with our conclusion that we simply can’t go back any   further   There are two possible causes of this overstatement that we have to confront One is   the diversion of funds and the other is error Now, we cannot rule out the possibility of a   diversion of funds But people from our own audit function and from Pricewaterhouse-  Coopers have reviewed the control procedures we’ve had in place for the last decade and are   very comfortable with the conclusion that these control procedures are sufficiently robust   that the likelihood of diversion is remote It cannot be ruled out, but for diversion to have   occurred it would have had to involve the collusion of many people--just an extraordinary   number of people--on several different staffs If anything, our control procedures run a little   to the “belt and suspenders” direction in regard to control of the flow So, there is   reasonable confidence that no diversion of funds occurred The much more likely cause is a   simple accounting error  The failure to credit the accrual account when cash was received   would have left this account overstated But we have worked the accounting back as far as   we can take it and cannot find the erroneous entry or entries   Dave Sheehy, the New York Fed’s General Auditor, and I are both looking into a   fundamental reappraisal of our control procedures We have introduced an additional   mechanical check to maintain detailed records of the accrual stream by instrument, so that   when a final principal payment is received we can trace the record all the way back on each   instrument and double check the accounting   More fundamentally and more importantly, what troubles us is how we could have   gone for so many years without scrubbing this account more vigorously That is something   we are looking into and we are going to be revising our control procedures--both the audit   procedures and those in our own Markets Group The Board’s staff and our accounting   function at the New York Fed have worked out an accounting treatment to correct for both   the $5 million and the $266 million errors That involves reducing the accrued interest   asset account by the entire $316 million, with an offsetting reduction in interest income on   foreign currency investments We will make that adjustment before the end of the year and   spread it among all the Reserve Banks Of course, for all of us with responsibilities for   SOMA this is an embarrassing, indeed humbling, event As a technical matter, though, I   understand that PricewaterhouseCoopers is comfortable with the conclusion of both our     12/21/99 3   accounting and audit function and the Board staff that this is not a material event for   purposes of disclosure for any Reserve Bank I would be happy to try to answer any   questions    No, there is not    Yes, we have looked into that Many of the staff people are still at   the Bank, though others are not But we have found nothing of that nature    We only know that the difference existed prior to December 1994    The details certainly don’t exist for pre-December1994 records, so I   don’t know how we could determine the beginning point--in 1973 or 1963 or where Prior   to 1994, the only interest income we were receiving in that account was coming from the   BIS, the Bundesbank, and the Bank of Japan So the source of the income was official   institutions It was really a very simple accounting process to bring that income in at that   point; the complexities have been introduced since that time So, as I say, Pricewaterhouse-  Coopers and our audit function are confident in looking over the control procedures we have   had in place that it’s implausible that a diversion could have occurred But we cannot rule it   out    Turning to the packet of colored charts,1/ page 1 depicts  the rates implied by forward rate agreements As you can see in the top  panel, in the period since your last meeting forward rates rose steadily  until the release of the employment report on December 3rd when the  market reacted to a lower-than-expected average hourly earnings figure,  and the forward rates came off a little The rates then bounced backed up  again on the release of retail sales data, reaching highs for the year   1/ A copy of the material used by Mr Fisher is appended to the transcript (Appendix 1)     12/21/99 4   In the middle panel you can see that euro forward rates continued to  follow the movement in dollar forward rates I think I have been harping  on this all year, but let me say it one more time  To me, the most  unnerving thing in markets today is not the state of equity markets, the  dollar/yen relationship, or the weakness of the euro, but rather the extent  to which European interest rates at the short end follow the peaks and  valleys of US forward rates I find it, as I say, unnerving that those rates  fall even as the ECB raises rates and rise when we raise rates  It is really  very odd and hard to understand   In Japan, as you can see in the bottom panel, the forward rates backed  up in mid-November But this time the Nikkei was rallying and there was  increasing anticipation of a strengthening recovery By mid-November  the 9-month forward 3-month rate, which as of now covers the fourth  quarter of next year, had doubled since October But with the release of  third-quarter GDP numbers and the Tankan Survey, those rates began to  wind down a bit However, I should note that Bank of Japan officials have  been candid, if muted, in explaining that they are beginning to look for an  exit strategy from their zero interest rate policy, and that is seeping out  into the markets a bit So there is still a bit of lift in the Japanese forward  rates   Turning to our extraordinary year-end operations, on the next page  you can see that we have completed the auctions of options on repos, with  the final auction held on December 1st If you scan down the page in the  columns labeled “total propositions,” “bid-to-cover ratio” and “awards/  stop-out rate,” you can see that those numbers were generally declining  over the course of the auctions In our view that reflected the fact that we  did what we said we were going to do We tried to meet demand--maybe  not each and every last bid, but the serious bids for these options The one  exception to the general decline in these numbers was the last auction of  the January 6 strip, as can be seen in the very bottom line Total  propositions jumped up from $36 billion in the prior week to $43 billion,  the bid-to-cover ratio backed up, and the stop-out rate backed up a little  from 2½ to 4 basis points I don’t want to make too much of that, but I  think it reflects an epiphany of something going on in the markets The  closer we come to the end of the year, the more the anxieties and  uncertainties seem to be about the first two weeks of January--what will be  on the other side of the great divide of the millennium--and less about  liquidity in late December That is progress at least in one sense   Turning to the next page, in the top panel you can see the cumulative  reserve drain from currency in circulation The two red dot-dash lines  reflect the same projections--labeled “high” and “moderate”--I showed  you last time In the middle line I’ve shown the actual experience to date     12/21/99 5   and our current projection That current projection is running a little  closer to the high end than to the low end of our previous range of  projections Most of this still reflects growth in vault cash, although we  do see some outflows to meet consumer demand that is higher than in  prior years We don’t know whether to attribute that to Y2K or not, but  we are beginning to see a little of the cash seeping out   In the middle panel are the New York Bank staff’s estimates of free  reserves or reserve needs through year-end, including yesterday’s  operations but not yesterday’s actual performance As you can see, this  produces about a $42 billion need from here to year-end, not including  whatever excess reserves we may need to put in on the last day, which  might be around $10 billion So, from this point to year-end in our current  forecast it looks as if we will need to provide about $52 billion more   This past August, I suggested to you that we might face reserve needs  from then forward of about $100 billion, with a band of uncertainty of  $100 billion--$50 billion on either side of that estimate At that point in  August we had an underlying need of about $8 billion Since then we  have purchased just under $10 billion outright and have done $60 billion  in term operations through the turn of the year So on the present course,  dating back to August and adding in the $50 billion for uncertainty, we are  at about $120 billion That’s roughly our estimate of reserve needs from  where we were in August through year-end   Looking toward the end of the year, some of the market estimates of  year-end financing for mortgage-backed collateral that we were hearing  about--and we were calculating ourselves--were coming close to and  sometimes over 7 percent, which is the strike price for our options That  began to catch our attention After thinking about it, we executed two  forward transactions for the turn-of-the-year weekend We thought we  would take on in advance some of the mortgage-backed collateral that  might be looking for financing over the century date change Our  reasoning was as follows If it was going to be exercised as an option  around the turn-of-the-year, we would have been taking it on anyway, so  why not do it in advance?  Also, as we thought more about it, we decided  this would be an opportunity for price discovery both for us and for the  market   Let me take you through this bottom panel on page 3, which  represents a bit of the evolution of estimates of term financing On the far  left, you can see that the implied turn-of-the-year repo rates from our term  operations on October 8th were about 7 to 7½ percent for Treasuries, 10 to  12 percent for agency securities, and 11½ to almost 14 percent for  mortgage-backed securities Now, I want to be clear that a lot of heroic  assumptions are built in here There were uncertainties about Committee     12/21/99 6   policy and one had to make estimates of where other financing rates would  be But these are fairly typical of where most people in the market  thought turn-of- the-year financing rates were, understanding they might  be a little overstated In the second column you can see the comparable  implied rates from our longer-term operations on December 17th   The next two columns are the bid and offer rates taken off broker  screens yesterday for Treasury and agency collateral And on the far right  are the rates, taking the high proposition and the low proposition, in the  two turn-of-the-year RPs we executed Both came in a little lower than  the rates on broker screens The high bid was 627 percent and the low bid  was 45 percent on the first five-day RP we did for the turn-of-the-year  period; 638 and 525 percent were the comparable rates on the second  one I think the tightening up in the second operation actually just  reflected the market coming to a sense of the pricing The low bidders in  the first operation were wishful thinkers, hoping financing would be that  low So, I view it as a sort of healthy bunching up But looking at these  rates again does suggest to me that more of the uncertainty the market is  pricing for is in the early days in January, not just the century rollover  date Some of the assumptions we have been making are probably in  error, in that they attribute much of the premium just to December 23rd;  more of it is probably an uncertainty premium for the initial days in  January One way to put it is that the market may believe that we can  keep financing rates low on any one day in light of our operations, but it  may be harder to believe that for the first two weeks of January   Finally, the last page depicts how the fed funds rate has traded since  your last meeting The upper right section shows the maintenance period  surrounding Thanksgiving In that period we had a slightly elevated funds  rate as we faced pressures typical of the turn of the month and of  Thanksgiving, especially when it comes so close to the beginning of  December   In the next maintenance period, from December 2nd to 15th, we leaned  rather heavily in the direction of generosity, with the 15th being the end of  the maintenance period and a tax payment date We wanted to be very  certain not to have firm rates on that day, which might set us up for the  end of the year So we were quite generous in providing excess reserves  from the early through the middle part of the period Then we worked  down the period average excess to just $11 billion, as you can see, but  that gave us some soft rates over the last few days of the interval That  was intentional on our part   That is all I have to report We conducted no foreign exchange  operations in the period I would be happy to answer any questions     12/21/99 7    It may just be a relative issue in that anxieties about the last few days   of the year, when people thought markets would be most illiquid, have gone away So   relatively speaking, the state of anxiety, whatever it may be, is now about the first ten days   of January    Yes, it was just shifted out into the new year There are certainly a   number of people who are more worried about the state of settlements and heavy volume   after an accumulation of slow days If the whole system gets as sticky as molasses, the   problem is not going to be on January 3rd and 4th; it is going to be on the 6th or the 10th if   everyone is being a little too cautious I think that is where a lot of anxieties are focused   There are a number of other markets in the world where, notwithstanding when banks are   closed for holidays, the authorities have not been as vigilant as we have tried to be in   making sure the banks do not de facto close down the markets Some small non-euro   European countries have allowed their banks simply to declare the first ten days not good   value days for foreign exchange transactions, for example, even though the banks are going   to be open So their retail customers can walk in the door and take out money, but their   corporate customers can’t get their foreign exchange trades settled That’s the sort of thing   that is gnawing at confidence about those first ten days     12/21/99 8    Could I just give a perspective from the market?  In my view, if you   put out that statement, it’s like putting up a neon sign that says “Coming soon A big   change in our bias!” I just don’t think the market is going wait and give you a chance to   draft a well crafted press release  The crescendo of interest in that, I think, is going to be   extraordinary     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the  package of materials in front of you, which includes charts and some  text1  First, I will briefly review interest rate developments and ask for  ratification of our domestic operations  Then I would like to go over  some background material in anticipation of Item 2C on the agenda,  which encompasses the two items on which I am seeking a Committee  vote                                                          1 A copy of the material used by Mr Fisher is appended to this transcript              - 4 -     The chart on the first page depicts three-month deposit rates  implied by forward rate agreements  As you can see in the top panel,  forward rates have moved little on balance since the Committee’s  previous meeting  They rose a bit on the Chairman's Humphrey- Hawkins testimony and came off a little toward the end of March,  around the time of the strong revision in fourth-quarter GDP  But I  have a hard time understanding the causal connection there, which is  why I didn’t include the GDP release date as a trip wire on the chart  It  does seem that there has been a slight increase over the intermeeting  period at the short end of the forward rate curve, that is, the three- month forward three-month rate, whereas the nine-month forward  three-month rate--the top line--has really not moved at all on net  I  think the one thing that could be said about market expectations is that  the markets are anticipating a little more action from the Committee  sooner, but the same net amount over the next twelve months     As you can see in the euro area panel, the one in blue, the ECB   raised rates 25 basis points last week and their forward rates declined  ever so slightly  I think that may reflect something of the same  phenomenon in that the ECB was moving a little sooner than the  market had been expecting  In this case that might be reducing  slightly the amount of tightening the market is looking for further out   But there is a lot of noise in these rates, with a lot of seesawing back  and forth  I think the ECB is being unfairly treated  On the one hand,  a lot of analysts are saying that the ECB is confused, lost, and  hopeless  On the other hand, there is clearly a germ of truth in that  assessment  Members of the policy committee are bringing out their  disagreements in the public domain  That there is disagreement is very  evident; the markets are not mistaken about that       In the bottom panel, you can see the slight upward drift in   Japanese forward rates since the release of their fourth-quarter GDP  data  Over the last few weeks Japanese officials have been talking up  the prospects for growth while trying to talk down the currency  That  is giving people in the markets a bit of a headache  The Bank of Japan  has intervened since your last meeting--directed by the Ministry of  Finance--buying a total of 94 billion dollars and 700 million euros  over the period      Turning to page 2 and developments in the fed funds market, it’s   clear that we've had a rather quiet time of it since your last meeting   The fed funds market has been remarkably well behaved, with some  modest and predictable volatility at the end of maintenance periods, at  month-end, and at tax dates  So, we have the pleasure of reporting that              - 5 -     the effective intermeeting funds rate was 575 percent  It's nice to be  both good and lucky!     Mr Chairman, there were no foreign exchange operations since   the last meeting, so at this point I would be happy to answer questions  on this portion of my presentation and seek the ratification of our  domestic operations since the last meeting       Mr Chairman, turning to page 3 of my handout, I have  outlined some significant changes in conditions in the fixed-income  markets over recent months  Coincident with the inversion of the long  end of the yield curve, daily volatility of the 30-year bond has risen  above the volatility of both the 5-year and 10-year notes  Ten-year  credit spreads have widened to their 1998 highs and beyond; and ten- year spread relationships among private credits have become much less  stable  The bid-ask spreads on Treasury securities have widened  And  the scarcity value of Treasury securities can be seen in lower overnight  repo rates  I have included on the next three pages several charts that I  will use to discuss each of these points       The top panel of page 4 simply shows for background the yields on   5-year, 10-year, and 30-year U S Treasuries since January of 1992   The middle panel depicts the daily volatility of US Treasuries on a  rolling 50-day interval basis, annualized  You can see the rather  extraordinary spike in the volatility of 5- and 10-year notes after the  Russian moratorium that was associated with the unwinding of Long- Term Capital Management’s positions  What is worth noting is the  little blip in the red line on the far right side of the chart, showing that  for the first time in eight years the volatility of the 30-year bond is  higher than that of either the 10-year or the 5-year notes     The bottom panel depicts the correlation of daily changes in   Treasury yields  Again on the right-hand side you can see the  extremely rapid breakdown in the correlation of movements between  the 5-year and 30-year issues--the dark blue line--and the 10-year and  30-year issues--the red line  On the one hand, looking at this with the  benefit of hindsight, we can say that this type of breakdown is an  entirely predictable consequence of an inversion of the yield curve  As              - 6 -     that process gets under way, we would expect to see such a breakdown  in correlations within the yield curve  However, while that is certainly  true, the market does not have the benefit of hindsight when it  experiences this  And the abruptness of these changes and the rapidity  of this breakdown are really a very dramatic altering of pricing  relationships that the market has relied on for many years  So, I think  the suddenness of the breakdown needs to be understood as partly  reflecting the fact that the market is not seeing this breakdown in  relationships to the 30-year bond as a transient event, as perhaps some  of the other episodes of volatility across the page were  There is a real  question in the minds of market participants as to whether relationships  with the 30-year bond will be re-established to levels that have been the  norm for the last quarter of a century        In the top panel on the next page are three credit spreads to the    10-year Treasuries  A corporate spread, using the Merrill Lynch A-2  index, is shown in red; a swap spread is in dark blue; and an agency  spread, with the Bloomberg index of noncallable debt--that is, their  straight 10-year debt--is in light blue  You can see that recently these  spreads have widened out to and beyond the levels they reached in the  fall of 1998  Looking now at the whole eight years’ worth of data, the  adjustment of spreads since 1998 looks to me much less like a one- time shock or even a series of shocks and a little more like a resetting  of spreads at higher levels  Indeed, since the fall of 1998, all three of  these spreads have traded at roughly double the averages that had  prevailed from 1994 to August 1998  It’s a little under that, but a  rough approximation is that those spreads have almost doubled     Clearly, some of this can be attributed directly to the decline in  Treasury yields resulting from the cutbacks in Treasury issuance,  particularly more recently  But I also think there is an indirect impact  of the supply/demand imbalance on the confidence with which market  participants price credit risks  One way I have tried to think of it is  that the changed supply outlook for Treasuries has introduced a fair  amount of noise into the Treasury yield curve  As a consequence, the  efficiency of our most basic measurement device for credit risk has  been significantly disturbed  And in that environment, one might  expect a heightened uncertainty premium to be built into all credit  spreads  And at least in part, I think that is what we are looking at in  the top panel     In the middle panel I have depicted the correlation of weekly  changes in the spreads of the corporate swap and agency indexes to the  10-year Treasury  Again, you can see that the Treasury/agency  breakdown is rather abrupt  In the bottom panel is depicted what I              - 7 -     think of as the “intramural correlations” of the three indexes--the  private credits--to each other  And there the breakdown is even more  extreme, particularly for the corporate/agency index      What I want to be clear about is that this result did not surprise me  when I looked at charts like this for the 30-year area, given what has  happened to 30-year rates with the inversion of the yield curve  But  this is the 10-year sector  I think the extremity of these moves and the  breakdown in the intramural pricing of credit within the private sector  is really an extraordinary shift for the market to adjust to  Some of this  may reflect market efforts to take on agencies in lieu of Treasuries as a  hedging device, thus creating a fair bit of noise  But I think that’s a  very imperfect part of the story on which to rest too much of the  explanation  There are also very complex interactions between the  swap curve and the agency market, given how much the agencies rely  on the swap market for laying off their duration risks and their callable  debt risk  So, this is an area where these relationships are breaking  down, and market participants really are not certain when more normal  spreads can be expected to reassert themselves or in what form  predictable relationships might come back into play     Turning to page 6, the top panel shows the yield curve for 5-year,  10-year, and 30-year Treasury securities since 1997 as background for  the bottom two panels  In the middle panel are the mean bid-ask  spreads for 10-year and 5-year Treasuries  You can see the spike in  those spreads in the fall of 1998 after the Russian moratorium  And it  is clear that since the end of last year they have been drifting up again,  with a very sharp spike on the day of the quarterly refunding  announcement, which was also the day of your last meeting  So, these  spreads are widening a bit     Shown in the bottom panel are the 10-day moving average and    30-day moving average Treasury overnight repo rates less the fed  funds rate  The question this panel addresses is  How many basis  points relative to each morning's fed funds rate does Treasury  collateral in the repo market command?  As you can see, we have been  getting lower lows, somewhat more volatility, and in general slightly  more valuable Treasury collateral relative to the morning funds rate  over the last six or seven months compared with most of 1997 and  1998     Turning to page 7, as I explained in my memorandum to the  Committee of March 13th, in order to serve the System’s portfolio  objectives and to avoid exacerbating the supply/demand imbalance for  Treasury securities, it is my recommendation that we should take              - 8 -     several steps  First, I believe we should begin to moderate our reliance  on net additions to holdings of Treasury securities as the sole means of  accommodating the upward trend in the asset size of the System’s  balance sheet We should evaluate all plausible asset classes and  operating techniques that could be appropriate alternatives to Treasury  securities for the System Open Market Account (SOMA)  As I  outlined in my memo, I think we would want to look at both the  advantages and disadvantages of individual assets and carefully  consider them from the System's perspective in terms of how well they  suit our purposes  And separately, we need to consider the impact our  operating in those assets would have on the evolution and behavior of  credit markets  Until the Committee can thoroughly consider  alternative asset allocations for SOMA, my recommendation is that we  should rely on long-term temporary operations to meet the growth and  underlying reserve needs that cannot comfortably be met by further  outright purchases of Treasury securities  In so doing I would  recommend that we distribute our demand for collateral as broadly as  possible so as to minimize our impact on spread relationships     On page 8 I have outlined some specific plans that were also set   forth in my memo  I suggest that we set a target of no more than 35  percent--and a firm ceiling of no more than 40 percent--for System  holdings of any one issue of Treasury bills And I would manage our  auction participation accordingly  This buffer would allow for the ups  and downs of Treasury issuance from quarter to quarter; as you know,  there is some volatility there  At this point, I would plan no outright  purchases of bills  However, after we get through the April tax season  and look at the likely size of bill issues, we could evaluate whether we  would be able comfortably to acquire more of those issues of which  we hold significantly less than 35 percent  I want to say that this is a  possibility to consider cautiously because I don’t think we want to  whipsaw the bill market by coming in and buying an issue only to run  it off at the next auction     In coupon holdings, I suggest that we continue to roll over existing  holdings at auction but monitor the impact of the Treasury's buyback  program and the changes in note and bond sizes on our percentage  holdings of individual coupon issues  As my memo explains, I don't  think that is an immediate concern, but it is something that we need to  keep an eye on  Also, I suggest that we adopt a try-and-see approach  to meet a portion of our underlying reserve needs through outright  purchases of around $20 billion over the rest of this year, spread  evenly across the coupon curve  And finally, I suggest that we meet  the balance of underlying reserve needs with the rolling book of term  repos, accepting Treasury securities, straight agency debt securities,              - 9 -     and mortgage-backed securities as collateral and pricing them  separately as we have since last October     Finally, on the last page, Mr Chairman, I reiterate the questions I  posed in my memo for Committee members to consider  First, are  there particular issues or concerns that members think the study that  Don and I are planning on alternative assets for SOMA should  address?  If so, we would welcome any comments of suggestions  regarding particular assets that should be looked at or topics that  should be covered  Secondly, are members comfortable with my  35/40 rule for bill holdings?  And thirdly, what are members’ views on  the desirability of further coupon purchases this year?  In particular,  are members comfortable with the approach I have spelled out?     At this point I am seeking votes on two proposals, Mr Chairman   First I ask that the suspension of paragraphs 3 through 6 of the  Guidelines for the Conduct of System Operations in Federal Agency  Issues, adopted on August 24, 1999, be extended through the period  until the first FOMC meeting in 2001  Secondly, I request that  paragraph 1(c) of the Authorization for Domestic Operations, which  permits the use of reverse repurchase agreements, be retained as a  permanent amendment to the Authorization       My suggestion is that I attempt first to answer questions on my  presentation and my memo  Then the Committee could vote on the  issue of the Guidelines, the first of these two proposals  After the  discussion and vote on that issue, I would then cover the more  technical questions relating to the use of reverse repurchase  agreements      That is correct     I have tried to structure this proposal in a way that allows for an exit   strategy, but I take your point, Mr Chairman   Maybe I did not say it bluntly enough in my   written materials, but I see the Committee as having a very difficult choice to make  One choice   is to create a wrenching and straining experience for the US Treasury market currently by   placing the entire weight of our demand there, which would cause dislocations in credit markets   more generally  But that has to be weighed against the scenario that you spelled out  I don't   deny at all the plausibility of your concern and the Treasury’s concern; the scenario that you laid   out is one that might come to pass  But in my view, if we put the full weight of our demand on   the US Treasury yield curve for the next six or seven months, we could create equally   disturbing--or perhaps greater--stresses than those that would arise from a gradual rolling off of   diversified RPs in agency securities              - 11 -       There are no substitutes  There is US Treasury debt  There is   straight agency debt, which we have been taking for a long time--that is, the debt securities of   Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and other agencies  And there are mortgage-backed securities,   including Ginnie Maes, which we have only been taking since October of last year  So for us to   go back and place the full weight of our demand exclusively on Treasuries would be unwinding   much more than just what we have done since last October  That would involve unwinding   practices that have been used since--I couldn't give you the date  I was probably trading baseball   cards!     I have reserve needs by June of $30 billion  The hypothesis you are   offering is relying exclusively on Treasuries to meet this?     We would create, if the Committee approves what I'm suggesting, a   rolling book of 30-, 60-, and 90-day forward RPs of rather modest size  Small amounts would   mature every day, so we would ladder in what we would accept in each case of Treasury, agency   debt, and mortgage-backed collateral  And we would take the relative pricing that the Street   gives us to avoid disturbing the spreads Our experience with longer-term RPs is that we get   mainly agency debt and mortgage-backed collateral but very little Treasury collateral  In fact,   our ability to get Treasury collateral currently decays after overnight  That is, we get mostly   overnight Treasury collateral  As soon as we are talking about 3-day or 4-day RPs, the Street   does not want to give us Treasury collateral  This involves just a rolling buildup and it could be   unwound, I think, without causing any shock over any one week or even a one-month period  It   would roll off rather gracefully, if that is what the Committee wanted     We have a $20 billion underlying reserve need now  We face   significant reserve demands in April because of the tax season  I would hope to have this issue   resolved before we hit the tax season, frankly, to give us some flexibility     Yes, my issue  I would like the flexibility to take a look across all the   assets and have a broader pool--     Let me just make sure I understand  In this case by “issue” you mean   the issue of the Treasury’s sentiment toward federal agency issues on the Federal Reserve’s   balance sheet?      No, it will not be perceived as permanent  It is Don’s intent and mine   to try to get back to the Committee as soon as we can in the fall with a completed study and to   put this whole subject on the table  We think there is a lot of staff work to be done  It will   involve the disciplined task of comparing assets and coming up with the principles and criteria   regarding what assets the System should hold  Our intention is to put that on the table as soon   after Labor Day as we can  And our understanding is that the outer limit will be the first meeting   of 2001   Putting aside the relationship of the agencies to the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet,   one other aspect that motivated my request in my memo and presentation is that I think we have   to begin to moderate our exclusive reliance on Treasury securities for the underlying growth in   the asset side of our balance sheet  That has nothing to do with the agencies  That has nothing to   do with repos versus outright purchases  We have by tradition relied on outright purchases to   meet the growth in demand for currency in circulation, which as it grows forces the growth on   the asset side of our balance sheet     Mr Chairman, I am referring to this year  We would be buying   somewhere between $40 and $60 billion of Treasuries if we followed our previous norm  That is   not a way-out forecast  That is a reasonable number in the circumstances  Last year we bought   $45 billion  The Treasury market exploded on February 2nd when the Treasury announced it   was going to buy back $30 billion of its debt  The Japanese have bought $48 billion over the last   12 months  The collective monetary authorities keep siphoning assets out of this market and that   contributes to very bizarre behavior  That is my biggest worry  I urge the Committee to   understand that     Absolutely    That’s certainly one of the alternatives  It would be possible for the   Committee today to give the Desk the authority to go to the full extent allowed statutorily  The   Federal Reserve Act would permit us to do foreign currency swaps; it also allows us to take on   state and municipal debt in anticipation of revenues--so there is a limit set on state and local debt    We could do all those things  You could authorize that!  I’m not sure I could go out tomorrow   morning and actually begin to carry out such a decision, given the mechanics of the market, and   I’m not sure we would know what the consequences would be  And that, I think, is Don’s point   and mine  We care about the consequences There are some other alternatives, but we want to be   careful to avoid the law of unintended consequences in jumping into them  We have been taking   agency debt, the straight debt, for many, many years  And adding mortgage-backed securities to              - 18 -     that actually lets us bring in Ginnie Mae mortgaged-backed securities, which are the equivalent   of federal government debt; we had not been taking in Ginnie Maes before last October  So   bringing in the mortgage-backed collateral at least partially corrects a slight imbalance in our   previous behavior  If there is an alternative that we could implement tomorrow morning, I am all   ears  But I’m afraid I don’t have one in my pocket     Thus, we need to think about other assets     No, I don't think so  The problem is that wherever we sit down we   displace a lot of water  It doesn’t matter whose obligations they are  And the further problem is              - 21 -     that we have to sit somewhere  At the present we are giving the subsidy to Treasury and agency   debt and to mortgage-backed bonds; it is spread around  If we were to settle in on municipal   debt, we would give that market a little kick as well  We cannot avoid the consequences     Yes     I’m sorry if the memo did not speak clearly enough on this point  If   the temporary extension lapses, it is a very narrow issue  It is scheduled to lapse on April 30th   and thereafter I would not be able to take Ginnie Maes  I could still take Freddie Mac and   Fannie Mae issues, both straight debt and mortgage-backed securities  Now, for many years we   have taken the straight debt and, therefore, we have been doing a “favor” to Freddie and Fannie   and none to Ginnie  So if the current authority lapses, we will go back to that status of just   taking the straight debt of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and the other minor agencies and taking   nothing of Ginnie Mae  Given the concerns, that seems to be one of the more perverse ways to   go  So it is in part to avoid that perverse outcome that we want to extend this authority  As I   tried to spell out at the very end of the memo, the most rational and perhaps pure-of-heart way to   proceed would be for the Committee to issue me a new guideline saying that I can only take              - 24 -     Treasuries and Ginnie Maes  If the Committee did that in the current environment, I promise   you that would be a Molotov cocktail in the credit markets  I wish it weren’t; I wish you had that   freedom  But it is my advice to you that that would be throwing a match into a room full of   gasoline  I regret where we are  I understand Jerry Jordan’s frustration that there is a sense of   limited options, but that is where we are  And that is why the lapsing of the authority now is so   awkward     As soon after Labor Day as we can, given the sequence of meetings   and topics     There are two points at which that will come up  The market is aware   that our authority to take a broader pool of assets lapses on April 30th and that our reserve needs   peak around that last week of April and into early May  The other point will be the minutes of   this meeting  It would be desirable for me to say something so that the market is not surprised if              - 26 -     we start doing some RPs that roll into May  If we do a 30-day RP at that point, we wouldn’t   want to get a big market distortion  So I think we will have to say something to clarify our   authority to undertake such transactions  The minutes would come out somewhat later     I have a second issue on which I need a vote  I hope this will be   quicker  Mr Chairman, I sent a separate memo to the Committee on March 14th asking that   Paragraph 1(c) of the Authorization for Domestic Operations, which gives us the authority to do   reverse repurchase agreements, be retained as a permanent amendment  When I say permanent,   though, please understand that of course you can change it at any time you want  As I explained   when we were asking for that amendment last fall because of our Y2K concerns, we thought we   might need to have this authority technically in the Y2K environment and the tri-party world    However, as I mentioned then, this is a practice that the market has moved to  Our outside   accountants have been urging us to move to reverse RP accounting  Our own internal accounting   people, both here in Washington and in New York, would prefer a move in this direction  We   are now in the process of installing a new trading system  It would be a shame not to lock this in   place so we can avoid the trouble of customizing a lot of software and line up with what              - 27 -     everyone has wanted us to do all along  So my second request is to retain Paragraph 1(c) as a   permanent amendment to the Authorization for Domestic Operations     The tri-party arrangements have worked reasonably well  They do   involve more complications than our regular clearing system, but we are working on including   that capacity in our new system as well  So I want to separate that issue  We did not do reverse   RPs via tri-parties; we never found an occasion to do reverse RPs, so we did not test that  We   may at some point want to test that  The issue here is that if we leave this paragraph in the   authorization, we will essentially have the authority to do both matched sales and reverse RPs   going forward  At some point, about two years from now, when we have a new system in place   and we see where we are, we may end up dropping the matched sale authority, but that is off in   the horizon     Our new trade processing system we hope will facilitate such   transactions  One of the reasons we did not use the reverse RPs to drain reserves had to do with   the clearing bank systems  But the clearing bank systems did do the valuation of the collateral,              - 28 -     which simply would have been impossible for us  So, I want to be clear that we couldn’t be   accepting this collateral if we were not using their valuation systems  I don’t recall precisely   whether we focused on late-day draining in our trade processing system, but we are at this point   accelerating the configuration of our system to accommodate tri-party arrangements  That is one   of the issues that is in front of us now     We are going to push for that  It is a question of how many dollars we   spend on it     Over here, Mr Chairman!  [Laughter]   There is a package of charts   and text in front of you, which on the first page has a summary of my remarks 1    Let me apologize in advance for the length of my report  I will  try to cut to the chase  Also, I should note that all the typos in the  written material are my own, as yesterday I engaged in the illusion that  last-minute changes result in improvements      I will discuss domestic market developments with respect to   policy expectations in short-term rates, movements in the euro as a  consequence of capital flow leads and lags, and the current shape of  US yield curves     With respect to domestic operations I plan to cover four topics,   including the mix of operations since the previous meeting, current  conditions in the Treasury market, and the impact of Federal revenues  and Treasury refunding plans on the flow of new Treasury issuance  and System operations  Then I would like to present to the Committee  a proposal for interim System operations that I’d like to discuss with  the Treasury  And at the end of my remarks I will remind you about  some foreign matters on which I sent you a memo     Turning to the second page of the package, which shows forward   rates, you can see in the top panel that US forward rates have risen  sharply since mid-April, when they had dipped a little following the  release of the CPI and more importantly the stock market turmoil  around mid-month  Since then they have moved up, most briskly on  the release of the ECI on April 27th and then again a little on the  publication of the nonfarm payroll report on May 5th  It is interesting  to note, however, that compared with the peak of these forward rates  just after your last meeting, the 9-month forward 3-month rate-- the  top dashed line--is only 25 basis points higher whereas the 6-month  forward 3-month rate--the solid red line--is 45 basis points  higher   There is some “collapsing in” of the market’s expectations of how far  the Committee is likely to go in tightening, even as more aggressive  actions are being priced in over the near term     In the middle panel, you can see that euro forward rates have   backed up from their low levels in essentially three steps over the  period  First, they moved up as the euro broke below 95 cents; then  they rose quite modestly after the ECB raised rates 25 basis points on  April 27th and rose again after the May 2nd release of euro area M3                                                     1 A copy of the material used by Mr Fisher is appended to this transcript        5  and the purchasing managers’ index  The market certainly has a sense  of backing up and raising forward rates in Europe as the euro has  weakened     The bottom panel depicts Japanese forward rates, which have   drifted lower over most of the intermeeting period and spiked down on  the release of the negative household spending number on May 9th  It  has been my impression during this period that the Bank of Japan has  been waving its arms in the air, trying to get people’s attention and  communicate that it might actually raise rates at some point  I think  the market is under-assessing the earnestness with which the Bank of  Japan is trying to send that signal  It is very much my sense that Bank  officials feel somewhat as our Chairman did in 1993 and early 1994   They are trying to warn everyone that a rate increase is coming and no  one is listening     Turning to page 3, I would like to talk a little about the euro’s   weakness, which I see as a function of two factors  The principal  factor is the exceptional leads and lags in capital flows, which have  been punctuated, if you will, by the extraordinary cyclical  developments in the United States over the last couple of years  Each  of the three panels shows data for the 17-month period on either side  of the January 1, 1999 launch of the euro  The top panel depicts         2- and 10-year U S and German swap rates and a 10-year Italian rate  up until the launch of the euro, and then the dollar and euro rates after  that time  In the middle panel are the euro/yen and euro/dollar  exchange rates  And the bottom panel shows the Italian stock market  in purple, the S&P 500 in red, and the German stock market in blue,  all indexed to August 1, 1997     Looking back over this period, it seems to me that non-European   investors bought the rumor of the euro before its launch  You can see  that in the rally in Italian and German 10-year swap rates and also  somewhat in the Italian and German equity markets in late 1997 and  into 1998  And talking to people over that time period, there were  anecdotal reports of a flow of non-European capital into the euro zone  as investors bought the rumor of the creation of the euro  During this  same period, euro-zone businesses braced themselves for the launch of  the euro by hoarding cash  Many of us no doubt remember Governor  Trichet of the Bank of France complaining repeatedly about how their  corporate sector was hanging on to high levels of cash--building up a  war chest for the more competitive environment they expected with  the launch of the euro--rather than investing     Since the introduction of the euro, it appears that European   businesses have actually been diversifying out of the euro area, as FDI      6  and portfolio flows away from the euro zone have picked up  That  seems to me to reflect an effort on their part to catch up with the  process of globalization and diversification that has seen US  corporations at the forefront  Now, inward investors into the euro  area--and the intermediaries who bought the euro exposure from the  outward investors--all hung on, waiting for the strong euro to  materialize around the start of this year and expecting finally to get the  rally they had been looking for  But this was just when US cyclical  developments gave them the “double whammy,” if you will  The last  quarter of 1998, as investors were anticipating the launch of the euro,  was just when this Committee was easing rates       There was much excitement about whether there would be an   economic slowdown and there were strains in the markets  At that  point the spread between 10-year US and German swap rates stood at  80 basis points and the spread between their 2-year swap rates stood at  120 basis points  Since then those swap spreads have doubled  The  10-year US/euro swap spread is 190 basis points and the 2-year  spread is 240 basis points  While those who were hanging on to euros  were hoping for the euro to rally and the US economy to slow down,  just the reverse has happened     If you look at the bottom panel and the recent equity rally, you   can see that the one place from which US equity values might look  cheap would be Milan; that is just one of the head fakes that occurred  to the exchange market  Everyone expected that the hiccup of the  NASDAQ in US equity markets in April might be the occasion to  spark a rally in the euro  On the contrary, it appears that European  businessmen, looking at their market valuations vis-à-vis US  valuations, saw that hiccup as a buying opportunity  And from the  newspapers, which one has to follow to see these developments before  they get picked up in the data, one can read about a continued flow of  deals involving European purchases of US assets     The euro bounced up at the end of last week amid a hail of   discussion and threats of intervention by prime ministers and central  bankers and finance ministers from all over Europe; but the bounce  was not much more than one would have predicted even without all of  that rhetoric  To me, the fact that it got only that rather marginal  bounce was again a somewhat bearish sign for the euro      Let me briefly cover the material on domestic yield curves on   page 4  These are the charts I have shown you before on yield curves  for US Treasury securities, interest rate swaps, Fannie Mae issues,  and Ford Motor Company debt  The yield curves shown are as of the  close of the day of your last meeting and as of last Friday As you can      7  see, the US Treasury yield curve is a little higher but also a bit more  inverted than it was at the time of your last meeting  All three of the  non-Treasury yield curves have more or less backed up by around 50  basis points, or maybe a little less  Thus credit is more expensive than  it was at the time of your last meeting  But even with credit spreads  widening to quite wide levels by the standards of the last several years,  my impression is that habitual notions of appropriate spreads to  Treasuries are still exerting a downward pull at the long end on all  non-Treasury issues  Treasuries are acting as somewhat of a magnet,  pulling the long end of these yield curves down     Turning to domestic operations, I have outlined on page 5 some   key points regarding our mix of operations since your March meeting  At that meeting I spelled out my plans to try to determine what would  be a comfortable pace of outright purchases of Treasury coupon  securities  I said that I thought we could target 35 percent for our  participation in Treasury bill auctions but would allow that to go up to  40 percent in the next month or so, as we expected bill sizes first to  shrink and then to rise again later in the year  I also noted that we  would use a mix of 30-, 60-, and 90-day repos to meet the balance of  reserve needs and that we would not be purchasing bills outright until  after the Treasury’s refunding announcements       In response to views expressed by Committee members and my   assessment of changing market conditions, we in fact purchased $42  billion in coupon securities on five different days  The principal  constraints were the Treasury’s buy-back operations and the novelty of  those operations being quite a big deal in the market  The Treasury  had a rather big window, a two-day notice window  That eliminated a  number of days when we might have been tempted to operate     We also purchased $23 billion in bills for System account on   April 11th  On that occasion we conducted operations from which we  learned something by doing  On the first day of the quarter,                                                                                                                                                                                                                   That was not                something I was expecting to wake up to that m                                                                              orning; their request  was a consequence of their intervention the prior evening                                                                                             it seemed to me  that the bill market adjusted rather well to that rathe                                                                                      r large effect on  supply  So, on behalf of the Committee, we purchased $23 billion of  bills on April 11th for our own account       We redeemed $16 billion of securities at auction--$977 million in   bills and $568 million of the last 7-year note  We now hold 40 percent  of two bill issues  But on two other issues that we anticipated      8  bumping up our share to 40 percent, we ended up with a lesser share of  the total outstanding as a consequence of the large add-ons                                And the Treasury in this case ended up with more cash th an  they wanted     Occasionally we have used 28-day repos to meet our underlying   reserve needs  We now have four separate 28-day repos on our books  for a total value of $82 billion  Most of our repo operations over this  period have been for only a few days’ duration because of the great  volatility in the Treasury’s account     On the next page of charts I have tried to convey a picture of the   conditions in the markets in which we operate  My assessment is that  the bill market has made a reasonably smooth transition to the new  supply conditions it is encountering  But I think the long end of the  curve is having a harder time making that adjustment, in part because  of the abrupt changes in supply and obviously in part because of the  policy actions this Committee has been taking       The upper left chart depicts bid/ask spreads on 3-month bills   going back to January 1997  You can see the increases in those  spreads in January 1998 when the supply changes were beginning to  come through to the bill market and then the dramatic spikes reflecting  the chaos of October 1998  But over the last six months or so the  spreads have about stabilized in the bill market  In the bottom left  panel are bid/ask spreads on the 10-year note  While they seemed to  be stabilizing last year at higher levels than prior to the crisis period of  1998, the trend now is a continuing widening of bid/ask spreads in the  10-year note market     On the right-hand side of the page are spreads of the 3-month bill   to LIBOR and of the 10-year note to the 10-year swap rate  I would  just note that in the 10-year area we are still seeing a widening out of  the spreads, which is merely another reflection of the greater  uncertainty the market faces at the long end  Moreover, even though  the spread of the 3-month bill to LIBOR is volatile, I think it is more  or less staying in a modest range that gives the market some comfort     On page 7, Mr Chairman, I have outlined recent developments   with respect to Federal revenues, surplus estimates, and the Treasury’s  refunding plans  These developments obviously have an impact on the  flow of new Treasury issues and on System operations   At the end of  March, the Treasury’s plans for debt issuance reflected the  Administration's forecast for a surplus of $176 billion in fiscal year  2000  On the basis of April receipts, the Administration's current  forecast is for a surplus of $226 billion  At its quarterly refunding in      9  early May the Treasury announced its intentions to buy back no more  than a total of $30 billion this calendar year, reiterating what it has said  previously  However, I think most knowledgeable observers expect  the Treasury to be buying back more next year  Treasury officials also  stated at the time of the May refunding that they would maintain the  10- and 30-year programs  But I think that statement also was about  this calendar year  In my view, the 30-year program is at some risk  going forward at least with this Administration       They also announced their intention to eliminate the 1-year bill   once Congress adopts some technical amendments and to trim the size  of the 2-year monthly note auctions They indicated, too, that further  increases in revenue would likely lead to a switch from monthly to  only quarterly 2-year note auctions  In addition, although this has not  been announced, the Treasury has told us that the amount of bills  likely to be issued each week for the rest of this year will be reduced  by more than 20 percent  That means the amount auctioned weekly  will be down to $16 billion for the rest of the year, not just for the brief  period in April and May that we were anticipating      These reductions in the Treasury’s issuance plans obviously have   implications for our operations this year  The table on the next page,  page 8, shows projections of the Treasury’s debt issuance over the  remainder of the year, projections of the percentages to be purchased  by the System, and estimates of the System’s net redemptions  I won’t  go through all of it with you, but I’d highlight the top two rows  The  first row shows the Treasury's issuance plan by refunding quarters,  May to July, August to October, and November to January  In the left- hand box are the figures projected in March--that is, what we were  looking at around the time of your last meeting  Going across the  page, the next box shows what our holdings would have been  And  the next box indicates what our net redemptions would have been  under the plan of holding up to 40 percent of any one issue this quarter  but going back down to 35 percent for the rest of the year     On the right-hand side of the page, the next three boxes show you   the currently projected figures for those same variables--the Treasury’s  issuance plans, the reduction in our holdings under the 35 percent  objective, and our implied redemptions  But now the implied  redemptions become somewhat more material in maintaining the 35  percent limit  For the 2-year note, for example--the next set of boxes,  which I have put in bold print--the percent of our holdings as a  consequence of the reduced size of the Treasury's offerings would be  moving up significantly Moreover, that still assumes monthly auctions  and we face the risk going forward of the Treasury cutting back to  quarterly auctions      10    Let me go over with the Committee a proposal for interim System   operations that I would like to discuss with the Treasury  The key  points are summarized on page 9  At your last meeting, I thought we  might be able “comfortably” to purchase outright up to $20 billion in  Treasury securities  In light of both Committee members’ views and  the changes in the outlook for new issuance, I have tried to devise a  means to increase the amounts we would be purchasing  Given the  uncertainties the Treasury faces in debt management and the impact of  our operations on their primary and secondary markets, I would like to  inform them in advance of my plans for managing the System Open  Market Account (SOMA) over the coming months, in part to permit  them to adjust their strategy  It will also be vital for us to  communicate clearly to market participants any changes we make in  our strategy     In brief, I would like to operate SOMA on a schedule for   participation in Treasury auctions that essentially locks in the status  quo in the percentage of SOMA’s holdings acquired in the primary  market  I would then like to increase the pace of outright purchases of  coupon securities, skewing our purchases both to the middle and the  shorter end of the yield curve  We would also need to rely on 28-day  repos to meet the reserve needs that cannot be filled through this  process and to serve as a buffer between the timing of redemptions and  outright purchases       I have provided for your information a very rough approximation   of just three of the reserve factors we face over the coming months,  from now until the end of January  Our current underlying reserve  need for this period is $21 billion  The implied redemption from the  35 percent bill limit would be $42 billion  And the New York staff  forecast of 85 percent growth in currency adds $22 billion, for a total  of $85 billion  I want to be very clear that this figure takes into  account only three reserve factors  We know there will be  demonetizations of SDRs that will add to reserve needs, and we face a  risk that the Treasury’s cash balance will be higher and spill over into  further reserve needs  So this is not a topside estimate of our reserve  needs  We know other factors will tend to add to those needs     Turning to the next page, as I have indicated there, we face both a   stock and a flow problem that we are trying to address   As a number  of you noted at the last meeting, with over $3 trillion in marketable  Treasury debt outstanding it seems clear that we ought to be able to  find sufficient assets to grow the SOMA balance sheet from the  existing stock  However, the amount of marketable Treasury  securities outstanding with remaining maturities of more than 10 years,      11  exclusive of SOMA holdings, totals only $433 billion  And that  amount will decline as a consequence of both Treasury buybacks and  System purchases  There is also strong demand for these long- duration assets in foreign and domestic private portfolios, as reflected  in the inverted yield curve  While relatively comfortable with private  credit risks for shorter duration assets, investors perceive few  acceptable long-term substitutes for Treasury securities  Thus the  stock of such Treasury issues is not large relative to apparent demand  and that stock is expected to decline  The total flow of new Treasuries  reaching the securities market has continued to decline, with total  issuance exclusive of cash management bills falling from a little over  $2 trillion in 1997 to $17 trillion this year  As I have tried to explain  at previous meetings, my concern is this  If the growth of the  System’s balance sheet absorbs an expanding share of both the  primary and on-the-run issues too quickly, there is a risk that System  operations will come to be seen as a major disturbance, even if only  transitional, in the price discovery process      Briefly, it seems to me that we have some very basic portfolio   objectives in that we have a preference for Treasuries as an asset class  to grow our balance sheet  We have over time had a preference for the  shorter rather than longer maturity issues  We have expressed that  preference principally through our large holdings of bills, whose  growth has been relatively limited in recent years  But some members  of the Committee have expressed frustration to me that, with the  reduction in the size of the bill auctions, the average duration has been  creeping up rather than going down  The concerns center on our  interest in maintaining sufficient short maturity assets to provide us  with adequate maturity liquidity  It also strikes me that it is not  obvious that we have much of an interest in paying a premium for the  special liquidity of on-the-run Treasury securities       In the current setting, it seems to me that the Treasury has three   paramount debt management objectives  The first is to reduce the  issuance of debt in line with revenues  The second is to avoid a  lengthening of the average maturity of its outstanding debt  And the  third is to maintain issue sizes and key benchmark maturities to sustain  an active secondary market  In trying to reconcile these interests, it  seems to me that we could limit the System’s share of the primary  market and on-the-run issues in order to leave room for private  demand, particularly for long-duration securities, as investors adjust to  the reductions in supply  We could expand System holdings of off- the-run and shorter-duration Treasury securities to meet our balance  sheet needs, in the process of acquiring as much of the preferred asset  class as possible, and adjust SOMA to a shorter overall maturity that is      12  closer to our basic preference  Doing this will have an impact on the  average maturity of privately held Treasury debt outstanding     The particular proposal I am making is outlined on the next page    Let me say in advance that there is nothing magic about these numbers  and percentages  They represent my best seat-of-the-pants judgment at  this point and if someone has a better idea, I am all ears  But my  suggestion is that we maintain roughly the status quo of our existing  holdings as the share of SOMA participation in upcoming auctions;  that would involve taking shares of the now-anticipated size of  offerings in accordance with the percentages shown in the schedule at  the top of page 12  We would tell the US Treasury in advance that  SOMA’s bids at auctions would be the lesser amount of SOMA’s  maturing holdings or the percentage limit from the schedule  This  would have only a very limited impact on our currently forecast  rollovers  But in the event of further declines in issuance, this would  hold constant the System’s share of the primary market and, therefore,  should increase the amount available for private demand from what it  would have been otherwise  It also should assist the Treasury in  forecasting and thus managing its cash position, which is an incidental  benefit of some consequence to the Desk     We would also take the schedule to imply a graduated set of   guidelines for SOMA outright purchases of off-the-run issues  Over  time we would make outright purchases in the primary market under  the following schedule up to 15 percent of securities with remaining  maturities between 10 and 30 years; 15 to 20 percent of securities in  the 5- to 10-year area; 20 to 25 percent of securities in the 2- to 5-year  range; and 25 to 35 percent of securities with a remaining maturity of  under 2 years  Also, we could perhaps continue to bid as we have  been for 5 percent of inflation indexed securities at auction, and we  might be prepared to bump that up to 75 percent in the secondary  market     Page 13 shows in the second row the very marginal impact this   would have on net redemptions  There would be no change in the bill  redemptions and we would have rather modest redemptions of the       2-year note if we applied this schedule to our primary market  operations  But we would share in the upside risk that the market  would experience if issue sizes decline  In that case we would be  taking smaller nominal amounts and our redemptions would grow     The chart on the next page tries to depict the opportunity we have   to implement this plan  This shows SOMA holdings as a percent of  the size of outstanding issues  The blue bars are bills and the other  colors show coupons in various remaining maturity brackets  The bold      13  red line represents the proposed guideline graduated for each and  every issue in the Treasury yield curve  The white area under the red  line gives you a sense of the size of the opportunity we would have to  purchase these issues if we skewed our demand toward the shorter end  of the maturity spectrum     Turning to page 15, I have shown that a very rough calculation of   the amount available for purchase using this schedule would be around  $178 billion  We would continue our current practice of waiting to  purchase new issues until they are thrice off-the-run  This compares  with a comparable reserve need of $88 billion through the end of  January, which is close to the $85 billion estimate I mentioned a  moment ago plus the $37 billion in redemptions implied on the 2-year  note  Again, I want to emphasize that these numbers are very rough  and intended for illustrative purposes     The pace of outright purchases could have a strong impact on the   Treasury yield curve, tending to produce lower yields, and at least in  the short run could be seen as being at cross purposes with the  Committee's policy actions  This could also be seen as a reverse  operation twist even though it is motivated, in my opinion, by the  System’s reasonable portfolio objectives  I doubt that we could  comfortably purchase the full amount of our reserve needs for the  remainder of the year--$80 billion to $90 billion--under this schedule  within the next six or seven months  But provided we communicate  clearly to market participants about this radical change in SOMA's  secondary market behavior, I think we could purchase considerably  more than the $20 billion I was suggesting at your last meeting  One  of the features of this plan is that we would be limiting our purchases  at the long end and leaving the market a little more leeway to express  its demand there       Finally, I would remind you that this is clearly just a stop-gap   measure  It delays the onset of problems meeting our reserve needs   If Treasury’s supply were to begin to expand over the coming year or  so, we would have assets to roll into  However, if Treasury’s supply  continues to decline over coming years, SOMA's need for new assets  would only have been delayed     Let me turn now briefly to the recommendation I sent to the   Committee in a memorandum on May 11th regarding the renewal of  our swap arrangements with Mexico and Canada and noting two  changes in our investment practices  The latter do not require a  Committee vote  I will need a vote to ratify our domestic operations,  Mr Chairman, and a separate vote to approve the renewal of our swap      14  arrangements  I would be happy to answer any questions and, again,  my apologies for taking so much of the Committee's time       Thank you  If I could just note, Mike Prell has wisely counseled me   that the number I quoted to you on the Administration's surplus of $226 billion is not for   publication  That number is embedded in what the Treasury has in its cash forecast for the   rest of the year, and that is not in the public domain     You got me!     You are kind to say so!     Yes, we will look into that  Thank you, Mr Chairman     The $178 billion is the product of the sequence of my thinking   about how one could cap SOMA temporarily in our primary market behavior and in some way   communicate that effectively to the market  The question is how to communicate effectively   to the market that we were skewing our demand in the secondary market toward the short end    The $178 billion is just the number that was very crudely calculated off a current snapshot,   and too much stock shouldn't be put in it  It just gives a sense that there is a sufficiency of   securities in the market if we use this formula that could carry us for a while  The $88 billion,   rounding to $90 billion, represents the current reserve needs we see over the next seven   months  Now, I'm not sure we are going to be comfortable buying $90 billion over the next   seven months, but we'll see if we can pick up the pace as we go along       Yes, how long we could tread water in this way     We do not purchase on-the-run issues in the secondary market  My   point has been that if we let our share of the primary market expand, we would be collapsing   the market for the on-the-run issues in nominal terms  That's the only point  We have not   been purchasing the on-the-runs  However, we have been suppressing our demand, if you   will, vis-à-vis this schedule for decayed securities that are way, way off-the-run  You can see   on page 14 that we've been trying more or less to work our way up toward 15 percent all along   the coupon curve  In that sense we have been buying issues decayed way, way off-the-run   more aggressively; issues decayed in the 7-year area and the 4-year area are way off  So it is   in that sense that I'm making the distinction here       Thank you, both!     All right  Thank you, Mr Chairman  [Laughter]     At least I’m worthy of note  I’ll be referring to the usual package of   indecipherable charts, which have been relabeled specially, in accordance with your wishes, Mr   Chairman1     The top panel on the first page depicts forward and  current deposit rates  Since your last meeting, both the current and the       3-month forward deposit rates have declined  And the current 3-month  LIBOR rate is about 10 basis points lower than at the time of your last  meeting  Moreover, the 3-month, 6-month, and 9-month forward 3-month  deposit rates are all more or less right on top of each other, yielding 68  percent  If one assumes the existence of some term premium, the fact that  the 9-month forward rate is about the same as the 3-month forward rate  implies that something funny is going on, or at least that the market may be  expecting an easing or is filled with uncertainties  I think it’s very hard to  sort out whether this is one of those cases where uncertainties about the  state of macroeconomic conditions and fiscal and monetary policy in the  first quarter of next year are leading the market to price interest rates for  differing maturities in a glob together  But implicitly, it looks as if the  market is pricing in an easing in the further-out contracts      Looking at the euro area, euro current and forward rates have risen   since your last meeting  It is noteworthy that this is the first time in the                                                     1 A copy of the charts used by Mr Fisher is appended to this transcript  (Appendix 1)       4  euro’s history that those rates have moved in an opposite trend from our  forward rates for an extended period of time  Recent ECB musings and  their bulletin about inflation risks pushed the rates up most recently     In the bottom panel on the page, you can see that the Bank of Japan   finally did it--raising their rates, as everyone knows, on the 11th of August    I think it is worth going back over some ground here  Forward rates and  current deposit rates in Japan backed up in late June as they have every  year for the last several years, as all the contracts start to incorporate  forward period-end dates--the fiscal half-year ending in September, the  calendar year-end in December, and the fiscal year-end in March  And that  elevated all the deposit rates as it has very consistently for the last several  years  They remained elevated into early July, as the market began to  anticipate a Bank of Japan move at its July meeting  Then with the Sogo  bankruptcy just a few days before that July 17th meeting, the rates came off  as the market concluded the BOJ wouldn’t be moving in the event  Indeed,  the decision was for no change in rates Then rates began to price up in  anticipation of the meeting on August 11th when in fact the BOJ did raise  rates  One point worth noting is how much steeper the rise in the current   3-month deposit rate was than the anticipation  I think that reflects the fact  that Tokyo bankers have for the first time in a decade had to deal with an  increase in rates and how to price deposits in such an environment      Turning to the next page, I thought I’d briefly discuss the plight of the   euro  The top panel shows the 10-year and 2-year dollar and euro swap  rates and the middle panel depicts the differential between those rates--the  2-year and the 10-year dollar/euro differentials And in the bottom panel I  have plotted the euro exchange rates against both the dollar and the yen   Since the start of May, the 2-year differential has narrowed almost 100  basis points, approximately half due to our rates coming down and half to  theirs going up  The 10-year differential has narrowed almost entirely as a  consequence of our rate coming down, with only a very little uptick in their  10-year rate  While the initial narrowing of these differentials coincided  with the euro’s brief rally off historic lows in May, at first appearance the  more recent narrowing in interest rate differentials seems to have done little  for the euro  The euro has drifted back down to its springtime lows and  was trading below 90 again this morning  I think a better interpretation,  looking back, is that in all likelihood the euro would have been a great deal  weaker had these interest rate differentials not narrowed as they did       Forecasts for euro-area growth have been revised up to around, and in   some cases even above, 3-1/2 percent, while forecasts of US growth have  tended to be revised down toward that neighborhood, just north of 3-1/2  percent  Many market participants, myself included, had long expected  that a convergence of anticipated growth rates and the erasing of a growth       5  differential would be the signal for a strengthening of the euro  But that  has not been the case  I think European business confidence continues to  express itself in a quest for outward investment, particularly into North  America  And the capital markets in general have been mesmerized by the  graceful moderation of growth in the United States and the continued  productivity gains, both of which for the time being are reflected in the  strength of the dollar     On the next page, I have depicted the four domestic yield curves that I   show you from time-to-time--those for US Treasuries, interest rate swaps,  Fannie Mae, and the Ford Motor Company--on three selected dates  In  green is the yield curve in July of last year, in blue the curve on the day  after your February meeting, and in red the most recent reading as of last  Friday  Most are noticeably lower than they were in early February of this  year  The one exception is Ford Motor Company’s yield curve, which is  almost identical to where it was in February  But I think it’s important to  note that that is not only fairly typical of corporate yields but also probably  reflects the strength of issuance we’ve had over the last few months  So  that outlier is more likely indicative of a supply effect than a market-driven  expectation for interest rates     Turning to page 4, I thought I’d briefly go over the impact of the   announcement we made in July of the changes in our operations with  respect to outright purchases  We announced on July 5th that we would  tend to concentrate more on outright purchases for the System Open  Market Account at the short end of the yield curve and lean more toward  purchasing off-the-run issues and limiting our participation in the primary  market  The top panel shows the eurodollar futures strip for September and  December 2000 and for March 2001 as background, in terms of policy and  macroeconomic expectations  The middle panel depicts 2-year and 10-year  Treasury yields, which you can see follow a more or less consistent pattern       From the time of our announcement on July 5th, 2-year yields did   outperform 10-year yields very marginally until the auction of the new     10-year issue on August 9th, when the relationship began to reverse  But  this behavior is really consistent with the economic data the market was  seeing and with our announcement that we would be buying more in the  short end  Those factors may have given a slight boost to the short end of  the yield curve, but it’s very hard to parse that out from the policy impact   The short end was rallying across the curve, as you can see in the top panel     In the bottom panel, I’ve depicted one measure of the differential   between on-the-run and off-the-run yields in the Treasury market  Here it  is a little easier to see that our announcement had an impact  After July 5th  you can see a narrowing of these spreads There is a lot of noise in this       6  series, especially as we come up to the new auction where the cycle will  change and a new 10-year issue will come into the market  But we did  seem to have an impact, as we expected  We hoped to avoid having much  of an impact on the shape of the yield curve, and I think we succeeded, but  our announcement did seem to affect the off-the-run spreads     Turning to page 5, let me go over our operations since the last   meeting  At the time of your July meeting our reserve needs were  projected to grow as a consequence of economic factors by a little over $8  billion in the intermeeting period, as indicated in the first column of  numbers We expected to redeem about $15 billion net of Treasury  securities, so that was going to add to our reserve needs  And then, given  our forecast of a slight decline in total nonborrowed Fed balances, we  thought we’d have to do about $22 to $23 billion in combined repo and  outright operations       The next column depicts where we were in fact through yesterday    The autonomous factors drained fewer reserves than we anticipated  Most  of the $62 billion differential between our forecast and the actual was a  result of less demand for currency than we expected  Our redemptions  were somewhat lower at $12 billion, not $15 billion  The Treasury upped  the size of its bill offerings a bit and that reduced how much we were going  to redeem under our 35 percent limit  Thus we had less of a need to add  reserves than we had expected, $14 billion rather than $22 billion       Looking forward to the next intermeeting period through early   October, we are expecting autonomous factors to drain about $4-1/2  billion, SOMA redemptions to be about $5-1/2 billion, and our need from  September 6th forward to grow by about $9 billion       On the next page in the top table, the numbers in the left-hand column   are the ones I showed you last time, indicating that we purchased about  $128 billion in outright securities from January through June  So, in the  first half of the year we purchased a little over $12-3/4 billion  Just in the  past intermeeting period we purchased $12-1/2 billion--rather aggressive  on our part  But under our new guidelines we thought that was manageable  and we did that  In the table below you can see that the average level of  repos outstanding, with the shift in reserve needs less steep than we  expected, has declined to about $115 billion, in contrast to $165 billion in  the period ending June 28th       Looking forward, I don’t think we’ll try to buy another $12 billion in   Treasury securities between now and your next meeting  But in all  likelihood we will try to purchase something on the order of $10 billion by  your November meeting, probably doing $5 billion between now and the       7  next meeting and $5 billion from that point to November  Obviously, as  I’m going through this, if members of the Committee have opinions on the  appropriate pace of this activity, I would like to hear your views       Finally, I might just note a couple of other points, Mr Chairman  At   the last meeting I mentioned that the Treasury was very seriously  considering changing the bidding rules for foreign central banks to curtail  their ability to bid noncompetitively because of the uncertainty that  preferential bidding procedure gives the Treasury in managing its cash  balance  As I said at the time, this is overwhelmingly an issue of managing  relations with the                                                                                                        The Treasury did not announce that change in early August, as                                                                                         original ly planned, in part to ensure that our Japanese colleagues  understood what was likely to transpire and were comfortable with the way  we could work with them on this  This is a matter of some considerable  sensitivity  The market has become aware of the fact that if the current  bidding procedures for the foreign central banks continue, by the middle of  next year that will overwhelmingly dominate the market The market has  realized that something has to give  I don’t think there have been any leaks  on this matter       That’s right, Mr Chairman  So the market is waking   up to this situation  It isn’t really an issue of the 10-year fiscal forecast  It  is a matter of the maturity schedule over the next two years  There is likely  to be a noticeable decline in issuance about a year from now, as the amount  the Treasury has to roll over declines sharply  The Treasury and we at the  New York Bank are trying to work with both                                                                               to ascertain their comfort level with this change and                                                 our announcement of it  The question is whether to announce this in  September or to wait a little longer and work a little harder in our  discussions with the                    That is something the Treasury will be  deciding in the next couple of weeks             Mr Chairman, the funds rate has behaved quite well over the   intermeeting period, so I’m not even going to report on that  We had no  foreign exchange intervention operations to report  I will need the  Committee’s ratification of our domestic operations  Also, I have sent the  Committee a memorandum on changes I’d like to make in coordination  with the Treasury on the investment of the System’s euro reserves and I’m  hoping the Committee will concur that this is a prudent thing to do  I’d be  happy to answer any questions       8    Yes, in discussions with my central bank counterparts in other countries it   is clear that a great deal is going on in that area  Let me try to distinguish a couple of classes of   central banks  There are some central banks that have rather sophisticated foreign currency reserve   management programs  I mean that in a complimentary way, not a disparaging way  They have   thought very hard about how they want their portfolio structured and have diversified out of a simple   portfolio of Treasury holdings  In that category the                                     comes to mind; they really   are rather distraught at the idea of a shrinking supply of Treasury securities because they already   have achieved their diversification out of Treasuries in a way they view as optimal  So that’s one   case where there is some concern about the shrinking supply; they don’t want to be responsible for   chasing Treasuries that are lower and lower in yield  But they feel a need to do that as it suits their   portfolio   Another category of central banks involves ones that are sophisticated but more   aggressive  I mean that in a slightly less complimentary way  They are trying to generate as much       9  yield as they can, rather aggressively  They’ve diversified out of Treasury holdings pretty   effectively  And they will look at this as a very opportunity-driven situation and probably will shift   as yields change  I think of                                                   as the sine qua non of this group                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      which they want to leave in Treasuries  They   don’t want to change that strategy  I have some grave concerns, as do my colleagues at the   Treasury, that                        left to their own devices, would bid to hit in every auction in which they   feel a need to participate  They could push yields lower very fast if they took a rather mechanistic   attitude  We’ve done some analysis, which I’ve shared with staff here at the Board and the Treasury,   and have concluded that at least over the course of next year, 2001, we could work with                         authorities and perhaps get them to diversify their holdings  What we are thinking about is   essentially 10 percent of their holdings across the entire spectrum out to 10 years, their current   maturity ceiling  They haven’t gone beyond that  Their current holdings are very lumpy  In some   issues next year they could well bump up against the 35 percent legal limit the Treasury puts on any   one bidder  You can imagine what would happen in a Treasury auction where 35 percent of the total   was being bid on with the bidder wanting the certainty that all its needs would be filled  That could   really move yields around quite a bit   So, at a very mechanical level, that’s what we’re trying to work out with the                                       We are trying to work with them with the objective of buying them another year of time in   which we could help them stay in the asset class of US Treasuries, but diversify themselves more   evenly across all the available issues outstanding That would buy them some time before they even   need to think about diversifying into other asset classes  But undoubtedly, there are other central       10  banks with smaller holdings than                                                       , which may be in the same   behavioral pattern as the Ministry, as you suggest     Yes, there is always some chance of that  But I believe                                             has very good relations with                                       and we’re hopeful that the officials   from both countries will be able to talk this through  I think the more junior people in                                                                           understand the complexity of this, and on that side of the house I’m   quite confident that there is no animosity among the                                                     The staff people   on both sides have worked together for a long time in managing these assets  I don’t think the   problem in            is stonewalling but inertia  The                                     does not move quickly in   the best of circumstances  There may be some skepticism about our fiscal forecasts  Is it all pie in   the sky?  And why do they really have to bother with this?  And there is a question of the   sophistication and interest on the part of the                                  to deal with this kind of change    It’s a daunting prospect     Yes, there may have been something of a rotation there--we have custody   of their holdings of GSEs--but it’s been pretty stable  It has not really been changing much in total    Some may have been driven to them and others were dissuaded from thinking of holding them as the       11  single answer to the problem by some of the statements about GSEs of the Chairman and the   Secretary of the Treasury over the last eight months  But it’s a very delicate balance  They want to   put their funds somewhere in our markets  And I believe they will take a more cautious attitude as to   the amount of their exposure in GSEs  But many of them are not in a position to avoid that asset   class  It simply is not something that makes sense for a large holder of fixed income products  But I   don’t think their GSE holdings are growing very rapidly at present     Obviously, it’s not the level of the yield, which would be a saving for US   taxpayers  It’s the lumpiness of the                                  In one five-year auction they might take   down 35 percent of the offering and in the next one they wouldn’t participate  And we don’t really   have any way for the market to get a transparent sense of what the                 are going to bid for  We   have put details about the composition of our portfolio on line, with weekly updates  I’m not   expecting the                                  to do the same in the near term  So it’s mostly a question of the   disproportionate size of their holdings of individual issues and the fact that aggressive behavior by   them would have a volatile effect on our auction outcomes     And, therefore, market yields     Yes, absolutely  The feedback effect of making the market more volatile,   more quickly is a concern     Yes, in due course  It would need to come out in the quarterly report on   our foreign exchange activities that we produce jointly with the Treasury  The announcement effect   is something that I think the Treasury in particular needs to be sensitive to in terms of our relations   with other ministries of finance as issuers of debt  So the language I used in that last paragraph   about public announcement has the type of wording that we have been discussing with the Treasury   for inserting in the quarterly report  My basic posture would be that if the Treasury thinks it   important to preannounce it in some way, I’d leave that to them       Yes, we certainly don’t want people to think that how we invest our   reserves has anything to do with our intervention appetite  And we will try to make sure that,   however announced, it is communicated as “good housekeeping” in our investments     Let me just add to that point, in light of President Poole’s comment  The   Treasury is motivated here by the cash management nuisance  They just don’t want to end up with   more cash than they need, which is a result the foreign add-on procedure has produced several times   in the last six months  That’s also a nightmare for us  If the Treasury is routinely ending up with   much more cash than they anticipate, it makes it harder for us to manage reserves  So we share the   Treasury’s objective  And they are trying to make clear to the                                     that that is their   motive--it’s a mechanical issue that is driving the need to change these bidding rules  That is how   we’re trying to present our position  Our posture is that I am then giving them advice, as a manager   of reserves, regarding how we have gone about participating in                         and Treasury bill       14  auctions                to avoid disturbing the market  We don’t bid to hit  We try to put in a reasonable   set of bids, and then if our needs are not filled at auction, we buy in the secondary market  We don’t   want to have an outsized impact on their markets  So we’re trying to couch the conversation in   terms of collegial advice about managing reserves, given the sensitivities Bill Poole has alluded to     I should have that number right in front of me somewhere, but I’d say it’s   about $30+ billion at current market values     When the dollar is very strong, as it has been, the value of those foreign   currency holdings goes down  That is a factual matter  I’m sorry I don’t have the precise number     I have no idea what the right amount of foreign currency reserve holdings   is for the US monetary authorities     I thought it might be     Thank you Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the package  of charts with a peach cover1  On the first page, as usual, is a chart depicting the  forward rates You will note on the far right of each of the three panels that the  recent spike in the current 3-month LIBOR rates, the black line, occurred as their  maturities moved into the period that covers the calendar year-end  I don't draw  any other significance to that spike           The red lines on the top panels depict US forward rates As you can see there,  since the September 1st release of the August employment report, both the 6-month  and 9-month forward 3-month rates have been driven below the current 3-month  LIBOR rate and the 3-month forward 3-month rate  More recently, the 6- and        9-month forward rates have traded down to within less than 10 basis points of the  Committee’s current fed funds target rate        Summarized differently, 3-month rates in the second and third quarters of next   year are now expected to be below current rates and below those in next year’s first  quarter as well  It’s hard to resist the conclusion that markets are pricing in  expectations that the Committee’s next move will be an easing  But there are very  few market participants who will say so in words, let alone date it, though they are  actually predicting it in their pricing behavior  So, while we see it in the prices, it’s  a funny kind of reflection of group behavior to which few are willing to confess       Yes, that comes to mind  I think your former colleague, Wayne  Angell, well summarized this curious state of affairs, at least to my way of  thinking  When recently asked what the Committee’s next move would be, he  responded that it would occur in the year 2003  [Laughter]           Turning to the middle panel, as you can see, the euro forward rates declined a  bit after the ECB raised rates on August 31st but moved down principally on  September 1st, as US rates fell after the release of our employment report  They  rose again a little but then declined throughout September as evidence seemed to  accumulate that euro area growth was slowing and may have hit a near-term peak  earlier in the summer  Japanese forward rates, as the green lines in the bottom  panel indicate, have become a little noisier as calendar and fiscal year-end dates                                                               1 A copy of the charts used by Mr Fisher is appended to this transcript  (Appendix 1)      4  have traded into the forward rate maturities, but the overall levels are little  changed      On the next page I have shown some long-term rates  The top panel   shows US Treasury yields on 2-year, 10-year, and 30-year securities and  the bottom panel has the US and euro swap rates for those same maturities   In the top panel you can see that from August 31st through last Friday, the  latest date depicted there, 2-year Treasury yields declined by about 18 basis  points  Those expecting a slowdown in economic activity have eagerly  cited this as evidence supporting that outlook  Both 10- and 30-year  Treasury yields backed up, with 30-year yields trading above 10-year yields  for the first time since January, and this has been eagerly cited by those who  have been concerned about inflation risks  Now, I don’t want to downplay  concerns about inflation, which are widely being discussed in the market,  particularly with reference to the volatility in oil prices  But the modest  backup in yields on 10- and 30-year Treasuries did appear to coincide with a  heavy pace of new corporate issuance and with indications from the  campaign trail and the Congress that both major political parties might yet  find a way to spend some of the surplus     Moreover, in the top part of the bottom panel, you can see that swap   rates show a slightly different and less pronounced trajectory  The 2-year  swap rate, like the 2-year Treasury yield, fell by 18 basis points from August  31st through last Friday  But the 10-year swap rate fell 8 basis points while  the 30-year swap rate was unchanged     At the bottom of the page you can see that euro swap rates, at lower   levels, roughly tracked the movements in US 10- and 30-year swaps, with  the 2-year euro declining 17 basis points and the 10-year declining 5 basis  points  But the 30-year euro swap backed up by 11 basis points  Thus, both  the dollar and the euro 2- to 30-year swap curves steepened by 19 basis  points from August 31st through last Friday  But on the dollar side, all of the  widening occurred by falling 2-year rates, while on the euro side it was  divided between a fall in the 2-year rate and a rise in the 30-year rate       These relative movements in US and euro area swap curves not only   reflect but reinforce the perception that while growth in the United States  may be slowing--with the risk of an uptick of inflation, perhaps from oil  prices among other things--that in Europe is slowing also  And the  slowdown in Europe is from lower levels of growth, while the uptick in  inflation could perhaps be of a greater magnitude from the combination of  rising oil prices and the falling euro     Turning to the next page and directly to exchange rates, you can see in   the top panel the percent change since May 1st in the three major currency  pairs  The bottom panel depicts implied volatilities of one-month options      5  for those same pairs  We should recognize, of course, that the dollar has  been strong against a number of currencies for some time  But over the  course of the summer and into September, among the three major currencies  I think we clearly have a problem of a weak and volatile euro, particularly  against the yen  The red line showing the euro/yen rate leads the way lower  in the top panel, as the spot rate has traded down, and the way higher in  implied volatility in the bottom panel  The dollar/yen line, in blue, is  remarkably stable across the top panel, with declining implied volatility in  September       Why did the euro come under such pressure in September?  I see three   reasons that work together  First, in anticipation of the Japanese fiscal half- year-end statement date on September 30th, Japanese investors were seeking  to reduce or hedge their euro exposures  Second, in a market with this ready  class of euro sellers, there were some very confused policy signals sent by  the Europeans  On September 5th Chancellor Schroeder in a prepared  speech said that the current euro/dollar exchange rate is more of a reason to  be happy than concerned  The ensuing cacophony of official utterances  drew attention to the lack of a clear voice on euro exchange rate policy and  made the euro’s exchange rate an increasingly political issue  The third  factor was the ECB’s mistake, in my view, of announcing on September 14th  that it would sell accumulated interest on its foreign exchange reserves,  amounting to 25 billion euros, and that in the future it would consistently  sell interest income  I want to be clear that I don’t think that’s a mistake in  principle; in principle that’s a fine thing for a central bank to do  But timing  is everything  I’m confident that the ECB thought that with this device they  could intervene a little without exposing themselves to the credibility loss of  an actual intervention  From my way of thinking, by taking an insufficient  amount of funds to make a difference in the market, they sent a muted and  garbled signal of a “nonintervention” intervention  And they created the  risk of inducing more euro sellers to come into the market by announcing  their intention to buy     Why did we join the intervention on Friday the 22nd?  The short answer   is                                                                       virtually every important  condition that we spelled out  At the start of that week,

informed Thursday evening, while the                                                                         details of the agreement were           wor                           being               ked out, that Secretary Summers would  state on Friday after the operation that US foreign exchange policy remained  unchanged and that a strong dollar is in our national interest           Turning to the operation itself, you can see in the bottom portion of this last  page various rates at certain selected times from Wednesday September 20th  through last Friday  I’d like to make three points about the joint intervention  operation  Sadly, the operation appears, at least to my cynical eyes, to have been  anticipated by some in the market  From Wednesday’s close to Thursday’s close,  the euro rose more than a cent, and it rose another cent from Thursday’s close to 7      7  am Friday, just before we entered the market  While it is often said that  intervention works best when it’s pushing the market in the direction it already  wants to go, this isn’t quite what we mean by that           Second, even so, I think the operation should be recognized as having been  fairly successful in a narrow technical sense  The rate closed on Friday the 22nd at  8784, higher than the prior day’s close and higher than the rates when we entered  the market  At the close of the following week, Friday the 29th, rates were higher  than when we entered the market on the preceding Friday  We can have bigger  movements than these, but I don’t think it’s reasonable to expect much more of  intervention than a one-day or one-week impact, particularly in the absence of a  subsequent concrete policy action to which the intervention can be thought of as a  bridge            Third, I think the impact on expectations about the Committee’s future actions  and US exchange rate policy was quite limited  During the operation the dollar  rose against the yen, as you can see in the exchange rate data on the bottom line of  the page  While the December fed funds futures contract came off about 1-1/2 basis  points on Friday the 22nd, most people in the market attributed this tiny bit of noise  to the weakness in US equities that day and the previous day rather than to the  intervention             Mr Chairman, for the first time since 1998 I will need a vote of the Committee  to ratify the System’s foreign exchange operations  In those operations we sold  669,723,900 US dollars and purchased 750 million euros as the System’s share of  the US portion of the September 22nd intervention            In domestic operations, the fed funds rate has been quite well behaved since  your last meeting  We have redeemed $48 billion in Treasuries at auctions under  our internal limits and have purchased $61 billion in Treasuries in outright  operations since your last meeting  I should note that the currency component of  M1 has been weaker than we had expected This reflects both weaker domestic  demand and continued net inflows of foreign currency from abroad  Our detailed  extended forecast of reserves is available on our Market Source web site  I will  need a separate vote of the Committee to ratify our domestic operations         I’d be happy to answer any questions        I haven’t made that calculation, but I’m sure we could do it in just a few   minutes; it could be done off of the rates I have provided here      8    Yes, it’s a couple of percent     Dino gave you the answer It’s about 15 to 30 million dollars     I don’t disagree with the way you’ve described it, Mr Chairman  But it’s   a very small data sample of only a few weeks  And I think in the microcosm of a couple of weeks,   the heavy pace of private corporate offerings helped to move those rates up to their peak  A number   of investors looked at the pickup in yield from a move out of a 30-year Treasury into a 5-year private   debt issue, and that opportunity cost looked very attractive to them  I’m not disagreeing with you   that when we look back, whatever the trend line is here, probably the supply consideration will be      9  more significant, but in this microcosm I offered both developments as factors in the bit of noise we   were seeing here     I would agree with you on where to put the most weight  But I would   want you not to put zero weight on this different issue--and maybe I should have been more explicit   about it--that there will be a process of investors coming out of the long end of the Treasury market   at lower and lower yields  Even if the supply of Treasuries comes back from the dire forecast people   have made of no 30-year issues outstanding, these yield levels relative to what is available elsewhere   suggest that investors will be drawn to the higher-yielding instruments  I just urge you not to put a   zero weight on that     I don’t think it was qualitatively different from operations of the early   1990s in the sense that there usually have been two channels of communication with the United   States  In those days, it was between the Bundesbank and both the Federal Reserve and the   Treasury  Those two channels operate concurrently  The Treasury was and remains in the driver’s   seat, as we say      That was the case this time     I’m sorry, I meant that to be explicit  There is a novel awkwardness with   the ECB in that, as Secretary Summers has said, there is no one to answer his phone call--there is no   one place where he can call his counterpart--whereas there is someone to answer our phone call  So   there was some awkwardness  And there’s still an intramural dispute on the Continent as to who’s   on first in that regard  This made the process considerably more awkward and cumbersome for both   the United States Treasury and for us     I’m sorry I wasn’t clear about that     June of 1998     If I understand your question, it’s the price we get when we enter the   market  We call our counterparties and they quote a price at which we may buy  The Chairman’s   question had to do with the set of numbers across the bottom of page 4 in my material  Had the rate   not traded up 2 cents, how much would--     The operation was front-runned or leaked--or at least there are all sorts of   questions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            19                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I want to be clear that I don’t think                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Little countries on the periphery of the exchange rate system of   our world economy can have active reserve managers  I don’t think it works for a major currency or   even a component of it in an NCB to have an aggressive reserve management program  For your   benefit, we at the Federal Reserve--as I’m sure you pretty much take for granted--do not adjust the   currency composition of our foreign currency reserves other than through official acts of   intervention  It’s routine for other central banks around the world to trade actively for profit in the   exchange market and to hedge their reserve positions actively and dynamically  Malaysia comes to   mind in its operations a number of years ago  When it’s a small country whose currency doesn’t   play a particularly dramatic role in the world economy, I think everyone knows how to deal with   that  When it’s a component of an institution that is one of the major central banks of the world, it   really is very different  The Bank of England, I want to be very clear, has a long tradition of being   an active foreign currency trader in the open markets  They’ve had some good and some bad   experiences with that, and they’ve developed a century-long tradition that lends a note of distinction      20  to that kind of trading operation  I think that’s the exception that proves the rule rather than a good   pattern for others to follow     Well, we don’t know what they will decide at their Council meeting later   this week with respect to their interest rate  But just as we target an interest rate, they target an   interest rate  So I’ve taken it for granted, and I think the market has too, that they will be managing   their repo operations just as we would  And I believe there was some reflection of that in the market   there     That will only come out of their Council meeting, just as it would only   come from this Committee     It’s possible     This tells you how big the animal behind door No 2 is  It just doesn't tell   you what the animal is!     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to a  package of colored charts that should be in front of you1               On the first page I have depicted all on one panel the forward deposit  rates for the dollar, the euro, and the yen from May 1999 through November  13th  To give some perspective on changes in these rates, I have also shown  the sequence of rate moves that this Committee and the European Central  Bank (ECB) have made over the last year and a half      The orange and red lines at the top of the page are the dollar forward  rates, with the lighter color showing the 9-month forward rate  As you can  see, the 9-month forward 3-month deposit rate has fallen by almost 100 basis  points since its peak in May of this year, at the time of this Committee's last  rate action, unwinding almost half of its total increase from May of 1999   The 9-month forward 3-month rate is now trading below the 3-month  forward 3-month rate, which itself is trading below the current 3-month  deposit rate  Still, the 9-month forward 3-month rate [Laughter]--       That’s the Chairman’s language!  At any rate, the   dollar’s 9-month forward 3-month rate is about 100 basis points above its  euro counterpart  The ECB has raised their policy rates 100 basis points  since May of this year, but their 9-month forward 3-month rate has not  changed  It's essentially trading at the same level as it was in May  Taking a  step back, the market has priced in a fair amount of easing by this Committee  over the coming months but has been reluctant to price in much of the  tightening that the ECB has put in place over the summer and into the fall     The green lines at the bottom of the page, which look like inchworms   crawling along there, are the Japanese forward rates  They have bunched up                                                     1 A copy of the charts used by Mr Fisher is appended to this transcript  (Appendix 1)        4  a bit, as have the dollar and the euro rates, but on their rather suppressed  scale     Turning to the second page, I have included two charts depicting   exchange rates  In the top panel, going back to May of 1999 again, are  changes in the foreign currency values of our four major trading partners-- movements in the Japanese yen, the Mexican peso, the Canadian dollar, and  the euro against the dollar  In the bottom panel are comparable changes in  the currencies of five smaller countries     Looking at the top panel, you can see that the yen strengthened quite a   bit against the dollar last year but is really very little changed this year  The  peso and the Canadian dollar are down slightly over this period, but rather  marginally so  And the euro has lost 20 percent of its value against the  dollar, mostly this year     Of the five currencies shown in the bottom panel, all but the Korean   won, which is certainly something of an exception, have declined quite a bit  against the dollar, principally this year  Those currencies include the New  Zealand dollar, the rand, the Australian dollar, and the Thai baht     Now, however we may feel about the dollar's movements and whatever   our analytic framework, I think we should recognize that the movements of  the euro and several currencies of smaller countries against the dollar are  viewed by people elsewhere in the world as extreme or extraordinary  And  they are seen by our counterparts in other countries as reflecting a drawing in  of capital into the United States and safe haven flows that persist on the order  of those experienced in 1997 and 1998  We may not see it that way  We  think there is a distinction between what has been going on this year and  what occurred in those prior years  But they see it as a continuation of those  safe haven and capital flows into the United States     So, while one can point to significant differentiation in the pressure on   different countries--for example, the Argentine peso is under pressure but the  Hong Kong dollar is not--the dollar's strength is not seen by the rest of the  world as a consequence of the fundamentals  Rather, the dollar’s strength is  seen as a cause of their problems and the stress that besets their economies   That view is held much more firmly now, I think, than in 1997 and 1998  when other nations tended to understand the nature of the safe haven flows   This continuation of capital movements into the United States now seems  more mysterious to our counterparts in other countries     On page 3, I have provided four snapshots of three different yield   curves  Those snapshots are for the following dates  May 3rd of 1999, before  the Committee's recent tightening cycle began; January 10th of this year,       5  which was just prior to the Treasury’s buyback announcement and when the  yield curve began to invert; May 16th, the last occasion the Committee  changed rates; and November 13th, this past Monday  Each red diamond  reflects a Treasury issue  The gap for the period between 10 and 14 years  reflects the fact that for this exercise the callables have been located on their  call date and not their maturity date  So we've shifted all those maturities  down     I'd make four observations from looking at these comparisons  In the   chart for November 13th, while the slope of the A-2 industrial corporate index  is roughly the same now as it was in May of 1999, it is clear that the yield  curve has shifted 100 basis points higher  So over that time horizon we see a  certain tightening of financial conditions, at least for this credit grade   Secondly, however, the short end of the corporate curve is considerably  lower now than it was in May or in January of this year  So, over that time  horizon, for this credit grade you would see a certain easing of financial  conditions  Third, the widening of the corporate spread to Treasuries of this  index actually occurred between January and May--between the dates  depicted at the upper right and the lower left  And there's really only a  modest uptick in the widening of their spread to Treasuries from May to now  for this higher grade  We know that lower grade credits have deteriorated  over this period, but I found it quite significant to realize that the widening  relative to this higher credit grade occurred in the first half of the year     Finally, the most noteworthy movement on these panels is the collapse   of the short end of the Treasury curve, which occurs between May and  November, with the hump out to two years completely inverting and coming  down  Clearly, this reflects the anticipation of easing, which has increasingly  been priced into the markets over the summer and into the fall, reflecting the  markets’ reading of the data  You pay me in part to worry  I must say that I  do have a small worry that we will never know what part of this collapse of  the hump was caused by our change with respect to our outright operations   About $30 billion of the $37 billion of outrights we purchased this year have  been in maturities of five years and under  Now, we’ll never know the  counterfactual  But I believe had we continued to purchase evenly across the  curve, that we might have had a more profound effect on the long end, where  conditions were getting thinner and where the Treasury was buying back  issues  So there was no free lunch here for us  I want to be clear that I think  the predominant movement in the short end should be attributed to the  markets’ pricing in the ease based on the fundamentals  But it's not without  some anxiety that I note our own operations could have played a small part     Turning to the next page, let me just go over the current status of our   operations  In the top portion of this table we show the changes in our  forecast looking forward to the year-end  There has been relatively little       6  change in our forecast of reserve needs from late September to now  Things  seem to be coming in pretty much as expected  I’ll actually come back to  these in a minute; I have a better picture of our projections on the next page     In the middle of page 4 you can see details on our outright purchases    We had purchased a little more than $32 billion through early October and  we have purchased another $5 billion since then  And you can see how much  has been in the short end, following the guidelines we adopted in July     In the bottom panel you can see that the average level of our short-term   RPs in the current November, shown in the right column, is running about $3  billion  We’ve started to increase the longer-term book a little, anticipating a  year-end average of almost $13 billion  In the bottom part of the table on  RPs you can see that the mix of collateral we are taking now is still  predominantly Treasury debt, at 64 percent  The rest is divided between  agency debt and mortgage-backed securities     Turning to the last page, I’ve tried to give you a sense of how we plan   to manage reserves around year-end  In the top panel we've depicted factors  draining reserves from the system  The orange line shows the impact of  changes in autonomous factors, principally currency  The green line shows  the additional drain occurring as a consequence of our cumulative  redemptions, here all based on changes from October 3rd  As you can see, we  are expecting a drain of about $30 billion as we get into the year-end period     The bottom panel gives you a sense of how we’ve been managing this   reserve need and how we plan to manage it  The dots represent actual  operations and the solid lines give a sense of our forecast Working up from  the bottom of that page, we plan to buy another $5 billion outright between  now and the year-end, meeting part of the reserve needs that way  We expect  to increase our 28-day book of repos to a peak of $24 billion at year-end and  then begin unwinding that  And on our current forecast we will have about  $6 billion outstanding of temporary short-term RPs at year-end  I don't yet  have any precise forecast, and I wouldn't pretend to, of how we will manage  that on the other side of the year-end  But the 28-day book will start to  unwind and we’ll see where we are We’d then begin accumulating outrights,  but I think I'll wait to see how things evolve before making a forecast for  that     I’ve mentioned to the Committee that the Treasury was planning to   announce a change in the bidding rules for our foreign accounts  They made  that announcement yesterday  I think it went rather well  We’ve worked  with the Japanese authorities and I think their comfort level with respect to  this change is now much higher  We are in a position to help manage their  participation in competitive auctions next year by working very closely with       7  them on this  Very few other countries are really affected by the rule change,  but we have been talking to those countries that are affected  So, I wanted  you to be aware that that announcement was made yesterday     There are no foreign operations to report, Mr Chairman  I'll need the   Committee's vote to ratify our domestic operations  I'd be happy to answer  any questions       I believe so  I can’t think of any problem that would--        I can't think of a variable over the next six or eight months that would   really press us in that way  If we had to add a lot of reserves, we could affect some spreads  But   I don't think there would be a capacity limit     Our current level of operations is not trivial in size as we look to the   year-end  I don’t think we’re disturbing spread relations now as we anticipate increasing the   book to about $30 billion I’m sure there are extreme scenarios under which we would have a   temporary effect on spreads over the next six months if we had to inject a really large amount of   reserves, which I assume we would do through aggressive repo operations  But I think our       8  methodology of pricing our three tiers of collateral separately and trying to reflect what’s in the   market will mitigate, though obviously not eliminate, the impact that a significant increase in our   operations would have on spreads       I worry that we don’t know enough to answer that with any certainty    Had I plotted the Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac yields on these four panels, on this scale they   would have smothered the swap rates and not come through on the page      You wouldn’t have been able to see the distinction on the chart  They   would have been so close together that there would be no gap between them     Yes Those agency yields would have been right on top of the swap   rates  The impression I have from talking to people at those agencies and in the market is that   the agencies use the swap market very actively to manage their interest rate exposure  And I   have a fair amount of concern about which is the tail and which is the dog with respect to the       9  swap market  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt has performed well since their joint   announcement relating to the issues raised by Congressman Baker  The spreads have come   down and the swap rates have come down  I am increasingly uncomfortable about whether I   know enough to interpret the spread relative to the swap rate movements     That’s a concern I have  I want to be clear that I can’t put a finger on   it  But looking at financial conditions, I’m suspicious of the notion that the financial sector,   whose credit stands behind the swap rates, is somehow improving so much more in these   circumstances than A-2 industrial corporates  That seems to me to be something about which we   don’t have any real evidence  So you caught me unprepared  I intentionally did not address the   widening of the swap to A-2 spread because I didn’t have enough information to explain it  I   worry that it’s in part the agency role and in part that swap rates tend to be drawn down perhaps   more by Treasuries as a parallelism in how people trade them and use them       That’s a concern I’ve had for some time, whether agencies or swaps   are the right benchmark  If the two are moving in tandem, then neither one of them is going to   be a very good benchmark under certain conditions of stress     I agree with you completely, Mr Chairman  I was trying to give   members of the Committee a flavor of the angst among some of our colleagues      I don’t disagree with you, Mr Chairman     No  I think you hear these voices as clearly as I do, and perhaps more   so  But I thought the Committee should understand the level of anxiety about this in the central   banks around the world       I’m making sure it’s fully reflected in the transcript!     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to a package of charts with a   peach or salmon cover that should be in front of you1   The first page depicts deposit rates on forward contracts  US  current and forward rates have moved lower since the last FOMC  meeting, most noticeably in a series of steps  The first such step was on  November 28th, following the release of the durable goods data; the next  was on December 5th, following Chairman Greenspan's speech to the  Community Bankers group; and rates moved down again at the end of  last week following the release of the PPI and CPI     The current 3-month rate is now less than 5 basis points over the   Committee's target fed funds rate, and the 9-month forward 3-month rate  is now 85 basis points under the current 3-month rate  Euro deposit  rates have also moved lower since your last meeting, following roughly  the same pattern and timing as the declines in dollar rates  In addition to  moving down after the release of the durable goods orders data and after  the Chairman's speech on Friday, December 5th, they also fell last week   The latter move was in conjunction not only with the release of the CPI  but also the report of the sixth consecutive monthly decline in the  German IFO survey of business confidence      While the differentials have narrowed somewhat because of the   larger declines in the dollar, they remain rather considerably in the  dollar's favor  The differential in the current 3-month rate is still 160  basis points  In the 3-month and 9-month forward rates the differentials  are 125 basis points and more than 100 basis points, respectively     As for Japan, deteriorating sentiment about the Japanese economy   is not obviously reflected in the forward rates shown in the bottom                                                              1 A copy of the charts used by Mr Fisher is appended to this transcript (Appendix 1)      4  panel, which at first glance appear to be treading water  However, I  think the convergence of the 3-month forward and the 9-month forward  rates in the last few weeks does reflect an unwinding of the modest  hopes for an accelerating economy over the next year  The current 3- month yen deposit rate has ticked up on funding pressures, reflecting the  combination of the Bank of Japan's new payments system--launched at  the beginning of the year--and the normal fiscal year-end financing  requirements associated with the first calendar quarter, which is their last  fiscal quarter     In the top panel of the next page you can see movements in the US   Treasury yield curve, with the 2-year note in red, the 10-year note in  blue, and the 30-year bond in green  These yields have moved down in  roughly the same pattern as the forward rates, with the rate on 2- and 10- year notes having come down by just less than 60 basis points each since  your last meeting     In the bottom panel I've depicted the differential between dollar and   euro swap rates--the 2-year differential in red and the 10-year in blue   The dramatic narrowing of the latter since the Chairman's speech to the  Community Bankers has been explained as reflecting expectations of a  more pronounced slowing in the US economy as compared with  Europe  While that perception is around, focusing on the 10-year sector  seems to me to overstate the change in the relative outlooks  If there had  been a sharp divergence in growth expectations, one might have  expected to see a bit more of it reflected in the 2-year rates  While the 2- year differential has narrowed by about 20 basis points since your last  meeting, that is considerably less than the narrowing of 46 basis point in  the 10-year differential  The explanation I have been offered by market  participants is that the pronounced fall in 10-year swap rates reflects the  needs of those who manage mortgage portfolios and have to extend their  portfolio's duration as interest rates decline in order to hedge prepayment  risks  And with thinning Treasury markets, these portfolio managers  increasingly look to agency securities and the swap market as additional  sources of liquidity to complete their hedging     In effect, the more pronounced narrowing of the 10-year swap   differential reflects the greater extent to which the agency financing of  the housing stock is marked to market on a daily basis here in North  America as compared with Europe  Two-year rates may yet prove to be  a lagging indicator, or the short end of our yield curve may yet decline  by more than the market now expects  But as long as the 2-year  differential remains over 100 basis points in the dollar's favor, it is hard  for me to think that market participants are expecting markedly  diverging growth paths for Europe and North America      5  On page 3 I've provided a set of charts on yield curves similar to the  charts I showed you at the last meeting, this time with addition of the  BB1 industrial corporate index  At the upper left is the yield curve as of  May 16th, the day the Committee last raised rates  The upper right panel  shows yields just after your November 15th meeting  The lower left  panel is for November 28th, after the release of the durable goods orders  data, and the lower right one is for December 15th, after the CPI release     Looking from the upper right to the lower right--comparing rates at   the end of the day of your last meeting to today--you can see that the  US Treasury yield curve has moved noticeably lower  One might say  that the 2- to 30-year curve now hovers around the central tendency of 5- 1/2 percent, 100 basis points under the funds rate  The swap curve over  that maturity range has been pulled completely below the funds rate   And 2-year A2 industrial corporate paper yields the same as the  overnight rate The BB1 yields have moved appreciably lower, by 50  basis points in the 2-, 5-, and 10-year maturities since the time of your  last meeting       Now, with the short ends outperforming the long ends and the better   credits outperforming the lesser credits at the long end, what seems to  me to be happening is that very different sets of concerns in the markets  at the moment are converging in terms of investor behavior  From  whatever their different starting points, investors are tending to shorten  duration and move into the higher quality credits  Those who expect a  pronounced and enduring slowdown of activity expect a considerable  easing of monetary policy and thus are positioning themselves to enjoy a  rally in the short end of the yield curve  Those who think the current  slowdown may only be a pause are concerned about the potential  volatility of GDP and thus are tending to reduce their duration in order  to minimize their exposure to the long end  Those who are concerned  about corporate earnings strains and deteriorating credit quality are  fearful of corporate event risks and are reducing the maturity of their  credit exposures while shifting into better credits  Those who have  finished their risk-taking for the year because they have a sufficiency of  either gains or losses, have positioned themselves into the short end  while they await next year’s opportunities  As the short end of the curve  and the better credits across the curve have rallied, the hedging by  mortgage portfolio managers has accelerated the movement down     On the other side are those who think that interest rates, or at least   some portion of the 2- to 30-year curve, are at or near their bottom  because the soft landing will be achieved  In their view any pause in  activity will be quite brief or may even be over  These accounts have  been content to sell Treasury securities and swap contracts to the eager  buyers  Implicit in this view is the intriguing idea that the market has      6  not only led the Fed but that the market has lapped the Fed  Even as  they expect the Committee to lower short-term rates, they expect longer- term rates to be steady or rising  All of these views are usually reduced  to the simple dichotomy between those who expect a hard landing and  those who expect a soft one  On the one hand are those who anticipate a  pronounced weakness in demand and a deterioration of credit, and on  the other are those who think activity will stabilize or pick up and that  credit spreads will normalize once we pass through the typical year-end  seasonal risk aversion       Turning to page 4, you can see some extraordinary movements in   the commercial paper market  In the top chart are spreads of A2/P2 30- day commercial paper over the A1/P1 paper for all borrowers, financial  and nonfinancial, from September through February of each year since  1996  In the bottom chart are comparable data for 90-day commercial  paper  In both cases the heavy red line represents those spreads over the  period since September of this year      Clearly, the pattern in 2000 is outside the range of recent   experience, reflecting something more than normal risk aversion  associated with the window-dressing of year-end balance sheets  In  talking to those in the commercial paper market, one does not get a  sense of crisis in the A2/P2 market  But there is a rather strong sense of  saturation of higher risk assets  Portfolios that might have carried A2/P2  paper through the year-end have more than their fill of telecom paper  and other paper, whether long-term or short-term, of questionable credit  quality  And there is this wonderful notion in the markets that event risk  is somehow different from credit risk  It seems to me that event risk is  credit risk that they didn’t anticipate or didn’t price, but they'd rather not  admit that to their superiors  Clearly, the sharpness of the jump in the  30-day spread is a function of the term rolling through the turn of the  year  However, the extent of the spike can’t be attributed to the calendar  nor can the ratcheting up of the 90-day spread     On page 5 are the underlying data for the charts on the previous   page  Please don't try to read the fine print or take out your microscope!   Just view it from a few inches away and look at the shapes of the lines   On the left side are the 30-day yields and on the right side the 90-day  yields; the A1/P1 rates are the red lines and the A2/P2 rates the black  lines You can see the year-end for each year, marked by the heavy  dashed vertical line Compare the bottom panel, which depicts the 30-  and 90-day yields for this year, with those above from the preceding  years While the spike in the 30-day A2/P2 yield is quite abrupt, what is  even more extraordinary about this year compared to the previous four  years is the relative stability of the A1/P1 yields, with the 30-day yield  rising only modestly and the 90-day yield actually declining  This      7  seems to me to depict something of a noticeable flight into A1/P1 paper,  with that paper perhaps playing something of a safe haven role as a  substitute for Treasury bills  One can note that the A1/P1 yield for 90- day paper is right around 6-1/2 percent, which is about what the market  is being rewarded for holding 2-year A2 industrial paper  That's not  much of a reward for being that much farther out in duration  Market  participants are expecting some liquidity to come back to the market in  January and for some of this extraordinary spread to unwind  The  question that we won’t know the answer to until then is by how much         Turning briefly to domestic operations, Mr Chairman, on the last   page are two panels on reserve needs that are similar to the ones I  included last time  The top panel depicts actual and projected  cumulative changes in reserve needs as we forecast them  The solid  orange line is our current forecast for autonomous factors  The dashed  red lines show our projections at the time of your last meeting; we've  had very modest changes in our forecast  In the bottom panel is the path  of open market operations we’re contemplating for year-end  As you  can see, we’re on course for having about $23 billion in long-term, one- month RPs outstanding, and we expect to top off the year-end with just a  little more than $5 billion in overnight repos  This contrasts with the  more than $140 billion in repos we had outstanding on December 31st of  last year     Mr Chairman, we had no foreign exchange operations to report  I   will need the Committee’s ratification of our domestic operations  I’d  be happy to answer any questions         One is the S&P terminology and the other is Moody’s     A is S&P, am I right?     Well, the whole yield curve began to move  I think the mortgage portfolio   managers looked at your speech and saw in it a mix of a soft landing forecast and an easing forecast   without date specificity  And they came to feel a need to rush and anticipate the hedging needs for   their portfolios this late in the year  And that, I think, drove them to grab whatever assets were   available--whether they were agency debt securities, US Treasuries, or swaps--to move into to   hedge their duration risk  There was an arbitrage opportunity to wash some of this back out as our   10-year swap rate came down in a very pronounced manner, more than in Europe  But in the year-  end environment--      The explanation offered to me relates to the availability of futures market   substitutes  That is, the overall hedging market at the short end of the yield curve is so much deeper   than at the current longer end of the yield curve, the 10-year, that the result is this exaggerated   swing  And were this not happening at a year-end, the expectation is that it would have sorted itself   out more quickly     I don’t know     I guess I would share that sentiment  I’m trying to rack my mind on this; I   have a sense here that the commercial paper market lagged slightly what happened to the firms’   equity values in this case, and it's playing catch-up     No comment     This is the roll into December, the point at which the 30-day paper carries   over into the new year     To elaborate on what I’d hoped to convey in my remarks, I think it’s a   flight to quality issue of the substitution for Treasury bills being much more pronounced  In the   prior years, there’s a sense that the total sum of balance sheet credit to be offered is being   constrained as the intermediaries want to slim down for year-end, affecting both the A1 and the A2   market, though not quite equally  But you can see the impact in the prior years  What is quite   different this year is that there doesn’t seem to be any constraint on the A1/P1 market  So it doesn’t   look like a quantity constraint  It looks like a flight to quality  They’re substituting for Treasury   bills and maybe the A1 market is being pulled down a little by the rally in Treasury bills      Thank you, Mr Chairman    I will do that, Mr Chairman    I’d like to ask a question of Karen about import price growth, particularly in   the retail sector In terms of imported goods sold through our retail chains and the timing of the   increasing price pressures we’ve seen, is that weighted heavily toward March and recent activity in   April?  Could you expand on that a little bit?    I realize I’m entering an ongoing conversation midstream, but sometimes it   may be useful to have a fresh set of eyes and ears to at least give an interpretation of what he or she   is seeing I went back and read the minutes of the last several meetings  I’m glad to see confirmed,   Mr Stockton, that you do have a sense of humor  [Laughter]   But I do detect something of a noticeable dissonance between the last several meetings and   currently in terms of what’s in the Bluebook, what’s in the Greenbook, and the tenor of the   discussion And I’m going to use a baseball analogy to describe how I see the situation from the   perspective of the FOMC as a batter at the plate   It seems to me that over the course of the last many meetings this Committee saw a fairly   consistent delivery from the pitcher’s mound  These were fast balls that came right across the   middle—in the strike zone between the knees with 1 percent inflation and the letters with 2 percent   inflation It was the predictable pitch coming down the pipe, as they like to say in baseball  And   you—I can’t say “we” because this is my first meeting—assumed a batter’s stance accordingly and   managed to continue to round the bases without creating any imbalances   Now the data and anecdotal evidence indicate that the economy has at least changed   pitchers, and we’re getting a few curve balls, maybe some knuckle balls, maybe some split-finger   fast balls, and an occasional change of pace The inevitable question is Do we adjust our batter’s                                 May 3, 2005 39 of 116  stance or keep what worked for the fast ball pitcher who has been on the mound for the last seven   innings?  And unlike you, Cathy, I’m going to save that discussion until the second part  But I do   want to address myself to the kinds of pitches we see coming across the plate in the Eleventh District   and also nationally and globally   Sitting where I’m sitting and looking at that map on the wall, of course, the District is   probably drawn in relative scale to the egos of my fellow country people  But as the second largest   manufacturing state, the second largest in terms of employment in the high-tech sector, and a major   transshipment point with significant retailing activity, I think there may be some proxy value in our   District’s performance  So I just want to report that, whereas before we were lagging the economy,   we seem to have caught up with the pace  We think economic activity in our region grew at around   3 percent in the first quarter   Manufacturing activity in general in the Eleventh District, and high-tech manufacturing in   particular, has picked up in pace There has been a notable improvement  As for energy-related   activity, which is a stereotype for our District—we do have oil—the best way to summarize it is the   way one of our contacts summarizes it  If you can pass a drug test and you can speak Spanish, you   can get a job in the oil sector There are a lot of price pressures from the standpoint of employment   However, in the petrochemical sector, we haven’t had any reports of pass-through activity in   terms of pricing power, and I don’t think that is unimportant  And we are not hearing reports of   increased pricing power generally from our retailers and others—other than for accountants because   of Sarbanes-Oxley Now, I don’t know how good a proxy that is We’re a very open economy  I   don’t know what the output gap of Texas is, for example; it’s a very porous economy  But this is   confirmed by our contacts with larger global operators  And against my background, having spent   the last five years as a strategic advisor to UPS, Exxon, EDS, and Wal-Mart, etc—and by the way,                                 May 3, 2005 40 of 116  particularly with the railroads—I’ve taken advantage of that to reach out and try to get a feel to see   how it corresponds with what we’re seeing locally We’ve had a couple of confirming impressions   On the domestic economy, there seems to be an expectation of a 3 to 3½ percent growth rate,   and people are adjusting to that expectation One of our contacts, the CEO of a company, reminded   me that we went through a period in the early 1990s when economists lowered expectations for   growth to 2½ percent, and we were very happy to see 3 percent against that set of expectations He   went on to say that now everybody is what he called “Eeyore”—down in the chops about growth   that’s not 4 percent But in his view, 3½ percent, and I quote, is “darn good growth”   On the energy sector, one can’t get a better view than from the companies that operate in our   state, the large transnational companies, and if you’ll forgive me, from a dinner we had last Sunday   night with those CEOs and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia It was a small group that met to   discuss what they thought was going on in energy prices, for what it’s worth  And it’s a fairly good   source, I think In terms of current pricing, the discussion at the table focused on the fact that some   percentage of that pricing is due to financial and speculative activity As summarized by the CEO   who will remain unnamed but who runs the largest oil company in the world, the market seems to be   pricing in a supply disruption some time this winter  To quote him, “For the life of me, I cannot   figure out where it’s going to come from and the degree of pricing, but it’s not insignificant”   Another company estimated that the amount being priced in for financial speculation and   potential disruptive activity is somewhere around $10 a barrel  But a key point is that the chemical   guys are not finding it easy to pass on cost increases at the national level or at the international level   either In addition, there is sufficient refining capacity for current production levels and not a great   expectation that there will be significant additions to refining capacity                                    May 3, 2005 41 of 116  They’re not able to pass on increases Neither are the retailers One retailer noted that an   abrupt halt to sales of household goods took place in March, which his firm thinks was driven by the   slowdown in new housing starts One of the nation’s largest retailers, which is continuing to build   its capacity to source in China, reports that price pressures in constructing new stores is significant   because of higher prices for the materials that are going in—steel aggregates and so on  But as to   what they sell, and I quote, “Prices have not risen; they’ve just stopped falling We can’t discount   aggressively without hurting our margins and we don’t have the leeway to raise prices”   And one last input from the CEO of one of the nation’s largest railroads, and by the way the   CFO of one of the largest air shippers their shipments are geared significantly to transoceanic trade   The nation’s largest railroad reported to us that they’ve seen a 21 percent growth this last quarter in   their international business That is particularly geared toward the trans-Pacific trade, and through   this lens it appears that our manufacturers and retailers are expecting to continue significantly   boosting their investments for sourcing in China  As one of them said, they are ramping up their   spending in China and continuing to arbitrage labor with China From this and our international   contacts—mine by the way ended abruptly and happily on March 31 when I joined this organization,   for which I’m grateful—we infer that the effects of globalization on our assumptions about resource   slack and the constraints on the economy and the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment have   yet to run their course Thank you    Again, Mr Chairman, I’m new, and I want to be appropriately humble and   respectful I listened very carefully to what you were saying The way I interpret the first part of   what you said is that we don’t want to signal the market that we know something the markets don’t   anticipate or don’t know Having been a market operator and being sensitive on that front, I agree   with that And I don’t think there’s an argument for a pause, so I would argue for a 25 basis point   increase in the funds rate   I’m a little worried about later in the statement signaling to market participants what they   may interpret as something that we know that they do not know  So I would again suggest that we   might consider a change in the “measured pace” language against that background  The idea of   maintaining a measured pace implies we will continue along this path; and if we deviate from that   path, that might come as an unpleasant surprise to the marketplace   As to the procedure, I’m too new to have any opinions on that  Like you, Cathy, I too have   sort of a Rubik’s cube of moving parts to place  I would suggest, against the background of what   Janet said, the possibility of just eliminating section 5 entirely in alternative A  That would give us a   shorter statement and even reflect a concern about some asymmetries that we’re detecting, and I   think that might do the job    David, we’ve been discussing anecdotal evidence in the last few meetings   on the lack of pricing power in the corporate sector  And we’ve anticipated that margins would   be squeezed unless there was substantial top-line or revenue expansion  I’m wondering if you’re   seeing any evidence that that situation has changed  Is there any evidence in the data that   companies are not just meeting these increased price pressures through cost-cutting but are   beginning to pass their higher costs on?   And then, Karen, my question for you is Could you give a number for the trend-line rate   of dollar depreciation, including the yuan, you anticipate?    Mr Chairman, as reported in the Beige Book, activity in our District has   picked up substantially There’s a tremendous amount of activity in all but the manufacturing   sector And there’s an enormous surge in confidence, particularly in Texas, even though that   may seem like a redundancy to talk about confident Texans!    I’ll refer to just a couple of points very quickly as part of the broader discussion we’ve   been having at this table First, we’ve had a huge surge in housing starts  Houston now ranks   second in the country year-to-date in terms of housing unit permits, and Dallas ranks third  First,   by the way, is Atlanta Moreover, permits are running at rates roughly three times what we see   in New York City and roughly twice those in Miami or Orlando  But to illustrate the point that   we discussed at our last meeting, in terms of price pressures, Dallas ranks 250 out of 265 MSAs   [metropolitan statistical areas], which shows the geographic differential  In any event, we’ve had   a substantial pickup in housing activity                               August 9, 2005 35 of 110  The second point, with regard to energy, is that Texas, Louisiana, and New Mexico   account for two-thirds of the rig count in the United States  It’s a rather schizophrenic sector    One might say that schizophrenia beats dining alone, because we do get both sides of these   arguments  [Laughter] We have a very excited group of people—the rig operators—now   running at the tightest capacity rate in terms of rig utilization since December of 1985 in the case   of Texas and since 1986 in the case of Louisiana  As evidence of the kind of pressure that’s   occurring on the happy side, but also a testimony to globalization, we have the first case of a   company—a small company that was not able to find rigs—importing a rig with workers from   China to operate in a certain basin in Colorado  By the way, 70 percent of that rig content is   constructed in China and 30 percent in the United States  This is the first such case that we’re   aware of   On the opposite side, the depressive side, there is a constant fear of price collapse in the   oil sector One might describe it as a wild surmise, except that one of the most articulate and   outspoken champions of the view that oil prices could fall dramatically happens to be Lee   Raymond, the Chairman of Exxon and the Chairman of the National Petroleum Council  He   likes to remind listeners, and he lectures me constantly, that in 1985 or 1986—I forget exactly   when it was—we had a price collapse which took oil prices from $28 to $10 in two weeks  He is   constantly warning his colleagues—noting that it is a minority view within the oil patch—that if   we have a warm winter he expects that kind of price behavior in the oil market  And he certainly   is a noteworthy proponent of that view   On the high-tech side, I’d note a couple of points based on conversations with Texas   Instruments and Dell on the issues of capacity and capital expenditures  TI, having just   announced that they’re going to build a huge factory—a $3½ billion investment in the Dallas                   August 9, 2005 36 of 110  area—says that they expect this to be one of their last full-bore production facilities for wafers    By the way, even with that large dollar investment, the factory will employ only 500 people    What they’re finding now is that they can buy what they call commodity wafers—which is about   60 percent of the content they need—from Chinese producers at ever-lower prices  Dell repeats   the same kind of defiance of the laws of economic behavior, as they put it, in terms of what   they’re able to source out of China, and they claim now to be the second largest operator of US   companies in China  Moreover, they report that with each passing day, as we’ve heard from   retailers, somebody appears on their doorstep able to outbid any existing supplier at an ever-  cheaper price   As far as the retail sector is concerned, again, with my colleague’s permission, I do talk   to contacts from Wal-Mart occasionally—to the COO and to the President of Wal-Mart   International We hear the same kinds of reports, and there are substantial questions about   Chinese accounting And, Karen, the reason I asked the question about the assumptions   regarding the Chinese yuan appreciation or the general depreciation of the dollar against the   yuan—even though it’s obviously very volatile—is that the CEO of Wal-Mart International said   that it makes absolutely no difference that China has revalued the renminbi at this juncture    They constantly find that people that will come in and underbid existing suppliers  The   supposition, Mr Chairman, is that the Chinese (a) don’t pay back principal, (b) don’t pay taxes,   and (c) if they do pay taxes, they pay the tax collector rather than the government  All of that, of   course, gives them a substantial advantage  This has always been the case, and we assume it will   be not carried forward over time  But in terms of competition, there seems to be a voracious   appetite to continue to supply—a variation of the old Communist model in which they produced   for production’s sake and now they produce for sales’ sake  Again, our private sector— our                      August 9, 2005 37 of 110  retailers, our high-tech sector, and others, and now our energy sector—are taking advantage of   that situation   Having said all of that, I want to indicate, as did Mr Moskow, that with this strong   economic activity, even though there may be a risk that we’re borrowing from the future, we,   too, are concerned about inflationary pressures  So we would be in favor of further tightening to   the degree that my former colleague as Deputy US Trade Representative just mentioned  We’ll   talk about the wording of the statement later  Thank you very much    I support the recommendation, Mr Chairman, and I’m indifferent on the   word “gradually” I like President Poole’s rephrasing of the fourth box down  I think it makes   grammatical sense, but I’m not going to fight over it    Mr Chairman, I have two questions  One is to Karen with regard to the   energy futures markets  Have we seen any change in the dynamics of those markets during the   trading activity—higher numbers of contracts or size changes—from what we saw pre-Katrina?    The reason I’m curious about this is because I think we have been   struggling with trying to determine what the speculative element is in those markets  Clearly,   those who did speculate for whatever reason on an event, such as the one you just mentioned,   have been rewarded But sometimes the complexion of those people who then enter the market   changes; the smart ones get out when they’ve been rewarded and they’re replaced by what we   used to call the mullets who swim in smaller contracts  I’d just be curious to see what the change   in the dynamics is, if indeed a change is taking place at all  The other question—excuse me?    Yes    Again, as we talked about a couple of weeks ago, the point is the   volatility—not so much the direction—and yesterday reinforced that concern  I’m just trying to   get a sense of these dynamics    My other question is about the $85 billion fiscal stimulus assumption  Is   that based on rational expectations of, say, the women and men who sit around this table?  Or is   it based on some soundings of the politicians on Capitol Hill?  What is the source of the $85   billion figure?    Thank you, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, the Texas economy is faring better than the national   economy  Pre-Katrina we saw very strong evidence of that in all nine of what we call our super   sectors in the economy—including, by the way, the information and telecom sectors, which   suffered serious setbacks in the bursting of the dot-com bubble and the reversal, coming out of   the recession in 2003   Post-Katrina data are likely to be stronger still  Despite or perhaps because of the unique   position that we’re in geographically, 265,000 people from the area affected by Katrina have                               September 20, 2005 46 of 117  evacuated to the state of Texas  We expect about 40,000 of them to stay, and that’s above and   beyond Jack’s employees to whom we’ve tried very hard to be helpful    The way our economy will improve in the aftermath of the hurricane is by increasing the   convention business, for example, that has been displaced into Dallas  And the port of Houston   will have increased activity  We’ll see what happens with this storm that’s brewing presently    Our office and business relocation efforts are running full bore, and throughout the state we’re   getting commitments already from people who have been displaced along the Gulf Coast   Our data show greater business optimism than is seen nationwide  Our bankers are very   frisky [Laughter] As one of them, the CEO of the largest bank in our District, put it the other   day, “loan demand is stronger than horseradish” And it just continues onward One concern I   would note is that economic conditions in Mexico are worse than we expected, and—a point to   make about the Greenbook—we’re less optimistic than the Board staff about the second half of   the year There seems to have been an implosion in domestic demand in Mexico  We’re also   concerned about some developments in the building materials sector for cement, wood, and   steel—we’re seeing significant evidence of the hoarding of lumber, for example—and how that   might affect construction activity in our state  We are, at least in Northern Texas, second to   Atlanta in terms of housing starts, although fortunately not subject to significant upward price   pressures   On the national anecdotal side, this has been an aggressive period for us in that we talked   to as many CEOs—many with firms headquartered in our District—and other business contacts   as we could We spoke with a total of 15 CEOs for this round, one COO in retailing—everybody   knows who that is—several CFOs, and many directors from banks and other boards of different                      September 20, 2005 47 of 117  sizes and dimensions of conventional companies  So I’d like to summarize very quickly what we   heard   The retailers, from the convenience store operator who is headquartered in our District to   the largest retailer, emphasized two points  First, $300 per gallon gasoline seems to be the   tipping point in terms of having an impact on consumption  Whether Katrina is directly related   to that or not, the point is that one gets from these retailers evidence of a falling off of demand   and, very importantly, a bifurcation of demand  By the latter I mean that the higher-end retailers   like Nieman Marcus continue to do well while the lower- and middle-end retailers suffer    Second, there has been a change in product choice, with a move from branded products to   unbranded products My favorite example provided to me in this call-around was the   substitution of Gold Coast cigarettes for Marlboros  There’s a $250 per pack difference, and   retailers, particularly 7-Eleven, are seeing significantly higher sales of the lower-priced brand   The price pressures that are coming in retail are in areas one would expect—plastics,   packaging, transportation—and there is evidence of price pressures beginning to build  I   understand that Wal-Mart executives have called in the CEOs of all their suppliers and told them   that Wal-Mart will not accept further cost through-puts  But the company indicated that they   will work together with their suppliers to achieve efficiencies  Whether that experiment will   succeed or not is another question   On energy, we have what we call a SWOT team—we replace the A with an O, which is   for oil—that includes the largest integrated company down to some smaller gas producers  I’ve   been sending around some notes to my co-Presidents on what we have learned from these   sources, for whatever they’re worth  The bottom line there really comes down to natural gas and                   September 20, 2005 48 of 117  gasoline prices There are 25 ships at sea presently bringing in product, meaning gasoline  And   the expectation is not so much a direct price movement based on Katrina but increased volatility,   as we talked about earlier, dependent on whether or not the winter turns out to be a cold one    That’s what the producers are looking at in terms of the real side of the business as opposed to   the speculative side of the business   The effects are working their way through chemicals, and these are effects that don’t   come to mind readily  You can only take a natural gas molecule and divide it in so many ways    Our chemicals people are telling us, for example, that they don’t yet have the leeway to pass   through prices on things like nitrogen and hydrogen and other chemicals that we ordinarily don’t   think about but that are important to the chemical production process  But as one said “We are   going to look for every way we can to pass on prices there”   Regarding the shipping and rails, the largest barge company in the country gave us this   statistic 300 to 400 barges out of 15,000 to 16,000 were affected by developments in the   Mississippi related to Katrina  But it was “no big deal except for an impact at the margin”  We   received a similar report from the CEO of one of the larger of the five railroad companies  One   thing that everybody in the transportation business talks about that they applaud politically is the   waiving of the Jones Act  The estimate is that it will cut intercoastal transportation costs by ship   by half, which is obviously not insignificant   As far as express delivery is concerned, the key factor there in terms of ground   transportation is whether or not the US mail will move up its prices; the expectation is for a 54   percent increase in January  On the auto side, as President Moskow reported, Ford is probably   feeling more frisky—just to use that term again—and GM is as well  It’s interesting to look at                         September 20, 2005 49 of 117  the used auto auctions for Manheim and Adessa, the two largest wholesale used car auctioneers    There was a big spike in prices post-Katrina  If you do the math, whether 100,000 cars or even   more were lost from hurricane damage, this should be of assistance to the auto companies   As far as technology is concerned, TI reports the ability to pass on some price increases   in their broad semiconductor business  But again, all the tech folks, whether it’s Dell or EDS,   report continued pressure to lower prices and to outsource and new source their employee base   On housing, I have reported on the hoarding of lumber  There is another interesting   development, which is the disappearance of contractors and subcontractors from our state—and   apparently from Florida, Jack—because they are rushing to New Orleans to cash in on the money   that is going to be spent there   In summary, the comments from our business contacts on Katrina, while acknowledging   the human tragedy and the tremendous displacement of people and property, range from “no   impact” to “short-term shiver” to “sporadic impact”  And as cold-hearted as it may seem, this   comes down to the issue of where we are today  The way I have thought about it is that I believe   there will be less of an income statement impact but more of a balance sheet impact, which is   something I worry about  What I mean by that is that perhaps we will see a temporary setback in   terms of growth, a shifting in the complexion of that growth, and, to be sure, additional volatility   and potential price increases But what I worry about most, Mr Chairman, is what I have come   to refer to as the fiscal incontinence of the government  That is, I worry about money being   thrown at a problem and whether or not that will undermine the confidence that we depend on to   finance our economic growth                      September 20, 2005 50 of 117  I’m reminded of a story that George Shultz told me about his time working under   President Reagan, who was very frustrated about spending  George picked up the phone and   called I think it was Sam Cohen and said, “Tell me, Sam, is there really any difference between   Republicans and Democrats when it comes to spending?”  And Cohen said, “I want to think   about it, do some research, and give you a serious answer”  He called back the next morning and   said, “Yes, George, there is Democrats enjoy it more” [Laughter]  “But otherwise there doesn’t   appear to be any difference”   I want to vote for a 25 basis point increase in the funds rate  I agree with President   Santomero’s point about confidence  I worry about the price pressures that are building, but I   also think it’s very, very important that regardless of the amount of additional fiscal stimulus—   whether it’s $85 billion or more—that we not be viewed as being tempted in any way, shape, or   form, to monetize that fiscal spending, whether it’s incontinence or profligacy    I would suggest also, Mr Chairman—and this may seem odd—the possibility of looking   at the language in our statement, which I think Jack mentioned obliquely, and whether or not we   want to continue with the term “measured pace”  Has it run its course?  Has it become   synonymous with a 25 basis point increase or not?  And might we not use Katrina as an   opportunity to decouple that link in order to provide us greater flexibility going forward?  But, in   summary, I am in favor of continuing to remove policy accommodation  Thank you very much    I support your recommendation for tightening  I still wish we would   consider eliminating the words “measured pace”  I like the last sentence in the first alternative   that Vincent put forward as a substitute to that  I’d prefer adding that to alternative B without   guidance But if push comes to shove, I support you entirely, not only because it is the right   thing to do but also because it gives us a buffer                September 20, 2005 103 of 117    Karen, I didn’t bristle, but my ears pricked up when you mentioned Mexico    This is not a major point, but well before the hurricanes we noticed a disconnect between the   standard presumed correlation of, say, 90 percent—Mexican GDP to US industrial production    Something has weakened in Mexico  We’re analyzing it  It could be the onset of the sexennial   event, the presidential election  But, for example, our El Paso folks report that with the Delphi   announcement some 60,000 Mexican maquiladora workers have been affected  And your   comments on Mexican economic growth or your assumptions seem to be somewhat different than   what we’re hearing anecdotally and what we’re finding in our research in Dallas  I just wanted to   point that out and offer our input  If we can be of assistance there, we’d be glad to do so     I lost     Mr Chairman, growth in the Eleventh District, if anything, has been   accelerating in recent months—picking up steam  We appear to be the beneficiary of the natural   disasters that have taken place on the Gulf Coast, and that continued, incidentally, through Wilma   A small example is that the grapefruit growers have definitely benefited from the destruction of   grapefruit crops in Florida, which was nearly total  If I were to paraphrase Yogi Berra, who said the   future isn’t what it used to be, I think I would be on the mark because we’re now much more   confident   One of the most articulate, smartest, and at the same time conservative, bankers in our District,   Dick Evans of Cullen/Frost, says that building contacts are reporting the busiest business activity in   30 or 40 years in our state  At the very front end, which is site work for land development, one of   his clients, an engineer, reported that in his entire business career he’s never been busier  So we are   proceeding on all pistons, and we’re beginning to see it reflected particularly in real estate prices    The market has gone from a buyer’s market to a seller’s market almost overnight  In the Gulf area   of Padre Island, for example, record prices are now suddenly appearing overnight   So in summary, the bankers and the business community in the Eleventh District, as I reported   at the last session, are still frisky, Mr Chairman  Indeed, their tails are wagging at an accelerated   pace and I hope—to paraphrase another “Berra-ism,” which is that history isn’t what it used to be—                                    November 1, 2005 32 of 114  that history doesn’t repeat itself here  But we certainly have a much more enthusiastic business   community   I want to turn now to a broader perspective, based on our calls to headquarters of companies   that operate throughout the nation as well as in our District  At the last FOMC meeting, Mr   Chairman, you mentioned gasoline prices having a very visible impact as one of the few   commodities that consumers look at for price comparisons  In talking to our retailers, that is clearly   the case In sharing with President Poole our contacts with Wal-Mart, I talked to the new CEO of   US Wal-Mart yesterday, and he noted that while October same-store sales were up 42 percent, the   consumption pattern had shifted  Because of gasoline prices, people are making fewer trips to the   stores but they’re buying larger amounts   And we have a leading indicator ourselves in Harvey Rosenblum, who is the wine connoisseur   amongst our research leaders in Dallas  I’ve noticed that he, since he lives in a dry district of Dallas   —we still have prohibition in parts of Texas—is making less frequent trips to the wine store but is   buying in greater volume  Perhaps that’s because of the questions we’re asking him!  [Laughter]   Wal-Mart, 7-Eleven, and Dollar General all report that heavier items transported by truck—   dog food and bottled water are just two examples—are under tremendous price pressure due to   rising fuel costs And these higher prices are being passed on, although sometimes offset by   consumers substituting private label items for brand name products  American Airlines is passing   on their fuel costs  They managed to raise their average fare 8 percent in the third quarter  Once   again we hear them talking about $25 attachments to confirmation fees for standby passengers    Hovnanian and Centex, two of the largest builders, report rising costs of locally sourced materials   delivered by truck, adding to price pressures of labor and materials for roofing, siding, and   windows  We’re seeing fuel prices affect also the transportation costs that are charged and passed                                        November 1, 2005 33 of 114  on by the express companies UPS reports—and I don’t think this is public information—that   they’re targeting rate increases, pre-fuel charge, of 4 percent to be set in early November, knowing   that the US Postal Service will be pricing in an increase of 5 percent plus at the beginning of the   new year   There are some potential mitigating factors here  7-Eleven, Exxon, Wal-Mart’s Sam’s Club   stores, and other gas retailers report that the margin they are retaining on their gas sales—and 53   percent of 7-Eleven’s revenue comes from gasoline sales now—is still running 30 cents versus 13 to   14 cents normally They expect to hold these margins as long as they can, or at least until volatility   is dampened; but as gas prices ease, this could possibly be a cushion that will provide some relief   for retailers And the correlation is quite direct  At 7-Eleven, for example, they can walk you   through, week by week, the effect on sales of each downward movement in the price of gasoline   Three weeks ago they had an increase in sales volume of 2 percent; two weeks ago, 4 percent; and   this last week, 6 percent So we may have a little bit of relief coming from the reduction of margins   that might occur as the margins go from 30 to 13 to 14 cents   It’s still clear from our discussions with business operators that price pressures are building    A rising percentage of companies are experiencing price increases for what they sell as well as for   what they buy, along the lines that President Moskow mentioned  We see it particularly in   chemicals, as he mentioned  Caustic soda, formerly priced at $450 a dry ton, is now $800 a dry ton    Polyethylene, formerly priced at 38 cents a pound, is now priced at 55 cents a pound   I hope this is   expunged later, but Exxon’s CEO told me that they will take every measure they can to pass   through, and I quote, “sizable increases” on that front in every place that they can  Perhaps the best   indicator of what’s happening in the chemical industry is Pioneer Core Alkaline Company, which   was filing for bankruptcy and is now “printing money,” according to their CEO  Wal-Mart expects                                   November 1, 2005 34 of 114  to pass along price increases for all resin-based products, such as garden chairs and outdoor tables,   in the spring  The rails appear to be planning, according to BNSF’s CEO, a price increase of 5 to 6   percent before fuel surcharges next year   And of interest in all of our discussions is that we’re hearing what President Moskow is   hearing, which is that there are pressures on the wage front  To be sure, they are mitigated by   Delphi, Northwest Airlines, and also GM  But the numbers we’re hearing from the rails, from the   Belo Corporation, a large broadcaster, and others on labor prices are negotiation targets of about 3   percent, with a heavy focus on health care running in the 9 to 10 percent range   I think probably the best summary, Mr Chairman, came from the CEO of Wal-Mart US  He   said that “previously we were deflating and we can still offset a little bit through China, although to   a lesser degree than before”  He said “we will early-discount like all retailers, moving our discount   season, largely in terms of announcements, up to November 1  But at best we hope to ‘hold the   line’ on prices”  That’s a direct quote   So I feel that the heightened inflationary pressures that we talked about last time are lurking    Against that background, I favor further tightening to contain inflationary impulses and   expectations  I have some comments on the statement, but we can speak about that later  The   bottom line is that one can sense, even though we don’t see it in the data, inflation pressures   creeping up like little cat’s feet  Thank you     Setting aside the governance issues that Janet raised, it seems to me that the   key operative phrase and the change in alternative C is taking out “accommodation can be removed   at a pace that is likely to be measured” and replacing it with “likely making further policy firming   necessary” I’m of the school that we likely have a little bit further to go, partially driven by our   own analysis of the inflation trend—meaning PCE inflation data—that we do in Dallas  But I’m                               November 1, 2005 86 of 114  curious as to what the staff ventures might be the market reaction to this particular wording change    Would changing this language to “making further policy firming necessary” sound as if we have a   more severe situation on our hands that we are worried about?  What’s your judgment?     Well, I accept your suggestion, Mr Chairman  I was just thinking about the   introduction you provided, which is something I’ve been consumed with because I’m supposed to   give a lecture at Harvard on Thursday night on the globalization of monetary policy  I’m worried   about the phenomenon that you described—it’s one of the reasons I feel quite hawkish even relative   to President Lacker—and the direction in which it is proceeding  Let me cite a small data point    The retailers will tell you that they got 10 percent relief last year from China but that they’re only                                  November 1, 2005 97 of 114  getting 5 percent relief now  Now, where that number comes from, I’m not quite sure  But the   point is that the disinflationary mitigating factor is being reduced, and yet we have no sense of the   measure of capacity or of the utilization of capacity outside our own borders, particularly in the   parts of the world you spoke of  And I want to make sure, however we word things and whatever   we communicate in the minutes, that we don’t close the door to still be very vigilant, though not   vigilantes, on the inflation front  But I accept and support your recommendation     Very quickly, on the Chairman’s question to Karen  Clearly, there is virtue to   massive competition  My most delicious irony is the fact that similarly dated Vietnamese debt now   trades on a price basis richer, and on a yield basis lower, than that of Ford Motor Company   [Laughter]  It wasn’t too long ago that we were killing each other  But we do have, increasingly, an   independent central bank in Mexico  We have better reporting techniques in Brazil   And I would   submit that while it may not be Anglo-Saxon capitalism, part of this is just a matter of realizing the   value of capital and the desire to attract capital  Moreover, the improving at-home conditions make   many of these countries increasingly attractive as an alternative  And the competition is good   My question is to David, and maybe Brian or others  I wonder if you could—not now but   with some kind of briefing or a paper at some point—give us a sense about the issue you mentioned   of the lags in the effects of monetary policy tightening  I’m curious about the dynamics in a   tightening scenario such as the FOMC has been pursuing here  How do you calculate the impact and   the likely lag time intervals in the progressive process that we’ve been going through as opposed to a   one-time shock?  I assume that your models include a dynamic  I’d like to understand it better, and                                 December 13, 2005 22 of 100  maybe some of my other colleagues would as well  So it’s not a question to be answered now, but if   you’d be kind enough to do that, I’d be grateful  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Mr Chairman, Texas and the Eleventh District are even more surprisingly   strong than the surprisingly strong rest of the United States  We see growth in retail sales and   manufacturing employment, strength in housing starts, and high occupancy rates  Houston is 100   percent occupied in terms of apartments, as part of the resultant fallout from President Guynn’s   District  In every single dimension, the Eleventh District economy is solid   There is price seepage from natural gas and other products  The most alarming will be utility   bills, which are expected to jump by 40 percent next year  But what is taken from Peter often goes   into Paul’s pocket or, as we say, what is taken from Pedro goes into Pablo’s pockets in Texas  And   the best example I can give you is from the CEO of American Airlines, who told me yesterday that   their fuel bill over the last two years has increased $3 billion  As he put it, “The blood is being sucked   out of me, and it’s going to our friends down the street”  In this instance, that is literally the case   because Exxon is a couple of blocks away down the street  In terms of our local economy, this is   healthy for us because we’re energy neutral  In the activity surrounding energy, the rig count is up 23   percent this year  Energy company profits are soaring, as I referred to earlier  Oil royalty streams and   mineral rights holdings are expected to rise dramatically, so we have a wash as far as energy prices   are concerned  The bottom line is that Texas is a very happy place, the Eleventh District is a very   happy place, and our economy is strong  And it shows you the dynamic nature of our country                                              December 13, 2005 33 of 100  Nationally, both the Greenbook and anecdotal evidence indicate that the economy is equally   solid We see it in the retail sales data, as David reported today  But one of the aspects of those retail   sales numbers, according to our interlocutors at the big box distributors, is that less than half the goods   sold in what they call the “November frenzy” were deeply discounted goods  In other words, the   sales were solid   I spoke to sixteen CEOs and CFOs in preparing for today  I basically heard only one new   concern, Mr Chairman, which goes back to the point that Karen was making earlier about   globalization  Also, I want to point out that one of the big homebuilders—Hovnanian—confirmed   what you said, David  As he put it Investors—meaning speculators—are exiting the business and it   is returning to normal  But the common concern coming from the retailers, the rails, the shippers, the   shipbuilders, and so on, was the following  Everyone I’ve talked to continues to try to figure out ways   to exploit globalization  Each of them, from the IT [information technology] guys to the big box   retailers to the specialty chemical firms to the service firms, wants to have offshore supply  One of   the CEOs said, “We have a long way to go in exploiting China”  We’ve heard that forever  And one   of my favorites was the comment, “China, India, and Indonesia can make Italian ceramics better than   Italians can now or could 200 years ago”  [Laughter]   The problem that I’m beginning to hear seeping into the conversation, Mr Chairman, has to   do with US infrastructure  If you read the New York Times article two days ago about Shanghai’s   new deep water port, you have to realize that those facilities are being built to ship goods out of   China, not so much to ship goods into China  And consider this, as reported by one of the shippers I   spoke with 50 percent of all the ships on order for construction are container ships  Capacity-  expanding container business is increasing at 15 percent or more per annum to carry cargo from   Shanghai and other parts of the world to the United States                         December 13, 2005 34 of 100  Now, this is good news on the disinflationary front  As the CEO of Northern Navigation, one   of the larger shippers told me, “Transportation by ship will essentially be free when these numbers are   realized in the marketplace”  The bad news is stateside  We don’t have the capacity to absorb it    Long Beach and the Northwest harbors are constrained  Work rules, according to our interlocutors,   are very slow to adjust  But there are ways to beat the bottlenecks, and I just want to mention two    UPS reports that they have gone from 6 to 18—and now for next year 21—flights from China  Wal-  Mart just built a four million square foot warehouse in the Houston port, in order to shift part of the   burden from Long Beach  But it is evident that the enemy is us as far as exploiting globalization, and   I think that’s a long-term problem that we might want to take note of over time   Presently, I argue that the economy is solid  We have very good growth  I’m still a little   worried about inflation, but I’m convinced that we’re nipping it in the bud by the action of the FOMC   and that we might want to pause sooner rather than later  But, again, we might discuss that in the   discussion of the statement  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Mr Chairman, I listened very carefully to what you said  In 1997, I sold my   money management business because I figured I could no longer beat the house  For 23 years I was a   market operator, so I’m very sensitive to the power of markets and the issue you raised, although I   think it’s a very risky business for the FOMC to discuss how monetary policy might impact asset   prices Yet you’re right in terms of the power, the liquidity, and what that’s doing to affect real   economic behavior, so I look forward to that discussion   In thinking about this statement, I want to vote for the ¼ point increase announced in the first   sentence  I think the one-sentence statement in row 2 in alternative B says all that needs to be said—   the economy is solid, period  That’s good news  In row 3, I would prefer to say why core inflation   has stayed relatively low, because we talked about it at this table  It has remained low for two   reasons—because of competitive pressures and still robust growth in productivity, and I think we   ought to insert that  Those are the facts, and we just talked about them at length  And I suggested that   kind of language when I sent in my note   In the wording of the assessment of risks, I think there is an interesting trade here  We’re   taking out “accommodation,” which is a signal  One could make the argument to remove the word   “measured”  I respect the arguments that were just made  To mitigate the operative word “likely” I   think we could achieve the objective by just saying “further measured policy firming may be needed”   rather than “is likely to be needed”  That leaves us plenty of options, and I can honestly say that I feel   it may be needed; I cannot honestly say it will likely be needed  But then, again, I will not have a vote   next time  Thank you                         December 13, 2005 79 of 100    Going back to the Chairman’s question on size, Dino, the press and many   analysts focus on central bank reserves when they talk about what’s buffeting intermediate-term   rates  If you talk to Barclays, they give you awfully big numbers of potential dedicated moneys on   the pension side, an order of magnitude of, say, multiples of six or seven times what central bank   reserves are  Could we study the potential size that’s at play here?  And, of course, the United   Kingdom is not just dedicated to UK fixed-income instruments  They’re also looking at our fixed-  income instruments at the longer end of the curve  So getting a sense of dimension here, if possible,   might assist this conversation  I think that this is very, very important   January 31, 2006 14 of 106      Mr Chairman, I took note of the two Davids’ forecast of 47 percent growth   in the first quarter  Especially against President Yellen’s comments, it brought to mind the name of   one of Henry Jerome’s albums on the Decca label called “Brazen Brass”  That is, some might   consider brazen or even brassy that it jibes or, in this context, jives with what I’m hearing   anecdotally both in our District and nationwide—though we have only three and a half weeks of   observations and the year-end to look at   Very quickly to sum up these observations, the CFO of UPS put it this way “The economy   feels much better than what I read”  UPS reports a very strong December adjusted for seasonality,   and January has stayed strong  Over the year-end in the recent past, they have had only one holiday   peak day of processing 20 million shipments  They had three at year-end of more than 21 million    Burlington Northern–Santa Fe’s volume for the first three weeks of ’06 is up 9 percent year over   year  Interestingly, they just auctioned off their entire lumber-carrying capacity for the year at an 8   percent premium over current market  Texas Instruments reports a positive book-to-bill ratio, which   is a very rare thing coming out of the fourth quarter  They find that they underinvested relative to   demand and report a seven- to ten-day delivery delinquency rate  As the CFO says, “We have   stopped scratching our heads about demand, and we’re just taking it all in”   The CEO of Wal-Mart USA reports that “the consumer hasn’t hidden” as expected  It’s   true that traffic is down, but average purchases are up in the Southeast and Texas, and the West is   strongest in overall demand, aided by the warmest winter by their calculations in 112 years  The   CEO and the top managers met with their 5,000 suppliers the week before last in Kansas City, and   he reported that the suppliers described themselves as “upbeat”  Wal-Mart and others report what   we’re hearing from the railroads, the shippers, and other retailers—all of which lends verisimilitude   January 31, 2006 40 of 106    to what was evident if you parse the Beige Book And that is that the rim—from Richmond down   through Atlanta to the State of Florida and then, of course, the “uber” states across Texas and up to   California and the West Coast—is enjoying robust growth  To the extent that there’s weakness, it   appears to be in the north central and northeastern regions   On the price front, Dick Evans, on our board, of Cullen/Frost, a very astute banker, says that   he “keeps hearing people talk about potential inflation, but the economy seems to be able to pull it   out of the hat”  Wal-Mart International reports no pricing power other than in resin-based products    The CEO marvels at how the world continues to, as he puts it, “replace technology at lower and   lower prices”  Further up the retail chain, Penney’s CEO reports no price inflation in home   furnishings and continued price deflation in apparel  And on the two subjects for which I reported   price pressures before, the CEO of DX Services, a large chemical company, reports that PVC prices   have fallen off because of overproduction but the prices of the key building blocks of chlorine and   ethylene are falling  “There’s no pricing on the upside,” according to that CEO  And as for my   other favorite subject of diapers, incidentally, Proctor & Gamble and Kimberly Clark have rolled   back their price increases of 5 percent   Our shipping contact at Northern Navigation reports that Panamax rates—and Panamax is   the key fleet of bulk carriers—are now down to $16,700 per day from $17,300 in December, which   was down 35 percent from the average for the year of ’05  The container fleet will absorb a   14 percent increase in fleet size per year for the next three to four years driven largely by what one   could consider Chinese ego because they have now entered the building market in size  And   interestingly, UPS worries that, if this continues, they will come under price pressure to decrease air   freight rates  Despite fierce demand and delivery delinquencies, Texas Instruments reports that it   has slowed down its price increases   January 31, 2006 41 of 106    So, Mr Chairman, we have forecast a core PCE inflation of 2 percent for the year, and we   feel comfortable with it  I started with Henry Jerome  Let me conclude with another Henry, the   Fifth, at least as written by Shakespeare  I’ve been honored to serve with you, Mr Chairman, the   least time of anybody at this table  In Alfalfan terms, I’m just a sprout in the crop of otherwise   experienced men and women  But I’m sure they would agree with me, without getting too   dramatic, about the appropriateness of Henry V’s remarks at Agincourt—and I’ll rephrase them—  economists and bankers now asleep (remember these are bankers) shall think themselves accursed   that they were not here  I consider myself privileged to have been here, Mr Chairman  This isn’t   Agincourt, but it’s important  I’ve served under two saxophone players now, [laughter] and I would   say without question, you’re a leader of the very best kind, and I thank you for your leadership     Well, I support a 25 basis point move  I think President Poole has made a   good point  I wrote a note in support of it, but I can accept the language that’s here  Then, finally, I   am in full accord with the President of the Reserve Bank of New York’s articulation of the issue of   procedure, which I think we should defer
