5014,1993-09-21, [Statement--see Appendix]  We need to approve the System's $825 million participation in the intervention operation of August 19th  SPEAKER(?) So moved 
5116,1993-11-16," [Statement--see Appendix] Mr Chairman, I'd be happy to answer questions on my report or to move on to Agenda item 4C as the Committee wishes  The System's reciprocal currency arrangements come up for renewal at this time of year, including the existing $700 million swap with the Bank of Mexico, which is relied upon as part of the package being prepared I have no changes to suggest in the terms and conditions of the existing swap arrangements and I request that the Committee approve their renewal without change I'd be happy to answer questions on the renewal of the existing swap arrangements Ted has something to say about the Mexican package being worked out now [We can proceed with] Ted or questions, either way  I'd like to add that I think the question of whether we would use them, given the current high level of balances, is a very different one than whether we would want to have them available for other central banks to use It's essentially a question of cooperation and whether having them in place isn't a good idea as a sign of central bank cooperation  $250 million  They're renewed annually They are one-year swaps which are renewed each year And at this time the Committee authorizes the manager to renew them for the coming year  Yes It's fortuitous "
5148,1993-12-21, I will be referring briefly to two pages of color charts which Carol was kind enough to put on the table in front of you this morning [Statement--see Appendix] 
5177,1994-02-03," [Statement--see Appendix]  It came off Yesterday, it moved up against the mark and was 173ish to 174ish; it lost all of that first thing today and it's creeping back up to 17363 on the latest reading that I have "
5203,1994-02-28," Yes, I am  I'll be going over developments in dollar/yen and dollar/marks since the Committee's last meeting Initially, the dollar traded in a range against the yen above and around 108 as we approached the Clinton/Hosakawa meeting In retrospect, there was a fair amount of complacency among the holders of long dollar positions prior to that meeting Market participants had for some time been of the view that once that meeting was out of the way, dollar/yen could trade up toward 115 And they quite clearly held on to those long positions going into that Friday and through Friday On Monday, Valentine's Day, as everyone is aware, we had an abrupt liquidation of those long dollar positions here in the New York market The dollar/yen closed in Tokyo that day around the 105 level In New York, we got to an intra-day low of around 1015 and closed just above 102 in what was a very abrupt and massive sell-off of speculative long dollar positions During the day, there was a half-hour period that was quite exciting, some 50-pip and 100-pip moves in the exchange market But many bankers I spoke to thought the market had functioned very well; even in the very busiest half hour, people were able to get their business done Since then we have had a rather choppy market The speculative market participants have been trying to make and take profits on smaller positions and smaller moves in both directions, and this has given a certain choppiness to the market Japanese exporters have left their offers in the market to sell dollars at the 105 and above level The Bank of Japan has purchased over these last two weeks And Japanese life insurance companies and other central banks also have been seen buying dollars against yen around the 103 and 104 levels  Turning to dollar/mark trading, following the Committee's meeting and the Committee's action to raise interest rates, the dollar/mark moved up above 176 immediately and then came down in what I would describe as three stages, principally reflecting the    2/28/94  perception that the Bundesbank was slowing further the pace of its easing First, it came down toward 175 on profit-taking and a lack of willingness of participants to extend long dollar positions until the market saw some further rate reduction by the Bundesbank Then it came down to the 172 - 173 area following the movement in dollar/yen on Valentine's Day That was not so much a sympathetic move as an alternative form of selling dollars If you were anxious about adjusting your dollar/yen position or your overall long dollar position once the move had happened, you would more likely want to do so in dollar/marks than in dollar/yen Finally, the dollar/mark came down to the 171 area on February 17th following the Bundesbank's action to lower the discount rate but not the Lombard rate and the RP rate This was seen as a sort of nonrate rate cut in the exchange market, and there was a further closing out and liquidation of long dollar positions that brought the exchange rate down roughly to where it is now Today, the Bundesbank announced that it would be having a variable rate RP tender, the results of which we should see tomorrow This has given the dollar some small boost today but the market will really await the tender tomorrow I'll stop there and see if there are any questions "
5218,1994-03-22," [Statement--see Appendix]  Yes, undoubtedly  There were some days on which the criticism of hedge funds or leveraged funds or derivatives worsened the impact That impact wasn't very long-lived, but there were a few days when comments by officials, especially the ones by unnamed officials allegedly getting tough on hedge funds or derivatives, were counterproductive I wouldn't put that as a dominant effect but at the margin it was a factor "
5254,1994-04-18," I'd be happy to Following the Committee's last meeting, the dollar declined against both the mark and the yen--from roughly 159 marks and 106 yen on March 22nd to lows of about 157 marks and 102 yen on March 31st The dollar then rose sharply after the nonfarm payroll release on Friday, April 1st, moving above 171 marks and 104 yen by the following Tuesday when European trading had fully resumed after the Easter holiday Although initially the dollar strengthened against the yen on Friday April 8th, following the announcement of Prime Minister Hosokawa's resignation, by last Monday the dollar had fallen back to around the 103 yen level on the perception that the process of forming a new Japanese government would delay any wish to resolve trade issues and also the completion of the already delayed budget Ten-year interest rate differentials with both the mark and the yen have moved by 30 to 70 basis points in the dollar's direction since the 13th of March On balance, the dollar is little changed against the mark and weaker against the yen  Against the yen, the dollar appears to be constrained in a narrow trading range by conflicting US and Japanese official views Despite the apparent stability of the perceived tolerated trading range since last fall, with the dollar now at the bottom of that range, market participants remain anxious that some of this could cause the dollar to test the record lows  Against the mark, the dollar's movement was muted on the one hand by the constraint on the dollar/yen and the risks of abrupt strengthening of the yen and, on the other hand, by the seeming transparency of both Bundesbank and Federal Reserve policies While the Bundesbank may periodically lower official rates by discernible increments as it did last Thursday when it lowered both the Lombard and the discount rate by 25 basis points, market participants perceive that the Bundesbank will continue to restrain decreases in the more important repo rate to no more than a handful of basis points per week and that the pace of reductions will be managed to ensure only a gradual erosion of the differential with the dollar At the same time, the Federal Reserve is expected to continue its tightening moves in 25 basis point increments With these two gradual policy trajectories priced into current dollar/mark levels, the most likely causes of a pronounced upward movement in dollar/mark would be either a pronounced acceleration of expected US or German policy actions or of signs of weakness in the German economy or strength in the US economy That's the end of my remarks  I'll just note that the trajectory of 3-month rates on Euro-dollars has the 3-month Euro-dollar at 45 percent by June and above 55 percent by December Now, that's for a longer maturity than the fed funds rate, of course, and we have to take that into account But it's a rather steep acceleration of short-term rates "
5271,1994-05-17," Thank you [Statement--see Appendix]  The dollar would trade off  It's very hard to put a number on that Let me start by saying that if the Committee does something in the range of what the market is expecting, I'm not sure the dollar will move up very abruptly I think it will tend to pip up and pip down a little bit as has happened with previous actions of the Committee I think inaction by the Committee could have a downside risk to the dollar The market is fairly neutral at this point In the interbank sense, its position is such that inaction could result in significant dollar sales  I think that the morning of May 4 began with President Tietmeyer's release of his statement that they did not have an interest in seeing the mark overvalued against the dollar One consultation in which I was engaged was a discussion of the nature of the dollar's reaction to the mark and that it seemed to move awfully quickly and without regard to where people thought interest rates were going in each of the countries The nature of the disturbance in the exchange market was the focus of my discussions with most of the other countries that I consulted with--I consulted with my counterparts in    5/17/94  the G-7 central banks and a few others When I say ""disturbed"" market conditions, I'm referring to April 29 when very seasoned professionals were unable to get business done, unable to get phones picked up, and where the exchange market was not responding to fundamentals in the sense of the direction of interest rates being pretty well laid out for them and they seemed to get caught in other backwashes in the market  With regard to the risk for the dollar going forward, I would again focus on the dollar/yen exchange rate I think the operation and the action of the Bundesbank last week and whatever the Committee does in the realm of the expected, if I can put it that way, will tend to stabilize the dollar/mark rate I don't see any big downward potential in the dollar/mark rate on its own terms The yen, though, will be the locus of attention particularly in the run-up to the G-7 Summit this summer That puts us back in the political context, and whether the Administration maintains its current formulation or reverses I think is a bigger risk for the dollar However, if the dollar can get through the G-7 Summit roughly at its current level against the yen, then I may be sticking my head way out    5/17/94  but I would see slightly greater odds for dollar strength thereafter than dollar weakness  I'm not quite reading you The monetary policy by the Administration or--  That will tend to disturb the foreign exchange market I think one of the very helpful official statements on May 4 was that by Mr Altman to the effect that he had no argument with the Fed over interest rates That really came on the heels of the Tietmeyer comment; that was a very useful setting for the operation So obviously, yes, if some of that Administration enthusiasm for the current Fed policy were lost, that would tend to be destabilizing to the dollar  I think they are more expected by the foreign exchange market than Administration statements; they may be in the same vein but I don't think they have the same effect  Well, if the history of the last three or four months is my guide, I'd have to say I would expect an impact on their long end It's hard to imagine there won't be some such impact I think, though, that we have seen more decoupling in this period-- between the last meeting and now--than we saw in previous periods So, in that sense I can be modestly hopeful that there would not be a negative impact on their long end I think the Bundesbank's actions last week are probably going to be the most helpful in that regard After the moves in mid-April had tended to squeeze out expectations of rate reductions, they have been put back in with last week's action and that may help decouple European rates "
5295,1994-07-05," Thank you [Statement--see Appendix]  Well, the events of the morning gave me precious little time The final decision to intervene was not made until sometime between 915 and 930 am There had been an uptick in the dollar shortly after 900 am I must tell you I fear that was the result of some leakage out of European central banks I was very nervous about trying to enter the market as the dollar was coming down and thus I was in rather a hurry to try to get into the market before it came off that brief high So, when I did get approval from the Treasury to operate in that market, I jumped right in  No, I don't think that was the immediate response The morning operation had a more beneficial effect The dollar moved up--I don't remember the exact figures right now It    7/5-6/94  moved up appreciably over the course of an hour or so It then began to come off when we pulled out of the market and in the afternoon when we tried to reinforce the dollar we really met a wall of dollar/marks  No, and I think that may have been one of its problems I think when I spoke previously we were referring to both Treasury and Federal Reserve policy  Looking back at last week, I think there was a change in Treasury policy The clarity with which it was expressed evolved over the course of the week in which we operated and only became clear, I would say, toward the end of the day and subsequently There was a change in the statements Treasury officials were making They were now looking for the dollar to go higher rather than lower  I don't think the increased clarity was sending the dollar down I really don't view it that way Late Friday afternoon an unnamed Treasury official finally said they would rather have the dollar go up than down, not in so many words but that was the gist of it I don't think that caused the dollar to go down rather than up We did have a very regrettable series of headlines as a result of the President's interview on the radio I think the overall remarks the President made were something any rational person could agree with They map rather well with remarks I have made here to the effect that there are fundamental reasons for the mark and yen to be strong but that their appreciation is getting a little overdone, and we think it is prudent to intervene This came out in a series of headlines The first said ""Clinton thinks exchange rates are puzzling"" And subsequent headlines were ""Clinton sees reasons for mark to rise versus dollar; Clinton sees reasons for yen to rise    7/5-6/94  versus dollar"" Our afternoon operations had to face these headlines literally head-on That, I think, was an important cause of the dollar's weakening that afternoon  I was not aware of the President's interview prior to seeing it come across the wire  I don't know that for a fact I think he had been briefed on the Treasury's views on Thursday But as I said, the final decision to intervene was made by Secretary Bentsen between 915 and 930 am on Friday morning for their part  I think it has bought us more than twenty minutes I wouldn't tell you it would buy us any great amount of time in terms of weeks or months As I said, I do think the relative stability of dollar/yen in a trading level below 100 is very different from what all of us were expecting The risk of a drop through the floor at that point, I think, was very real; dollar/yen sentiment was extraordinarily negative and there was very little indication that there would be buyers there Although there is a risk of a big drop now, I can't, of course, prove that to you scientifically But I don't think it buys us more than a few weeks--I'll be honest with you, I don't like to admit to that--unless there is some other change in market dynamics I think the market views itself as being a little oversold now The reaction of the dollar/mark last week was frequently to tick up as nervous people covered shorts That was not the case--we had not gotten that far--after the April-May operation  You're trying to make me enjoy the transcripts even less! [Laughter] I don't have any forecast that far out myself  I haven't a clue  Well, disorderly is different in one context from the risk of dropping through a trap door  Well, on Thursday afternoon and Friday morning of that week I was looking at an options position, which I included in my written material but did not include in the charts circulated today I am referring to risk reversals which are two equally ""out of the money"" options--one dollar put and one dollar call The pricing is expressed as the difference between the implied volatility of the two positions Now, when the put is over the call in ""vols"" we express it as a minus number; when the call is bid over the put, we express it as a plus number From my entire observation of this pricing, we have always talked about a range between -1 and +1 Thursday afternoon and then Friday morning, the dollar put was offered at 2 ""vols"" over the call People who had never discussed options prices with me were calling me up on the phone to make sure I was aware of this pricing development that suggested that the market was about to step back and would not want to touch dollar/yen as the rate dropped down So, that's as precise an indicator as I had; it is not the only one that I rely on in assessing market sentiment, which obviously was extraordinarily bearish  I don't think there is one that has anything approaching the magic quality or aura of the 100 level I think that the market looks to 9550--actually 95--as a sort of floor; this is the view of the chartists of the world That level would represent the bottom of the dollar/yen rate going back to the early 1960s, taking the troughs over that period; people with their rulers can draw a line to there That level has some significance for the market, but nothing approaching the significance of 100  The dollar had traded briefly below 100 in rather discrete increments and we had all seen 99 on the screen several times; it did not stay there very long So, it was a sort of episodic venturing below 100  -8-    7/5-6/94  I think you would have to have a sense of how confident the market was that it would stay at 85 or whether the next stop was 75 Now, if you were confident that it was stopping there, I would agree with your hypothesis for a rally in the bond market; that would be a plausible reaction But if the market did not have confidence it was going to stop at 85, I don't think we would get much of a rally in the bond market  I haven't said anything about irrationality I'd like the meeting tape to be very clear on that because I don't think people betting millions and billions of dollars are doing anything irrational They are trying to serve their interests as they see them in the short run That's very important to me That's the question, though I look at asset prices and I see that as prices go up, demand goes up in the short run and as prices go down, demand goes down in the short run And whether the markets are stabilizing or not depends on where the short run ends and the long run begins "
5318,1994-07-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman After the Committee's last meeting, the dollar came under a bit of pressure the following week after the G-7 Summit, and by the next Tuesday it dropped to below 152 against the mark and below 97 yen There was much focus in the foreign exchange market at that time on the rapid sell-off after the President's comments during the Summit, implying a continued benign neglect policy as the market saw it As soon as the dollar reached these low levels, however, it was widely recognized in the market that the dollar was rather oversold at the 152 level against the mark By the end of last week, it had traded up quite a bit In particular, by the middle of the week there was fairly widespread anticipation in the market that the Federal Reserve would be tightening by 50 basis points and the dollar jumped up toward the top end of what people perceived as a trading range of around 155 to the mark Now, the exchange market surprised itself a bit by the dollar sustaining itself rather well at the higher levels People who had missed the rapid downward movement and wanted to sell out of long dollar positions hesitated to do so at those levels The market even moved higher as we came into this week Now, people we talk to in the market tell us that things like rumors of action in North Korea and the performance of the long bond sparked the dollar's moving up I would note, looking over the last couple of weeks, that the dollar has been getting the best of everything If people expect interest rate hikes by the Fed, the dollar seems to go up; when the bond market rallies on the thought that the Fed won't be tightening, the dollar seems to get support out of that This is all a rather long way of saying the dollar was a bit oversold, and shorts have been progressively squeezed out no matter what the news has been But I would note that the dollar is really only back up to the levels that existed against the mark prior to the weekend of the G-7 Summit  Ted will go over some of the recent events in Mexico in his report I would note with respect to Canada that there is now a widespread expectation in the markets that in the next few days Quebec will be announcing elections to be held in September While the Canadian long bond yields have come down a bit in the last several weeks, about 50 basis points, they have done so in sympathy with some of the other higher yielding G-10 long bonds--the UK and Italy--and thus events of the last few days may be more of a sympathetic reaction to all of that The market is still quite concerned that simply the calling of an election in Quebec will lead to pressures for a further deterioration of the fiscal situation within the federal government It will become harder for the federal government to turn off the fiscal spigot to all the provinces while there is an active election campaign under way in Quebec, perhaps leading up to a referendum in Quebec in the months ahead That is the end of my report, Mr Chairman I'd be happy to answer any questions  When 301 was announced, when Mr Kantor announced that they were seeking the authority, we actually had a brief rise in the dollar the next day There are some in the market who view anything that is done concretely on the trade side per se as a positive for the exchange market as it might reduce the risks of the exchange market club as the only weapon the Administration is using There are others who will view it the other way--as negative for the dollar and negative for the tone of the trade talks So, I think, based on what has happened the last couple of times, it's hard to predict Sometimes it has a negative effect; sometimes it actually has had a positive effect "
5335,1994-08-16," Thank you [Statement--See Appendix]  I think the market's immediate reaction was more the first of the two you mentioned I think that the extremity of the reaction, if I can distinguish the fact of the reaction from the extent of the move once it got going, was more of a gnawing anxiety about the general fiscal condition of Europe--of all the European countries put together But untangling those two anxieties in a relatively short time is quite a problem I would point out, if you'll forgive me, Mr Chairman, that the very technical aspects of the announcements were not handled as elegantly as they might have been The Italian announcement came with 60 seconds left in trading on LIFFE futures There were many people in London with very bloody fingers trying to cut back their positions That certainly    8/16/94  contributed to the very extreme reaction on that day Clearly, those two countries are the outliers on the fiscal side in Europe No one in Europe had been anxious about a general backup in short-term rates beyond the fact that everyone expected the UK to begin raising rates sometime soon As the market digests what happened and distinguishes the stronger countries from the weaker countries, there may be some improvement, but I wouldn't expect that very soon The markets may have a hard time digesting and untangling whatever it is the Bundesbank does on Thursday I think that there is likely to be a period of continued gnawing in European bond markets for several days to come  I think the market is faddish; I'll agree with you on that I think there is an opportunity for the market to be less anxious about the trade talks I'm of the school in interpreting the market's reaction to trade talk announcements that believes the market is biased in its reactions When the announcements tend to be explicit, mundane, and mechanical, however strongly articulated, eg ""we are imposing a 60-day deadline,"" the foreign exchange market, dollar/yen, can shake that off fairly easily What is harder to interpret is what happens when the announcements come in a setting or context that the overall Japan/US relationship or the overall economic relationship including exchange rates and trade flows is at stake, and that's what is being argued about here or that's why this announcement is being made That then tends to undermine the confidence in dollar/yen and the confidence that the Administration would stick to a stronger dollar rhetoric So I think that there is a nuance that the market is really very quick at picking up on, whether the announcements are couched in this broad overall relationship or whether they are couched in the specifics of the trade announcement at hand I think that on reflection, the end of July announcement by the US side was seen in the mechanical context The market reacted negatively actually to the Japanese announcement that they would walk away on September 30th if sanctions were imposed Now, that announcement fell on what probably is the thinnest foreign exchange market in the world, which is New Zealand when Australia is on holiday in early August [Laughter] The big reaction we got was clearly related to the fact that no one was trading there Some people stayed in New York Sunday afternoon to sell into it and see what was there I think everyone then realized that was 60 days away and 60 days is eternity for the foreign exchange markets, so we will worry about that in the period to September I will say regarding the period to September, what has made me more anxious than anything is seeing a number of members of Congress write a letter to the Administration saying they hoped the Administration would be tough in the trade talks I think the foreign exchange market could very easily focus on    8/16/94  a date, but that is the sort of thing the exchange market can get riled up about If there were even a modest shift in a few members of Congress choosing to run on a trade issue rather than a health care issue, that could get the foreign exchange market very engrossed in the run-up to that date I think that could be difficult "
5359,1994-09-27," [Statement--See Appendix]  I think it's rhetoric on either side--the United States or Japan And in this country it's rhetoric from anyone who is perceived to be expressing the inner thinking of the Clinton Administration  I don't think Congresspersons would be the issue; but anyone who the market could plausibly think is expressing the inner views of key Administration officials, whether in the Treasury or elsewhere, could be a source of pain to the markets  On the contrary, let me make a couple of points First, most major central banks are much more advanced than we in having some direct dealings in foreign currency government securities markets and in direct activity in those markets through private custodians I would say that we probably are the only G-10 country that does not have an account with Euro custodians, just as an example That is a normal activity of most of the other central banks Indeed, the Bundesbank really has been, if you'll forgive the expression, babysitting us by allowing us to keep rather large amounts of reserves on their balance sheets We have had quite preferential treatment--  So, I really would turn the point around I think that direct participation in the government securities market is increasingly the norm in terms of the investment of foreign currency reserves  They certainly operate in our markets in that fashion--Joan could perhaps tell you more about that than I could-- and certainly in the German market that has developed quite a bit over the last five to eight years We actually have been receiving quite preferential treatment from the Bundesbank So I would say in response to your observation that their tolerance for the slow rate at which I have been managing to move off their balance sheets shows rather high levels of friendliness and cooperation  Absolutely, yes I meant to include that in my initial remarks It could come from either side  I would remind the Committee--as I think I mentioned at our last meeting--that when the dollar dropped July 30th, 31st, and August 1st on the announcement of Super 301, my view was that rhetoric coming from the Japanese side had caused that drop, albeit as I mentioned last month in rather thin markets in New Zealand  Well, there are a couple of different layers of risk we have to consider On the one hand, the Bundesbank as a custodian is really not remotely providing the level of service that private sector custodians are capable of offering in terms of attention to detail and quality  It's a very big business and it's very hard for them to manage It's not a business they are in, really So, on one level we reduce risks at a sort of operational level by going to a custodian whose business it is to manage other people's securities and make sure they are all in the right place at the right time Another risk that gets reduced is simply the importance of having the tri-partite agent manage the collateral value--that is, ensuring that there is always enough margin held for the repurchase agreement Now, the Bundesbank simply won't even provide that service We would be doing that ourselves at some remove from German market custody arrangements  Those are two risks I would see going down quite a bit, indeed with some services being made possible only by using private sector custodians The principal risk that we face is the rather complex and subtle legal one of our confidence in the custody arrangement That is, do we have the confidence that the legal underpinnings are such that the securities will always be our own, and we won't have to worry about the loss of principal? That is the principal risk and one that the major providers of these custody services know that they are in the business of addressing But the whole RP process we will be going through is really focused on ensuring that we have confidence in the custody arrangement The final risk is the delivery-against-payment risk Most of the private sector solutions offer greater precision and clarity in reducing that risk actually than the Bundesbank currently does, but we take comfort under existing arrangements that it's the Bundesbank that is providing us the service But actually the Bundesbank does not currently assure us in any legal way that we have true delivery against payment for our purchase of the few existing government securities with low remaining maturities that we hold I hope that's helpful  I will mention one thing that I may want to bring back to the Committee in February The System Foreign Account is currently limited in its investments to maturities not exceeding twelve months When that limit was put in place, it was a simple and relatively effective means of insuring that we did not take too much price risk But it also was based on the notion that we would make sure we were always liquid Now, in my view this has resulted in a slight irony We have accumulated a fair amount and have the potential of accumulating more of the decayed securities with a remaining life under one year--German government securities--since I can't buy anything longer than 12 months Now, while that limits the price risk, it subjects me to rather high levels of liquidity risk This stuff is not highly liquid In terms of having liquidity and the    9/27/94  assurance of being able to get out, I would much rather have some portion of the System Account invested in actively traded five-year issues, for example What I have been intending to do, and this is part of the process, is to exhaust my existing authority so I could look this Committee in the face and say that to do any more of what I need to do I need to change the maturity ceiling And so I would very much like to have the authority and the ability to invest in repos It's a very flexible, liquid instrument Perhaps after we have begun that process, we would consider changing the maturity ceiling to a duration ceiling where the Committee would specify that the overall portfolio should not have an average duration of longer than X and no subportfolio should have a duration of longer than Y This would permit having some small portion--10, 15, 20 percent--of the portfolio invested in the actively traded five-year securities I'm not there yet myself in terms of our management planning, but the repo business is something, if we could get it organized, that would be the principal, and really the only, next step I would see  The Bundesbank officials are rather firm in not wanting to give us any assurance of that Now, whether they would if asked is uncertain, but they are very firm in not giving us any advance comfort  Starting with the last, yes, it is comparable There is a range of practices that runs from being identical to our market to being somewhat less collateralized at the margin than our market But the range exists The repo market in European government securities has really been evolving from infancy in--  Yes Certainly we couldn't put all our reserves into the repo market, and I wouldn't want to I would imagine always trying to have some balance between directly held or under repo government securities in the BIS and perhaps some amount still at the Bundesbank; we'll have to decide how much Having a diversity of institutional arrangements as well as maturities is part of our goal  The length of my remarks this time was really premised on the fact that we had gone to some efforts anticipating the election and I wanted to follow through I suppose I could have summarized my remarks by saying how smoothly the Mexican markets and the peso went through the election  Yes My own focus on it is not following the trade account as much as the anticipation that New York banks and dealers, who are in the list of 100 firms planning to open offices in Mexico City, will be trading peso instruments more actively As a footnote to that, I would note that I asked my counterpart at the Bank of Mexico whether he wanted me to include the dollar/peso in our turnover survey of the foreign exchange market Some banks had suggested it to us,  I presented this conundrum to my counterpart and explained that this survey was for next April He thought about it and said, ""yes"" "
5385,1994-11-15," [Statement--See Appendix] Mr Chairman, I wasn't quite sure how you wanted to proceed I could take questions on the report, or I could go on and ask for ratification of the operations and renewal of the swap lines Should I just go on with each of those?    11/15/94  I will need the Committee's ratification of our operations on Wednesday, November 2; we sold $400 million equivalent of Japanese yen and $400 million equivalent of German marks for the System's Account On November 3, we sold $250 million of yen and $250 million of marks for the System's Account Thus, over the period we sold $650 million equivalent of each of the two currencies for the System Account  Mr Chairman, the System's reciprocal currency arrangements are up for renewal for another year with the exception of our Mexican and Canadian arrangements I have no changes to suggest in the terms and conditions of the existing swap arrangements and request that the Committee approve their renewal without change  I admit it is rather hard to fathom I think it is this combination of foreign demand surprising the dealer community which has for some time now been playing the dollar from the short side I think the two factors continue to operate together The surprising election result last Wednesday produced precisely that sequence, that is, the resulting foreign demand for the dollar surprised the US dealer community a bit and the dealers rushed to cover shorts Monday morning, the same thing seemed to be occurring again The dealers saw a slightly surprising level of foreign interest in the dollar and the dealer community once again tried to play catch-up with their customers, as best I have been able to understand There was a rather quick mark-up yesterday If you look at the charts, it really happened rather quickly I have not been able to ascertain what in particular was happening at that time  The very fact that we are effectively at parity on the funds rate with German rates suggests that any move we make now will give the dollar a cost-of-carry advantage against the mark One of the things that some people talk about and that I perceive as important is that the foreign exchange market generally is not focusing on that That is, during the spring, that was the ""be-all- and-end-all"" of the exchange markets People talked about the point in time when fed funds would be higher than overnight German rates I think that that is in effect the sleeper that could catch up with the market If fed funds were to be trading between 50 and 100 basis points above German overnight rates as we went into year-end, that would begin to shift the whole dynamic of leads and lags in corporate deposits and the like That again would slightly shift the burden of proof to the speculative community If they start to lose money by running a short dollar position on cost-of-carry, that will begin to work on their calculations  Let me answer that in a couple of ways It obviously varies depending on the institution The point is that the Fed being perceived as behind each of those curves means it is rather hard to justify and means that foreign demand is around the corner There are extraordinarily high real returns in foreign bond markets, and that is a cause of major concern to our European counterparts There are incredibly high yields in France at present and German real yields simply calculated are extraordinarily high That in itself is the problem One way of looking at the problem is to ask when investors will be prepared to buy our bonds For example, if there were to be a sense of stability and the sense that a capital gain was available in the intermediate term, that might overcome the lack of a real bond yield advantage for the dollar I don't mean to suggest that it is a necessary condition for the Fed to be ahead of each and every one of the curves Rather, the negative sentiment is premised on the fact that, no matter what the analytic frame of mind, one can look at the exchange market and see that the Fed is behind each and every one of the curves That's been feeding on the market  Do you want to ratify the foreign operations or do you want to save that for later also?  This is kind of the reverse of a beating-your- wife question!  Yes! I'll mention one thing, Mr Chairman, that relates to the commentary earlier by Governor Lindsey Maybe this will inspire questions from those who are reluctant to dig in I recognize in your comment the idea that intervention takes place and it seems to box in the Committee; the bridge had better go somewhere I think both in the way you pose that and in other remarks at previous meetings, one has to say ""compared to what?"" We don't always have the counter-factual of what would have happened had we not intervened I think the hypothesis I worked with and why I thought it was a good idea to intervene was the risk of an extreme event--that in early November the dollar could have dropped another 3 percent rather quickly The range could have dropped to the mid-140s on the mark and to 94 to 96 dollar/yen The market would have interpreted that move as entirely related to the inaction of the Fed I think the Committee could then have found itself at this meeting in a very different kind of box, one that you would have liked a lot less It would be a box that is much harder to get out of, one that was similar to the box in which the Committee found itself in July where to do anything plausible or reasonable on interest rates would have looked very bad from an exchange market point of view because it was not going to be adequate That is, the reasonable change in fed funds for domestic policy purposes would look like a sop to the exchange market That is not a counter-factual thing one can put one's hands around, but one has to think of what the counter-factual is to devise recommendations --whether the risks are leading one to think it is a good idea to intervene versus not  I just wanted to add a footnote to your comment, Mr Chairman, about taking the profits on the long position One of the things that people in the market do focus on is that the accumulation of reserves since the late 1980s implies asymmetry in the US appetite for intervention That is, we are more prepared to hold down the value of our currency than we are to defend it That in itself is a major market negative among the analysts who look at our behavior That's not a particular reason to intervene on any day or for any kind of operation, but it is a reflection of the negative market sentiment about the US authorities in general  We need two votes  It was really my two votes that I was after, Mr Chairman  We have most of our reciprocal currency swap agreements up for renewal; those with Mexico and Canada come up at a different time now  Yes, a year from now  What we have now is no change in the terms and conditions of the existing swaps with Austria, the United Kingdom, Japan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the Bank for International Settlements, the Belgian National Bank, the Danish National Bank, the Bank of France, the Bundesbank, the Bank of Italy, and the Netherlands Bank These are all swap lines that have been in place for many years I have no changes to recommend I seek the Committee's approval for their renewal without change "
5409,1994-12-20," Thank you [Statement--See Appendix]  [Re-entering the meeting] Actually, we do The peso has traded at 383 to 386, down about 11 percent from yesterday; it has not approached the outer band at all Screens in New York are not quoting the Mexican stock market, but talking to people in Mexico, the decision seems to have been taken well in Mexican markets Even though the ADRs--Mexican stocks traded in New York--were down, reports indicate that Mexican stocks are trading up in Mexico So, the market seems to be taking it well in Mexico so far, and the peso hasn't traded out to its limit "
5434,1994-12-30," Yes, I'd be happy to Today the peso has traded between 5 and 520 It's original devaluation, for point of reference, was to a level of 4, and the weakest level was 585 In the last couple of days, it has strengthened to a high of about 475 That really was on quite a bit of leakage of expectations for what the official package would be and what the Mexican government policies would be It is back down now around the 5 to 520 level I should say that the peso market for most of this week has been extraordinarily thin There's an exchange rate suspended in the air Indicative prices move a great deal more than actual volume Those who were trying to sell in the initial wake of the action, the original devaluation and then float, realized how narrow the door was and how little money was coming in on the other side They have more or less suspended any attempts to sell or get out of the pesos Earlier this week they had a tesobono auction in which $750 million worth of peso instruments were coming due; they redeemed only $28 million of this amount It was simply an auction that nobody came to Their overnight rate today is about 30 percent, and at one point this week, the Bank of Mexico had to raise its overdraft penalty substantially to make sure that it was still an effective penalty over the market rate They have an auction on Tuesday coming up for value next Thursday They have $650 million worth of tesobonos running off next week and they hope to auction $500 million on Tuesday I think that is what they total this week The worst indication we had was the one-month dollar/peso auction volatility at a level of 150 percent It was 40 percent following the initial devaluation and 6 percent two months ago, to give you a sense of the thinness of a market that has no one on the other side There are high hopes in the market that the other side will materialize with the new year One of the risks next week is not only the expectation of official action, but the extent of expectations of a deeper two-way market, which may or may not materialize  here? I think actually a little bit on the contrary The peso has gotten all the way down to 585--  --and bounced back to 475 on all that leakage I think it would be doing well to trade through next Tuesday around the 5 level Now one would hope to see it do better than that but fear that it could be worse One would rather see it firm to 4, 450 on the news next week; that would be ideal If it stayed at these levels, I think that would still be pretty good news  Yes, the markets were discounting a lot of it yesterday and some of it the day before  I'm sorry, but I don't have a precise notion of the overall trading volume the day they lost $4 billion in reserves "
5446,1995-01-13," The dollar's big decline against the mark last week really occurred independently of Mexico, but I think the last few days have to be viewed slightly differently The first stepdown several days ago was really the result of large speculative positions in dollar/mark that speculators had put on at the end of the year in the hope those positions would be profitable with a rise in the dollar/mark to around 158 to 160, and that did not happen The speculative holdings were sold off rather abruptly as the mark strengthened within Europe after the pressures emerged in Italy and Spain The dollar has weakened in the last few days In this case I think the reason is still a rush of money from emerging markets and peripheral European countries into the mark and the yen The dollar has benefited relatively less than have the mark and the yen So there has been a slight effect in the last few days, but the initial weakness was not related to developments in the emerging markets I would say also that underpinning this whole 10- to 15-day period has been a much greater nervousness in the foreign exchange market, given the large speculative positions that were based on expectations that the dollar would go higher because of the prospect that the Committee would tighten at the end of this month That is, the foreign exchange market has been somewhat more anxious than our domestic debt markets that the Fed might not be tightening by 75 or by 50 basis points at the end of the month I really do think that has been the dominant effect There has been a lot of talk in the last few days concerning the impact on the exchange market of the announcements about the loan guarantees, but frankly that has been so positive for the Mexican market in the last two days that I don't see a direct play-through of the loan guarantees into the dollar market yet "
5462,1995-01-31," It closed today at around 570 to 580 and their stock market was up about 9 percent It's very positive after yesterday I caution that the peso level is only at Friday's close  I don't have the closing levels in front of me The stock market in Brazil was up strongly  SPEAKER(?) What about the US market?  In the US the Dow was up about 14 and the dollar was up about 2 pfennigs  The long bond closed at 769 percent  I don't think anyone thought five days ago that their reserves were still at $5 to $6 billion There is no credibility loss because they are down closer to $3 billion Yesterday, the market was saying that they were at $2 billion; the Mexicans denied it and said that they were above $3 billion Now, one can split hairs but they were by all accounts, and in terms of their conversations with us, above $3 billion  Yes, $34 billion We are getting down to small numbers, but no one thinks there will be a credibility loss because they were at $6 billion earlier and tomorrow they will announce $2 billion  It's not going to offset it entirely People will, as people in this room did, sort of take a little breath and say, well, that is a low number But I think the President's package and all the things that have come out today should mitigate the effects of that to a great extent  Yes, they are reasonably liquid instruments I think the sum jumped up today The dollar/mark today was--well, I think dollars had been a little oversold and people were covering back But some of it was rumors that, in order to do anything, the United States might be selling all the marks and yen immediately Now, that was mostly a skittish thing going into a rather anxious, jerky market I don't put too much stock in that  Yes  Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring eventually to the three colored charts on the single sheet of paper distributed this morning [Statement--see Appendix]  There are two aspects I would focus on One is the trend, as you point out What is disturbing, or important, to the foreign exchange market is the sense of rising current account deficits; the foreign exchange market sees the trend in the current account as being against the dollar If there were to be forecasts of stable $200 billion current account deficits for 5 or 10 years, that might be something to which the foreign exchange market eventually would adjust So, I think a big component is the fact that the deficit seems to be ratcheting up, and people in the market do not see where the process might stop Obviously, the level is also important; and in the past year, as you have all read and have heard at this table, the combination of the current account deficit and the outflow of US savings in search of portfolio diversification abroad was seen as having a piling-on effect by the foreign exchange market Market participants did not see where the demand for dollars was going to come from  I certainly err in the direction of being interested in some of the micro mechanics of markets, so you will have to forgive me But I think it also is important to keep in mind that, increasingly, all sorts of managers of funds and portfolios abroad who are interested in holding dollar assets view the foreign exchange exposure component of that as something that has to be managed completely differently These foreign holders set aside their dollar assets subject to exchange rate exposure and give them to someone to manage And so, even if foreign investors view holding US Treasuries as a very good investment, they probably have passed off to some other manager X billions of their dollar exposure to be managed on a perhaps  -76-    1/31-2/1/95  slightly more aggressive basis in the foreign exchange market And so stable flows--stable for the foreign exchange market--may be a thing of the past for the portfolio manager  With regard to Canada, I would expect the Canadians to add 50 basis points themselves The Bank of Canada has leaned very strongly against the wind in the last few weeks and in doing that has impressed their markets That is, the Bank of Canada raised its rates, and when market rates started to come back down, the Bank kept taking action to make sure the rates stayed up After that was done two or three times, the yield on 30-year bonds fell 30 basis points If the Bank of Canada adjusted basis-point-for-basis-point with us, I think the Canadian dollar would be relatively stable against the US dollar I don't mean to jump too much into the fun the Committee will have this morning, but I think the important question is compared to what?  If it is a 50 basis point increase in the federal funds rate compared to zero, I think zero would be quite bad for the Canadian dollar I also think our own markets would be rather disturbed by zero and that it would be worse for the peso than 50 basis points If one looks at where the market would like to price Mexican assets, 50 basis points added to the cost-of-carry just is not worth anything So that is not the issue The issue is stability of the interest rate environment  Yes I was referring to their total drawings for the month on the Federal Reserve That is, we did $500 million earlier in the month and last night we accepted their request and locked up an additional $1 billion  That is right  -77-    1/31-2/1/95  As fiscal agent it will be my problem to deal with their oil accounts and all that, but that is changing our participation entirely to that of just being the Treasury's agent The New York Fed will still be used, but it is not the System's exposure  -123-    1/31-2/1/95  I can add something that at least supports what Ted is saying, and I am being quite candid about some of the problems that Mexico has going forward, which you are both talking about Mexico has an independent central bank But, going back to the issue Ted raised about Bill's views and mine on the need to get their markets functioning, they do not have much of a secondary market The signaling mechanism is through the control of the auction process by the Treasury, and that is the bigger problem In the long run, the Bank of Mexico is controlling the monetary base In any one week it is the Hacienda that is controlling the signaling process And that was what happened in November; that is what happened yesterday; and that is a real problem going forward That is partly why I feel so strongly that if they are going the route of the float, then they have to take steps to liquify and get better intermediation in their secondary market It is one of the reasons "
5488,1995-03-10," After another quiet week in the market, I thought I would review events involving the dollar, the bond market, and the peso Last week, we had the dollar grinding lower both against the mark and the yen, as expectations concerning this Committee's policy course began to unwind progressively There also were comments by Federal Reserve officials that were perceived in the market as implying an indifference to the level of the dollar Finally, on Thursday we had a very choppy and sloppy foreign exchange market in the morning in New York In the afternoon, the dollar broke through the old low of 9611 against the yen and was in quite a rough downdraft against both the mark and the yen At that point, we did intervene for the ESF and the Federal Reserve by purchasing $300 million against the mark and $300 million against the yen--$150 million for the System against each of the two currencies This was an effort to stabilize what was a very sloppy market and to show that the US monetary authorities were not indifferent to the direction of the dollar  Early Friday morning in Europe, the European central banks entered the market at their own initiative, following comments by the Bundesbank, and bought collectively a little over That took the dollar up against the mark from about 144 to 145, and we found it at about that level at the opening in New York We intervened in New York and did $450 million over the day against the mark and $370 million against the yen Over the course of the entire day, we also purchased against the yen for the Japanese monetary authority European central banks did just less than  in the New York session As we were operating last Friday, it began to appear that we were inducing selling over the course of the early afternoon, and we began to pull back from the market We had a rather large volume to conduct for the Bank of Japan so we continued to operate for them in the market throughout the afternoon at their request  Over the latest weekend, there was a realignment within the ERM, and, in particular, as you are all aware the Spanish peseta was devalued The dollar began to trade off quite quickly again at the start of this week Given the turmoil in Europe, we thought it wise to step back and try to let that sort itself out as the pressures on cross rates were quite intense In the next two days, there was quite a bit of dollar selling on a combination of position adjustments and rehedging of exposure by both European and Japanese accounts This selling had a heavy overlay of speculative accounts pushing in the direction they saw the hedging to be driving the dollar On Wednesday, we had one of the most successful concerted interventions in some time--that of the Chairman and President Tietmeyer Through their statements, they managed to communicate the resolve and concern of the monetary authorities without providing any liquidity to those who may have been looking for opportunities to sell the dollar This morning, before the employment numbers were released, we had quite    3/10/95  widespread rumors that we would be intervening following the release of the numbers, whatever they were The dollar began to rise in advance of the numbers as people who were either short or wanted to go to neutral in some way or another adjusted their positions The dollar traded up briefly on the numbers and then experienced a bout of selling on the fact but oscillated throughout the day after that Dollar/mark and dollar/yen traded fairly stably for the day--the dollar/mark more or less at its high for this week, and the dollar/yen more or less at the mid-range of the week  I will turn to the interest rate market here in the United States If I look back to the Chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, I think the market has pretty much gotten back to where it was at that time in the sense of having about a 50 percent probability of a 50 basis point rise in the fed funds target by the end of May With the dollar weakness, the exchange rates were beginning to back up a bit at the start of this week However, and this is fairly interesting, over the last two weeks the dealer community has been quite surprised by the strength of customer demand There has been a great deal of investor buying interest, particularly at the short end It appears that a great deal of the asset management community had underbought, if you will, and this money now seems to be coming in and continually surprising the dealer community who had been positioning themselves on the short side Waiting for this rally to correct itself is how the dealers would think of it This morning, the dealers positioned themselves short again, to a great extent on the risk of a bigger employment number than the market was looking for The dealers were once again surprised by customer demand immediately on release of the employment data, and we had some back and forth in the market The market then got its bearings and found something it could understand in the Beckner article, which quoted an unnamed Federal Reserve official as looking at the weaker components of today's numbers As the morning progressed, the bond market took some comfort from the stability of the dollar, which seemed to encourage more customer buying  I will cover only very briefly developments in the peso market this week We started the week with a combination of extraordinary anxiety about the political melodrama in Mexico, about the banks in trouble, and fears that the economic plan would both disappoint the market and include nonconvertibility The rumor that the plan would include nonconvertibility swept the market yesterday and brought the peso down to its low of 785 The package announced last night in Mexico City was clearly better than the market had feared and it did not include capital controls The peso has improved today, encouraged by of intervention by the Bank of Mexico They have done over the week and the peso is trading at about 630 now Today, as many of you may be aware, the Mexicans have requested--and we are now operating on their request-- to repay $1 billion on the drawings made on the two swap lines, the Fed and the Treasury swap lines That repayment includes $500 million on their drawing from the System The Mexicans will draw $3 billion on the medium-term facility that the Treasury established in the ESF That leaves $2 billion outstanding on the combined short-term facility with the Fed and Treasury and $3 billion on the new medium-term facility That is the extent of my remarks I would be happy to answer any questions on any of the subjects    3/10/95  I think, as I said, that it was viewed as better than they were fearing There was some anxiety that the program would include a much bigger rise in the minimum wage and less in the way of fiscal discipline and tax increases On one front, it was better than the markets expected or better than they feared It was thought to be more credible than what they were anxious about, but clearly there still is a very gnawing anxiety about the condition of Mexican banks Even though the peso has come off its rather extraordinary lows of yesterday, the spreads are really very wide I don't think we should be under any illusions that we have established a new trend for the peso  The reaction to the program is not one of euphoria among the populace of Mexico I believe that there have been quite chaotic events over the last several weeks in Mexico; I have usually heard protests coming from outside the Bank of Mexico on the phone when I have called my counterpart there over the last ten days I am not aware of any particularly extraordinary popular outcry in Mexico today I am just not aware of it, Cathy "
5505,1995-03-28," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]  I think a number of central banks are holding more dollar reserves than some people within those central banks think they ought to be holding I wouldn't pretend to say that is the official posture of all the central banks, but I think the leakage into the markets occurs as a result of that There are a number of central banks in Asia that both have accumulated large dollar reserves and have a rather active approach to foreign exchange trading as a potential source of central bank profit In those central banks, some people may have a view that they would rather hold fewer dollars, and since the banks' foreign exchange desks tend to be somewhat active, the market then is free to interpret that when they move one way that must be a secular trend It is more frequently just trading back and forth, but that sort of activity certainly has provided some credence to that general story  I talk to them from time to time about that They are not happy about it, but the Bundesbank is fully committed to a single reserve currency--the dollar They have no appetite for diversifying their portfolio I think the Bank of Japan at a policy level is still more or less committed to a dollar reserve policy They have diversified somewhat and are holding a few more marks It's still a tiny, tiny fraction of their total reserves  I'll take the short term and leave Ted with the long term! In the short term, I think the fiscal picture weighs on the dollar as I mentioned principally in terms of the competence issue as it relates to US economic management, not in the sense of forecasting a macro economic effect Whether analytically correct or not, market participants do in a sense add up the two deficits, the current account deficit and the fiscal deficit, and say we can't manage anything so they can't find any reason to buy dollars or hold dollars In the short run, at least in the last three months, I don't think the markets have really tried to digest the implications, as you have, on a much more sophisticated basis But they are negative in the short run Now, I'll defer to Ted on the tougher question  No  That is our sense that the short end--  I am very sorry if that was not clear I was referring to the 2-year maturity of the coupon curve  No, I don't think there has been a big rush of foreign demand for Treasuries The sense is that the money has been coming out of the investment community, the mutual funds, and the real money crowd into the dealer community The dealers have been surprised by that Their tendency had been to play the market from the short side during this period It gave the market a bit of a choppy feel from time to time, and in fact contributed to some of the rise in prices There was a phenomenon of the market doing better during the afternoons, which was sort of curious We feel that was a bit the result of the dealers just catching up with their own customers But we don't have any sense of foreign demand There is constant chatter going on about how the capital flight from Latin America is fueling the bond market Capital flight from Latin America, however defined, is not of a sufficient size to drive the  -13-    3/28/95  overall dollar exchange rate It is large relative to the peso and other Latin American currencies It's hard to see if it is not big enough to affect the dollar exchange rate overall how it is really big enough to drive the bond market, which is rather large  So, these stories are more in the nature of anecdotes floating around than anything we have been able to pin down  We have data on what they hold with us as custodian, but that is only a portion of what most central banks hold  I don't have an exact view I don't have any of those data here  In the last 10 weeks they have gone up We had an extraordinary rise of $10 billion in one reporting period There has been some back and forth movement in such holdings  No, it didn't include the Caribbean The market all read it as entirely the Bank of Japan  Ironically, it was to a substantial extent other Asian central banks who were thought to be sellers of dollars  Who just happened to be shifting  We did have a period when our custodial accounts went down quite a bit, net, but I haven't looked at the figures There was a period where some of the Asian central banks--  --went into bills, came out of them, and went back That created some volatility in our custody holdings So those holdings probably are a little higher over the past 10 or 20 weeks, but not dramatically, I would think  If I could comment, going back to the reserve currency status issue, it is interesting that the markets all chatter about how the dollar is losing its reserve currency status Yet, the dollar bill is in heavy demand around the world  The hundred dollar bill, yes The greenback It's an interesting offset to the concept that the dollar is losing its reserve currency status  A tiny tiny bit I don't particularly! [Laughter]  I think we have a dollar problem, as I mentioned, in the way the foreign exchange market looks at the relationship between our interest rates and our current account I don't mean that should drive the policy decided around this table, but that is the chain around our ankle, if you will, that we have to deal with; it's the load we are carrying The mark is at extraordinary highs on a trade-weighted basis The mark clearly is strong--however defined--against us, against Europe, against everybody There also is a problem of an ever appreciating yen Now, something may break that at some point, but until it does I think there are problems in each corner; each leg of this stool has its own problem And that in my view is how we get the historic lows or historic highs--when there is something that is pushing the exchange rate on both sides in the same direction "
5525,1995-04-28,"  The long end of the yield curve is not much changed from where it was before the last meeting But there has been a change over the intermeeting period at the short end of the curve We had a slight backup in the two-to-five-year area around the time of the March meeting on data that were not quite to the market's liking That was followed by a long, slow ride down in yields during the month of April, until around April 20, as the market began to see weaker data that seemed to conform to the view of a soft landing in sight By the middle of April, however, the market began to get a sense that it was-a little stretched At that point the spread between the fed funds rate and the two-year rate ranged around 45 basis points There was a lot of chatter in the market about how the market was relying on foreign central bank purchases amid unfavorable supply conditions and a lot of explanations as to why people should be interested at these levels At that point, even as the market saw some rather weak data, we saw no further gains in prices, reflecting this sense that the market was a little stretched In the last several days, the market has seen some data that were a little stronger than it was comfortable with This is modest stuff; no one was shocked But durables, homes sales, and today's Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index were all a little on the stronger side than the market was counting on As a result, the short end began to come back up Now the yield curve, in the two-to-thirty year range, is about where it was just before the Committee's last meeting  Looking forward, I think the market is going to be gearing itself for the week beginning a week from today Next Friday, we will have the employment data The following Tuesday and Wednesday will be the quarterly refunding, which will change the supply outlook of the market Then, on the heels of that, retail sales and inflation data will come out on Thursday and Friday Over the few weeks between now and the next Committee meeting in Washington, I think that's the pivotal week that the bond market is going to be positioning itself for  The dollar obviously has been under a fair amount of pressure over the period It is interesting that for the last couple of weeks the dollar has traded in a rather narrow range After the last meeting through the middle of April, we again had pronounced weakness against the yen But that coincided with the yen's tremendous strength against the mark as well, and that may have contributed to the dollar stabilizing against the mark and ultimately trading in the ranges of the last couple of weeks Right after the Committee's last meeting, we had the surprise rate cut by the Bundesbank, which did give the dollar quite a bounce from the 138 level up to the 141 level This unwound rather quickly, in part on the fact that it was just a short covering rally but announcement by the Bank of Japan of the adjustment in their call money rate This adjustment was viewed as a weak substitute for a change in the official discount rate that the market had been looking    4/28/95  for The dollar then began to trade off We intervened on Monday, April 3rd, along with the Bank of Japan, and then on the 5th with the Bank of Japan and the Bundesbank There was no tremendous rally in the dollar following those operations But I think, following the three-way intervention on Wednesday, April 5, the dollar did develop a sense of firmness against the mark even as it began to accelerate down against the yen The pressure against the yen continued and reached its crescendo in mid-April following the second attempt of the Japanese authorities to put out a fiscal package and to cut the official discount rate on April 14 When the announcements finally came out, the market viewed the mix of policy actions as a rehashing of prior efforts of the Japanese authorities, which in particular was lacking in any specifics whatsoever The market came to the view that the specifics had been taken out because they were so small and lacking in meaning That brought the dollar down briefly to the low of 7985 on April 17 It then traded up against the yen As I said, for the last two weeks, the dollar traded in ranges of dollar/mark 135 to 139 and dollar/yen 81 to 84  The positive note of the period has been in Mexico City and the peso Since the last meeting, the peso has firmed from a level of 680 to a high of 580 just two days ago It has given up some of that gain and come back to around 6 in the last two days There have been similar positive movements in the pricing of Mexican stocks and Brady bonds To a great extent, this has been a reduction in the uncertainty premium--the risk that chaos could develop at any time in Mexico City--as the markets became more comfortable with themselves While there were plenty of risks to the Mexican program going forward, it didn't appear to market participants that they would be caught by surprise on one day's notice The downward adjustments from the high the peso reached a couple days ago seem to reflect a combination of a market that began to thin out at those higher levels--a sense that such a level is a little frothy--and the growing awareness that Monday will be May Day in Mexico, the traditional day of labor marches Even though the officials of mainstream unions have agreed to call off their annual marches, the more left-leaning unions have not There is considerable anxiety about protests in the streets that have helped take some of the punch out of the peso  Let me note that on April 19, the Treasury extended an additional $3 billion to Mexico from its medium-term facility, bringing the total extended on that facility to $6 billion One adds to that the $1 billion from the ESF in short-term money and $1 billion that has been provided from the System Account in short-term money, for a total of $8 billion outstanding at present Next week we will be rolling over the two short-term outstandings of $1 billion each This is the first of the three possible rollovers that were contemplated when the package was put together You will recall that the Treasury agreed that any amount still outstanding at the end of three rollovers would have a Treasury takeout  That's the extent of my report; I'd be happy to answer any questions  I believe they currently are a tad over $6 billion The amount may be $6-1/2 billion or approaching $7 billion Is Charlie there? I'm sorry, I forgot  Early after our last meeting, I think they did a very modest intervention; it was a token amount Their principal form of intervention in support of the peso, as you know, would be the direct provision of dollars through the window to the Mexican banks in conjunction with maturing tesobonos There is some sense that NAFINSA, the government holding company group, may have been purchasing dollars in the last week or so But the Bank of Mexico itself has not yet been seen purchasing dollars "
5537,1995-05-23," Thank you, Mr Chairman I will first discuss current conditions in interest rate markets and then some of the factors contributing to recent exchange rate movements before reviewing foreign and then domestic operations [Statement--see Appendix]  If you are taking a short position on the expectation that the data will lean the other way or the market will not continue to rally, you begin to lose a lot of money and you have to cover your shorts There are people who believe that there will be a rebound in activity by the end of the year, but it is too expensive for them to try to express that position in the market  We talk to people, and there are some well known losses that are now reported We certainly talk to the dealers about major positions that go against them So, yes, there are informal surveys and some more formal surveys  I think, as Don said, you lose a lot of money There were people who were priced out of the market in December They thought that the fed funds rate might not be raised 200 basis points    5/23/95  in 1995 and that the yield curve had moved well beyond where it would go But they chose not to express that view in the market in December  Sure [Laughter]  There were various stages in their announcement process One of the earlier, more definitive, announcements actually had a positive effect on dollar/yen--modestly positive I think I have described my views to the Committee before on this When the markets perceive trade policy statements to be just saber rattling and no action is anticipated--just a lot of angry words--that tends to be negative for the exchange markets because they don't perceive that anything concrete will be done But on the few occasions when our trade representative has announced concrete trade policy steps, whether sanctions or invocations of statutory authority, the exchange market for dollar/yen generally has responded positively on the theory that at least the sign is right for the impact on our short-run trade position  No, I don't, and I would like to look into and clarify some of the criteria that we use to approach this task The presumption for several years has been that we are really replicating the portfolio as it exists So, there is simply an effort to maintain roughly the current maturity mix That is the policy that I inherited and it can be seen in effect in the new tables that we provide at the back of our report It is a policy that I have been trying to understand better and to think through some of its implications It    5/23/95  is something that we have begun to work on We contemplate having a few staff people devote a fair amount of time over coming months to thinking through the criteria that we use as we approach each auction The tradition has been to assume that we wanted a relatively high component of bills to permit the portfolio to run off rather easily without the need to sell a lot of securities into the market and disturb the structure of the yield curve, if such an occasion were to arise So, that is the nature of the received wisdom and how I intend to proceed  Yes The presumption as to the size of each pass is sort of built into the assumptions about how we operate We have to look at the two together  We will be looking at that There are arguments for smaller passes with more frequent operations; there are arguments for larger ones I have had some very interesting discussions with other central bankers in my position about the nature of a central bank portfolio and how to think about it There is not much divergence in practices, but there is a wide range of views about how to think about this One central banker feels very strongly that a central bank's portfolio should never contain on-the-run securities A central bank, after all, makes its own liquidity Why does the central bank need to hold on-the-run issues? The central bank should exclusively be buying everything that is off the run But in practice, of course, that would involve the Herculean effort of being the vacuum cleaner of the securities market  Yes  And to who  Yes  That's fine  So, there is a wide range of views A number of central banks that apply very sophisticated approaches to their foreign currency portfolios--really as profit centers--have been    5/23/95  backfitting some of that financial technology into thinking about their domestic portfolios  By normally leaving the market a little short, we continue to push the rate in that direction The rate expectations can be seen in the fed funds futures contracts Both my report and Don's report indicate that the market is looking for the funds rate to be edging down, or skewed slightly in that direction, over coming months We do not feel a great deal of pressure in the reserve market itself I wouldn't relate this to the substance behind your question, but there have been some occasions where demand for excess reserves seemed a little on the soft side in the last few weeks I think that is more of an anomaly, but it is something that I am intrigued with There was one period in which the demand for excess reserves was really extraordinarily soft; we still have not gotten our hands on the reason for that excess level below $1/2 billion I don't see that as a profound change but more as a fluctuation in the reserve market itself But the market's forecast certainly is leaning in that easing direction I don't think we have quite felt that in our reserve management yet "
5562,1995-07-05," [Statement--see Appendix]  For value today, the Mexicans are drawing an additional $25 billion on the medium-term facility That brings to $105 billion the amount that has been drawn on the facility the Mexicans have with the Treasury For several months we and the Treasury each have had outstanding $1 billion drawings on our respective short-term swap lines with the Mexicans Those remain outstanding; the drawings have three-month maturities We have rolled them over once I would expect, because I have heard nothing to the contrary, to be asked to roll them over again on August 1 That would be the second renewal In our agreement with the Treasury, there could be a third rollover of the three-month swap in the fall  That's a very important and difficult question I would put the emphasis slightly differently than you I think the interbank community has been reducing its risk appetite and has been quite nervous not just in the last period but for the whole six months of this year It's that reduction in the risk-taking appetite of the dealer community that makes it particularly difficult for hedge funds to operate in their traditional style Now, the fact that there might    7/5-6/95  be smaller positions in the market--and we have some confirmation of that--can cut either way on the efficacy of intervention If people are closer to neutral, it's harder to catch them far off guard-- leaning far the wrong way On the other hand, if positions are smaller and people are slightly off guard, it may be easier to frighten them back to neutral There is not much science to that assertion and a lot of feel I think there is something to your point, but there could be occasions where it would be harder to intervene effectively because everyone is sitting happily at neutral in terms of their own risk appetite  We have a survey on turnover in the foreign exchange market, based on April data We still don't have all the data, but it will give us a three-year to three-year snapshot The better comparison is to talk to the major interbank firms to get a sense of foreign exchange market liquidity and what is happening to their volume In the last month it has certainly been thin There is some variance among firms; different banks have had good months and bad months this year, and I don't feel confident that we can say something definitive about turnover in the foreign exchange markets this six months as contrasted with the first six months of 1994  One of the resources of the ESF is SDRs The process of monetizing them and presenting them to us--let me say if I am explaining something wrong, Sandy, please bail me out--we take them in and they get dollars for them And that is the major--  They sell us the SDR certificates; they get the dollars and we have the SDR certificates That then is an injection of liquidity that we have to worry about and sterilize as we would any other form of intervention in that sense So, that's the process of providing them dollars monetizing the SDRs  Initially, it would--  The mathmatical way is that the Treasury balance goes up, as we are all saying That's the narrow answer But the Chairman is asking--  I may be missing the point, but in terms of the System Open Market--  We will endeavor to have a simplified--  We will endeavor to clarify it for all interested parties  That would be warehousing  I want to thank you!  I think we heard the same thing from the same sources at different times this morning Looking through the pricing of the contract and the different time horizons one has to adjust for, there is a 60ish percent probability, if you read it literally, of a move early in the month--meaning now And there is an implied probability closer to 100 percent of a 25 basis point easing by the end of the month Without going too far into the gymnastics of it, that's how one interprets 14 basis points on a contract that settles near the end of the month, given the different probabilities and different time horizons  Yes I was trying to offer a note of caution about whether you should read that price literally as saying that everyone in the market has agreed that those are the probabilities attached to a move or whether it's a clearing price between some who have a much higher sense of confidence that there will be a move earlier in the month and others who don't think there will be a move this month at all There is room for all sorts of interpretations as to whether a given basis point implication in the fed funds contract indicates a consensus view or a range of different views that find a clearing price "
5589,1995-08-22," [Statement--see Appendix]  You're asking me to put myself inside their minds I am a little squeamish about doing that  I don't see it as an either/or situation I think the Treasury feels very strongly about the commitment made in the G-7 communique in April that they were seeking an orderly reversal of previous exchange rate moves At that point, they were referring to the downward movement of the dollar from January through the end of April When they say they are seeking an orderly reversal, they really mean that I think the financial sector difficulties in Japan and the weakness of the Japanese economy are an additional reason why the Treasury was concerned about exchange rates when they reached their lows But I don't think it is really an either/or situation They would like to see a stronger dollar and now we have a somewhat stronger dollar, though I would note that it is not yet back to the levels of mid-January I don't think anyone thought the dollar was over-valued in mid-January of 1995 I tried in my remarks to be rather careful to say that the dollar is off its lows and we have had a big move, but it was a bigger move down  I think the Treasury is looking at the decline of the dollar from January through the spring and seeing that as something that is not positive for US financial markets or the perception of the US economy It's really the time horizon that is involved here You can think about disorderly markets as a fifteen minute phenomenon; you can think about them as a 24-hour phenomenon; or you can worry about whether there wasn't a bit of an overshoot on a quarter-by-quarter basis I think the Treasury's focus has been more on the quarter-by-quarter basis  I think this Treasury has tried to shy away from putting it so pithily They are trying very hard to shake the image that there is any effort to depreciate ourselves into prosperity So that would be their rather direct rebuttal to the point you are making They are trying to shake that image  I am not aware of any exchange rate target or particular objective other than the sense that the dollar was a bit low this spring "
5613,1995-09-26," Thank you Before permitting myself to take advantage of the new high-tech toys in the ceiling and because of the number of topics I need to cover, I thought I would try to exhaust the potential of older technologies Thus, you should find an outline of my remarks on the table in front of you together with a single page of colored charts [Statement--see Appendix]  Yes Beginning in the spring and continuing over the summer, the German banking community seemed to awake to the possibility of capturing some of the flows by placing them in Swiss investments This coincided with some revelations about the use of Luxembourg accounts by Germans for tax avoidance So, there was a double incentive for the German investment community to move out of Luxembourg and find some other place German banks in Switzerland, not just Swiss banks, seem to have taken advantage of this opportunity initially through mark Eurodeposits in Switzerland but funds clearly also were moved into Swiss assets for ""safe haven"" reasons as well There has been much talk in Germany about how far out the yield curve investors can afford to go, given the uncertainties about future returns That has been part of the marketing pitch the bankers have used to stimulate this flow  Yes, precisely things like that  I failed to mention that the Swiss lowered their rates and saw their currency keep appreciating last week  They are down to 2 percent on their discount rate  In the implicit division of labor between Don Kohn and myself, I am working on issues that would not involve legislative changes There are questions about possible changes in reserve requirements that might involve new legislation, and Don may be better placed to talk about those At the Desk, we are looking at some very simple issues such as what time of day we can operate; what level of information we have to operate with at different times of the day; whether there is a different type of repo with which we might be able to conduct operations in the market late in the day; and whether we could change the discount window in some informal way, or perhaps some statutory way Reserve requirement changes would be another approach  No If the dealer community does more of its financing early in the day, they generally have fewer securities left to finance by the time we would normally enter the market at 1130 am It is a very mechanical issue  It is just the domestic players and they are just completing their financing Certainty is better for someone looking to finance a large portfolio than uncertainty, and waiting to find out whether or not we will enter the market has its risks for them It is not a major issue On Monday of last week we received only $57 billion of propositions The next day we were looking at a need between $8 and $10 billion at the time we made the decision We did end up injecting about $8 billion, after getting about $10 billion in propositions as a result of operating earlier  The claim is that this high official of Daiwa's New York branch had been trading in US bills and bonds in the straight bill and bond markets He managed to lose between $1 and $15 billion over the last 11 years; that is the amount that is unaccounted for It's a rather extraordinary tale The relevant authorities in New York are looking into the matter  They are not a primary dealer, excuse me This is the bank The securities firm is an entirely separate legal entity  The securities firm is the primary dealer This is a branch bank trust department    -10-  I'll just insert there A number of the European countries continue to prefer to hold a relatively large portion of their reserves in dollars for investment purposes But in a crisis, they want to convert those into marks to be able to defend their own currency There are two effects on the market that in the very short run can create this sort of disturbance Even the expectation of it can create the disturbance  No, it shouldn't  Yes I'm referring to a very short-run effect Countries have a tendency to hold large quantities of dollars and then convert them into marks to defend their own currency They also have a preference for acquiring reserves that way Even if their ultimate goal is to acquire marks, they will try to move into the dollar out of their own currency and then into marks in the event of a crisis The other very short-run phenomenon, which certainly hurt us last week, occurs when the situation that Ted was referring to becomes acute As Europe closes up for business and investors are looking to defend  -11-    9/26/95  themselves, then they really have to go into the dollar/mark because they simply can't get liquidity in the Paris/mark or the peseta/mark in the New York trading day after Europe has gone home This then tends to accelerate the movement in dollar/marks in the very short run It's very short run but it's very pronounced  I think the support of the Chancellor for the process is really the only thing standing in the way of the deluge of public opposition  All of the above! "
5638,1995-11-15," Thank you As you can see on the agenda and also on an outline of my remarks that has been circulated with some attached charts, I am going to take up four topics separately I will be asking for the Committee's questions and relevant vote at the end of each of the first three topics so that we can get through this rather meaty portion of the agenda in an orderly fashion I will turn first to the report on foreign exchange market developments and Desk operations [Statement--see Appendix]  The Mexicans paid down part of their swap line drawings, and I rolled over the remaining portion on October 30 for the third time I am requesting Committee ratification  Yes, at the end of January  Thank you [Statement continued--see Appendix]  No, I don't see how At the very bottom of the list of our swap lines that I have given you, you can see that the Treasury has two swap lines of its own with Mexico and the Bundesbank  They are entirely separate So, I cannot see any way that a drawing on the System swap lines would have any necessary connection with System warehousing for the Treasury  Thank you Before turning to my report on the domestic markets and operations, I would like to give the Committee a bit more background on the Desk's cooperation with the Japanese monetary authorities in managing the liquidity of their portfolio of US government securities as part of their broader effort to aid the dollar liquidity of the Japanese banks [Statement continued--see Appendix]  A spike in year-end rates is always there I don't think it's out of line with--  But it's entirely in line with the normal end- of-year pressures  But the problem there, just to go into detail, is that we have to look at the futures contract for December, take account of the limited probability of a Committee action to ease in December, and then look at the December contracts The market normally does some smoothing in its pricing of the futures contracts If there is an assumption of an aggressive easing in policy three months out, the end contracts tend to edge down a little and to provide a bit of trend line toward that lower funds rate That makes it hard to judge futures prices  Yes  Well, their fiscal year-end is March 31st, and there is some pressure in their funds market then There are occasions when the deutschemark money market experiences rather sharp spikes These stem both from the German banking system and from foreign demand of which the Japanese may be a part, but I don't think quite as significant a part as in our market  Yes  The answer is no Some central banks realize that if they are talking about $500 million or $1 billion, they can sell bills to the Desk and we will execute such transactions for them relatively effectively There are some less subtle or more anxious central bankers who approach the Desk to ask if we can guarantee that we will do a $5 billion repo with them if they need some liquidity suddenly What they want to avoid is having to sell the securities outright and having to take a gain or a loss We explain to them that, no, we don't provide guarantees So, the question frequently comes up conversationally in that way As I say, the subtler central bankers understand that when relatively small amounts of Treasury securities are involved we can help them by either selling the securities in the market or taking them into our portfolio The larger amounts are not in the nature of what we do routinely and that was the tenor of our conversations with the Japanese when larger amounts were clearly what they were interested in  Yes We would try to choose an area of the yield curve, say, the two- to three-year area or the five-year area, define it for the dealers, and then take propositions only in that portion of the curve  It might the first few times that we use the procedure But my hope is that things would smooth out over time, as the dealers got used to it and they saw that we are like any big customer who might come along and buy up a certain maturity I also want to be clear I don't think we would necessarily be mechanical about day one, day two, day three, day four and conduct these transactions on consecutive days We might do it that way; we might break it up and have a day fall in between depending on what other things are going on--a bill auction, for example  The community to talk to first and foremost is the dealers, wherever they are located, since they are the ones who have to do the bidding and put in the propositions  Obviously, once we begin it we'll have to have guidance for Peter Bakstansky in our press office and figure out what we are going to say more generally so that the Fed-watching community doesn't jump on it and misinterpret it  Yes  You are raising a good point I think we have always thought of swaps as a bit of a hybrid Given our focus on having a short-term means of repayment, we have tried to think of the swap lines, or I try to think of them, as merely a liquidity arrangement with a central bank like the Bundesbank, notwithstanding the fact that they hold a lot of US government securities Conceptually, I think the swap line can still be used, but obviously its use is problematic given our concern about the short-term means of repayment if a borrower really runs through every asset in sight In the episode to which you refer, there certainly was a sense, and related anxiety, on our part that they did not merely want to draw on the swap line as they ran out of assets but that they already had gone deeply into debt We weren't going to be the first creditor in line Returning to the Bundesbank example, what has clearly eclipsed all this is an increasing sophistication in the liquidity management of the portfolio of the Bundesbank As I have described to the Committee in the past, they maintain a large amount of immediately available liquidity in case they need dollars for intervention purposes and they structure their portfolio accordingly So, the likelihood that the Bundesbank is going to look to the swap line for liquidity purposes is quite low As the Chairman said a year ago, we realize that the swap    11/15/95  lines are somewhat anachronistic, but getting rid of them could be more painful than carrying them forward I think we might all benefit by rethinking the nature of our central bank cooperation Maybe when we are through with this exercise with the Japanese and have been repaid on the Mexican swap line, it might be useful for the Committee to review the purpose of these cooperative facilities  Those securities had already been selling off a bit, and that's rather awkward for a security with a short remaining maturity  The amount is small in absolute terms, but it is noticeable that dealers are turning them down  I don't know it off the top of my head, I'm afraid I think we discussed it in the document we submitted as a special report Sandy--please go ahead  We need a vote to ratify the domestic operations  No, no, I'm not seeking another vote [Statement continued--see Appendix]  Mr Chairman, I would be happy to answer any questions from the Committee on this final part of my report But maybe you are all tired of listening to my voice, and I wouldn't mind if you pass  In recent months and years, we collectively have been targeting a balance of about $5 billion for them But we all recognize that forecasting the Treasury balance is in part an art, not a science, and the risks exist But it's in the nature of a forecast that we are always forecasting tonight what the cash balance will be when we wake up tomorrow morning and then tomorrow what it will be when we make payments on the Treasury's behalf We at the Desk were very pleased that the Treasury made their announcement as early as possible this week because of the various uncertainties we would face in our forecasts of their balances if we waited until the 1lth hour to worry about default and the market did the same, and given the computer systems that release payments early in the morning So, the  -10-    11/15/95 -11-  Monday morning announcement was very much what we had urged on them in terms of the number of days that we needed for guidance  260 something  Virtually all  On any one day?  Most of them  It would send a very negative message  No, I said nothing in my remarks that suggested that I said the Desk was eager to find a way to demonstrate that they would be accepted as collateral in temporary operations  Temporary operations are open market operations  My point was that I did not think that an intentional preemptive strike to buy the particular defaulted securities outright would be an appropriate action in the circumstances that I mentioned  Yes, we are  We do outright purchases relatively infrequently --to wit my discussion about coupon passes--a handful of times a year I am suggesting that we raise that to three or four handfuls a year for reasons of operational simplicity without changing the amount we would buy over the course of the year relative to reserve demands The question is whether we take defaulted securities in temporary operations In repo operations, we take whatever securities the dealers offer We are not going to announce in advance that we are going to turn down any particular Treasury security in repo operations The idea that I urge the Committee to put on the back burner for much later consideration is the question of whether we would buy outright preemptively those particular issues that the Treasury had defaulted upon  If they were presented to us as propositions for temporary overnight or four-day System operations, and they were at the better end of the prices, we would look at what are the best prices and draw a line at an amount that meets our objective My desire would be for the Desk to be indifferent to what the CUSIPs are, whether the CUSIP underneath is one that has missed a payment or not Now, maybe these securities will end up among the better prices; that's a likely hypothesis if the dealers are on their toes They might be a large portion of what we did or they might be only a small part of our overall operation given the uncertainties about the volume we would be doing So, yes, there is a certain likelihood that we would take in some, or many, or all of them in temporary operations  -12-    11/15/95  where the legal risks of an extended duration of a Treasury default remain with the dealer "
5663,1995-12-19," Thank you, Mr Chairman I would like to begin with the Mexican swap renewal before turning to the market reports All of this is summarized on the one-page outline of my report that you have before you [Statement--see Appendix]  That was part of the package  There are two $3 billion swap arrangements; think of it that way There is the basic $3 billion, which was what we already had in place Then we added a supplemental one last December of $15 billion, which was increased to $3 billion on February 1 It's just a coincidence that it was $3 billion Now, we are letting that whole supplemental arrangement expire, and we are going back to the original, regular $3 billion  There are lots of threes  It's drawn under the regular swap line They never drew enough to get into the supplemental or temporary $3 billion  I think you need to separate the question of whether the market had a good sense of a number of data points from their balance sheet and macroeconomics and whether we had good information about their reserves There were only a very few days in December 1994 when we were, I think, at a loss and a little anxious about what their reserve levels were But I don't think, if you take 1994 as a whole, that we had a sense that we weren't getting a good level of cooperation and understanding of what their reserve balances were That's internally That's different from the public issue that I think the IMF was addressing  I think it's important to keep in mind that we have not thought of Treasury takeouts as the presumption under which we have swap lines It was a presumption under which the Committee undertook this drawing in the set of circumstances that existed in January, including the President's program, but reliance on Treasury takeouts has not been a presumption for the existence of swap lines  Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]  The long bond is at 622 percent, I think, so it is backing up a bit The middle of the maturity range is also backing up  Yes, 1/2 point In yield, the long bond traded up to 622 percent early overnight in Tokyo, came down to 618 percent, and was back up to the 622 - 624 percent range in the last hour "
5686,1996-01-30," Norm, should we go on to the authorizations?  Thank you [Statement--see Appendix]  Right I have thought of it, and I think the market thinks of it, as two distinct positions In one, they are long dollars against yen Secondly, they choose a sector of our yield curve, say the five- to ten-year area, in which to be long They may have borrowed yen somewhere on their balance sheet as well, given the low yen interest rates I don't have any better estimates of what the total positions are in these transactions than the one you cited, Mr Chairman I think it is a type of transaction that has been talked about more than it may have been adopted It has pointed the overall market in a direction of confidence in those two trades That is, its principal impact has been in getting people to think that the dollar was going to appreciate and that there might be value in investing somewhere along the US yield curve That has given people greater and greater confidence  There are a number of financial intermediaries who manage discreetly where they choose to borrow and the size of their positions I don't think that is being picked up in what people talk about as the ""hedge fund"" trades The traditional investment banks simply look around the world to finance themselves at the lowest cost they can There are people who do that within their hierarchies, and there are other people who choose where they should be investing I assume there is a good deal of that kind of funding operation going on That may be what you feel is missing in the estimates  I am afraid we all think it can go a good bit further Beyond that, I don't know if we have anything very scientific to offer you  I got repaid You don't mind that I got repaid on the Mexican swap drawings!  You ratify that I accepted repayment "
5710,1996-03-26, Thank you [Statement--see Appendix] 
5732,1996-05-21, Thank you [Statement--see Appendix] 
5755,1996-07-02," I will be referring to the package of charts that was just distributed [Statement--see Appendix]  A change in the dollar I tried to be careful If you look at those two charts, they tend to suggest a random walk in the relationship between increased volatility and the direction the dollar will go, but in the last few years the direction has been toward a weaker dollar  Well, I am not going to be able to answer that at the theoretical level for the long sweep of history The data show that it is in the last couple of years that the market has had a bias in favor of the mark; when volatility pops, it is the dollar that weakens The point is that it ought to be a random walk as to which way the exchange rate goes when volatility goes up, and I think that is probably the case in the long sweep of history The phenomena that I am looking at and I am concerned about are not a theoretical or principled articulation of the relationship between options and spot prices, but they relate to what I have observed and heard in talking to dealers, namely, that people are writing a very large number of    7/2-3/96  options right now So, I am offering you statistical data points in the chart that reflect what we hear in the market about all the options that are being written  I think I have both a degree of curiosity and, given the history of the last few years, a point of concern about the level of options being written  The incentive that is most evident to me is that they can't make money through normal channels  They now are subject to a rather disciplined approach to income targets that are set in terms of the level of income they are supposed to achieve month by month I am not saying that is a pretty sight  I think in the short run, yes, that is a big part of it  Let me try to take the second leg of that first The skewing of the demand for reserves toward the end of the maintenance period is a normal pattern but one that we have seen become more pronounced in the past year My initial reaction to that was to try to force banks to smooth their demand for reserves, force them to come to me in a smoother way over the course of the period That, though, has the negative feedback consequence of making the funds rate very soft early in the period We just can't fight it They want the reserves when they want them and pushing too hard to counter that does not work So, in the current environment I have not found it a fruitful course to try to insist that they take reserves when I want to give them  With regard to the information available to the market, I think there may be some steps we could take I am somewhat uncomfortable with the continued use of the customer RP, which is a bit of an historical artifact It used to reflect the pass-through of the repo pool when the repo pool was only $2 or $3 billion or some similarly small amount Now the repo pool is $10 billion or more, and we really do not pass it through to the market in any sense The customer RP also was used by my predecessors as the non-signaling device, which likewise is no longer necessary, but it does have the tradition of having the amount to be done publicly attached to it One thought I have, which I intend to propose when I come back to you with an outline of the steps we have to go through to conduct our operations earlier in the day, would be to ask for your guidance on my desire to eliminate the use of the customer RP as we now employ it We would do only System Account RPs Currently when we do a customer RP, we announce that we might do, say, a total of up to $15 billion; however, if we tell the market that we are doing RPs for System Account we never announce how much we are doing  I think a big step in the right direction would be to limit our operations to System repos and when we finish our review of the propositions we have received in a given operation we could then announce to the market how much was done--whether it was $45 billion or whatever the amount Interestingly, that would not have helped us all that much yesterday when we had a very anomalous day There were more reserves than we thought, and we would have led the market astray in thinking there were fewer reserves So, that would not have helped A combination of things occurred yesterday One major bank making payments on corporate securities delayed the payments until very late in the day, so recipients of very routine dividends did not think they were coming Another bank experienced a shortage early in the day but ended the day with much more funds than they had  -3-    7/2-3/96  anticipated All of that money became available toward the end of the day, and the federal funds rate fell sharply late in the day So, our provision of a little more information yesterday might have misled the market But in general I think the practice would be useful and I intend to come back to the Committee--perhaps at the August or September meeting--with a little more detail on how we might provide more information to the public  Yes, I think it does, particularly in the foreign exchange market The early to mid-'90s was a period when these firms were building up capacity The great successes in income terms in '92, '93 and '94 for many dealing rooms led them to build up their capacity and their fixed costs just as you described, and I think they are all feeling some pain now and, perhaps regrettably, that is driving the expansion in their position-taking  The exchange rate movements follow changes in historical volatility but with a lag  I am sorry I can't calculate that off the top of my head  Well, let me try this on you I hope this is helpful I talked with one person at a firm in this market for whom I have a great deal of respect, and he referred to the current level of options as both too high and too low Implied volatility was too high because it was still considerably above the recent historical experience It was too low for his taste because he didn't think he was going to get compensated for the risks he would be taking at the current levels  Yes, we will go back and work on that  The back data were provided by a couple of investment banks We have been collecting more recent data routinely off the screens ourselves  They are the best data we have been able to get  I can't improve on that; I agree with Mike "
5781,1996-08-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to the two pages of color charts distributed this morning [Statement-- see Appendix]  We have not tried systematically to segregate those episodes We have observed the phenomenon that you referred to, and that is something we could try to do, although it is quite tricky I think the causation tends to run in both directions at times such as those you are referring to So I am not sure--  I do not want to be quoted as saying it is hopeless, [laughter] but it may be akin to looking for a needle in a haystack  It will be quite a challenge Let me think about that, and maybe Don Kohn and I can come up with ways to sort it out It really is tough to do much better than to talk to as many of the major market participants as one can and get a sense of what they were seeing major accounts doing Sometimes those accounts are liquidating bonds and moving out of the dollar at the same time, and sometimes they are not doing it coincidentally, but the effect may be the same if they are doing it over a period of time    8/20/96  I strongly share the impression that bond markets are traded more and more each year as we think foreign exchange markets are traded, that is, as a collection of currencies Traders are consistently thinking that if they move out of one currency or government bond maturity, they will move to some other currency or maturity automatically It is not automatic in the sense of being by rote because traders do make a conscious decision as to what to move into So, we think people are trading bond markets as if they were currencies but it is very hard to pin that down  Yes, we will  Let me try to answer that, and I invite Don to jump in after I have made the first stab Your three factors were sweep accounts, demand for currencies from overseas, and then just general demand for reserves  Right The nexus that we have been looking at is really the first and third together As sweep accounts continue to ""sweep"" the nation, the level of vault cash that is applied to bank reserves becomes much more important What we are observing here is a weekly, moving phenomenon, with Friday flows in and out for weekends, and we are experiencing some difficulty in tracking total required reserves as vault cash becomes a larger and larger, and in some cases a dominant, share of the reserves of major banks So, I would link your first and third points I do not know if we have any sense--I look to both Sandy Krieger and Don Kohn--that there are other sources of demand for reserves that are giving us a problem of interpretation We are certainly focusing on this one Don, maybe you want to comment  This week-to-week, day-to-day problem is clearly something we are spending a great deal of time focusing on I think this episode reflected a unique confluence of events; everything conspired against us at the same time But we are still focusing nonetheless on how to track the week-to-week changes "
5805,1996-09-24," [Statement--see Appendix]  To put the market's reaction in a nutshell, I think the market is focusing on the question of whether the politicians can pull a rabbit out of the hat Maybe they can Having a commission in Brussels bless the French budget is one aspect of how the politicians may be able to do that The markets are not going to underestimate the ability of the politicians Those who are positioning in the expectation that EMU will implode fear that the politicians may pull a rabbit out of a hat and when they see something like that happening, they back up and reassess the question of speculating against the EMU  In the short run, it may work that way The market practitioners are concerned that they could lose a lot of money if they underestimate the politics  Certainly we have We have not thought about reducing the D-mark position That is, I take my responsibilities in the investment of our foreign currency reserves to be independent of their level So, I am left with the task of taking a given quantity of deutsche marks and investing them There are other avenues and other conversations the Committee can have about the desirable level of our foreign currency reserves We have not looked at that Once I take as given roughly the level of foreign currency reserves that we  -40-    9/24/96  have now or that we have had on average for the last five years, there are only a few alternatives that have any practicality We already have about one-third of our reserves on the balance sheet of the Bank for International Settlements I see that as a rather high number, although we could go higher As a rule of thumb I was stopping at about one-third, but we could decide on a larger exposure to the BIS We could, as in fact most central banks do, go into the commercial deposit market--the Eurodeposit market In effect, the BIS is a veil for us They are in the Eurodeposit market; we are not We avoid, therefore, the rather time-consuming exercise of credit assessment It is my sense, but it is a very strong one, that we would find rather awkward the process of making differential credit assessments among banks and taking commercial bank or commercial credit risks in the securities market and making relative assessments about the extent to which we should be exposed to or invest in individual private institutions But that is really the only alternative that exists today  Now, we have just begun to invest some of our reserves in the deutsche mark repo market, and I think there is some room for growth for us in that market in terms of our overall balance sheet In my memo, you will see that I am worried about our promise to the Bundesbank that we would get off their balance sheet completely What I am proposing here will reduce our D-mark balances at the Bundesbank to about one-third of our total D-mark reserves Another third will be in the German government securities market either in the form of repos or direct investments, and about one-third will be in the BIS It is my hope that the German repo market will grow and that we will be able to push the envelope a little more there than we have But if we invest too much there, we will become a rather large piece of that market So, the alternatives that seem realistic are rather uninspiring because they would involve taking on additional credit risks and the credit assessment process We would face the prospect of pulling the plug on private entities if we became concerned about their creditworthiness  It does nothing unless the Board changes the accounting rules, and we start marking the securities to market We currently do not mark the securities value of the SOMA portfolio, the domestic portfolio, to market We have not marked to market the securities value of the short-term foreign currency bonds that we hold now There are some strong arguments in favor of marking them to market, but I am not persuaded by them Indeed, I would be a vehement opponent of marking the securities to market, either the foreign or the domestic securities, out of a rather strong fear that, as the Account Manager, I would end up chasing my own tail as the balance sheet went up and down and I moved things around to change the duration of the portfolio So, absent a change in the accounting rule, moving 15 percent of our deutsche mark holdings into a sub- portfolio of German government debt will have no appreciable impact on profits and losses The huge impact will continue to be the monthly revaluation of the foreign currency holdings to translate them into dollar values  -41-    9/24/96  I would like to comment on that After spending much of the last five years looking at the foibles of other central banks and their investment strategies and trying to make sure that we do not fall into some of those traps, I think there are two problems-- you point to one of them--that can arise in using any kind of benchmark, particularly a duration target One is the problem of too much discretion and the other is the problem of too little On the potential problem of too much discretion, as the memo and the investment principles in the quarterly report make clear, we do not trade on interest rate expectations We are going to design the benchmark and replicate it Period; full stop  The other problem is one of too little discretion Are we going to design a benchmark that leads us to do goofy things, to churn the portfolio in order to maintain a perfect target duration? In designing what we might want to do, I tried to address that problem by  -42-    9/24/96  setting the 10-month duration target that I am telling the Committee I would intend to implement while permitting actual investments to vary over a very wide seven-week window on either side of that Essentially, the portfolio can decay for an entire quarter without our having to do anything to address or move back toward a center point If exogenous shocks occur in the market, my inclination--and I hope the investment principles we will be revising will make that clear-- would be as apt to look at whether the benchmark itself, the 10-month target, should be revised as I would be to change our behavior Over the last decade the single largest move in a five-year interest rate in Germany was about 250 basis points The sub-portfolio that we have described in the memorandum has a 5-year duration target, so it is a rough proxy for that maturity A 250 basis point move would translate into a change of about 2 weeks, perhaps a little more or a little less, in the average duration of a sub-portfolio targeted at 5 years, and that would translate in turn into a change of just a few days in the overall structure that I am proposing The reason for having the wide latitude, if I may digress, between the 18-month ceiling I would like the Committee to set and the 10-month target is that there are a number of factors that could lead the duration of the portfolio to move away from my intention and that would be beyond my control as investment manager The Germans are notorious for not holding regularly scheduled auctions So, we are always subject to a big surprise, a big shock, as to when an auction takes place and its timing can move the duration quite a bit  The other reason is that I very much want to separate the question of intervention and its size from the question of how the portfolio is managed and what kind of limit the Committee places on the Manager If 50 percent of the portfolio were to be liquidated through intervention, there are different ways that could be done We might liquidate everything at the short end; we might liquidate across the spectrum That could swing the duration quite widely, and I would not want to have too short an overall limit placed on the portfolio that would in effect, because of intervention, lead to violations of the Authorization  I have begun to think about that It has been my assumption that we would leave our deutsche mark holdings unchanged as they are transfigured into euros And when that happens, we would then be a participant in the novel question of what the euro yield curve will be--whether, for example, German paper will determine long euro rates but French paper will determine the short rates There is enough noise in how that will work out that I cannot see very clearly in my crystal ball That is about as far as I have gotten  Yes  Our deutsche mark reserves will not disappear; they will be converted into euros The euro will be a major reserve currency of the world even if it is subject to a great deal of volatility It is my forecast that there will be some volatility, indeed quite a bit I would think, in the early years of the euro And I believe that it would be in the interest of the US monetary authorities to have some capacity to participate in reducing what I personally see as a rather significant risk of market disturbances I am not suggesting any particular intervention or any particular type of intervention, but unilateral disarmament ahead of the event is not something that I would be urging on the Committee But I want very much to separate these two questions, Governor Lindsey, if I can  The question of how these reserves are managed and invested and how we stand as the prudent manager of what essentially is a public asset is different from the question of the level In my six years of association with this question, whenever marginal improvements in the prudence with which we manage these reserves are brought to this table, the question of level is what comes back I do not think the question of level ought to dictate the manner of the investment We can have a debate about the level--  If we just take the norm of historic interventions, we would not have to go out to 18 months in order for me to have a 10-month maturity duration target But the day could come when the decision would be made to intervene using, say, half of our reserves, which would be three times the largest intervention amount used historically The Committee has procedures for approving the amounts of intervention I think this investment guidance I am seeking should be a separate issue and not become a constraint on future intervention A much shorter duration, whether it is 15 months or 14 months rather than 18 months, is not the be-all end-all But if you start squeezing and impose a shorter total duration and we were forced to intervene in very large amounts, I would run the risk of violating the authorized duration limit if I were to liquidate a great deal of our holdings at the short end Let me just repeat that I propose setting a 10-month target, and I will not change that target without coming back to the Committee and soliciting your views on a change So, the two things are separable in my mind  We have been spelling out some of the risks in the quarterly report that we have been sending you The immediate answer that I have to your question is what I referred to in the memo We did a simulation over an entire interest rate cycle and looked at what would happen if we were marking to market the entire portfolio, including deposits  There was no quarter in which a deutsche mark portfolio structured as proposed would have had a net loss; that is, the capital value loss would have been exceeded by the earnings  Yes, over the last 10-year interest rate cycle Moving 15 percent of our holdings as proposed implied a pickup over a normal investment cycle of about 20 or so basis points over the income produced by our current approach to investing Now, I do not have immediately in mind an answer to your question in the way you structured it  -45-    9/24/96  We tried to make clear several other points in the memo First, I do not urge the Committee to adopt the 18-month duration limit solely for its liquidity measurement purposes I think it is a replacement for the current 12-month maturity ceiling which was intended to limit both price risk and force a certain amount of liquidity into the portfolio It has had some perverse effects We are a major owner of very illiquid government bonds at the very short end of the German yield curve If I continue to try to get off the Bundesbank's balance sheet without some increase in our duration, I am going to be buying more and more illiquidity in these short-dated cats and dogs of the German yield curve, which is contrary to the objective of wanting to be liquid So, I will be buying less and less liquid paper It is less liquid than buying securities ""on the run"" out of recent auctions and permitting them to decay and having a sub- portfolio spread evenly all along the yield curve That is a bit of the background that I think changes the complexion of what you are pointing at  I am also doing this because I feel a necessity to get off the Bundesbank's balance sheet A decade ago we were entirely dependent on their balance sheet Between 1/4 and 1/2 of the reserves of the German banking system were owned by us through the Bundesbank's balance sheet We are down to a much smaller proportion in part because we have moved off the balance sheet and in part because the Berlin Wall came down and reserves expanded in the German banking system That was a major shift But I think we ought to recognize that the Bundesbank is in a very different position than we are Let me just turn it around A couple of months ago, when this Committee discussed the question of facilities for foreign central banks on our balance sheet, the Committee members expressed a great deal of reluctance, skepticism, and concern We are going to come back and try to address these issues in a modified proposal We currently maintain tens of billions of dollars of deutsche marks on the Bundesbank's balance sheet with zero liquidity cost We can liquidate these at zero notice and contract their balance sheet at our whim  -46-    9/24/96  Now, to put that in context, the need here is to get off their balance sheet We have been rather slow in doing so, and they have been rather good natured about the tardiness of our response to their request If I take that need as a given, I now have to look for a place to invest I think a reasonable first step in how I diversify off their balance sheet is to invest in ""on the run"" German government securities or purchase them at auction, and build up a small sub- portfolio So, it's a different mix of factors than I think we were--  They are similar  I'm sorry; I meant to answer your question there as well I do not mean to say that I will automatically liquidate only at the short end when there is a need to liquidate large amounts Indeed, many central banks--the European central banks--discovered during the period of market tensions in the early 1990s that it is very efficient to repo out long-dated securities for immediate liquidity That provides the luxury of selling those securities very slowly and gradually over time That may be another source of liquidity We will try to develop liquidation rules that may have an either/or flavor to them We may liquidate significantly at the short end or we may repo out the long end and rebalance the portfolio more gradually That is very much my intention because of the enhanced liquidity of holding the ""on-the-run"" German government securities So, your point is very well taken  It would be my hope and something of an expectation that in the event we move to euros, we will find a deeper short end And when it is all denominated in one currency, we may  -47-    9/24/96  find it much more comfortable to be invested in French government bills and to have a shorter duration to the portfolio  Yes, I think it is Let me make one comment because it might help other members to comment on it I wish I had made this point clear in my memo In addition to the two different kinds of neutrality you are pointing to, there are two very different kinds of sell-side neutrality One is a very short-run, sell-side neutrality that relates to the impact on the market today The other is a very long-term, sell-side neutrality that has to do with how the public portfolio is affected by the selling In some of the hypothetical cases that the Meulendyke memo points to, if we were to liquidate $50 to $100 billion and did it all through the short end, that would have a rather profound impact on the public portfolio and thus would not be sell-side neutral or market neutral in a long-run sense So, there is another balancing going on there I think much of the history of the portfolio has reflected a tension between these two different kinds of neutrality Obviously, there are market situations where we would not want to sell across the yield curve, but there might be some where we would Clearly, it is generally most convenient to liquidate principally through the short end But with that caveat, I agree entirely with your formulation of the problem  While Sandy Krieger thinks about how long the transition might take us, I would note that to move in that direction we probably would need to have the Treasury treat us explicitly as an ""add-on"" in the bill auctions They do not do that now because, as deficits have come down, they have been contracting their bill offers and we along with the foreign central banks have become a rather large share of the competitive auctions But I think that issue is solvable and that the Treasury would amenable, if that is what we want to do, to working with us on that Once we had their agreement that we would be an add-on--I am trying to think off the top of my head how quickly the portfolio behaves--I would guess that it might take five years to move our holdings of bills up in a smooth way from 50 percent to 60 percent of our portfolio  I do not have a sense of a definitive answer from the Treasury on that  I do not know of any constraint on that  That is a good question I am somewhat uncomfortable with our current securities lending program, to say the least The program itself goes back to the period before government securities were in book entry form It was designed to deal with the tardiness in the paper clearing process With the development of book entry, I believe that the Desk became eager to discontinue the program and was on the verge of doing so at the time of the Salomon Brothers episode But that just seemed to be the wrong time to make the change To put it bluntly, I am desperate to find an occasion to discontinue the securities lending program, and if I can find the right cover I will urge the Committee to discontinue it I do not think, however, that this issue raises itself to the issue of the overall structure of the portfolio  But perhaps on another occasion I may come back and talk to the Committee about some of those more mechanical issues  We might be able to I might add that even if our coupon portfolio went down to 20 percent or 30 percent or 40 percent of the total, we would still have plenty of securities to lend, given the kinds of limits that we impose But that would not be an obstacle to me, and I do not think it would be viewed as a serious matter in the market  Absolutely I am hearing some encouragement of the super preeminence of liquidity, which will be reflected in our effort  There is certainly a good deal of depth to the long end of the yield curve, but given the history and current structure of the Treasury securities market, there is no doubt in anyone's mind that the bill sector is much more liquid Now, I think that we have to stay in touch with a possible evolution at the Treasury on this Over a long period of time the relative liquidity of bills could change For example, in the German yield curve it is the short end that is illiquid and that I am trying to get out of  That is not an immutable fact, but it is a fact today and has been a fact for the last couple of decades  I would just note that we are also using the traders' definition of liquidity, which is the ability to execute transactions in volume without moving price Clearly, the long end is less liquid in that sense The further out the maturity curve we go and the more we are selling, the bigger the price effect we will have  I will take a stab at the next step Thank you "
5829,1996-11-13," Why me? [Laughter]  Thank you [Statement--see Appendix]  Yes, I think congratulations are due at the other end of the table, but since I get beat up occasionally down here, I will take what I can get!  The Committee would be giving me the authority to negotiate their renewal  To ratify our domestic operations "
5854,1996-12-17," [Statement--see Appendix]  Members of Ted's staff and my staff have been working on this, and I am afraid there is nothing that we can come forward with that is conclusive or very satisfactory Staff are arguing back and forth, and I do not think there is anything that we can put our fingers on that provides a systematic explanation The work is going along I think what is most on market participants' minds is the abrupt decline that the dollar suffered in July when our equity markets experienced a reversal The dollar-mark lost 3 pfennigs very rapidly and the dollar-yen also came under pressure I am very cognizant of the fact that markets are driven to a great extent by habit They look at the most recent episode to see what other things might happen and to give them a clue as to how they should behave In July, we had pressure in equity markets, and it translated immediately into a weakening dollar Many people were expecting that to happen again as they looked for pressures in our asset markets So, I am just reflecting on market participants' observations that that did not happen when they expected it to  Yes, that is right The lags are a bit long in that regard I would also note that in addition to the mechanism that you are referring to, there is another mechanism If risk appetites are large at the end of the cycle and these happen to be expressed in long dollar positions, people might collapse dollar positions in a period where risk aversion comes to the fore because of uncertainty    12/17/96  and might do so independently of whether they actually are liquidating dollar assets That is, there may not be a direct pass-through from the closing of a stock position to the sale of dollars There may also be some management of foreign exchange market exposures that simply implies just a reduction in risks and a reduction in positions  I have been exposed to them for a while!  Yes That is the historic practice we have continued Now, I may have gone too far in explaining this, but I think that in all likelihood customer operations may die on the vine I do not want to announce that we will never do another customer operation, but I am hard pressed to see circumstances when I would be tempted to do it  Yes, I think there are some pros and cons to announcing the quantity in advance The pro is that telling the market the amount of the contemplated operation is normally thought to be helpful The con is that we like to look at dealer appetites as one indicator of funding needs, so I am rather uncomfortable in situations where we announce we are doing a $1 billion customer operation and we get so many bids that we do $2 billion, which is rather typical I am not saying that the amount of the bids is always double, but that is rather common The amount of dealer bids for financing is actually a very helpful piece of information in assessing the amount of reserves we think we may need to inject As we have focused increasingly on day-to-day operations because of the much reduced operating balances and related uncertainty, the size of dealer bids has become a variable of growing importance I accept in principle that it would be better to announce the size of intended System operations, but that makes me somewhat uncomfortable because I like to see the dealers' appetite as an indicator that may lead me to shade the size of the operation one way or another In my view, announcing the size of the contemplated operation becomes problematic  As I explained in the memo  Well, it has been a while since the Desk had any kind of habit of going into the market multiple times a day--I guess twenty years or so I certainly have no hands-on experience with such multiple daily operations Among the things we would look for would be an unexpected shift in the Treasury balance that could be a big factor that we would become aware of later in the day The drain of reserves from a rise in the Treasury balance is information that is available to us, as would be an unexpected shift of funds and drain stemming from our customer operations These are the first order of flows about which we would become aware with some degree of certainty Another reserve factor about which we are certain relates to those occasions, which I am hoping avoid, where we do not get to add as much in reserves as we wanted to Then, it would be nice, if we did not shock the market in the process, to be able to come back and conduct further operations because we did not get enough bids the first time That is another sort of fact, certainly  The harder issues are those where the funds rate just stays firm and, in the current environment where we operate once a day, we are left to wonder in the early afternoon whether we made a mistake We talk to brokers and funding desks to find out where something is going wrong; sometimes we can determine the reason, such as funds getting trapped in a bank that is having wire transfer problems The bank may continue to have a wire transfer problem throughout the day, and adding a little reserves could be helpful in that situation I think that is the sort of issue that we have to look at Don Kohn and I have talked about this at some length over the last couple of years What we are really rather hopeful for, but is still even further off, is some way to be able to operate truly late in the day, that is, at 300 pm or 400 pm--which would require a change in Fedwire rules and perhaps the window--or even later at 600 pm We certainly would have more information then about a number of factors and would know whether there is a reserve miss or not and could try to respond to it  So, in terms of the new framework for conducting operations, I think multiple operations on one day would be used infrequently but would be available to us So, whether we operated at 930 am or at 1030 am, we would have the option of coming back at 1130 am if we became aware of something very tangible about the Treasury balance or other developments unexpectedly affecting    12/17/96  reserves But I am also trying to set the dealers up for the time some months or years hence where we might try to create a window for the Desk late in the day if the combination of low operating balances and volatility late in the day really becomes an issue We do not know that that will happen, but in case it does, I want to alert them to that possibility  I would like to echo that concern I agree with you and I would want the Committee to have that discussion I also am quite worried that if we jump too quickly into multiple daily operations, we will actually reduce the incentive for intermediation in the fed funds market Clearly, these incentives have been declining As reserve balances have come down and sweep accounts have taken hold, there has been less juice in the system for an individual bank desk or treasurer to intermediate in the market, so their incentives to do so have been coming down We have to be careful not to reduce those incentives further by our behavior That means intervening only when we think the market really is not working, when something looks as if it is broken  In terms of bids?  Well, in the last couple of weeks, as you will have observed, we have operated a number of times at 1030 am, in part responding to firm conditions in the funds market and the large need that I was worried that we might not have enough bids to cover I should have this statistic on the tip of my tongue, but I don't--I think we almost routinely saw something like a doubling in the amount of propositions from the dealers when we have operated at 1030 am    12/17/96  rather than at the normal time of 1130 am Now, whether that is a function of the surprise value of our being in the market and their knowing that we were looking to fill big needs, I could not sort out But, clearly, we have seen a substantial improvement in the amount of propositions by going in one hour earlier  I have thought quite a bit about the pros and cons of providing some sense of our reserve forecast Clearly in one sense, that would provide some modicum of certainty, but as soon as I have that thought I realize that it does not provide a modicum of certainty Our forecasts are really quite movable feasts, and I will start at the end of my own analysis of it One of the things that I have come to realize is that the forecasters who work for Don and me are actually most valuable in telling me what the probability distribution is of their forecast error That is, on which side do they think their errors are most likely to be? That actually is the most useful bit of information for me in the whole exercise That is because we can then think through which way we want to lean on the basis of our own utility function Now, that would be impossible to communicate to the market unless we sort of did it by shading the forecast  That leads me back to the start of my own analysis When I look at the whole issue of transparency, whether it is the Committee's transparency on policy or our transparency in operating in the market, I think those are two things about which we need to be clear In my case the objective is simple You have told me that the target rate is 525 percent It is in our operations where we have not been as transparent The process that drives our decision-making is a little fuzzier and a little harder to communicate, particularly while we are going through a shift in market behavior associated with low operating balances and a heightened degree of uncertainty If I had much greater confidence in the accuracy of our forecasts and in turn in the relevance of our two-week forecasts to the day-to-day volatility in the market than I have today, I would be leaning more on the side of reporting our forecasts But given where I am now in my own uncertainty about the relationship between our two-week forecasts and day-to-day demand for reserves, I really am quite squeamish about it So, I think there are definitely pluses and minuses, pros and cons, but it is--  Yes, they do, and I think that raises an interesting question They have a one-day maintenance period If the decline in reserves balances and operating balances in the System led us to conclude that a two-week maintenance period was becoming irrelevant--it does not look like that is going to happen but we are on that trend even though there is no certainty about it--then I think we would have to come back and think very hard about operating on a de facto one-day maintenance period basis We would have to decide how much money the banking system needs each day The Bank of England with its one-day maintenance period has 3 or 4 windows every day during which they may operate They announce what their forecast shortage will be for the day, decide whether to provide some money or not, and whether to enter the market immediately or later in the day With the one-day horizon, there is not much intermediation across time, which is something I think we would want to encourage our banks to do If we get to that point, we will have to rethink quite a number of things A one-day horizon gives rise to questions of what the target should be, the forecast itself, and whether, given the implications for incentives as President Melzer pointed out, we should be operating multiple times a day on an ongoing basis  Absolutely Don Kohn and I had the benefit of being on a conference call with all the discount officers from the Reserve Banks, and we gently urged them to encourage greater flexibility in thinking about the use of the discount window I think that group is very helpfully working on a number of issues, including the consistency of collateral management across different Districts and the implicit messages that are sent to banks about the use of the discount window Quite frankly, one of the issues that we have now-- and I don't have a sense of which Districts are relevant--relates to the fact that, as discount officers have noted, major banks in some Districts just never want to come to the discount window Now, that translates very rapidly back to us at the Desk with regard to developments in the fed funds market That is because certain regional banks are not going to the discount window but they are coming into the funds market when they have a miss or an unexpected heightened demand for funds late in the day That is one source of pressure in the funds market So, I agree completely with the desirability of discussing the role of the discount window    12/17/96  We have not had more trouble At some point, I would like to bring an analysis forward to the Committee; it is not finished yet We have begun using internally a standard deviation of the prior day's effective federal funds rate in volume-weighted terms We have the raw data that are used to calculate the effective rate, and we currently look each day at a standard deviation of that There has been considerable volatility this year, concentrated roughly speaking in the middle half of the year as I recall But it does not appear to be anywhere near the kind of volatility that we experienced in 1991 Interestingly, even though it has been high for the year as a whole, there are some months this year in which it has been lower than in some months in 1994 or 1995 So, we are nowhere near a crisis in our ability to manage the fed funds rate, but volatility has been moving up Some of the fed funds watchers have printed charts that show volatility, but they only cover the last two years From a longer perspective, the volatility this year is still well below that experienced in both 1991 and the early 1980s One would expect that for the early 1980s, of course, and it is more relevant to look at the broad sweep So, we are observing developments, and I would like to bring that analysis forward to the Committee at some point The people who work for me wonder whether we shouldn't publish the daily standard deviation along with the effective rate That is an issue we will be thinking about, and we will bring it back to the Committee  Right That applies to the rates at which funds have traded without taking volume into account For example, it does not tell us how much trading there was at the higher rates during the day  I think the shift in expected interest rates that occurred in the first week of December can hardly be attributed to the presence or absence of the Federal Reserve in the coupon market Trading volume in that market is $70 to $100 billion a day, and whether or not we bought $4 billion would hardly seem to matter It is true that many people talked about the absence of a coupon pass, but how that could have affected the March futures contracts has challenged me a little It is awkward--I will be blunt about this-- that the last remaining business for the Fed watchers is predicting when we will do coupon passes That is what the franchise has been reduced to since we adopted the current practice of announcing policy changes So, that is about the last thing that the people who write the weekly reports and screens have to offer to their subscribers To leave that thought with you, we have a certain feedback problem  Some analysts who write these screens got it right There was one who was absolutely on the money when he explained that the Desk probably was concerned about having to drain reserves in January That is exactly what I told you, and I could have read his analysis here instead of my own "
5879,1997-02-04," Thank you The next topic on your agenda is the review of the  Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations I do not have any changes to request at  this time, but I did want to use this occasion to bring you up to date on three issues  The first is a preview of coming attractions Following the Committee's discussion in  September of the maturity structure of the SOMA portfolio, we have continued to work both on  trying to articulate a set of principles that could guide the management of the SOMA portfolio  and to develop some concrete alternative portfolio structures that illustrate different mechanisms    2/4-5/97  for implementing what we have taken to be your consensus objective So, we continue to work  on that, and at some point in the future we will be bringing that back to the Committee  The second topic is an elaboration that I would like to make on an answer that I made  last September in response to a question from President Melzer He asked me how different  portfolio structures might affect the securities lending program that we are authorized to  implement to assist the dealers In September, I expressed some discomfort with the current  program I would like to explain that a little and explain other work we are doing at the Desk  The current securities lending program was devised in the 1960s as a response to the back office  crisis It was premised, and continues to be premised, on the assumption that we lend securities,  but not to a dealer who is ""short"" securities The idea was that we were providing securities to  facilitate the paper clearing process, and in the event that a dealer was going to have a fail, we  would be providing the securities and thereby averting that fail Well, we have had a book entry  environment for some time now, and it has never been entirely clear to me how our lending  program really fits in a book entry environment where a dealer often will not know if he is short,  in the sense of a cash position to settle, until after the wire is closed In that case, it is too late for  us to lend him a security I have some sense, perhaps more than a sense, that when dealers do  call and ask us to lend them securities, some seem to have forgotten the requirement that they  should not borrow to cover a short position They know they have to affirm that they are not  short the issue in question, but I have some reason to doubt the veracity of statements, based on  my consultations with senior management at dealer firms  I think we ought to have a securities lending program of some kind, and I think the  Treasury depends on it to a certain extent as a backstop to provide some elasticity in the supply  of securities in the government securities market However, we do not want to be the first-stop    2/4-5/97  shopping source for securities lending because that would mean that we would destroy the whole  securities-lending industry, given the size of the SOMA portfolio We are in the process of a  review We are trying to start from first principles but on the assumption that we will have a  program I believe an appropriate program would be consistent with the Treasury's wishes, with  our joint concerns for the efficient functioning of the government securities market, and with our  market surveillance responsibilities We are trying to be creative and open in our thinking I am  mentioning this to you now because I would like to invite suggestions from the dealers I am  going to ask them what they think Some of them have raised the subject with me I want to  open it up a bit and let all the dealers know that we are rethinking the securities lending program  and that we would be open to their ideas about how we could structure it given our objectives I  wanted you to hear about that from me before you heard about it from them I will come back to  you and let you know once we have a concrete plan That is the second topic  The third is to bring you up to date on our discussions with other central banks about  liquidity assistance, something we have talked about here from time to time As the Committee  knows, we have put aside for the time being any work on a program that would involve the Desk  in doing reverse RPs for the SOMA account with foreign central banks that are in need of  temporary liquidity As the Committee and the Board know, we received an inquiry from  about our willingness to act as agent, not for the SOMA account,  for a multilateral repo facility It relates to a rather complex policy of cooperation among  The matter is not moving forward with great speed, but we have  responded We are posturing ourselves in a helpful but not pushy way and are leaving our  positive reaction on the table    2/4-5/97  We are now considering the idea of the Desk acting as agent with the Street for  individual central banks, much as we did earlier in this decade for authorities That is,  had a portfolio of government securities at the New York Bank and the Desk repoed  them out to the Street, providing with liquidity We conducted those transactions as  agent for an undisclosed principal We are considering a similar function as the pass-through  agent particularly for the authority and the I  suspect that the also may be interested in that approach  Those are the three works in progress, if you will, on which I wanted to update the  Committee  Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]  I remain an optimist that it is not the level but the rate of change that is  important I am sure there is some single-digit number that would have a material effect on our  behavior--whether it is as low as 1 or 0, I am not sure But as long as we have a gradual move  from the current level down toward 10, as we have had in the last couple of years, I am not sure    2/4-5/97  there is any magic point in that range at which our operations will be impaired My hypothesis  that that is the case is progressively being confirmed  I don't have any concrete sense there would be anything different in  what we would do every day Maybe we would have to intervene a little more than we do  currently A development that could become problematic, I am hypothesizing, would occur if a  critical mass of the major banks in the country were all to become unbound That is, they would  meet their required needs with just vault cash If every one of these banks were over the other  side, we might have a very interesting federal funds market But I remain an optimist in  believing that some banks are still going to be operating in the funds market, even if it is the  smaller banks, and that their behavior, if all this continues to happen gradually, would adjust to  the new conditions and clearing would take place All of us around the table know that we do  not need required reserves to conduct our business We can run the banking system on a bigger  deficit or just up to zero or we can be filling in with temporary operations The tools are very  flexible  I agree with Don I generally think of the cause-effect as running the  other way We had the change in behavior in daylight overdrafts when our policy changes were  implemented five or six years ago, and we are now seeing the pass-through "
5903,1997-03-25," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix] "
5925,1997-05-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to a package of six  colored charts with a peach FOMC Class II cover [Statement--see Appendix]  Yes, it is extraordinary I'm sorry that I don't know precisely how  it compares with large movements in the past, but I think the shift over this period of several  days now exceeds the dollar/yen move during February 1994 after the Clinton/Hosokawa  disagreement on trade I can't recall any larger move over the last 5 years  No  That goes one step further than I would be comfortable with Let  me try to explain what I only hinted at in my statement, namely, the impact on the dollar of    5/20/97  intervention by the Bank of Thailand and other Asian central banks- I will try to be pithy  about this I think the simplest example is to take the Hong Kong dollar but only as a  hypothetical case; that currency did not come under much pressure in this period As you  know, Hong Kong runs a peg to the US dollar If $20 billion, for example, moves from  Hong Kong to Japan and the peg is maintained, the one thing that we know will happen is  that the dollar will go down against the yen Now, if we extrapolate that to Thailand just for  purposes of an example, that country runs a peg against a currency index in which the dollar  has a roughly 80 percent weight When the Thai authorities defend their currency, funds  flow out of Thailand to repay leveraged financing in Tokyo Thailand defends the baht by  selling dollars either spot or forward, and the net effect shows up in dollar/yen movements to  the extent that the Thai authorities are successful in maintaining their peg to their index,  which they have so far So, I think the dollar/yen was affected to a significant extent by  some of the intervention in defense of Asian currencies and other currencies in this period It  was not a direct effect  Yes, the dollar's weakness occurred on the days when the Bank of  Thailand initially intervened in size, May 6 and 7, but not so much in the days that followed  May 6 and 7 were days when the Bank of Thailand's defense of its currency was building  up, although there were indications that they had been defending their currency for a while    5/20/97  on a modest scale It was at the start of that week of May 5 to 9 that Thailand announced  some disappointing forecasts for its budget and economic growth for the coming year  Pressures began to build on their currency, and the exchange market activities were thought  to be related to that  No, no  Yes, precisely  That we all need to go back to the drawing board on forecasting  taxes, and I will not pretend to be the expert on that subject I think our projection problems  were universal--New York, the Board, and the Treasury None of us had it right Mike Prell  may be able to offer more insights into this than I Such a study clearly will require a major  effort We had some rather big surprises last year, and to be candid we thought we had  learned from them So, that is a major area for study  No, we do not There is a rather disappointing inability to take the  Treasury tax information and quickly derive statistics that we would find useful  The other part of your question, Governor Rivlin--or the other part  of my answer--is that I was very pleased that our announcing the quantity of RPs helped the  market get a quicker handle on how far off we all were on our forecasts, and that I think was  a help We did operate twice in one day on two occasions That was not to fine-tune the  rates but because of the paucity of propositions we had from the dealers and how far off we  were going to be unless we tried to add some reserves by going back into the market I think  the dealer community responded rather well to that in terms of not thinking we were flying  off the handle The added flexibility to the Desk was helpful I think the tools worked fairly  well The first time we had a big miss in propositions, it did occur to me that it might be nice  to be able to do foreign exchange swaps to inject reserves when there was a paucity of  collateral I don't think it was really necessary, but that thought at least crossed my mind  Anecdotally, we at the Desk have heard the same stories I have  not been able to see that in any data anyone has shown me, but there are some lags in this  process  There will be some data on that I have heard it said by a number  of people whose views on the markets I respect that they think the very sharp movement in  the dollar/yen means that US Treasuries are now at attractive levels for Japanese investors  to purchase on the principle that they have taken losses and it is done I think that the net  impact of these movements has been to produce a fairly good two-way market Clearly,  there was some aggressive verbal intervention, both public and private, on the part of the  Ministry of Finance I think that is regrettable, given the nature of the volatility it has  engendered  I just mean that this is only an initial round of market expectations  that the Bank of Japan may start tightening sometime later this year Differentials remain  rather wide against yen fixed-income assets I do not mean to draw a perfect analogy from  this, but in 1994 the Committee started raising rates in February and we all remember the    5/20/97  Orange County bloodbath in December That was a full thirteen months after long bond  yields started to back up in October and November of 1993 There are different  mark-to-market conventions in Japan Some institutions do not have to; they can just hold  their fixed-income assets at historic cost Others have to mark to market We have a more  mark-to-market financial system than the Japanese That does not mean the losses in Japan  are not buried there somewhere They are, but they do not come to the fore as quickly  Foreigners who borrow at low interest rates in Japan are subject to a mark-to-market  discipline "
5946,1997-07-01," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]  I would be happy to refer to Don and his staff on that  I would underscore that the paper, particularly the decision tree that  shows the different options, is not intended to be technical or to bury this issue in the details  Don and I were trying to lay this out so you would see all the steps we think need to be gone  through before you reach any of what we deem to be the important policy choices at the bottom    7/1-2/97  of the decision tree, as it were, and perhaps along the way I hope no one looks at this paper as  taking any of these issues and burying them Rather, we are trying to let you see, with as much  advance notice as we can give, the full scope of the possible changes that might be envisaged as  a potential answer to the low operating balances problem "
5972,1997-08-19," Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to the several pages of colored charts distributed this morning 1  In reviewing recent market developments, I will try to describe what I see as the causes of the recent, abrupt repricing and volatility of equity, bond, and currency values  1 Copies of the charts used by Mr Fisher are appended to this transcript (Appendix 1)    8/19/97  First, since your last meeting, there have been noteworthy shifts in the interest rate outlook for the United States, Germany, and Japan While each of these movements may appear small, in perspective and in conjunction they can be understood as causing a significant increase in risk to which market participants responded  Second, to my way of thinking, it is not helpful to view the dollar's movement--or exchange rate movements generally--as ""causing"" the sell- off in bond and equity markets The dollar's recent movements appear to reflect the same reassessment of the outlook that has affected other markets  Third, I think the recent volatility in markets can, in part, be attributed to the difficulty all market participants are having in coming to grips with the extraordinary performance of the US economy In this sense, the recent volatility reflects the contest between ""old"" and ""new"" paradigms  Looking at the first page of charts, which depicts forward rate agreements and Euro-deposit rates from August 1996 for the dollar, the mark, and the yen, you can see the backing up of the 9-by-12 dollar FRA-- indicating three-month deposit rates, nine months forward--which occurred following the August 1st release of the nonfarm payroll data and the NAPM survey In the blue lines, you can see the consistent rise in German forward rates from mid-July At the bottom, you can see the recent, continued decline in Japanese forward rates  The rally in US interest rate markets, which started in the spring, continued in the last two weeks of July That rally was propelled by the combination of reduced expectations for any near-term Committee action following the Chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony and expectations for reduced Treasury issuance as a consequence of the improved fiscal outlook  The August 1st release of the nonfarm payroll and NAPM reports caused a modest increase in expectations for a tightening by the Committee before year-end, with the December Fed funds futures backing up by 14 basis points in six days As you can see in the FRA chart, late last week the backup in interest rates reversed at the time of the rapid decline in equity markets But through last Wednesday's close, the 9-by-12 backed up by 32 basis points in the nine trading days from July 3 1st   Looking back across the past year, this move is comparable to the increases in the 9-by-12 that occurred in December and February In December, beginning a few days before the Chairman's speech at the American Enterprise Institute, the 9-by-12 backed up by 30 basis points in thirteen trading days; in response to the Chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins    8/19/97  testimony in February, the 9-by-12 backed up by 28 basis points in just six trading days  Trend reversals such as these, reflecting only a modest increase in the probability of a tightening of monetary policy, also tend to cause market participants to reassess the likely consequences of still seemingly remote events Most market participants still think that an increase in rates by the Committee is not likely to occur at this meeting or the next But given the lofty levels to which bond and equity markets had traded, even a small increase in the likelihood of an event which could have such extreme, negative consequences for asset values causes traders to reduce their exposures  To put the same thought differently for those still working in the ""old paradigm,"" uncertainty premia were squeezed awfully tight by the end of July, when the two-year Treasury yield traded within 25 basis points of the Fed funds target rate; some backup in interest rates and a collateral selloff in equities were accidents waiting to happen In conjunction with the reversal of the US rate outlook, after the mark began to weaken sharply in mid-July market participants also have had to respond to the escalating rhetoric from Bundesbank officials threatening an increase in rates  On July 24 th, the Bundesbank Council met and announced that their repo operations would continue at the fixed rate of 3 percent but only for the first two weeks of their four-week holiday until the next Council meeting This suggested that the Bundesbank Directorium would have the opportunity to change the repo rate by either moving to a variable rate tender or raising the fixed rate last week However, they announced one more operation at the fixed 3 percent rate last week, and this morning they announced one more operation at 3 percent  From the Bundesbank's perspective, this saber rattling has had two beneficial effects It has created a much greater sense of two-way risk in the Deutsche mark and itself in the pre-monetary union environment  Now, the Bundesbank faces something of a dilemma--or a couple of dilemmas First, the German economy is providing mixed signals some measures of activity are picking up and, as a consequence of the decline in the mark this year, officials expect import price inflation to begin to show up in the data On the other hand, high unemployment continues; ongoing problems in implementing tax reform suggest that consumption demand will remain weak, and M3 growth continues to slow Thus, on strictly domestic grounds, a decision to increase rates would be finely balanced    8/19/97  Second, it is not clear how markets would respond to a rate increase in the context of European monetary union To the extent that an increase in rates by the Bundesbank were to be perceived as hostile to the EMU process, causing delay or postponement or a narrowing of the field of likely member countries, it might then be expected to cause the mark to strengthen  However, much of the Bundesbank's rhetoric of the last few weeks has been in service to the idea that an increase in rates would be consistent with and supportive of EMU, suggesting that European monetary policy should not be frozen in place until the ECB is created and that the convergence process could be completed by German rates rising to meet Italian rates To the extent that market participants believe this, in the event that the Bundesbank were to raise rates, it is not clear that German long-term rates would move very much, or that the mark would appreciate much more than it did last week  Japanese forward rates reflect the continued unwinding of expectations for any near-term firming by the Bank of Japan, particularly following the July 24 th release of the Bank of Japan's Quarterly Report and the July 30th  release of weaker-than-expected June industrial production data As you can see at the bottom of the page, the rise in rates that occurred in May--in response to official pronouncements that things were not as bad as they seemed--has now been completely reversed as market participants have come to see the Japanese economy to be as weak as they originally feared  The 9-by-12 forward rate is now returning to the levels where it was trading in March, at the end of the last Japanese fiscal year when gloom was widespread On August 15th and again today, the yield on the benchmark No 182 Japanese government bond hit a new, historic low of 2065 percent  Turning to the next page, a further jolt to the global outlook has come in the rush of currency devaluations in Southeast Asia Over the course of the spring and summer, media attention has shifted back and forth between describing these events as ""speculative attacks"" on the one hand and ""competitive devaluations"" on the other Increasingly, emphasis is now placed on the latter While much of the focus has been on the devaluation of these currencies against the dollar, shown in the top panel, their declines against the yen since May 1st have been even more impressive, which is not likely to do much to improve the outlook for the Japanese export sector  Turning to the third page of charts--    8/19/97  All right As I mentioned at the outset, [laughter] a 9-by-12 is the  3-month rate traded 9 months forward So, 9 plus 3 is 12--  I think the new technology is spreading it out all the way to New Jersey  and Westchester! The 3-by-6 is the 3-month rate as it trades 3 months forward  Where were we? [Laughter] As I mentioned at the outset, I do not think it is helpful to see exchange rate movements generally, or the dollar's movements in particular, as an exogenous ""cause"" of bond and equity market volatility Rather, I think that exchange markets have been responding to the same shift in outlook that has influenced other markets  In the first panel you can see the dollar's movements against the mark, in blue, and against the yen, in red, since May 1st In July, the dollar rallied sharply against the mark as the idea of a broad and timely EMU process became generally accepted The dollar came off against the mark in early August when the Bundesbank worked hard to suggest the risk of upward movement in German rates; as these risks declined, the dollar has jumped back up a bit against the mark in the last few days The dollar appreciated modestly against the yen in July as the Japanese outlook deteriorated and recently has been more stable against the yen than against the mark Looking at the movements in bond and equity markets, depicted in the second and third panels, I see a case of correlation in their responses to common impulses, not causation  Finally, just as members of the Committee have been surprised by the performance of the United States economy in sustaining low inflation and    8/19/97  relatively strong activity, so too have market participants Surprises--even pleasant ones, like the combination of last Wednesday's PPI and retail sales releases--tend to create uncertainty, and uncertainty needs to be priced into markets  Another way to view this, depicted on the fourth page, is as a contest between the old and new paradigms and, specifically, among the diverse views now being expressed in market behavior ""Old paradigm pessimists"" think that inflation is about to break out; it has just been hiding in the lags They think the Fed is ""behind the curve,"" providing too much liquidity In response to last Wednesday's data, old paradigm pessimists would be inclined to sell stocks and bonds short  ""Old paradigm optimists"" think inflation is probably coming soon, but it's hard to tell They think the Fed is doing a good job and that maybe this benign inflation behavior can be kept going for a few more quarters Many old paradigm optimists are reformed old paradigm pessimists, whose pessimism became too expensive a few thousand Dow points ago Thus, they remain cautious buying stocks and bonds on dips and selling them on rallies  ""New paradigm optimists""--who have done rather well over the past year or so--think that we have entered a new era in which productivity growth, hidden in the macro data, is taming inflation They think the Fed is doing a great job and are great admirers of the Chairman In response to low inflation and strong activity, they do what they always do buy loads of stocks and some bonds whenever they can  ""New paradigm pessimists"" are only recently getting the attention they think they deserve The lack of corporate pricing power, the industrialization of China, the chronic weakness of Japan and Europe, the competitive devaluations of the United Kingdom and Italy a few years ago and, now, of all of Southeast Asia, are signs of the coming global capacity glut They think the Fed is much too tight They look at the PPI and retail sales data and see deflation staring them in the face and the last gasp of the US consumer before the deflationary reality sinks in; they, therefore, sell stocks and buy Treasuries--not corporate bonds, just Treasuries  While some of the recent volatility can perhaps be attributed to thin, August markets, as I see it the volatility is also a consequence of the interaction of these four archetypes' diverse responses to the same data and of the movement of market participants among these four types Much of the rally of this year can be thought of as having been propelled by the migration of old paradigm pessimists to old paradigm optimists and of old paradigm optimists to new paradigm optimists Much of the recent    8/19/97  retrenchment can be thought of as old paradigm optimists hedging against the risks of either old paradigm pessimism or new paradigm pessimism  Turning to domestic operations, reserve needs were somewhat more moderate than in preceding intermeeting periods and we tended to use shorter-term operations to meet those needs The next page of charts contrasts the volatility of Fed funds trading and operating balances in comparable periods from last summer and this summer The daily range of Fed funds trading is shown in blue; the one-standard deviation of funds trading around the daily effective rate and the effective rate are depicted in red; below each is a bar chart showing daily operating balances At discernibly lower levels of operating balances this year as compared to last, we have actually had modestly less volatility in the funds rate, as measured both by the range and by the standard deviation  Mr Chairman, we had no foreign exchange intervention operations during the period Committee members have received materials describing how we intend to manage the diversification of a small portion of the System's Deutsche mark holdings into a sub-portfolio of longer-dated German government securities, which the Committee approved in principle last September  I would be happy to answer any questions about this material, or about any aspect of my report this morning I will need the Committee's ratification of the Desk's domestic operations during the period  It is certainly worthy of note I do not have an exact read this morning,  but the forward exchange rates have backed up quite a bit in the last 10 days I am told anecdotally  that the pressure is from prudent asset managers who are hedging risks, not speculators poised for  an attack I don't know how much value I can place on that information  That's a very good thought Let me make a few observations for the  benefit of the whole Committee First, we are treated as an ""add-on"" in the Treasury's issuance at  the long end, so our purchases do not reduce what the Treasury issues to the public Whether to  buy such obligations at all was a bit of a dilemma for us If the Treasury launches a new program  and we do not buy any of the securities, there is a risk of a negative inference for the new  instrument that the Treasury is marketing There is also a risk that if the new type of security  becomes a major vehicle for Treasury funding and we have not bought any such securities, we will  need to buy them in order to keep the SOMA portfolio invested in the deepest area of the  Treasury's issuance On the other side of the dilemma, obviously, the notion of central bank  purchases of inflation-indexed securities has a certain odd ring to it  But as I noted, we are not a net subtractor of market supply because the  Treasury treats us as an ""add-on"" An additional reason for holding some of these securities was to  have them available for our securities lending program You inspired me to comment on that  program at an earlier meeting, and I have told the Committee that we are trying to come up with a  new program I hope to come back to the Committee during the fall with some new ideas for that  It might well help the inflation-indexed market if we were in an improved position to lend  securities to that market    8/19/97  Not that I'm aware of  Yes, the Board of Trade is considering those, but when you said  ""forward"" I thought about the over-the-counter forward market  The futures market is what the Board of Trade is working on "
5995,1997-09-30," Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to the four pages of colored charts in front of you under the Class II cover 1 On the first page are current 3-month deposit rates and 3-, 6-, and 9-month forward, 3-month deposit rates that for the United States are shown in red, for Germany in blue, and for Japan in green Looking at the US forward rates, you can see that there has been relatively little net change since the Committee's last meeting Indeed, after rising during August, the forward rates are now back to around their levels at the time of the August meeting and almost back to the recent lows they reached at the very end of July The single biggest decline in US forward rate expectations came on the release of the August CPI on September 16 That followed a smaller decline the prior day after the retail sales and the PPI data for August were announced Looking at these rates going back to late March and given their recent declines, I see relatively little, if any, pricing in of expected further action by the Committee in the months ahead  Looking down to the German forward rates shown in blue, you can see that the rise in German rate expectations that began earlier in the summer has continued While both German and some other European data have been somewhat firmer, I believe the bigger impact on German rate expectations has come from the rather loud whisper campaign that the Bundesbank has directed at financial markets The message in effect is that in order for the European monetary union to work, German and Italian short-end rates will have to meet somewhere in between their current levels With the German short-end rates now around 3 percent and Italian short- end rates around 6 to 6-1/2 percent, this implies a 150 basis point rise for Germany and a 150 basis point decline for Italy The rather public whisper campaign has been driving German rate expectations up, and you can observe on the right side of the chart the rather pronounced upward shift following the ECOFIN meeting the weekend of September 13 and 14  Looking at the Japanese forward rates in the bottom panel, you can see that the various forward rate maturities have continued to collapse on top of  1 Copies of the charts used by Mr Fisher are appended to this document (Appendix 1)    9/30/97 2  the current rate The release of the 112 percent (annual rate) decline in second-quarter GDP added to the gloom in Tokyo Rather than try to parse out the green muddle of rates at the bottom of the chart, let me observe that the 9-month forward, 3-month yen deposit rate now trades at 3 basis points over the overnight Libor rate The JGB benchmark yield has traded down to 186 percent in the last couple of days These relative shifts in interest rate expectations have had a fairly predictable impact on exchange markets, with the yen depreciating about 2-1/2 percent and the mark appreciating about 5-1/2 percent against the dollar since August 1 I think this impact on the dollar-mark exchange rate is precisely what the Bundesbank had in mind when it engineered its whisper campaign  Turning to the second page, you can see that recent developments had a somewhat more complex impact on bond markets The four panels on this page depict the basis-point changes since July 1 in 9-month forward 3-month deposit rates implied by the FRAs and in 10-year government bond yields In the upper left panel, you can see the story of US interest rate markets as the red lines move across the chart We had the rally in July followed by the upward spike in early August There was little net change subsequently until the more recent rally associated with the release of the August price data during September In the top panel for Japan on the right, the persistent decline in Japanese rates, both for 10-year bonds and forward interest rate expectations, is evident In the bottom left chart for Germany, we see a different pattern of interest rate movements throughout the period The 9-month forward 3-month deposit rate has risen by 72 basis points since July 1, while the 10-year bond has traded more or less sideways; it rallied a little in September, declining 18 basis points in yield  The truly dramatic impact of the Bundesbank's whisper campaign was felt in Italian interest rate markets where participants heard the Bundesbank to be saying three things First, the Bundesbank would be raising rates Secondly, the Bundesbank was so convinced that Italy would be in EMU that they were prepared to act on that basis And third, the Bundesbank thought it would be an EMU-friendly act for the Bank of Italy to lower rates 150 basis points As shown in the panel at the bottom right, the 9-month forward 3-month lira deposit rate declined by 125 basis points from the beginning of August through last Friday and there was a similar decline in the 10-year bond yield One of the questions that have come out of this experience is how to explain the stability in long-term German interest rates From Frankfurt, the markets have heard that when central banks with real credibility threaten to raise rates, the long end of their yield curve    9/30/97  remains stable or rallies And much to my surprise, a great number of market participants have adopted this view as their own There is an alternative view to which I am somewhat partial It begins by noting that over the last several years the Bundesbank has been of the view that the long end of their yield curve has followed the lead of the US and the global bond markets, and it has not really followed expected changes in short-term German interest rates The pattern of the solid blue line for Germany does have some echo of the solid red line for the United States One could also note that relative to US and Japanese 10-year rates, German rates have backed up by 25 basis points since the beginning of the summer So, I think there is some excitement yet to play through in European bond markets as we move forward toward EMU  The third page of charts shows percent changes in equity indices for the second and third quarters of 1997 I have included that chart to make two obvious points First, equity markets were somewhat more volatile in the third quarter than in the second Also, there was a much greater diversity of outcomes in the third quarter That is true globally and also if we look at some of the internal comparisons For example, the NASDAQ performance was quite different from that of the Dow The Milan MlBtel, the German Dax, and the French CAC all had quite different outcomes and, of course, the Tokyo Topix and its construction sector, reflecting the Japanese domestic economy, also turned in rather different performances than other equity indices  Turning to domestic open market operations, the daily effective federal funds rate averaged about 555 percent over the intermeeting period, a little higher than the intended rate This outcome reflected principally a few days of elevated funds rates I'm not going to take you through all the detail on these charts, but I did want to make a point The vertical blue lines in the top panel show the daily range of federal funds trading; the horizontal red lines are the daily effective rate; the vertical red lines represent one standard deviation in the volume of federal funds trading each day and give a sense of the concentration or dispersion of funds trading The middle panel shows our misses, that is, the actual level of free reserves less the intended level; the yellow bars indicate negative misses and the blue bars show positive misses In the bottom panel, you see operating balances as they occurred each day  My reason for showing this chart is to focus on three days in September on the right hand side of the page--the 15th, 16th, and 17th--and to point out that neither changes in operating balances alone nor even our misses of some size really tell us everything we might want know about what drives volatility in the federal funds market The 15th, 16th, and 17th were corporate tax payment dates On the 15th, you can see that we had an elevated effective rate on the day but a very narrow effective range, as    9/30/97  market participants priced up for the pressures they anticipated and traded funds in a very narrow range However, looking at the middle panel for the 15th, we had a rather sizable miss of $2 billion on that day Even so, we had a relatively contained federal funds rate On the 16th, the effective rate was right on the target at 5-1/2 percent The one standard deviation trading range was somewhat wider on that day, but we again had a miss and, if you look at the bottom of the page, a very low operating balance In fact, we almost hit the historic low operating balance, but we did not have a terribly volatile day or upward pressure in the funds market The next day, the 17th, funds traded over a quite wide range at rates up to 15 percent and the one standard deviation volume of trading was much wider We had a very large miss and again a low operating balance  The difference between the 16th and the 17th was in the distribution of reserves, with the need falling on the large regional banks whose behavior pattern tends to be to bid up the funds rate So in this case, the behavior of those banks determined the volatility of the funds rate a great deal more than the level of operating balance or even the size of our miss I do not want to overstate that, but I think it is a significant point to emphasize The level of the operating balance is not the only factor  Since your last meeting, we have conducted two legs of outright purchase operations, both in the coupon sector The bill market remains quite tight, and I have been reluctant to enter that market So, I expect to continue to operate in the coupon market There is some possibility that with the new fiscal year the Treasury will be issuing a larger amount of bills and we will be able to return to bill purchases  Mr Chairman, there were no foreign exchange operations for the System account during the period since the August meeting I will need the Committee's ratification of our domestic open market operations I would be happy to answer any questions  No, I do not I think the market understands as well as any of us the  implications of low operating balances and how they may foster market volatility on some days    9/30/97  So, no, I don't think such volatility has had any effect on policy expectations Don and I have  worried that it might at some point I don't want to make too much of this, but we are making an  effort to refine our ability to measure volatility so that we can provide the Committee with a better  basis for judging and deciding whether this is something it should care about  I have spoken with people at the Bank of Italy, the Bank of France, and  some other European central banks For the Italians, there is a hierarchy of objectives Getting into  EMU is the first, the second, and the third objective! So, I think they are prepared to pay some  price for EMU membership If they cannot get their rates all the way down to match German rates,  they are prepared to go half-way Now, most people in the market anticipate another interest rate  reduction from the Bank of Italy once the Italian budget passes I believe that may occur in coming  weeks, and there may be one or even two Bank of Italy actions before year-end in light of the  Bundesbank's implicit announcement that short rates ought to converge somewhere in the middle    9/30/97  The Bundesbank's comments fell on very fertile ground in the markets They seemed to be waiting  to see when something might happen, and they got a pre-blessing out of Frankfurt It seems clear  that people in Europe wanted to see rates converge on the low German rates and felt a certain  reluctance to suggest that the convergence be somewhere in the middle of current rate levels On  the plus side, one reason the German action can be seen as positive is that it is creating a greater  flexibility for the new ECB when it comes in People previously had been assuming that the ECB  would simply pick up whatever repo rate was set by the Bundesbank and that would be that This  has introduced an element of uncertainty  On the other hand, I think the French are the ones who will really feel they have been  misled They went through the pain of getting their rates all the way down and having them  converge on the low German rates Now they hear that they will have to suffer the pain of going  half-way up to meet Italian rate levels, and they do not think that was the understanding That is  painful for them There are two ways to think about this ""meet-in-the-middle"" story One is in  terms of mood music it sets a positive tone and gets the process going But if it is taken literally, I  think it can be quite toxic You can fix exchange rates and let interest rates float or you can fix  interest rates at the short end and let exchange rates float Trying to fix both in advance of the  EMU event is a high-wire act "
6017,1997-11-12," Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to the package of charts that should be in front of you' It has a Class I cover and begins with a color chart showing 3-month deposit rates Today I will be going over four distinct subjects To give you a roadmap First, I will discuss market developments in general, focusing particularly on some of the causes of events in Hong Kong Second, I will discuss recent open market operations Third, I would like to take a few minutes to bring the Committee up-to-date on the performance of primary dealers I think it is important for me to give you a sense of what I have been doing with the dealer community After that, I will be seeking two votes One is the normal vote to ratify the open market operations since the September meeting I also will be asking for an increase in the intermeeting leeway After that, I will come back and comment on the swap line renewals, which are a separate agenda item I will seek a vote to renew the swap agreements for another year  Focusing on market developments, the first page of charts shows 3-month deposit rates, including the current rate, 3-month forward, 6-month forward, and 9-month forward for the United States, Germany, and Japan In the first panel, you can see that interest rate expectations began to back up here in the United States following the Chairman's testimony before the Budget Committee on October 8 The next day, the Bundesbank hiked their repo rate by 30 basis points, as you can see in the middle panel To many people in financial markets around the world, this indicated, perhaps inaccurately, a concerted effort by the industrial nations to raise interest rates globally Many  1 Copies of the charts used by Mr Fisher are appended to this transcript    11/12/97  people talked very seriously about how the tide had turned and interest rates could be expected to go higher in the industrial world Both in Germany and the United States, rates continued to back up for several days until the events beginning on October 23, a date I will come back to in a minute That was the day when financial pressures first emerged most acutely in Hong Kong You can see that interest rate expectations in both the United States and Germany came off rather sharply beginning that Thursday, October 23, and bottomed out on the day of the sharpest US equity market decline the following Monday, October 27 Forward rate markets were already stabilizing to some extent, at least here, by the time of the Chairman's testimony before the Joint Economic Committee on October 29  I would like to note that US interest rate expectations, as measured by the forward rate agreements, did not subsequently back up They stabilized more or less at levels slightly above the lows reached before the Chairman's October 8 testimony, whereas German interest rate expectations, reflecting a rise that occurred in market rates, are still quite a bit higher I think this goes a long way toward explaining the relative movements in the dollar and the mark One does not need to look anywhere else even though many financial market analysts are looking under every rock and in every nook and cranny You can see in the bottom panel that Japanese interest rates, as measured by forward rate agreements, are still quite flat I will come back in a moment to some events leading up to this morning's developments in Tokyo  Turning to the charts on page 2, I will focus on the causation of the events in Hong Kong, or as the Chairman sometimes puts it, a discussion of who sneezed last This discussion is not necessarily to point a finger at anyone but to delineate the series of events that led up to the financial pressures The first panel shows the percent changes in the foreign exchange value of the Taiwan dollar, the South Korean won, and the Hong Kong dollar since September 30 The middle panel shows 1-month interbank rates for Taiwan, South Korea, and Hong Kong, and the bottom panel shows percent changes in key equity indices for those countries and for the United States, Japan, and Brazil  Working across the top panel--the Hong Kong government announced in early October that they would hold another land auction This is a more or less routine event for them, but the announcement did indicate they were coming back to the market and would be putting some pressure on land prices They held the auction several days later, on October 15, and found a bogus bid for one of the largest parcels of land that were up for sale The bid was made by a woman in the name of a major firm and she certainly did not have the billions of dollars necessary to purchase the real estate The    11/12/97  Hong Kong authorities are reviewing their practices for accepting bids, but it was rather shocking to think that an auction for this kind of real estate could involve someone who was a mental patient, quite literally  Several days later, Taiwan ceased intervening in the exchange market and allowed its currency to depreciate significantly This posed a question in the minds of many foreign exchange market participants the world over--a profound question If a country with such a high level of foreign exchange reserves was not prepared to defend its currency, who would? The Taiwan government certainly had the capacity to defend their exchange rate, but it turned out they did not have the will The question in everyone's mind after Taiwan's decision was whether the People's Republic of China, and not so much Hong Kong, would need to devalue For many people the answer to that question appeared to come when, on October 23 or late in the evening of October 22, the People's Bank of China announced a reduction in interest rates They reduced their lending rate by 150 basis points and their savings rate by a little more than 100 basis points This appeared to answer the question for many people by showing that China was worried about their competitiveness The markets very quickly tried to price that in, but they could not price it into the yuan The only place it can be priced is in a proxy for the yuan, the Hong Kong dollar So, the pressures began to build and you can see in the middle column that the Hong Kong monetary authorities squeezed their money market rather tightly I don't think they expected overnight interest rates to go to 300 percent They expected the rise to be considerably less than that, but there were a number of players who held onto long positions hoping to make money in subsequent days In the bottom panel, you can see them play through to the equity markets, with whose performance you are familiar  Turning to the third page of charts, I want to draw your attention to the impact of these developments in credit markets While equity markets had some sharp losses, the real fear and adjustment that took place in financial markets seemed to be, as I heard it, in the credit markets In the first panel, you can see that absolute spreads of Asian Yankee and stripped Brady Bonds over US Treasuries backed up rather considerably These are measured in hundreds of basis points The backup was more or less triggered by the pressures on October 23 and thereafter, obviously with many contributing events In the middle panel, in order to get the scaling right, I simply have the basis point changes in two Merrill Lynch corporate bond indices, one for high yield and one for investment grade, over Treasuries since September 30 Clearly, there has been some widening of spreads over Treasuries What is worth noting is that the corporate yields have not moved at all; it is the Treasuries that have moved As shown in the bottom panel, 10- and 30-year    11/12/97  rates were down 20 basis points over this period, and that was the full extent of the backup, the widening of the spread if you will, both to junk and investment grade paper It was very hard to chart in the bottom panel how odd the bond market has felt over the last few days because there has been a tortuous back and forth between those who want to trade on fundamentals and the flight to quality that seems to be taking place I cannot show you last Friday's developments in a chart because the adjustments happened so quickly Following the release of the employment data last Friday, bond market and fed funds futures backed up and then, after about 90 seconds, came right back down as the market returned to its flight-to-credit posture  The fourth page displays three charts to make a very simple point Each panel shows the percent changes in one of the G3 currencies against the other two G3 currencies In the first panel, you can see that the mark has appreciated against both the dollar and the yen since September 1 In the middle panel, you can see that the yen has depreciated against both the dollar and the mark And in the bottom panel, you can see that the dollar is being pulled somewhat in two directions That is, it is considerably weaker against the mark but a little stronger against the yen, the dollar having been stable for most of this period  I want to go back to what I referred to earlier, namely, that I think interest rate differentials between the United States and Germany explain most of the movement between the dollar and the mark, although market participants do look eagerly at the question of whether there is a flight out of dollars into marks and whether the mark is something of a safe haven I think it is reasonable to pause and note that in terms of financial flows, there probably was some movement out of dollars, given how many of the assets that have been under pressure are dollar-denominated So, when portfolio managers sustained losses on Bradys and Asian Yankees and equities that are more or less dollar-linked, there was going to be some marginal movement out of the dollar That is a very different question from one about the macroeconomic consequences; this is a financial flows issue I think Ted Truman will be coming back to the broader macroeconomic question  Let me pause here to discuss some of the events of the last few days in Tokyo The yen has weakened overnight; it was below 126 this morning The Japanese government bond yield is up to 170 percent after backing up 10 basis points in just a few days A week ago, with the announced bankruptcy of Sanyo, a very profound event happened in Japanese financial history The authorities let a major firm go bankrupt It is something our colleagues at the Bank of Japan have been working on earnestly for 10 years and are very proud of Obviously, the timing was another matter It took the    11/12/97  markets a few days to begin to price it in But the number of financial market participants around the world who have been trading with Japanese counterparties on the assumption that the government stood behind them is very large By Friday of last week, some Japanese names, the weaker ones, were finding it hard to get quoted in the forward interest rate market in New York Today, people are talking about Japanese institutions needing to liquidate government bonds The Nikkei was off 434 points earlier and is now down again We see a grinding out of some of the worst fears one might have about the Japanese financial sector That is beginning to show up in forward rate markets For example, in the Euro deposit market as of the end of October, there was no credit premium in the 3-month rate for Japanese institutions This morning, it is already 250 basis points as compared to zero at the end of October  Excuse me I should have said 25 basis points I am very sorry I'm  trying to catch up with everything that happened overnight  On that note, let me turn to domestic open market operations and try to get my numbers right On the fifth page, there are two panels illustrating developments in the federal funds market The top panel shows the behavior of the federal funds rate The blue lines indicate the daily range of actual trading, the red vertical lines depict one standard deviation of funds rate trading on either side of the effective rate, the horizontal red line is the daily effective rate, and the green dotted line is the Committee's target In the upper right of the sub panels for each of the three full maintenance periods, you can see the period average effective rate In the lower panel of the chart, the blue bars show the daily level of free reserves, and the numbers on top of each of the bars indicate our daily projection misses There is one exception related to a labeling problem that I will come back to in a moment  The intermeeting interval unfolded more or less as we had expected In the first biweekly period, September 30, the last day of the quarter, was a difficult day in the market The market priced up for that statement date, initially producing a high rate, and we came in a little later in the day and added quite a few reserves That resulted in a very wide standard deviation in the federal funds rate on September 30 On the last day of the middle period, the settlement day, the very tall blue bar, is labeled 99; that number does not indicate the size of our miss; it refers to the level of the bar, which was cut off at the top of the chart Our miss that day was only 03 This was a day when we supplied quite a few reserves to the market, but given the    11/12/97  skewing up in the rate, we underestimated a bit the demand for excess during this period Actually, the point I want to make, which we describe in our written report, is that the demand for excess reserves has been growing We target demand for excess reserves of $1 billion in each reserve maintenance period on a period average basis, but actual demand has been creeping up on us Independent of the turmoil of the last few weeks, the rising demand for excess reserves is in all likelihood a function of declining operating balances Bankers appear to be looking for a little more excess reserves, but this is something that we are still looking into  In the final period, you can see that we did have to deal a little with the effects of the large volume of trading in equities The largest volume day was on October 28, and with a 3-day settlement, the settlement of that trading fell on October 31 That was a month-end, already a slightly complicated day for us We more or less had a day that looked like a maintenance period settlement day where we had to add a sizable amount of reserves and the funds market had a quite wide standard deviation  Stepping back, I would like to ask the Committee for an increase in intermeeting leeway to purchase securities on an outright basis during the intermeeting period between now and the December meeting The temporary increase would be from $8 billion to $12 billion We began another sequence of outright coupon purchases last week We have a significant amount to execute going forward We estimate that our holdings will need to grow about $15 billion by the maintenance period ending around the time of the Committee's next meeting and that the cumulative need will increase to up to $20 billion in the period immediately following the December meeting I would like to complete the portion we are planning to do on an outright basis in the market before we get that late in the year So, by the time of the December meeting, I expect to want to add around $10 or $11 billion through outright operations, principally in coupon securities However, given that the Treasury issuance of bills seems to be increasing somewhat, I also hope to buy some bills a little later this month or early in December  Before turning to your questions and your vote, I would like to talk to you for a few minutes about the performance of the primary dealers, as shown on your next page I will try to go through some of the background on our primary dealer relations  Criteria for primary dealers were revised in February 1992, as most members of the Committee will recall At that time, we identified some drawbacks in the existing system We described as one drawback the public impression that because the Federal Reserve Bank sets standards for selecting    11/12/97  and maintaining these relationships, the Fed was in effect the regulator of the primary dealer firms Another drawback was that the primary dealer designation was viewed as conferring a special status on these firms in that it carried with it elements of franchise value As a consequence, we dropped the requirement in 1992 that dealers maintain a 1 percent share of total customer activity We also discontinued our dealer surveillance activities, which had led to the impression that we were supervising the dealers In 1992, we also reiterated our standards for maintaining dealer status All primary dealers were told that as in the past they were expected to (1) make reasonably good markets in their trading relationships with the Fed's Trading Desk, (2) participate meaningfully in Treasury auctions, and (3) provide the Trading Desk with market analysis that could be useful to the Federal Reserve in the formulation of monetary policy Primary dealers that failed to meet these standards in a meaningful way over time would have their designation as primary dealers discontinued by the FRBNY I think that spells out, as I have been describing to the dealers, essentially six criteria that we look at in judging our trading relations with the dealers As listed at the bottom of page 6, these include their performance relating to our RP operations, our outright operations, the Treasury's bill and coupon auctions, the Desk's trades on behalf of foreign central banks, and the provision of information to the Desk  Bluntly put, we have not succeeded in removing the ""Good Housekeeping"" seal of approval There are many customers in the market who insist that they will only deal with primary dealers There are municipalities and other public bodies in this country that have such a requirement in their enabling legislation, and many other customers follow that practice informally So, we have not been successful there At the same time, it has been hard to motivate dealers to perform I frankly face something of a moral hazard because there is no longer a volume requirement Previously, that was an easy thing for the dealers to measure They knew that if they maintained their volume, they would be kept on our dealer list and that kept their minds focused  What I had hoped to do is provide the dealers with report cards that they could take home and share with their management and really understand how we saw them I then decided that I did not want to read about those in the Wall Street Journal So, we came up with a formula for sharing their relative performance with them, at least on the first four criteria, without giving them something they could take home The following four charts give you some sense of the performance of the individual dealer firms, though they will not enable you to master the details    11/12/97  The first panel shows primary dealer performance in financing Desk transactions The horizontal axis shows the percent of our volume in repo operations that any one dealer actually does with us, that is, it measures the propositions we accept The vertical axis measures pricing competitiveness in which zero represents the stop-out rate on our operations, that is, the lowest rate at which we operate Plus basis points indicate better yields we earn and minus basis points measure poorer yields The vertical axis reflects all propositions, not just the ones we take On average, we do not take most propositions For example, we may accept only $2 billion when we get $10 billion of propositions So, on average most prices will fall below the stop-out As a first approximation, poor performance is reflected in the lower left corner; strong performance appears in the upper right corner However, there is another twist If a dealer firm is too much of an outlier and too eager to price through the stop-out rate, that may say something about its ability to finance elsewhere and whether there may be something of a credit risk associated with its name In some sense, if a firm is in the very lowest quadrant, it is hard to know whether it has no business at all to be financed or whether it simply has numerous internal sources of funding that are cheaper than what we provide them So, that is another element of interpretation on this chart  The next chart illustrates primary dealer performance in Desk outright transactions The horizontal axis again shows the percent of volume they actually do with us The vertical axis is in effect a pricing competitiveness index in which zero in this case is a snapshot of the yield curve before we operate The prices we then see may give us more yield than the yield curve or they may give us less yield Again, the lower left in this chart indicates poor performance, and obviously something more toward the upper right indicates a stronger performance from our point of view  The third and fourth charts show the dealer performance in Treasury auctions for bill and coupon issues respectively The horizontal axis measures awards in their name as a percent of total tenders accepted by the Treasury, and the vertical axis is a measure of their capital that both we and the SEC use We call it ""liquid capital;"" the SEC calls it ""tentative net capital"" This chart again shows, more or less, that the lower left reflects a weaker performance and the upper right a stronger performance I chose to show the information to the dealers in this form because it indicates that there is not a very strong positive correlation on capital That is, some dealers that have relatively low capital can compete rather effectively in underwriting the Treasury's debt Their ability to do so is not just a matter of capital    11/12/97  We have shown these charts to dealers in the last few weeks, but with only their own name indicated and 38 black dots depicting the other dealers The charts provide a rather powerful indication of the absolute and the relative performances of the individual dealers from where we sit I tried to calibrate my message to the dealers When I showed them this information, I was able to point to both 12-month data, which are depicted on these charts, and four-quarter data, quarter by quarter, because trends were quite important for some dealers I told the dealers that my goal was to improve median performance I wanted better performance on their part I was rather blunt with eleven dealers in saying that they were not doing much to meet our current business needs Of that eleven, I told four flat out that they were not meeting our business needs currently However, I proposed that we work together over the coming six months to enable them to describe to me their intended business strategy for meeting my business needs and to make an effort to do so I will meet with them again two quarters from now to review fourth-quarter and first-quarter data I warned them that if they took no initiative to describe to me how they intended to meet my business needs and could show no performance over this period, we would discuss at our next meeting in the spring whether they wished to announce the termination of their dealer relationship with us or whether they wanted me to announce it As I noted, four of the dealers heard that message Another seven heard a message that they were near that category I think they all understood it, and they all thought the process was reasonable Again, the pictures on these charts are rather stark, and the dealers did not have much to argue about in that sense  I wanted the Committee to be aware of this process that I am going through I think it is reasonable but, obviously, I am sharing it with you to solicit your views if you have any I want to emphasize the sensitivity of these data I have assured the dealers that I was not going to share it publicly, and I informed them that I did not want them to share it publicly I did not let them take copies with them, but I did let them take notes I did not want to read about it in the Wall Street Journal, and I am sure many of them did not want to either  Mr Chairman, we have no foreign exchange operations to report for this period I need the Committee's ratification of our domestic open market transactions Separately, I would like to seek a vote to increase our intermeeting leeway from $8 billion to $12 billion I would be happy to answer any questions on my report as well as on my memo about our desire to publish the standard deviation of the federal funds rate for each trading day    11/12/97  I completely agree with you It is a dilemma, and I think we are stuck  with that dilemma I personally would rather take a hard look with the Treasury on whether the  primary dealer system makes sense in terms of underwriting Treasury debt issuance The  Treasury still feels strongly, as it has for many years, that the existing system is important So,  they wish to retain it We are going to conduct our operations with someone, and until we can  get to the point where we do not publish a list of the firms we deal with, which is what I would  be happiest with, I think we are in a dilemma It is very expensive for us to maintain relations  with 38 institutions, some of whom are deadbeats from our perspective We could create a  two-tier system I would be happy to talk to the Committee about that It would involve our  ignoring a lot of firms that provide no value to us but that might continue to sit on our list  Unfortunately, that does not foster very good performance from anybody That is the nature of  the dilemma We get poor performance from everybody or a franchise value, which sets up the  dilemma  My colleagues and I have thought about that, and we have not come up  with a way that might be done directly I think there are assets that could be sold--  We would get better prices We would earn more for the US  taxpayer We would have more flexibility in our operations the more propositions we received  I very much hope to avoid the situation that we had in April when we had the large miss in  forecasting Treasury tax flows and an insufficient volume of propositions forced us to go back  into the market to purchase more securities I want to see a healthier volume of propositions so  we can have much more flexibility That is very important to me Frankly, we can operate more  efficiently overall if we get better information from the dealers and they execute our trades more  expeditiously Our costs should in some sense be covered by the value we produce as a trading  operation  No In this case, what I would like to see is movement of the median  volume line to the right and a cluster of dealer performance around the intersection of the two  medians Where the auction falls vis-a-vis the stop-out rate is really a matter of how much we  are doing because we want more propositions than we can use Forgive me for my analogy, but I  would like to see what Pete Rozelle always said he wanted for the NFL, that on any given  Sunday, any football team could beat any other football team I would like this money market  operation to be very competitive We should have every dealer bidding at a reasonable price,  and that would give us the greatest flexibility So, if we succeeded, we might move the median  volume line to between 2 and 3 percent or maybe all the way to 4 percent, with every one of 30  or 40 dealers getting a roughly equal share of volume Maybe it would be a 2-1/2 or 3 percent    11/12/97 13  share, and the pricing could be in a tighter cluster on that chart That is what I would be looking  for, and that is what I told the dealers  Out more than up is what I would expect  I referred earlier to the paper that we put out in February 1992 to  establish the current ground rules That paper indicated that the arrangements between us and  the dealers were business relationships and that we could terminate an individual arrangement if  no business relationship existed There are a lot of lawyers in the country, and anyone who can  find a lawyer can sue But I think that the dealers are on notice I don't want to say that any of  the dealers were happy with the message I was giving them, but as businessmen they understood  it because I was able to document it in black and white That is what I have been trying to do I  felt there was no way I could come down hard on them unless I could show them something  concrete As businessmen, I think they understood that I have been taking this degree of care to  minimize the risk you are referring to  I have been working very hard for a couple of years in every meeting I  have had with the primary dealers to remind them that ours is a business relationship and that we  want them to treat us as a valued customer I gave a speech about this business relationship to    11/12/97 14  the Bond Market Association in Phoenix in which I emphasized that they should treat us as a  valued customer, not as a mere regulator  A little, but it is a language they understand  Yes, I think that is right I do not want to put too fine a point on it, but  I think most people in the market understand that I don't think people have been making too  much of the shift in that spread I agree with you  I share your view about that We have developed this measurement for  slightly different purposes I find it very useful in talking to you about our operations, and I  think it may help you to judge what we are doing That's how I think of the standard deviation  As is illustrated in some of those charts, there will be days when the standard deviation is going  to be wide, and we can do nothing about it It is on days when perhaps we could and should do    11/12/97 16  something about it that I want to focus my attention The standard deviation does not tell me  anything automatically  For a long time, people in the market have asked us to publish the underlying data that  we get on trades in the federal funds market They want us to give them the actual data on how  many trades are done at each rate level I am very uncomfortable with that, and I think other  people in the market also would be uncomfortable if we started doing that The reason is that the  data might help market observers figure out who needed to do what volume They could then  determine at what rates the trades were done even if the names of market participants were not  attached to what we published I think the standard deviation data give the market a very good  sense of the volume done at various rates, and that matters to them in their effort to understand  trading activity So, the information on the standard deviation is intended to give the market  something that is helpful to them in return for the statistical information that they provide to us  I share your view on market volatility  I will respond to the second question first The Desk collected  profitability data from the dealers for a long time When I became Manager, I looked at that and  discontinued it What we were getting was apples and oranges and kumquats We had no  ability to insure that we were getting apples compared to apples from the dealers The dealers  were very unhappy with that decision, but I felt that we should not be putting our name behind  something where they had not done the work to develop standard accounting conventions I  viewed that as a very risky and potentially embarrassing situation for us  Yes, and I want to distinguish two sorts of information that we get  from the dealers From our conversations with the dealers, it is clear that there is some disparity  among the firms There are some firms that are doing rather well and others that are not What  also comes out in our conversations is that the nature of the underwriting process is changing  Many of the dealers understand this With the Treasury's use of Dutch auctions, they already  have been disintermediated in certain sectors and they feel it I think this is a profound issue that  the Treasury has to grapple with, and Don and I have been urging them to grapple with it  We have looked at individual firms, and we can see dramatic trends The  quarter-to-quarter data are very helpful for that There are some firms with very fine names  globally but whose performance as dealers has deteriorated markedly over the last 12 months  because of business decisions they have made These firms are profitable as global entities As I  have explained to all the dealers, we ask them to compete in the thinnest margined, most  competitive sector of global fixed-income markets It is a tough market, but that is the business I  am in I cannot change that    11/12/97  There are numerous efforts Bill McDonough might be able to say  more about his contacts in New York with the Securities Industry Association The Federal  Reserve has been talking about those issues in many ways with the securities industry generally  I have not singled out the dealer community because there are so many initiatives going on in  securities markets  Yes  On that issue, we are trying to work with the Securities Industry  Association and the Bond Market Association Again, we do not want to become their regulator  as primary dealers As securities firms, we are trying to make sure we are talking to them, but it  is a little awkward, qua primary dealer, to discuss the century date change issue with them  On the last page of my package, there is a list of our existing swap lines, a note on the Treasury's two swap lines, and the new maturity date if we go ahead with the normal renewal process This is the time of year I ask you for authority to begin that process, which involves a lot of exchanges of telexes and telephone calls over the next month I am asking for your approval to renew our existing swap lines, and I would note that that includes both the swap lines listed here and the North American Framework Agreement, which covers the use of our swap lines with Mexico and Canada in certain circumstances The two swap lines of those countries can be used separately It is a stand-alone framework in the event of trilateral drawings  Last year, we had a rather lengthy discussion of our swap line agreements We discussed the possibility that some of these swap lines might fade into the sunset once European Monetary Union proceeds apace At that time last year, the members of this Committee agreed that we would begin discussions with our colleagues at the other central banks in the spring of 1998, and we intend to do so I think that will be an uphill struggle given the relative priority that the ECB and the NCBs will place on this issue vis-a-vis other issues But your humble servants will begin that effort in the spring before we are back here again a year from now with this issue  Yes, humble! "
6042,1997-12-16," Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to the package of colored charts, which you should find in front of you  On the first page are charts covering the same information we have shown in the past, but we have changed the source of the data for the current 3-month deposit rates Traders have persuaded me that the LIBOR fixing provides a better comparison than the Eurodollar series we have been using, so that is a slight change  Focusing first on US forward rates, there are two points to which I would draw your attention One is that there has been relatively little net change in these rates since the November meeting, as shown by the red lines, but clearly some compression has occurred as the money market yield curve has become increasingly flatter in the period since October I think  1 Copies of the charts used by Mr Fisher are appended to this transcript    12/16/97  the updrift in the solid line, the current dollar LIBOR, reflects a fairly typical year-end phenomenon I would not attach any significance to that  Looking at the German forward rates, Mr Tietmeyer said rather publicly on November 14 what other Bundesbank officials have been saying for some time, namely, that the market should not expect German rates to go up by 120 basis points between now and next May to meet Italian rates halfway, as the market had come to believe was going to happen In effect, Tietmeyer was saying that the German economy is stronger but not really all that strong You can see the gentle drift downward in German forward rates If you look at the solid blue line, the current mark LIBOR, it is quite interesting that the spike in early December parallels the spike in the yen LIBOR, shown in the chart below, at the time of heightened concerns about the Japanese premium Now, this is interesting for those of us in the money market business, as it were, because the calculations really are quite different In the British Bankers Association panel for the yen LIBOR fixing, there are eight Japanese banks, whereas in the panels for the dollar and the mark, there are only three and the calculation is done by throwing out the highs and the lows So, I think the spike in the German money market rates reflects the demand for funds from the Japanese banks It is not a reflection of the credit premium, as it were, from the demand side but a pushing through of the demand coming from the Japanese banks  Turning to the Japanese market, we need a little magnification of the bottom panel to see what is going on in Japan So, if you turn to the second page, I will work through some of the events in the Japanese markets Three rates are traced in the top panel the current yen LIBOR 3-month deposit fixing in dark purple, the 9-month forward 3-month yen deposit rate in orange-yellow, and the Japanese overnight call rate in green In the middle panel, we have plotted the excess reserves in the Japanese banking system I talked to Bank of Japan officials at some length about their calculation of this measure It is not quite how we would calculate it, but it is the way they do it The chart illustrates the heightened generosity that the Bank of Japan was practicing by leaving their market in considerable surplus following the closure of Yamaichi and subsequently in the last few days The bottom panel has two measures of the Japanese premium in dollar interest rates the solid line is the difference between the 1-month LIBOR rates at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and at Chase, and the dotted line is the Fuji rate minus the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi rate There was some modest differentiation among Japanese names at the height of the crisis, but clearly the dominant difference may be seen in the comparison between the best Japanese name and Chase as shown in this example    12/16/97  Going back to the top panel, I would like to draw out two points One is that in the last few days the Bank of Japan has pushed the overnight call rate down into the 20 basis point range A Bank of Japan official has told me that ""you may call this a temporary easing"" I took that to mean that the emphasis was on ""you"" because they were not going to call it that out loud quite yet But clearly, they have pushed the overnight call rate down The gap between the purple line showing the current LIBOR and the orange line does tend to indicate that the current premium is expected to wash out on the other side of the fiscal year That is, the high premium, high demand for funds coming out of the Japanese banks is thought by the market to be something that will wash out 9-months forward when we get happily to the other side of the Japanese fiscal year-end in March  Turning to the third page, I thought I would give a little background on events in East Asia I know Ted Truman will be speaking more about that The main purpose of these panels is to remind us that this is not just a bad thunderstorm but something more like the 100-year flood The top panel shows the exchange rate movements since July 1; the middle panel has percent changes in equity indices; and the bottom panel depicts 1-month interest rates Focusing on the currency panel, I think it's easy to say that the currencies have overshot their fundamental values But I think it's important to recognize that there is still a very large position overhang weighing on these exchange markets In effect, a leveraged convergence trade as we would have called it in Europe a few years ago, short dollar or yen external currencies and long internal currencies, was embedded on the balance sheets of businesses throughout the region, and they have not yet completed hedging those exposures In these thin markets, both bankers and traders have a very hard time thinking of these currencies as having overshot because they are aware of how much more there is yet to hedge that is weighing on the exchange rate  A second inference I would draw from this page is to note that the downward slope of the foreign exchange and equity values is somewhat steeper than the upward slope in the 1-month interest rates at the bottom Another point I would note is that so far Taiwan, the red line, has managed to distinguish itself In the top panel you can see that its currency has declined against the dollar only slightly more than the yen; and in the middle panel, you can see that their equity market has really broken out of the pack While looking at this chart overall, I think it is possible that we will look  back and see that the end-of-year effect for some of these currencies and values provided something of a nadir for them, given the risk aversion that is generally typical at this time of year But I think it would be risky to count on a bounceback after the New Year for all of them    12/16/97  Turning to the fourth page, I have depicted in the top panel both the March Eurodollar contract and the March fed funds futures contract as they have traded throughout the fall There is relatively little net change in both those series from just prior to the November meeting to today The middle panel shows the US Treasury constant maturity yields for 30, 10 and 2 years You can see that we have had a continued decline in bond yields in the 30- and 10-year areas, while the yield on the 2-year note has been more or less flat over that time horizon Clearly, this is something that is quite difficult to interpret I think that with the worsening of the Asian crisis, market participants have inferred that there will be no action at this meeting, and more of them have come to adopt the deflationist outlook or at least are taking it more seriously than they did some time ago While point estimates for inflation have moved down a bit, I think the better explanation is that market participants have shaved off the upside risk in the inflation probability distribution, that is, the risk that inflation will rise over the next six months That is what is tending to bring down the yield curve in combination with the flight-to-quality, end-of-year effect, making market participants more comfortable about moving their duration out the yield curve in this end-of-year environment  The last page of charts relates to our open market operations in this period The top panel covers daily fed funds trading the blue lines show the daily ranges, the vertical red lines show the standard deviations, and the horizontal red lines indicate the effective rates The panel at the bottom has the level of free reserves and indicates our daily misses from the projections I should point out that at the start of the middle period, which included Thanksgiving, we raised the allowance for excess reserves from $1 billion to $14 billion The demand for excess reserves clearly has been inching up I do not want to suggest that this is a precise science, but we are trying to get a handle on how much it has drifted up I think it will be some while before we are confident that we know where it has settled We had some volatility around the Thanksgiving holiday and the start of December As you can see, excess reserves averaged around $2 billion in that period, and we still had a slightly firm funds rate We may have slightly overcompensated at the beginning of the current maintenance period, but the market was quite tight Yesterday was a corporate tax payment date, and we tried to prepare the market for that  We purchased a total of $156 billion on an outright basis since the last FOMC meeting and a total of $172 billion since early November The total included a small amount of bills, $15 billion, and those purchases seemed to go quite well I was trying to leave something of a marker with the market and the Treasury--a notice that we were not forgetting about the bill sector, that we plan to come back to it In making these permanent    12/16/97  reserve injections, we did change our pattern of operations from last year A year ago, we left a larger need in the market, but we reverted to our traditional pattern this year by adding a large amount of permanent reserves That may put us in a position of having to drain reserves to a modest extent toward the end of January when the Christmas demand comes out of the market At that point, we also will be reaching rather low levels of operating balances, but I think we are ready to handle the effects of being on the drain side at what are likely to be new lows in operating balances  We had no foreign operations in this period Mr Chairman, I will need the Committee's ratification of our domestic operations, and I would be happy to answer any questions  They exist They are quite thinly traded, and I'm not sure how much  confidence people put in them, but they are there They are not the kind of market instruments  that one can click on a Reuters page and see  I think the problem is that we do not have a time horizon where one  ought to find fundamental value There is not enough confidence in markets that one would  want to have a contract with a maturity of that length That is a long duration exposure to take  on a currency that is declining so rapidly now  I don't know I have not heard that story  I think what we are seeing is the implosion of the intermediation  process in these exchange markets The exchange markets for the won and the baht have  disappeared There are not a lot of people who are excited about participating in those markets  We had been monitoring their trading exposure to us rather carefully  for many, many months We had an arrangement where if they needed to elevate their demand  for financing in our RP operations from the agreed routine amount, they would call Sandy  Krieger and give us some advance notice and information to enable us to understand their need  The process of getting a resignation letter from them was really a formality The lag can be  attributed to all the things they had to do other than type out a letter and send it to us, but I think  their management understood that was something they would have to do in the course of winding  up their affairs Was that helpful? "
6067,1998-02-03," All right, Mr Chairman I sent a memorandum to the Committee  suggesting two modest changes to the Authorization for Domestic Open Market  Operations I think that is the next item One is a permanent increase in the intermeeting  leeway from $8 billion to $12 billion The other is to remove from the Authorization the  references to bankers acceptances that have been inoperative lo these many years I think  the memorandum speaks for itself I would be happy to answer any questions  Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to the three pages of color charts that were placed in front of you before the meeting started 1/  The first page updates the charts I have shown before on current and forward three-month deposit rates In this case, I am presenting a full 13 months of data so you can see recent developments in the context of a longer period of time If you look at the top panel, shown in red, you can see the abrupt downward shift in US forward rates that occurred right after the New Year I think it is interesting that not much else has happened other than an abrupt move down The forward rates do not show much of a rising rate environment or falling rate expectations They are flat and right on top of one another after their downward shift, which I will come back to in a minute The flattening of the forward deposit rate curves really began in late October when the Dow lost 554 points It is quite dramatic how flat  1/ Copies of the charts used by Mr Fisher are appended to the transcript (Appendix 1)    2/3-4/98  the forward curves of expected three-month rates have become for the United States  Looking at the middle panel for Germany, shown in blue, you can see the continued modest decline in German forward rates I think this continues to reflect three factors First, there is a widening consensus that when the European central bank comes into existence 12 months from now, the initial policy rate is likely to be in the mid to low 3 percent range, and that is down from market expectations of higher rates I think there has been a widening appreciation that the Asian crisis will have a greater impact in Europe than the Europeans initially thought, and that has begun to weigh on the outlook for economic activity in Europe I believe those two developments combine to create a third factor in that the market really sees very little risk of a pickup in activity in the German economy or the European economy more generally in the months ahead, so rates have been winding down in Europe  In the green bottom panel, you can see at the lower right that there has been some rise in forward rate expectations in Japan as we have moved into the New Year, but the curve is still very flat I find it interesting that the forward rates have backed up a little, but the rise is not close to being as dramatic as the movements in the Nikkei and the yen in reaction to what the markets have seen as a very aggressive move by the Ministry of Finance to try to stabilize the financial sector and undertake some stimulus in the economy I think it is noteworthy that the forward rates depicted here are nowhere near the levels that they reached last May when there last was something of a burst of optimism, in the Japanese context at least, regarding the possibility that the tax impact that came in with this fiscal year might not be as bad as feared, and there were some hopes the Japanese economy might start recovering The point here is that we are not even near those levels even if there is some modest uptick in the Japanese forward rates  Turning to the second page, I would like to delve into the question of how to interpret recent movements in the US Treasury yield curve In the top panel, you can see 30-, 10-, and 2-year Treasury yields in green and the implied fed funds effective rate in red from the April fed funds futures contracts as they traded in December and January I would like to step back and give a little background In December, as yields and the yield curve were pressing lower, there were a number of market participants, myself included, who thought that with the start of the new year we would begin to see a modest backup in yields The backup was not expected to be dramatic, but it was thought that yields would rise at least to the levels that existed in early December This would occur as a consequence of the unwinding of a year-end flight to quality when investors were rushing out of emerging markets and into US Treasuries The thought was this would begin to unwind itself during January In particular, the managers of a number of major mortgage-backed securities portfolios took that view They may have gone home for the New Year holiday somewhat short of their normal duration targets with the    2/3-4/98  idea that they would be able to catch up more easily in the gently rising yield environment they expected to see in January  At the start of the year, there were three surprises for the market that came very quickly and changed that outlook rather dramatically One was a shift in expectations for monetary policy The second was a rather sudden jump in demand for Treasuries and other securities stemming from the Asian crisis, some actual and some anticipated demand The third was confirmation of a changed outlook in the supply of Treasury securities Let me go over each of those  The first came as a result of the Chairman's speech, and its market effect is depicted in the area of the chart associated with the line marked ""January 3"" The Chairman discussed the problems of price measurement in a low inflation environment, and over that weekend the market interpreted his comments to mean that the Committee and the Federal Reserve had moved to a symmetric outlook on the risks for policy Later that week, after Governor Meyer's speech on January 8, which included a discussion of easing, the market jumped on that part of the speech and interpreted it as meaning that the Committee probably had a slight bias toward an easing move or, if you will, that the greater probability was now in the direction of an easing in policy I am not passing judgment on whether either of these interpretations represented a fair reading of the texts, but that is the way the market interpreted them So, by the end of that first week in January, there was a quite significant shift in expectations for the stance of monetary policy  Two other things happened that week One, at the beginning of January there was a further sharp depreciation of a number of East Asian currencies as business corporations in those countries rushed into the markets to try to hedge their exposures for the new year It was a rather ham-handed, inexperienced effort to hedge their dollar exposures They had avoided the thin markets in December in the expectation of jumping into the thick markets of January, but they found that they were causing the currencies to move rapidly away from them That gave a further boost to the dollar and a further anticipation of very strong demand coming into the Treasury market  The third factor, not to be overlooked, is that on Monday, January 5, the White House announced its expectation that the fiscal budget for 1999 would be in balance While the market knew developments were moving in that direction, that news hit the market the same day that it had its first opportunity to respond to the Chairman's speech over that weekend  All of these developments taken together, which may have caught some of the major players slightly short of their duration targets, led to something of a rush You can see in the top panel of Chart 2 that in the first week in January both the 2-year and the 10-year rates moved down through the fed funds target rate level depicted by the solid black horizontal line I think the challenge is how to weigh or    2/3-4/98  untangle the three different factors the shift in expectations, the supply, and the demand factors influencing the market  In the middle panel on the left, the implied yields in fed funds futures are depicted from now through August The implied fed funds rate curves are shown for December 16, the date of the Committee's last meeting, for January 9, the end of that first heady week of January, and for last Friday, January 30, when rates backed up a little In the right panel is a snapshot of the Treasury yield curve for the same three dates As I look at the fed funds rate curves in the panel on the left, I see that the market is pricing some probability but not the certainty of an easing action It is not a particularly strong expectation that policy will be eased any time in the next six months, but clearly that is the direction where the probabilities lie  With regard to the Treasury yield curves shown in the middle panel on the right, many market participants look at the fact that the 2-year note is now trading significantly below the funds rate and take that as a very strong sign or conviction that an easing move is near at hand Indeed, over the last decade each time that the 2-year note has traded definitively through the funds rate, there has been an easing in policy within the following three months So, there is some historical background for that view But I believe it is important to keep in mind when we try to interpret the yield curve that the fed funds futures contracts and the forward rates suggest only some probability of an easing in policy rather than a certainty When I look at the yield curve, I see a strong conviction that there will be no tightening within the next six months, and I think that conviction is permitting the rather novel set of demand and supply conditions to migrate into the intermediate sector of the curve and thereby promote greater confidence among investors that they can carry 2- and 5-year paper without the risk of a backup in rates induced by the Committee  I would note two things First, the entire bill curve, even in the 1-year sector, was already below the federal funds rate at the time of the Committee's last meeting Moreover, while the entire yield curve--from 3 months to 30 years or 3 months to 10 years depending on how you slice it-- has declined a bit over the intermeeting period, the coupon curve from 2 to 30 years actually steepened over the same even as it shifted slightly lower So, while there clearly has been a shift in policy expectations in the market, I for one do not think it is as pronounced as a straight reading of the intermediate sector of the yield curve might lead one to conclude  In the bottom panel of page 2, you can see the movements in the dollar and get a sense of the run-up in the dollar that occurred at the end of last year and the first few days of this year Clearly, the yen strengthened over the course of January as the Ministry of Finance worked very hard to communicate their intent to stabilize the financial sector of the Japanese economy I would note that the dollar/mark is very little changed over the period from the high levels it reached at the end of the year    2/3-4/98  Turning to the last page of charts, I will briefly discuss our open market operations during the period I would like to make just a few points First, in the first maintenance period shown on the left side of the upper panel, we had both pronounced softness in the market around the Christmas holiday and then the year-end pressures; so, we had a ying-yang maintenance period We tried to manage both that softness and then the firmness In the next maintenance period, which ended January 14, we began the period by adding reserves, but we subsequently had repeated days of fog-induced float that led to a certain sogginess in the market So, we ended up being on the other side of the market, draining reserves that resulted from a considerable rise in float Early in the third period, on January 16, the unexpected size of corporate tax payments led to a miss of just under $3 billion in our projection of the Treasury balance That contributed to a very high fed funds rate, which rose as high as 20 percent on that day, and there was some borrowing from the discount window So, January 16 was one of the difficult days we faced during this period I would note that in the current period just under way, which is not depicted here, we again were supplying reserves in the last few days in anticipation of the settlement on new Treasury securities yesterday Today, we have been draining reserves We knew we would in fact have this heightened demand yesterday, but we anticipated soggy conditions as we came to the end of the period  I would also like to mention something not depicted in these charts to make sure the Committee members are all aware of the transactions in question Just before Christmas, we confronted an order from the Japanese authorities to sell  in Treasury bills In the absence of  We took of bills into the SOMA account, selecting bills that we would be able to run off in the course of January so as not to make our need to drain reserves any worse at the end of the month We sold  for them in the market and took another out of the repo pool, where we have had an elevated cash balance for them, to help them in effect to meet their cash needs We also actually arranged a transaction between the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance during the period; one wanted to sell bills and the other to buy This transaction was associated with their very heavy intervention in late January, and we tried to organize the financing this way to minimize the impact on the bill market At the same time, my colleagues at the Bank of Japan were faced with the problem of how to sterilize the intervention on the other side and get enough yen back into their market to avoid a spike in rates I just wanted to inform the Committee of these transactions  We had no foreign exchange operations for the System during the intermeeting period I will need the ratification of our domestic operations, and I would be happy to answer any questions    2/3-4/98  In the last several years, I do not recall that many instances of  sharp variations in float  Sandy Krieger says the weather has been better! [Laughter]  Sharp, unanticipated fluctuations in float now tend to happen only with extreme weather  The blizzards we had a couple years ago that closed the city of New York created some  extraordinary float around the time of the holidays The improvement we have seen may  have been the result of technology and a better working check clearing process, but I do  not have any particular insights beyond that My sense over the last six months to a year,  however, is that we are seeing a little more variation in float, and as operating balances  get lower and lower, a given miss on float proportionately matters a lot more  That is deflation! [Laughter]  One could consider hedging it, but I think the policy inference of  how we choose to hedge and how much we hedge would be rather awkward  Not yet! If I may, President Broaddus, you mentioned unrealized  losses or profits We pass our net profits on continuously to the Treasury They go  through the P&L system and on to the Treasury throughout the year  In my presentation, I pointed to the possibility that bullish  sentiment is already building in the market This is one of the anxieties that I have in  looking at the market "
6094,1998-03-31," Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to a package of materials that you should have in front of you It begins with a one-page summary of my comments 1/  1/ Copies of the materials used by Mr Fisher are appended to the transcript (Appendix 1)    3/31/98  Going over the summary, the first point is that the short-term and forward interest rate curves for the G-3 countries remain relatively flat Second, I will be commenting that greed eclipses fear in asset markets, except in Japan My third point will be that the flat forward pricing of short-term interest rates reflects, in my view, a ""clearing price"" for divergent views about the direction of the Committee's next move, not a conviction about the likelihood of steady policy If I am right about that, then there is something of a problem Why hasn't the risk premium associated with this uncertainty been more evident in the Treasury yield curve? I offer two tentative answers to that One is that, in general, expanding risk appetites have consumed the uncertainty for the moment Secondly and more technically, reductions in Treasury supply both actual and anticipated, combined with the flat forward money market curve recently have been encouraging dealers to extend duration, and that has tended to flatten the Treasury yield curve Finally, I will discuss Desk preparations for the heavy tax inflows in April and May that will cause a sharp rise in the Treasury balance and lead once again to a need for much larger operations than normal  Turning to the charts on page 2 that show current, 3-month forward, and 9-month forward deposit rates, you can see that these rates remain relatively flat in all three charts Only in Germany, the blue lines, is there much of a spread between the current 3-month rate and the 9-month forward 3-month rate In the chart for the United States, the red lines, you will note see that forward rate expectations backed up following the Chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, but they have not backed up to the levels where they closed at the end of last year  Looking at the chart for German rates, you can see that there continues to be a wide spread between current and forward rates relative to the spreads for Japan and the United States That spread reflects the anticipation that the European Central Bank, when it comes into existence next January, probably will have a policy rate somewhere in the mid 3 percent range; 3-1/2 percent is what most people in the market expect The Bundesbank's current rate is 33 percent Even with that in the background, I think the German economy and the European economies more generally are perceived to be doing a bit better than they were earlier, and it is noteworthy that both Finland and Norway raised their rates So, if anything, the market has a sense of some upside risk to interest rates in Europe, even if the potential increase is very moderate  Finally, in the bottom chart you can see that Japanese deposit rates, both current and forward, declined in February and March This reflects some decline in the Japanese bank premium Unfortunately, this is not so much the result of an improvement in the credit standing of the individual institutions but rather, in my view, a reassertion of the convoy system and    3/31/98  the implicit government guarantee behind the major Japanese banks The Japanese government simply will not let those banks fail, and that has pulled some of the risk premium out of the forward rate market  With that rather muted monetary policy outlook in the G-3 countries, the charts on the next page suggest in my view how greed has eclipsed fear in a number of the asset markets In our written report, we detailed that phenomenon across a number of individual markets This is a quick summary  On the left side, we have equity indices re-indexed to July 1, 1997, and total return bond indices for the United States, Germany, and Japan The red lines show the equity indices trading up from a 100 value on July 1 and the blue lines indicate the total return on 10-year bond indices  On the right side, we have indexed the option implied volatility on equity and bond futures in the G-3 countries We plotted the price of an option and its implied volatility on each of the contracts, but they are indexed to place them on comparable terms, again with 100 on July 1, 1997 You can see that the upward shifts in volatility that occurred in October and November have been reversed, especially in US and German equity markets  Generally speaking, you can see that financial asset prices in the United States and Germany have been consistently rising since the November period and their volatilities consistently falling, although it is noteworthy that in the last few days there has been some uptick in the implied volatilities in both the United States and Germany  The bottom panel, of course, shows that Japan is quite a different story You can see the poor performance of the Nikkei, but it did rally early this year, and total returns on Japanese government bonds have improved The authorities were working quite hard over the last quarter to get the Nikkei to close at the 18,000 level, an effort that did not succeed On this index scale, 89 would be equal to the 18,000 level In Tokyo, they even invented a new term for this effort Traditionally, the market has referred to PKO, meaning price keeping operations, where public pension funds and the like are used to support equities In the last month or so, they have relabeled these PLO, price lifting operations As you can see, the Japanese authorities had their only success in early January, and since then they have succeeded only in lifting the level of volatilities, illustrated on the right  I did not chart the last few days With the failure of the Nikkei to close at the 18,000 level at Japan's fiscal year-end, the markets are quite anxious at this point The yen has been weakening a bit, reflecting something of a sense in the markets that the Japanese authorities are without a policy at this    3/31/98  point While we hear that one more package is coming, it is not clear that the package is going to do anything for the financial sector, and the markets are quite cynical about what is likely to happen  The next page provides another way of thinking about how risk appetites have been expanding I return to a table that I showed to the Committee last August in which I introduced the different philosophies of four characters in their search of a return in financial markets--the optimists and pessimists under the old paradigm and the new paradigm  The top half of this table is identical in form to the one that I presented to the Committee last August It shows the old paradigm pessimist who is worried about an imminent breakout of inflation and the old paradigm optimist who thinks inflation may be coming but the Fed may be able to delay it for a few quarters We have the new paradigm optimist who thinks the economy has entered a new era and he does not worry about inflation at all We have the new paradigm pessimist who thinks that deflation is upon us I introduced these four characters last August to help explain the volatility we were then experiencing in the markets, including intraday volatility, and these four characters were duking it out in the markets I reintroduce them here to show briefly how they would have fared to date  Had you run a portfolio consistent with the views of the old paradigm pessimist, shorting stocks and bonds as shown here at the bottom, you would have been crushed, to put it bluntly The new paradigm pessimist, who would have been short stocks and long bonds, would have done a little better, but his positive return in bonds would not have come close to offsetting his negative return in stocks  The two optimists would have done fairly well, obviously The point is, of course, that the pessimistic views, the skeptical views, have simply been priced out of this market and are not being reflected in the performance of the market If you were trying to manage money on the basis of those views, you were stopped out long ago  Turning to the next page, I depict in the top panel three different trajectories of the implied yields on the fed funds futures contracts The blue line shows these yield trajectories at the time of the August meeting, the green line in early January, and the red line as of last Friday My view, as I mentioned, is that the steady path of the fed funds rates implied by these contracts reflects a clearing price among divergent views regarding the direction of the Committee's next move  Forgive me if you saw it, but Friday's Wall Street Journal had a lovely item in it that summarized a recent poll of the 36 primary dealers It showed that none expects the Fed to change interest rates at this meeting    3/31/98  But the survey also revealed ""that there is no clear consensus on the direction of the Fed's next policy shift"" Sixteen dealers predicted a tightening, twelve an easing, seven saw the Fed on hold for at least the foreseeable future, and one said it was not possible to assess accurately what the Fed will do  With that degree of uncertainty, why isn't there more of a risk premium evident in the yield curve? I think, as I said, that expanding risk appetites associated with the bull market in financial assets have consumed the premium and therefore partially obscured it The charts showing the bond and equity market returns and the implied volatilities speak for themselves Around the middle of last week, both the implied volatilities on bonds and equities and the yield curve did begin to back up I certainly would have been a buyer of volatility at the low levels reached in the middle of last week  In my view, this backup in volatilities and in the yield curve probably reflects two things One is that the market is beginning to price in some uncertainty in recognition of the greater uncertainty about direction Secondly, the market may also be pricing in the very small probability that the Committee will act at this meeting, even though it still views a move as an extremely unlikely event When markets begin to get anxious, they sometimes price in a little of that anxiety That adjustment may come out of the market after the meeting if the Committee does not make any change The other kind of adjustment may be more enduring  Turning to the next chart, a second explanation that I mentioned is that the reductions in Treasury supply, both actual and anticipated, combined with a flat forward money market curve recently have been encouraging dealers to extend duration, tending to flatten the Treasury yield curve I hope you will bear with me while I explain this chart  At the last meeting, I showed the Committee a chart of the yield curve on a constant maturity basis as each of the on-the-run issues traded through the funds rate I noted that with numerous issues trading through the funds rate, many saw that as encouraging an expectation in the market that an easing move was coming But showing you only the yield curve relative to the fed funds target rate was an incomplete picture In pricing on-the-run Treasury issues, dealers are not significantly constrained by the level of the funds rate Rather, their cost of carrying on-the-run issues is reflected in the term-to-date repo rates    3/31/98  In the top panel, the red line indicates the 10-year on-the-run yield The bottom blue line is the term-to-date RP rate for the on-the-run 10-year maturity as it traded over the past year This rate is a declining maturity repo On the first day of a refunding cycle, it is a 90-day instrument; on the last day, it is a 1-day instrument So, it has a declining maturity as it moves across the chart  There are a number of factors that influence this rate, obviously One is the remaining term A second is the scarcity of a Treasury issue As we move through each auction cycle, the outstanding Treasury issues become more and more scarce The on-the-run issue is purchased by people who actually want to hold it, rather than just to trade it or to hedge with it So, as you come to each of the dotted vertical lines on the chart, you see a greater and greater scarcity value Of course, the term structure of the money market also affects this rate  The purpose of the top panel is to help you understand the bottom two panels by putting them in context On the left, you can see a snapshot of the entire yield curve and the term-to-date repo rates for the on-the-run issues as of the Friday before last March's meeting On the right, you see the same as of this past Friday Each of these dates is roughly in the middle of the auction cycles--the first-quarter refunding and the second-quarter refunding They are off by only a few days What you can see is that even though the yield curve has moved down, there is still a positive carry across the entire curve What you also can see is how much more attractive the carry is on the 10-year now relative to the short end than it was last year  The purpose of this rather complicated picture is to make two simple points First, to be clear, the marginal buyers and sellers of on-the-run Treasury securities are not significantly constrained by the funds rate itself but rather by the cost of financing, particular on-the-run issues in the repo market There, the rates are significantly affected by the supply and demand conditions for those particular issues and by the term structure of the money market  Second, at present the positive carry in the market is making it relatively more attractive for dealers to extend duration into the 10-year sector So, while real investors or nonleveraged investors are being drawn out along the yield curve in search of higher absolute returns, the dealers are being pulled to some extent into the 10-year sector in search of the carry These are not the only factors that affect the level of the yield curve by any means, but I think they are important ones for us to understand  Finally, turning to domestic operations on the last page, our operations over the last period have been detailed in our written reports, and I thought I would focus on the upcoming period Last May, Governor Rivlin chided    3/31/98  me and my colleagues for the $50 billion positive surprise in the Treasury balance relative to our projections That positive surprise reflected a positive Treasury income surprise I thought it might be helpful to review how we are doing so far this year and to anticipate the Desk's operations in April and May  At the top of the page, we have shown the forecasts and actual results for last year's first two quarters At the top left you can see the forecasts by the Treasury, the Board, and the New York staffs of first- quarter Treasury budget receipts The actual is shown in red and the percent errors of the three forecasts are indicated on the right side of that first box In the right side panel at the top, you can see the 7 to 10 percent misses in projected Treasury revenues for the first quarter that created the positive surprises of some $40 to $50 billion  The next two panels show how we are doing this year On the left are the forecasts for the first quarter by the Treasury, the Board, and the New York staffs and the preliminary actual outcome The Treasury's forecast was right on the money, and the Board and New York are doing a little better than last year in their forecasting In the right panel, you see the April-June forecasts We have a rather wide range of about $30 billion separating New York and Washington, with the Treasury right in the middle  The bottom picture translates this into our estimates of the daily Treasury balances at the Fed The latter rise sharply once the Treasury reaches the ceiling on its TT&L account capacity in the banking system The differences between the New York and the Board estimates, as I understand it, are not related to differences in nominal GDP forecasts but in some of the nuances of tax collection We do have a bit of a gap here, but the estimates bracket last year's actual Treasury balances, the dotted green line  I want to offer this as background to help you understand that in the coming weeks we are likely to be changing some of the normal aspects of our operations--not permanently, but to deal with this situation First, we are likely to conduct another coupon pass in the next couple of weeks for $5 to $7 billion to lay a bit more of a reserve base  Secondly, when the need for reserves starts to rise sharply, we are likely to want to enter the market quite early in the morning, 800 or 830 am, so that we can insure that we get sufficient propositions from the dealers to cover our needs On those occasions, we are likely both to announce the day before that we will be coming into the market at, say, 830 am the following morning, and we would plan to conduct two operations that day We would do one in quantity, on the order of $10 or $20 billion, and come    3/31/98  back later in the day to fine-tune the total I certainly hope that the fine-tuning operation is going to be in the same direction as the morning's operation There is some risk it might not be, that we would be adding reserves in the morning and draining reserves later in the day If we did that, I would certainly hope that we would be doing them in different maturities We might have met our basic reserve objective for a week or so in a big operation in the morning and then have to fine-tune it later in the day with an overnight drain I hope that does not happen, but that is a possibility we have to bear in mind if the reserve needs expand to levels close to either the New York or the Board estimate Both estimates indicate the need for quite sharp reserve growth, and how quickly we will have to expand the scope of our operations will depend on how soon that need arises  Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations to report for this period I have provided the Committee with annual reports on both our domestic open market operations and our operations in foreign currencies I will need the Committee's ratification of the Desk's domestic operations during the intermeeting period; they are detailed in our written reports I would be happy to answer any questions  I'm afraid I don't have that number at my fingertips It's on the order  of a $30 billion surplus for this quarter  Yes  I wish I knew the answer to that question I certainly share your  assessment When I said ""no policy,"" I want to be clear that I was referring to the market  looking, seeing, and feeling that nobody was home There is the LDP; there is the cabinet; there  are the members of the Diet; there are the agencies; these are the different decision-making  poles I think the perception in the market is that they do not seem to be talking to each other,  which is what I am implying by no policy There is no center of gravity being provided, and that  is what I was focusing on On the question of whether this matters, how otherwise sensible  people--    3/31/98  I think the counterparties of the major Japanese banks are looking,  unfortunately, at the implicit Japanese government guarantee that appears to have been  reaffirmed I don't think they are trading on the basis of the capital adequacy numbers when  they are trading with Japanese institutions  It has come down to under 20 basis points  Oh, it is still positive; we can still see it  I don't think I need to I think you've said it very well  I don't think the Street's focus on that hypothesis would be at the short  end of the coupon curve, but if there were an anticipation of an easing move, the Street would  talk about expecting a rally further out on the yield curve In January, in fact, we observed what  I was talking about in the chart that I showed at the last meeting As I said then, I think the  market was responding to recent speeches by the Chairman and Governor Meyer, which were  interpreted as indicating an increased likelihood of an easing action That is when the short end  of the coupon curve traded through the funds rate I do not dispute that what you have described  can happen and the Street does talk about it that way, but what was happening in January was the  other scenario  Absolutely! I put in last year's actuals to show that the range of  misses was 7 to 10 percent That had a huge impact in dollar terms But I was also offering that  experience to provide some scale of the forecasting errors involving big numbers If we could  get Desk operations to have misses of only 10 percent over a 24-hour horizon, we would be  doing awesomely well "
6119,1998-05-19," Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to the package of color charts that should be on the table before you1/ The first page shows the 3-month deposit rates including the current Libor, the 3-month forward, and the 9-month forward rates  Looking at the US panel, you can see that there has been little net change in these forward rates since your last meeting on March 31, but there has been a  1/ Copies of the charts used by Mr Fisher are appended to the transcript (Appendix 1)    5/19/98  very modest uptrend since the nonfarm payroll release on April 3, when forward expectations troughed So, we have seen a gently rising trend since early April, with a punctuation mark associated with the April 27 Wall Street Journal story  Looking at the panel for Germany, you can see that forward rates had been drifting up at the time of your last meeting and they did not stabilize until after the EU summit on May 1-3 at which the president and the board of the European Central Bank were selected That pattern is contrary to the expectations of many observers in the market I think the earlier updrift was the consequence of the same factors that I have been talking about for some months These include the perception of slightly stronger-than-anticipated growth in the German and other European economies that has been viewed as leading to a slightly higher probability that the Bundesbank might raise rates before year-end or that the ECB might establish a slightly higher opening rate next January than previously had been assumed  The Japanese rates are shown in the bottom panel You can see that the announcement of the stimulus package on April 9 and the foreign exchange intervention on April 9 and 10 had little impact on the forward rates, with the 9-month forward 3-month rate not moving at all on the announcement I think that is worthy of note However, on May 7 Deputy Governor Yamaguchi of the Bank of Japan commented that he saw more positive than negative effects from a rate reduction, and forward rates moved down a bit following his remarks  Turning to the next page, I hope the Committee will find it worthwhile to bear with me while I try to go through some of the different components and ways of thinking about the Japan premium I think this explanation might be helpful now I will first go over the mechanics of the top three charts, and then discuss some issues and problems that come up Let me say in advance that I am presenting this to show you how skeptical I am that we really understand the Japan premium phenomenon  The first panel shows a measure of the premium in dollar terms It is expressed as the spread between the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi's 1-month Libor rate and Barclay's 1-month Libor rate You can see that during the first quarter of the year, from the start of the year to the end of the Japanese fiscal year which also was the date of your last meeting, the premium averaged around 20 basis points, though it moved around a bit That is the measure of the premium that most people were talking about Since the end of Japan's fiscal year, it has moved down into the 9 to 10 basis point range  The second panel with the green line is a crude, but I think still useful, measure of the premium in yen terms, which is expressed as the spread between 1-month Tibor and 1-month Libor Tibor is the Tokyo interbank offer rate; Libor is the London rate The Tokyo panel is made up almost exclusively of    5/19/98  Japanese banks If you threw out the high and the low in that panel, you probably would eliminate the 1 or 2 western banks that are in it, so it would become an exclusively Japanese panel Libor is overwhelmingly non-Japanese If you threw out more of the highs and the lows, you would end up throwing out all the Japanese names that usually operate in Libor You would end up with a measure of 1-month yen funding comprised mainly of non-Japanese banks in London and Japanese banks in Tokyo That spread is important to underscore because it gives you a sense of the premium for the best Japanese names It covers only the banks that everyone thinks are implicitly guaranteed by the government, not the smaller more anonymous banks  The left-hand scale of the third panel measures the asset side of the Bank of Japan's balance sheet The shaded blue area depicts the growth of assets The right-hand scale refers to interest rates The blue line is the overnight call rate; it recently has been mostly below the solid black line, which is the official discount rate  Let me now go back over some of the issues that come up First, it is worth noting that both the dollar and the yen premiums have come down quite a bit in recent days It is quite noticeable that the dollar measure still indicates a premium in the 9 to 10 basis point range One might ask whether this premium should be arbitraged out; it ought to be an easy thing to arbitrage away But, of course, an investor would have to take on the credit risk implicit in doing business with Japanese names What interests me is that when I talk to bankers, many of them will tell me very frankly that their credit lines to their Japanese counterparties are completely full That is, their traders are taking maximum advantage of trying to capture this premium and arbitrage it But the bank credit departments are now in charge on an individual trade-by-trade basis, and they are up against their limits With that in mind, I find it quite impressive that the spread is still only 9 to 10 basis points--that even with greed restrained by credit departments, the spread is still in that neighborhood  If you look at the yen measure, you can see that the premium has been squeezed down to 1 or 2 basis points at present I believe it is important for us to ask whether we are looking at a single phenomenon that we can measure consistently from last fall When we talk to Bank of Japan officials, they point to what they call the twin peaks of the premium--one prior to the calendar year- end and the other prior to the fiscal year-end They view the premium principally as a liquidity risk, not as a credit risk I would note, however, that the first peak occurred in late November when we began to see closures of Japanese financial institutions, bringing to mind a larger question of credit risk Also, given the dubious quality of assets on the balance sheets of Japanese banks, this does not seem to be a very useful time to be drawing a fine distinction between liquidity and credit risks A Japanese bank that cannot fund itself is really a credit risk to me if I am a market counterparty    5/19/98  The third panel shows the growth in the Bank of Japan's assets In our conversations, Bank of Japan officials explained what they were trying to accomplish when they were aggressively expanding their balance sheet around calendar year-end and fiscal year-end By doing so through 1-month repos, they wanted to provide the market with a sense of confidence by injecting liquidity for a relatively long period The growth of the asset side of their balance sheet depicted that They are rather defensive about the low growth on the liability side of their balance sheet because they say that various measures they have been publishing for a long time are misleading They actually have been draining reserves at times by issuing their own bills That is, they issue their own liability on one side as a Bank of Japan bill, but they also drain reserves That is a swap on the liability side and not really growth in the balance sheet In any case, these transactions have not given me much confidence  I will offer you my own interpretation, my words not theirs It seems to me that for the last six or seven months, they have been doing something of an ""operation twist"" at the very short end of their yield curve They have been intervening in the 1-month interest rate area, pushing money out Then, because they target the call rate and try to keep it in the neighborhood of the overnight discount rate, they have been draining funds out of the shorter end-- overnight and for two or three days at a time--against the backdrop of the overall expansion of their balance sheet That leads me to the tentative conclusion that when I look at the yen funding premium, I am not measuring a single consistent phenomenon expressed on the demand side That's because, overall, there has been a net increase on the supply side of the money market But at the margin, it makes me even more nervous to think that they really have been price-targeting the 1-month interest rate to push it down while draining funds out overnight to try to keep the overnight call rate close to the overnight discount rate If I am right about that, then interpreting the premium is even more complicated than I thought I believe the risks of a sudden backup going forward, if there is bad news, are even greater  The bottom panel is a place holder to show you widening corporate spreads, expressed in some Moody's indices that we found, over comparable Japanese government securities I think this panel is interesting for three reasons First, many people talk about the fact that they cannot find deteriorating credit spreads in markets in Japan They suggest that Japanese markets do not work that way, that they are not Western, but we can see the deterioration quite clearly in this chart Secondly, these widening spreads are those of the banks' customers, and things are getting worse and worse for them Finally, I think it is a useful reminder that we are approaching the Japanese bankruptcy season The bankruptcies do not actually occur at the end of the fiscal year; they take place later when the fiscal year results have to be made public Much the same thing happened in November of last year when we began seeing reports of    5/19/98 5  bankruptcies relating to results in the fiscal half year that ended September 30, 1997  Turning to the next page, let me briefly note some of the dollar's movements You can see in the top panel that the Japanese government stimulus package did little to improve market sentiment toward the yen, and perhaps the kindest thing one can say about the of intervention they carried out on April 9 and 10 is that it had only a transitory effect on the exchange rate Over the last month, many market participants have been full of brave talk about dollar/yen going to 150 and 160 When we ask them why it is not there already, they express a strong conviction but they do not make a very persuasive case Even so, since the close of the G-8 summit this weekend and the absence of compelling talk about intervention, the yen has been weakening against the dollar for the last two days, bumping up through what the market thought was the very significant 135 level  On the mark side, for all the fireworks involving the personalities at the EMU summit on May 1-3, I think one should not ignore that the summit did make a certainty out of EMU when previously there was at least a one-in-a- hundred chance that the process would be delayed or derailed The removal of that uncertainty has made the mark rather more significant as the predecessor of the euro We can see some slight firming of the mark But overall, except for the slight uptrend of the dollar against the yen since February 1, what impresses me about this panel is how very little has happened to the dollar in 1998 We have had shifting expectations regarding Committee policy, sharp fluctuations in equity markets, crises in Southeast Asia and in the world's second largest economy, and an historic monetary union in Europe Taking a step back, this panel suggests to me that the dollar has been out on a Sunday stroll  In the bottom panel, you can see that Treasury yields have tracked the movements in short-term expectations shown in the upper panel of the first page of these charts These yields have changed very little on net since the date of your last meeting, but there has been a gentle uptick since the nonfarm payroll release on April 3 I have talked to a number of traders and speculators who complain rather loudly that there is not enough volatility in this market for them to make money  Let me turn to our open market operations on the next page and give you an update on the tax inflows in April and May In the top panel, you can see that the Board and New York staff forecasts for second-quarter receipts converged at the higher level, closer to the New York numbers In the chart below, you can see that this did not help New York very much in forecasting the daily reserve levels As the red line shows, the actual balance came in much closer to the Board's estimate than to New York's, which is a good lesson in the difficulties of making daily forecasts    5/19/98  The first reason for this is that receipts did not come in as strong or as early as the staff in New York was forecasting This is indicated in the first notation line at the bottom of the page The first row of numbers, which shows total actual Treasury balances less the New York forecast, indicates how far the actuals came in below our daily forecasts, particularly early on But the gap narrowed quite a bit as we got into late April and early May  The second reason why it was so difficult to forecast the day number is that on April 17 the Treasury announced some changes to the TT&L program that were designed to make it more attractive to banks While we had been working with them on this and are very supportive of these changes, the timing of their announcement frankly took us, the market, and the Treasury's own forecasters by surprise As you can see, the notations in the bottom row show how much this affected our own day numbers by indicating the extent to which the TT&L accounts were holding higher balances than we were forecasting, meaning lower balances at the Reserve Banks  The next page shows various indicators of trading activity in the fed funds market since your last meeting The vertical blue lines are the daily ranges of the federal funds rates; the horizontal red lines or ticks are the effective averages for each trading day, and the vertical red lines each represent one standard deviation of trading around the daily effective rates The increase in TT&L balances at major banks may have been one of the factors contributing to the softness in the funds market in the middle two maintenance periods; the increase substantially reduced rather suddenly the purchasing needs of some of the major banks that often are active in the morning More importantly, demand for excess reserves appears to have shifted lower, particularly during the April 22 and May 6 maintenance periods, a development that we do not yet fully understand Moreover, banks apparently were able to use positive carry- ins from the April 22 period into the May 6 period to a much greater extent than we previously viewed as the norm That may be the result of little more than a random distributive effect or it may be something more profound; we do not yet know  The softness in the funds market in the May 6 period, I think in looking back, reflected a combination of this apparent shift in demand for excess reserves and our desire to remain symmetric with respect to the risks on each day To put this somewhat more precisely, even as we became aware that bank demand for excess reserves was lower than we had expected, we were reluctant to pare back the cumulatively higher excess reserves because to have done so would have required aiming for quite a low daily excess number Moreover, this would have occurred at a time when the absolutely high level of Treasury balances at the Fed meant that a small percentage point miss in the Treasury balance estimate could have completely drained the funds market and left us with a very negative day number and a big surprise on the upside However, based on this experience, we revised down our assumption about period    5/19/98  average excess reserves by $200 million to $12 billion I think excess reserves are going be very much a moving target for us  Finally, we had no foreign exchange operations to report for this period I will need the Committee's ratification of our domestic open market operations I have distributed to the Committee a memorandum on proposed changes to the securities lending program I am not seeking a Committee vote at this time, but I would like to share the details of these proposals with the primary dealers and I did not want to do so without giving Committee members an opportunity to react first I would be happy to answer questions about my report, our operations, or the securities lending memorandum Thank you  Noon is rather late in the cycle of daily trading and clearing in the  market The book entry side of the wire closes at 300 pm We want to try to provide some  elasticity to both the trading and the clearance functions of most major firms A noon auction  would enable them to get their results around 1230 pm, and that is already a little late in the day  How we would respond in a period of acute stress is, I think, a good question I would emphasize  that if the market knew securities were to be auctioned at noon and they could look forward to  relying on that auction on days of some stress, that might help to comfort them Beyond that we  have considered two possible approaches One might be to announce early in the morning a change  in the limits for the noon auction, which might provide some additional comfort I would begin by  using that device in a period of particular stress Another possible approach would be to hold the  auction earlier in the morning in such circumstances    5/19/98  In terms of selecting a routine time, however, we are trying to pick a slot that is in  between our operations, Treasury auctions, and other noise in the markets As a routine matter,  noon seemed about as good a bet as we could find, but we would have to remain flexible in  thinking about the timing of our auction if we were responding to a particularly acute problem  Obviously, if we state the problem in the extreme form of market  failure, it is hard to point to a market failure What I would emphasize is that we rely on the very  smooth operation of this market because it is the vehicle for our principal policy tool I think that is  why, in looking back through years and years of memoranda and reports on this issue, we see a  consistent concern from the Fed's point of view about making this market work efficiently A  number of central banks do not rely as much as we do, almost exclusively, on our own government  debt to comprise the asset side of our balance sheet We are the ""hog"" of the government securities  market We hold about a third of the bill issues and a rather significant portion of the longer-term  obligations--10, 15, 20 percent of individual issues as we move along the yield curve So, it is in  our interest to make this market function as smoothly as possible The market certainly views us as    5/19/98  a large holder of these instruments The initial System securities lending program in the late 1960s  was established in response to the request of the dealers, and our proposed revision is also a  response to the dealers who claim that the existing program no longer works We are in a period of  declining debt issuance by the Treasury, and the stresses in the market feel particularly acute All  that said, I think it is very important to emphasize how much on the margin of the market we  should try to position our program We will be a very small part of the securities lending market  even at the higher proposed limits--our share will be a single digit percentage There is a vast  securities lending market that we think works well The question is whether we are part of the  problems that exist and whether we should be part of the solution to getting more efficient clearing  I would prefer that we be predictable and transparent in the rules  under which we operate We thought long and hard about trying to design a more discretionary  program where we would just respond to dealer needs But that began to feel more like  intervention in the ""specials"" market It was very hard to see how we could get comfortable if we  established rules of the road that involved decisions about whether to make securities available for  lending today or some other day It seemed most effective and most efficient and most transparent  to say, here is what a dealer is able to do every business day of the year In acute circumstances,  we could change some limits if there were to be, say, another Drexel Burnham But normally, we  will try to be transparent, predictable, rule-based, and let the market come to us through a price  mechanism    5/19/98  We have been in the business of lending securities on a daily basis for  30 years  We get requests every day, which essentially end up being rationed on  a first-come, first-served basis and very small amounts being lent with great awkwardness The last  time I spoke to the Committee about this, I indicated how uncomfortable I was with our rule of  lending only to dealers who were not short It is a nice idea, but we just cannot enforce it I do not  even have a fig leaf of protection here  I admit that I am stuck We have been in the business of lending  securities for a long time, and we would have a problem if we tried to get out of it now I think the  dealers and the Treasury would raise a hackle  I'm proposing going principally to a price constraint with some  quantitative limits One reason I want to have a concrete proposal to show the dealers is that I  anticipate a spectrum of opinions There are some who will think this proposed program is great,  but others will say that it is not a good idea and that it will jeopardize the securities lending  business We want to hear about that so we can see if there is anything we can do to address  legitimate concerns I think this is the best way to approach a new program I want to underscore    5/19/98  that on both the quantity limits--the totals per dealer and per issue--and on the 150 basis point  spread, I think we are going to learn from experience and we will adjust going forward The  quantity limits and the spread may be too high or too low to enable us to adhere to the principle of  operating only on the margin of this market The Treasury is also very interested in making sure  that we keep our securities lending operations on the margin and that we do not become too  important a part of that market We are going to have to watch that very carefully  Yes, they are comfortable They support, as I said, our going forward  There is some delicacy in that it is our program and not theirs This function is right on the edge of  both open market operations and debt policy They see some risk that while we could generate  additional revenues from the new program, of which they are the ultimate beneficiaries, we might  squeeze out more of any market price premium than we generate in added revenues I don't think  that's likely to happen, but it is something we and they will be watching  Yes, that is another feature I did not mention You can see that in  their balance sheet I don't have the figures in front of me, and I'm not sure it is an overwhelming  number But, yes, there has been a certain amount of credit substitution that the Bank of Japan has    5/19/98  arranged largely by issuing its own bills while it has added reserves principally by taking in private  paper as well as government securities I should not say ""principally by taking in private paper""  They have been taking in a fair amount of such paper in addition to Japanese government bonds  So, they have ended up with more customer or bank paper on their balance sheet and have put out  their own credit into the market A number of traders in Tokyo have noted that it seemed to them  that the Bank of Japan was caught in a dilemma Having taken in private paper, if they disgorge it  now, very strange things may happen to the prices and yields that private entities in Japan get on  such paper  I don't have any evidence of this other than anecdotes in the market,  but the impression in the market is that the private paper the Bank of Japan is taking in is not of the    5/19/98  top 18 banks but of the lower tiers As I see it, this makes it a slightly bigger problem The Bank  of Japan may have an implicit guarantee for the whole financial sector We may yet get a financial  shock there, but I think it is more likely to come from the hinterlands, as it were  As I understand it, it is a mix of both It is similar to what we take in  at the discount window  That's an interesting way of putting it!  Yes, they are taking in some  The collateral is the private paper It is like our discount window If  we take in a ""Trump"" note from a bank, our collateral is--  I think Cathy Minehan is pointing to a real problem, Mr Chairman  At the margin, that is the direction I'm not sure one would assert that the Bank of Japan is now the    5/19/98  bad bank for the banking system, but as people now talk about it in Tokyo the marginal change  seems to be in that direction That is what I am reporting "
6145,1998-06-30," Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to three  pages of colored charts 1/ They have a peach cover and are somewhere in  front of you, I hope    The first page shows the 3-month Euro-deposit rates including the  current, 3-month forward, and 9-month forward rates since July 1 of last  year This chart therefore covers the 12-month period since the start of the  Asian crisis    1/ Copies of the charts used by Mr Fisher are appended to the transcript (Appendix 1)    6/30-7/1/98  In the top panel for the US dollar rates, you can see that most recently  those rates have continued their gentle decline from their peak on April 27 at  the time of the Wall Street Journal article The decline was punctuated more  recently by the market's reaction to the Chairman's testimony before the  Joint Economic Committee on June 10 I will come back to that in a  moment That leaves the forward rates right on top of the current 3-month  rates, which is the same state of affairs that exists in Japan, as you can see in  the bottom panel    If you look at German rates over the course of the year since the start of  the Asian crisis--shown in the middle panel--your first impression may be  that Europe has been going its own way Rates rose in the second half of  1997 and maintained a bit more of a spread between current and forward  rates in contrast to the dollar and yen rates But on a second and closer look,  I think one can see that since December 1997 German rates have tended to  move in the same direction as US rates; they declined in December and  January, rose from mid-January to late April, and generally declined again  from late April to the present Their recent downdrift is attributed to the  anticipation of a larger Asian effect on the European economy and therefore  the perception of a reduced likelihood of rate rises over the remainder of the  year from the NCBs in advance of the ECB taking over on January 1st As  this gentle downdrift has occurred in the last couple of weeks, the mark has  weakened slightly against the dollar    The bottom panel indicates that money market rates in Japan in general  and the Japan premium in particular have backed up quite sharply in the past  few days The backup has occurred even though the Bank of Japan has been  quite generous in its term operations in the 1- and 3-month areas, but they  again have been draining shorter maturities measured in days and weeks   The widening of the various measures of the Japan premium began about  two weeks ago as Nippon and Long Term Credit Bank problems came to the  surface It is interesting that the widening accelerated from last Friday to  Monday after the announcement that there might be a merger between  Sumitomo Trust and Long Term Credit Bank    Turning to the next page, there are three panels that I will first  describe and then go over my thoughts about them The first panel shows  the dollar/yen in green with the scale on the right side and the dollar/mark  in blue with the scale on the left side The middle panel shows constant  maturity US Treasury yields of 2, 10, and 30 years The bottom panel  shows the currency values of seven currencies against the dollar Those  currencies are indexed to April 10, which was the date of the Bank of  Japan's intervention operation in Tokyo The Japanese yen is  shown in green The day before we had conducted a more modest  intervention operation on their behalf  2    6/30-7/1/98  Many market participants have observed an apparent correlation  between the dollar/yen and various exchange rates and rates in other asset  markets Having observed this apparent correlation, which they date back to  about April 10, many in the speculative community may have reinforced it  through their own trading behavior in the expectation of making a profit   That certainly has happened But while most market participants are  focused on the weakening yen as the cause of the recent correlated  movements, I think we should not overlook the common thread of the  strengthening dollar and the strengthening mark, which I have not graphed  here, as capital flees the periphery and moves into core industrial countries    In particular, it seems to me that over recent months, the dollar and  dollar assets have been strengthening as US economic data have come in  close to expectations, though not so strong as to appear to require a policy  tightening by the Committee Indeed, the data have been just weak enough  to avoid provoking a tightening but not so weak as to suggest that the end of  the great expansion might be in sight While I do not have similar charts for  Germany, the same phenomenon has been occurring there, with the mark  strengthening against the yen, equity markets reaching new highs, and Bund  yields reaching new lows    The Chairman's testimony on June 10 before the Joint Economic  Committee, coming as it did in the midst of much anxiety about Japanese,  Russian, Chinese, South African, and other asset markets, was perceived by  the market as something of a neon sign announcing the good health of the  US economy in contrast to much of the rest of the world In addition,  because the Chairman appears to have been read in the market as being both  on the lookout for inflationary pressures but also suggesting that a near-term  tightening was not likely, investors took the testimony as a green light to  buy Treasury coupon securities with minimal risk    Our joint intervention on June 17, while providing something of a  respite from the rush of markets in one direction, also in a sense proved the  correlation hypothesis, at least to some people in the market In any event,  the strengthening of the yen provided some trading relief for many other  asset markets Overnight, we again had something of the same  phenomenon Today, official statements in Tokyo that made a permanent  income tax cut seem more likely and suggested that one faction of the LDP  might support the prime minister in his pursuit of a bridge bank concept  gave the market a certain pause In markets here at the quarter-end, a  number of participants seemed to cash in their positions and take their  profits home when they could This induced something of a rally in the yen,  which played through into other asset markets I'm afraid that while there is  a positive side to that, we should be aware of the likely risky side, namely  that this episode seems once again to be confirming in the market's mind  that everything is driven off the dollar/yen  3    6/30-7/1/98  Turning to the last page and domestic open market operations, the average effective federal funds rate since your last meeting has been quite close to the target rate at 551 percent But as you can see in the pattern of funds rate trading over the three maintenance periods, the daily effective rates have tended to oscillate between slightly soft early in the periods and somewhat firmer toward the end of the periods You can see the slight down/up, down/up pattern in the effective rates, the red horizontal lines This is not quite how I think we should be going about meeting the Committee's objective of an average rate I would prefer to avoid the apparent instability that stems from having the market think of us as content with the oscillation of a negative autocorrelation pattern I would rather that they think of us and anticipate our operations as being directed more toward a reversion to the mean I do not yet entirely understand why we have had this problem of a soft market early in the maintenance periods It may simply be that we have switched back and forth from adding to draining reserves as the needs worked out that way It may also be that there continues to be some volatility in the pattern of major banks' participation in the Treasury tax and loan accounts Some of them raise and then cut their capacity, and this is leading to some inherent instability in the market  In the last few days, markets have been anticipating the usual pronounced quarter-end tightness in the market Today, federal funds are trading above 6 percent as we thought they would, but this is a major payment day We have tried to address the pressures You can see the softish tone we gave the market yesterday in our effort to anticipate today's tightness We have been trying to meet that as best we can  Mr Chairman, I will need the Committee's ratification of our domestic operations Separately, I will need ratification of our June 17 foreign exchange intervention that I have previously described to the Committee The System's share comes to $4167 million I would be happy to answer any questions members of the Committee might have  I don't want the market to think that if we allow federal funds to be  very soft at the beginning of the period, we will inevitably let the market be tight at the end of    6/30-7/1/98  the period That is not my objective I'm afraid that the pattern we have seen tends to induce a  certain amount of instability if market participants come to anticipate that if the fed funds rate is  soft, we will permit firmness later I would prefer that they think of us, whatever the funds rate  deviation may be on a particular day, as trying to get back to the target as best we can on each of  the subsequent days  I haven't even heard the idea floated of an intervention to support the  ruble, though it has been floated with respect to some of the other currencies that have come  under pressure in the last year  No We have operated as agent for the account of South Africa, but  that is a standard reciprocity practice among central banks We've done it routinely over the last  ten years for the Reserve Bank of Australia, so routinely that you never hear about it It is rather  hard to turn down the Reserve Bank of South Africa when they ask us to do something that we    6/30-7/1/98  are doing month in and month out for the Australian authorities But for our own account or the  Treasury's account, I haven't heard any proposal floated for intervention in support of the ruble  I'm not sure how I would go about trading that currency But your question was a little more  general, and I defer to Ted Truman or others on whether there are other modes of assistance we  might be giving to the Russians  The intervention in which we participated on June 17 certainly took  the market by surprise We had a much bigger price effect than I and, I think, a number of my  colleagues anticipated Some large speculative players seemed to have been extending their  long-dollar/short-yen positions, and as the yen strengthened from 146, where we entered the  market, down to 142, they had to close those positions That's why we had such a ""pop"" in the  market The market is wary of further intervention Obviously, when people sustain significant  losses on a mark-to-market basis and some of them close their positions, that gets the market's  attention I think the rate went to 142 much faster than most market participants thought it  would They expected it to take longer It is worth noting that the rate has not yet returned to the  previous high of 146    6/30-7/1/98  It peaked this time in the high 142's, briefly touching 143 It is clear  that the market is going to be on guard for further intervention I would be the first to say that  intervention without some message is not going to be very effective, as our South African friends  found when they orchestrated their own intervention The Bank of England joined with us in  trying to warn them that trying to match the speculators dollar-for-dollar without some new  message about what was going on probably would not have much effect In fact, it was  counterproductive That kind of intervention creates the liquidity illusion that speculators can  turn over their positions and get cheap dollars  I should add that in terms of market expectations, the financial world was coming to  an end as of just a week ago, and the Japanese were going to be completely incapacitated in the  view of most foreign exchange traders Clearly, the Japanese have been able to beat those low  expectations! I alluded to some announcements and some comments that they made about  permanent income tax cuts So, the Japanese are beating the expectation that they would do  nothing That, I think, has helped to moderate the yen's movement over the last few days and  has prevented it from going back up to 146 But much remains to be seen between now and the  other side of the Japanese elections I don't have the sense that the market is anticipating any  imminent intervention I think market participants are very curious about further announcements  out of Tokyo I hope that answers your question "
6171,1998-08-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to the package of color charts, which should be on the table in front of you 1/  The first page as usual shows the 3-month deposit rates current, 3-month forward, and 9-month forward Since your last meeting, there have been small but noteworthy changes in interest rate expectations In the United States, the top panel in red, you can see that the 9-month forward 3-month rate has slipped below the current 3-month rate Even though this negative gap is small--a dozen basis points or so--it is the widest on the chart since the January period I think it reflects a growing chorus of voices in the market, particularly in the last 10 days, who are increasingly confident that the Committee's next move will be an easing action  In the middle panel, as you can see, the German 9-month forward 3-month rate also has crept a little lower in recent weeks I think it still reflects the anticipation of an increase in European rates sometime over the coming months I believe it is particularly noteworthy that the 9-month forward 3-month rate is actually trading around levels just above 38 percent where most people just a month ago were expecting the European Central Bank's 1-month policy rate to be set next January So, that reflects quite a reduction in expectations over the last couple of months  1/ Copies of the charts used by Mr Fisher are appended to the transcript (See Appendix)    8/18/98  In the bottom panel in green, you can see that both the 3- and 9-month forward 3-month rates in Japan dropped distinctly below the current 3-month rate following the selection of the new LDP leadership team, but those rates recently have bounced back up a bit  As I look at the last 14 months of interest rate expectations in the leading industrial nations, two things strike me First, the current trepidation in global capital markets is not a consequence of the perception that the leading central banks are about to do anything There is no such expectation Secondly, it strikes me how far markets have come over the last 12 months in giving weight to the risks of deflation, however they imagine them to be A year ago at your August meeting, I introduced my four characters in pursuit of a return, the old and the new paradigm pessimists and optimists At the time I introduced the new paradigm pessimist who was anxious about deflation and global capacity glut leading to competitive devaluations, I think only Governor Kelley had a kind word to say about the new paradigm pessimist who he thought should not be overlooked  Today, at least as the market sees it, the nation with the second largest economy in the world, Japan, and the nation with the largest share of the world's potential labor supply, China, are both experiencing distinctly falling prices Moreover, the premier of China is no longer worrying about maintaining the pace of  investment in order to prevent inflationary bottlenecks Instead, he is now talking about how China is trying to invest its way out of deflation It is this context that I think we should keep in mind in our effort to understand how the markets are looking at the question of whether China will devalue its currency I think that implicitly this question is seen, rightly or wrongly, as representing something of a turning point for the markets--from a world they are familiar with to one they are less familiar with, that is, a deflationary world  Turning to the second page of charts, on the left side are three panels showing foreign equity prices, German and US equity prices, and German and US 10- year yields over the period from last July to the present On the right hand side are three panels depicting the same market movements since the beginning of July this year Markets have gotten a little ahead of me since I prepared this chart, but let me focus on the right hand side first and make a point I think we can see in retrospect that the combination of the Chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony this July and Mr Obuchi's selection to lead the LDP were turning points for global market expectations Now, I want to be very clear In both cases, the outcomes were as the market expected but not as the market hoped Market participants were engaging, I believe, in some wishful thinking, hoping to be pleasantly surprised    8/18/98  With respect to the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, the market was hoping that the Chairman would say something rather kind and benevolent Instead, they heard him say exactly what he said in June at his JEC testimony, namely that he was more concerned about the risks of inflation than those of deflation, and they heard him testify with what might be characterized as a ""make no mistake about it"" delivery With respect to the selection of the LDP leadership and the new Japanese government, again the market was hoping to be pleasantly surprised, thinking that perhaps the Japanese could find their own FDR So far, it does not appear that they have Thus, looking back, I think the market's two self-generated disappointments can be seen as the last sneezes on which the start of the recent equity market declines might be blamed  I do not have charts depicting some of the market movements in the last two days that reflect the Russian devaluation Let me just note that on Friday both the German bund market and our Treasury market experienced some extraordinary inflows There is still a flight to quality into both core Europe and the United States The details are still coming out for the Russian devaluation and debt restructuring announced yesterday Market assessments are that the Russian program is better, at least insofar as can be judged in the first day or so, than they might have feared However, I think there is also a great deal of anxiety about how trades will be settled, and this is causing considerable market commotion The ruble was fixed today at 68 to the dollar, but it is trading around 7, at least in the interbank market But according to the reports that we have, the ruble is already trading around 9 in the black market I do not pretend to understand, and therefore I am not comfortable explaining, how it is that the Dow thinks this is great news while the Bolsa and other emerging equity markets think it is bad news I think we will have to wait a few days to see how this plays out  I would note that the devaluation of the Thai baht had looked pretty good on day 2 also I think we have quite a few risks ahead of us particularly in the days ahead when the collateral that has underpinned much of the leverage in the Russian financial markets starts to be liquidated as counterparties figure out what trades are being settled and what trades are not There is still a great deal of uncertainty there, but I cannot pretend to be up to the minute on these developments  Turning to the third page, you will see three different charts that depict changes in dollar exchange rates since July 1997 In the top panel dollar exchange rates, indexed to last July, are shown against a number of currencies as well as the Bank of England's trade-weighted dollar In the middle panel dollar movements are shown against the yen and the mark The changes are comparably scaled in the middle panel That is, given percentage changes for dollar/mark and dollar/yen are the same on the chart and permit a comparison of how the dollar has moved against the yen vis-a-vis its movements against the mark The bottom panel, again comparably scaled, shows the movements of the yen against the mark since the beginning of July 1997    8/18/98  Given the dollar's movements indicated in the top panel, my point, Mr Chairman, is that we are quite fortunate in my view that the world is not talking about too strong a dollar but rather is focusing its attention on too weak a yen There are some reasons for our good fortune Not the least is the fact that policy inertia is most evident in Japan and that the yen is weak against both the dollar and the mark, as you can see in the bottom panels The fact that the yen is weak against both currencies has translated into a remarkably stable dollar-European currencies relationship over the last year and a half as evidenced by the green line in the middle panel for dollar/mark As I noted a moment ago, investments both in the last few days and over the last few months have been pouring out of emerging markets into core markets This flight to quality is what has made our 30-year yields so low and has reduced German 10-year yields to below 4-1/2 percent Because Europeans historically have been the loudest to complain about too strong or too weak a dollar, I think the relative stability of dollar/mark is obscuring the public's appreciation of the dollar's strength against a lot of other currencies For example, we passed through new highs against the Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar  Another way to think about the strength of the dollar is to look at how stable the dollar/mark relationship has been and to realize that we are in the middle of the period in which, as I would have expected and we hear anecdotally, there are significant flows into Europe in anticipation of the creation of the euro Those flows are not going to occur in January after the euro is a fact, but people are trying to position themselves in anticipation of its creation Again, with bund yields at 41/2 percent, we see that the bund seems to be the happy place to invest in anticipation of a successful launch of the euro and also to hedge against its failure  Turning to the fourth page of charts, you can see in the top panel the September Eurodollar futures contract as it has traded from May to the present and the November fed funds futures contract I want to make two points here First, you can see the slight decline in yields in the last few days as expectations of an ease in policy, not immediately but in the future, have come into the market What I think is much more noticeable in the top panel is how flat and boring these movements have become since your July meeting compared with what they were earlier in the spring There is much less a sense of ""push me/pull you"" in the interest rate markets and expectations have gone very flat without a lot of rate movement  The bottom two panels show something that I depicted several meetings ago, which is the positive carry of on-the-run Treasury issues The on-the-run Treasury yields are shown in the red dots and the blue dots represent the term-to-date financing for each of the on-the-run issues The gap between the two gives some sense of the positive carry that the dealer community and leverage participants are still experiencing in pricing on-the-run Treasury issues I want to make clear that the general collateral rate that applies to most Treasury securities is still close to the funds rate, and therefore there is not as much positive carry for most off-the-run    8/18/98  issues However, the price discovery process is dictated by the on-the-run issues where there is depth, liquidity, and trading volume Even as the yield curve has been squeezed to below the funds rate, you still can see the very modest positive carry in the on the-run issues  Turning to open market operations on the next page, activity in the federal funds market has been mostly uneventful since your last meeting Funds traded at very elevated rates on one day when wire transfer problems bottled up a very large amount of funds at a major money center bank That bank sold funds in the market after the wire was extended Given the very firm rates we saw around the turn from June to July, we tried to anticipate similar pressures at the latest month-end turn from July to August, and we laid in some repos in advance We seem to have succeeded more or less in calming the market in this case Yesterday, we had quite an elevated funds rate, which is not depicted in this chart August 14, the last date shown in the chart, was on Friday, and the somewhat higher range of trading on that day occurred in anticipation of market pressures associated with the settlement of the Treasury's refunding yesterday There was in fact a great deal of pressure in the market yesterday, but that seems to be behind us We made an outright purchase of $1 billion of securities on August 3, and we will be looking for opportunities to make additional permanent injections of reserves in the coming days  One final point, Mr Chairman On the last page of my handout is a list of primary dealers A number of Committee members and others in the System have asked me how many dealers there are You need a scorecard to know the players at present In the top half of the page, you can see the 26 dealers whose status has not changed in the last year On the left side of the bottom half of the page, you can see the list of dealers 27 through 39 as of August 1997 At the bottom, you can see the three withdrawals that have occurred since then Yamaichi, Eastbridge, and Sanwa Sanwa was the most recent firm to withdraw from dealer status They were aware that we thought of them as one of our weaker counterparties, but their decision to close their operations was unlike that of Yamaichi and Eastbridge It was not forced on them by the market or other events but reflected a business judgment on their part A dealer operation was not in the mix of activities that they thought would be profitable for them in New York  In the middle column for August 1998, we have listed the mergers that have been effected to date On the right side, you can see that we expect a couple more mergers to take place and have two pending applications for dealer status I want to make clear that we do not have the ""aspiring dealer"" category, but it still takes some time to work things out with a firm that has approached us to become a dealer  Mr Chairman, we did not conduct any foreign exchange intervention operations during the intermeeting period I will need the Committee's ratification of the Desk's domestic open market operations, and I will be happy to answer any questions    8/18/98  The right answer is that I do not know  It is the only correct answer that I am able to give I think the most  important point is to be very skeptical about the interbank fixing at 68 or 7 rubles to the dollar It is  best to assume that that is a number that someone in the central bank or a couple of banks have  decided to post on the screen I don't know whether there is any volume behind it at all  By definition, we don't know how to measure that We don't even know  whether the black market is experiencing a deep day or a thin day  Yes I'm afraid I cannot help you there, Mr Chairman  That is not an easy question!  I don't think the world or market participants disagree with your  analysis I believe the dominant view is that the yen will grind lower from its current level That  is the market consensus forecast for exactly the reasons you described Now, the market has  gotten itself into a bit of a loop by becoming persuaded that a depreciating yen will force the  devaluation of the Chinese yuan I don't think that follows from a macroeconomic perspective It  is the absence of Japanese demand that is affecting the rest of Asia, not the behavior of the yen per  se, even if that makes things worse But there is a deeply imbedded expectation in the market that  further yen weakness will lead to a devaluation of the yuan and the Hong Kong dollar That is  where the market gets itself into a tizzy and thinks that such an outcome will be the end of the  world as they know it I am impressed by the number of unabashed dollar bulls I talk to who say  that if the Japanese do the right things, if they suddenly find their FDR and start to clean up their  banking sector, the yen will continue to weaken But if they don't get their act together and they  continue to dawdle and delay, the yen is still going to weaken The result would be positive for  the dollar in either case The dollar bulls are unabashed in asserting that view, essentially along  the lines that you outlined It is the Chinese connection that I think causes the anxiety    8/18/98  How is it going to be resolved?  I think they recognize a certain tension there That is true even of those  who assert that the best probabilistic forecast of dollar/yen is that it will go through 150 and keep  going If we ask the same people who make that forecast when they plan to start to ""bottom fish""  and buy cheap Japanese assets, the quick response is that the time to start cost-averaging in is  now They do not see any contradiction there I think that is the traders' answer to your question  They are in effect acknowledging that the turn may occur sooner than they are forecasting, which  itself is ironic  One thing I alluded to is the continuing demand for bunds and  Treasuries, which is indicative of uncertainty The reason for the uncertainty is that investors do  not understand the deflationary world, and the result is a flight of capital The flight is not  motivated so much by a search for quality as it is for certainty, to something investors think they  know how to price As I have said a few times before, 18 months ago I could not find anyone in  Germany who thought Germans would hold 10-year bunds at a yield under 6 percent They saw  that rate as a rigid floor Now the yield is below 41/2 percent Something affecting global investor  sentiment has changed That is how I would put it Now, that is not an entire explanation, but it's  the best that I have  I may be too much of an optimist here, but I think there is a growing  appreciation that credit quality may matter some day  Absolutely In a deflationary world, lenders and investors had better  start figuring out who is going to remain in business because not everyone is going to make it "
6212,1998-09-29," Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to the usual package of colored charts with an FOMC cover and also to three pages of black and white charts showing standard deviation data that I will refer to briefly Those two sets of charts should be in front of you 1/  Looking at the first page of 3-month deposit rates--the current 3-month, the 3-month forward, and the 9-month forward--you can see that the 9-month forward 3-month rate is now trading at a level of about 47 percent, reflecting in my judgment a market expectation and pricing not of a single easing of monetary policy but of a whole series of easings through early next year You can see that these expectations began building after the Committee's last meeting and the contemporaneous Russian devaluation and moratorium They have become much more pronounced in recent weeks  In contrast, the forward rates in Germany and Japan have now collapsed onto the current 3-month deposit rate, so there is no expectation of up or down rate movements in those two countries, just sideways I always like to point to instances when movements in exchange rates are consistent with changes in short-run interest rate differentials I do not want to suggest that the changes in the rate differentials were the only cause of the dollar's slight weakening, but it is gratifying when we find consistency there  At your last meeting, I suggested that market participants were on the edge of their chairs with respect to the risk of a Chinese devaluation of the yuan It turns out that the Russian devaluation and moratorium of the prior  1/ Copies of the charts used by Mr Fisher are appended to the transcript (See Appendix)    9/29/98  day was sufficient to strain, and in some cases nearly to shatter, investor confidence around the world, particularly in fixed income markets  Turning to the second page, we have depicted a series of yields on fixed income instruments Let me work up from the bottom of the page At the bottom, we have the 10-year Treasury note and a Merrill Lynch high grade agency index in yield terms The dark blue line above the red line is the 10-year US swap rate, that is, the fixed component of the ""plain vanilla"" 10-year fixed rate to floating rate interest rate swap The lighter blue line is the Ford Motor Company's 10-year bond and there is a Fannie Mae coupon issue as well  Moving up the page, the middle panel is on the same scale as the bottom panel We are looking at a jump of 150 basis points to get up to this Merrill Lynch index of high yield securities That index covers more than 900 companies rated BBB or lower  The top panel is on a completely different scale in order to fit the JP Morgan emerging market fixed-income index on the same page One reason for presenting this in this form, which I will come back to in a moment, is that a widely emulated trade in the financial markets has been a spread trade It is based on an expectation that spreads would be narrowing between higher yielding credits and, for example, Treasuries You can see here that spreads between the higher yielding issues in the top two graphs and the Treasuries widened considerably after the Russian devaluation on the day before the Committee's meeting in August While some of the yields on higher grade credits are lower in absolute terms, the spreads themselves also have been widening So, trades constructed even against those credits have been under considerable stress despite the fact that their yields in absolute terms have shifted lower  The rush out of emerging market and higher yielding instruments in late August obviously put significant strain not just on those who are carrying higher yielding instruments but on those involved in trading on spreads The result has been an acceleration both of purchases of Treasuries and sales of higher yield securities It is worth noting that while the yields on higher grade credits have come down, at least part of the explanation is an expectation in the market that there will not be the normal pace of new issuance In these very volatile markets, firms that have higher grade credit ratings like the Ford Motor Company are not going to try to price new issues, so some of the reduction in yield is in anticipation of that supply effect Of course, the treasurer of Ford Motor Company is not complaining that yields on Ford's bonds are lower, but he does face more volatile markets The 900 or so companies represented in the Merrill Lynch master index of high yield securities, however, are facing both higher yields and an inability to borrow in these very volatile markets    9/29/98  Turning to the next page, we see another way of looking at similar data In the top panel, we have the 10-year swap spreads that I referred to earlier The panel shows the 10-year fixed leg of a fixed-floating swap against the government bond for the same country--France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States are shown You can see the tremendous widening of these spreads after the Committee's last meeting  The bottom panel, unfortunately, is poorly labeled; it should be called ""swap-spread spreads"" What is depicted here is the difference between the UK swap spread and the French swap spread in blue and between the UK swap spread and the German swap spread in yellow This is a trade that is based on what a number of people have expected to occur--the long-run convergence of the United Kingdom into the EMU Eventually that is going to happen and this is one way to take advantage of that expected event Instead of converging, however, you can see that the spreads have tripled since late August  Yet another way of looking at the same data is reflected in the black and white charts that I have handed out The point here is that the events that have occurred recently in fixed-income markets produced a shock not just for those who have been trading for the last year or two but also for those whose trading goes back as far as June 1992 What we are looking at here is the standard deviation in basis points of these spreads, as measured over 20-day intervals, from the mean for that interval This chart indicates how many basis points need to be encompassed to include one standard deviation For the UK 10-year swap spread, the average 20-day standard deviation from June 1992 through July 31 of this year was 26 basis points As you can see, the prior high for any 20-day period was an average of 95 basis points in 1994, while for the 20-day period through the end of August it was 148 basis points So, we had a huge explosion in the volatility of the swap spreads in August The same essentially can be seen on the second page for the US10-year swap spread  Yes  The 10-year maturity So, we have a 10-year gilt It is a 10-year swap  among the prime bank names, not necessarily British banks; it involves the major players in all  the markets  Yes, in sterling It is that spread we are looking at as it widens out and becomes more volatile I don't need to go through all the data, but you can see essentially the same for the US 10-year spread and the JP Morgan emerging market bond index My point is to underscore that the shock to fixed-income markets that occurred in late August was of considerable significance to the players in the markets and in historical terms  Turning to the next color page--I will try not to dwell long on this--on the left side, we have re-indexed to May 1 a total return, 10-year bond index in blue for the United States in the top panel, Germany in the middle panel, and Japan in the bottom In red, we see the local equity index, in each case also re-indexed to May 1 The obvious point here is that bonds have been a better investment over this period than have equities That may not have required rocket science expertise to figure out! [Laughter]  On the right hand side, we have a measure of volatility Here the blue line is the At-the-Money implied volatility of options on futures of the 10-year bond contracts and the red line is the At-the-Money implied volatility of options on the equity indices, both indexed back to May 1 So, this is the change in the level of the implied volatilities on the futures contracts This shows how extraordinarily implied volatility has increased, particularly for equities Please forgive the lack of JGB data for June and July in the bottom right panel The point here is in part the extraordinary increase in volatility in the equity markets but also how much money an investor might have lost in late August if the investor had written a lot of option contracts in the expectations that volatilities would be coming down The loss could have been an extraordinary sum of money  And some did  Finally, Mr Chairman, in the chart on the last page relating to our open market operations, you can see that fed funds generally have traded uneventfully since your last meeting We did purchase $79 billion on an outright basis, and we will have to make more such purchases because reserve needs have been growing  Finally, we had no foreign exchange operations in the period However, we are working on a number of issues and I would like to mention those One on which we are working with Board staff is that of opening accounts for the European Central Bank on our books and trying to open a Federal Reserve account on their books It is not quite clear what, if anything, we can do with our account on their books We don't know what services they will be offering But in the spirit of bonhomie and camaraderie, we are looking to open an account with the ECB There are a number of technical    9/29/98  issues for them that are proving to be very time-consuming to work out With respect to their accounts with the Federal Reserve, they want to maintain a very complex structure of 13 different accounts for the national central banks as well as for the ECB itself and to have it all under one umbrella We are trying to work that out  We also are working on a number of technical issues related to the advent of the euro that have to do with our payment facilities and how we operate the accounts I am opposed, however, to undertaking any planning at this time of changes in the investment of our reserve holdings I would much rather wait and see how markets develop There may be some diversification options for the management of our deutschemark reserves, but I think the markets are going to be very uncertain and in any event the operational issues are consuming our time at present  Our holdings at the BIS, the Bundesbank, and in German government bonds and German repos are in the wholesale markets where they will all be converted and denominated in euros We would have to resist rather strongly and seek out bankers prepared to help us out if we wished to maintain them technically in deutschemark denominations We have not been resisting that conversion but have been trying to work with the flow  Ted Truman and I have sent you a memo on the status of discussions of the swap arrangements, 2/ and we will be happy to answer any questions about those discussions  Mr Chairman, as I said, we conducted no foreign exchange operations for the System during the intermeeting period I will need the Committee's ratification of our domestic operations during the period, but I would be happy to answer any questions about them  I would fall in your third category, and I'm glad you offered that  option to me As you described it, Mr Chairman, there was some sense of stabilization or  calming in late July when extreme movements in the Bradys and other securities seemed to  moderate I think there was a hope at the time that the IMF program for Russia announced at  that point was going to tide Russia over No one thought that program was going to be the last  word on Russia, but it was seen as a brief sign that things could be held together Over-optimism  about that may have led some to double up their trades In any event, when their confidence was  lost there resulted, through either of the channels you are suggesting, a bigger balloon to explode  or to collapse That is, some nebulous force in the world of financial contagion was closing in or  the official sector did not have an answer Bailout is an answer, but it is not a plausible one for  the whole world, as I think your second alternative was suggesting It doesn't matter for  investors which of the two hypotheses you described is correct; both of them involve an extreme  loss of confidence The market movement itself causes enough losses to concentrate the mind    9/29/98  and begin a delevering process I must say, as a side note to this, that in a meeting in Basle  earlier this month, a number of my fellow central bankers discussed with me their view that  money does not disappear I disagreed When markets delever, money goes away and credit  comes in In the macro sense, one can look at the Japanese money supply; money really is  disappearing in Japan In a shorter-run sense, if the parties financing counterparties take away  the financing, borrower balance sheets shrink and in one sense money is disappearing  Absolutely  Financial wealth can be destroyed Obviously, other people probably  have views on this very important question that you raised  I think one has to think of that in terms of the issuers or borrowers of  debt That is, the role of the financial sector is to take on the financing requirements of people  actually building factories and the like So, the other side may be those who issued bonds and  built factories and did so by borrowing on BBB or worse credit some time ago  The borrowers made money They borrowed at a good rate and they  built nice factories umpteen months ago So, as I see it such borrowers involve a fair number of  those on the other side of these trades It is not a zero sum outcome within the financial sector in  that sense    9/29/98  Yes, some people in the financial community undoubtedly are making  money on the other side  Cathy, clearly there are trades where people on different sides make  money  Yes, I agree with your analysis, though my point to Cathy Minehan  was more limited, namely that initially we have to be careful to separate the financial sector from  those who borrow We might call it the real sector for the moment If we have had years and  years of IPOs and junk bond financing, the real sector has already taken its money and invested it  somehow The financial sector is now faced with a collective writedown of the value of that  paper as the balloon is pricked There will not be an offsetting gain within the financial sector  for every loss within the financial sector as the air comes out of the balloon  I'm not sure what data you are working with I gather your study was  historical  On an historical basis, working from the data in my head, I think that  is right I have not compared the July 1 to September 15 period with other periods What I was  showing you was implied volatility on equity and bond futures, which moved up sharply from  levels in prior months Again, I do not know precisely what an historic comparison would show  Dino Kos just gave me a specific reference that helps to illustrate the  point I think the current level of implied volatility is double the historic; that is a very skewed  result The rush to try to hedge in the options market has been making the options market, which  people rely on, very thin So, I was focusing on that That is a pithy point  Let me first discuss the mechanics There clearly is a lack of supply in  relation to demand, whether it reflects a flight to quality or a closing of the spread trade I think  a number of people in the market are now realizing that they have to shift their basic assumptions  about how to think about the Treasury curve relative to other credits Supply is down, demand is  up, and they have to think of the Treasury curve in a different way As I see it, they started  trading the indexed bond against an internal mental benchmark of how the normal 10-year bond  has traded over the last five years The typical trader, I think, has a 5-year moving average of  recent experience in mind, if they are senior traders The junior traders have a 1-year rolling  average! [Laughter] Traders started out with a presumption of how to price the inflation-indexed  bonds against their notion of a 5-year average of a normal yield curve, and there has been a    9/29/98  sudden shift in that norm, a break in behavior because of the heightened demand and reduced  supply I think they're going to have to work that out Don Kohn may have a more profound  answer  I don't think you should interpret it as a good forecast I don't think  that's what the market is doing I think the trade you are suggesting is a very good one and  might be very profitable for you if you or anyone wants to make it at this moment [Laughter]  The illiquidity of the indexed bonds is notorious The dealers do not  like trading them  I agree with you  I don't think they had an August balance sheet on September 1  They may have had one during the weekend, eight days ago I don't  think anyone had seen one before the weekend of September 19 and 20    9/29/98  Let me try to answer your line of inquiry, Mr Chairman, with a  hypothesis I want to be very clear that this is just a hypothesis On August 31, the firm has a  $125 billion balance sheet against $28 billion of capital, which they have lost Essentially, $125  billion of assets are out under repo There are no assets in the firm One kind of transaction they  are doing with their counterparties is a repo transaction  US Treasuries, Danish government bonds, BBB credits--you name it  There is a fair amount of government credit in these assets, but there  are a lot of other assets also Swap agreements are their instrument of choice, and that is how  they got to a $145 trillion off-balance-sheet position on August 31 By the time we were  looking at that position during the weekend eight days ago, the firm clearly had lost a lot of  capital Other firms that looked at their position in greater detail than we were able to thought  the off-balance-sheet had shrunk to around one trillion dollars by the third week of September  The balance sheet leverage ratio was 55 to 1 by the time we looked The off-balance-sheet  leverage was 100 to 1 or 200 to 1--I don't know how to calculate it Let me try to explain by  way of a hypothesis    9/29/98  A counterparty looking at LTCP and contemplating secured financings involving repo  transactions and a lot of total-rate-of-return swaps and other swap transactions might decide not  to take any initial margin The counterparty would consider itself secure because it had taken  five years of data and seen what the daily and two-day price moves can be It would be  managing its risk exposure on the basis of the same five years of data that the experts at LTCM  were using and had concluded that not all the correlations would go to one Both counterparties  would be using risk management systems--this is now a hypothesis--where they have become  increasingly comfortable with zero initial margin because the daily cash flow is enough to let  them think they only have a 1-day move to consider That is, when they look at five years of  data and a potential 1-day move on that basis, they conclude that they can handle that 1-day risk  On the basis of that same five years of data, the partners inside LTCM have persuaded  themselves that the correlations will never go to one between Japanese, German, and US  government bonds They are making the assumption that they will have a globally diversified  portfolio That in part is how the counterparties also get comfortable with zero initial margin  But from the System's point of view, zero initial margin permits an essentially unlimited amount  of leverage There is no constraint other than exhaustion on the part of counterparties  If I lend $100 to LTCP they give me an asset worth $100 If the  market value of that asset goes up 5 percent today, I give them back $5 dollars; if it goes down 5  percent tomorrow they give me $5 dollars  Right  It was the latter The collateral lost market value  I want to be clear, Mr Chairman We are talking about a balance sheet  of $125 billion and an off-balance-sheet of $14 trillion Now, we know the total was not all    9/29/98  collateralized at 100 cents on the dollar It was only the balance sheet financing that was fully  collateralized  I realize it is notional, but we do not know how to scale the notionals  Let me try to work through some of the sources of the losses that were  discussed Long-Term Capital Management did an analysis of its top 17 counterparties on just  12 trades These represented a very small percent of the hundreds of trades that they had on their  books, but they were their big trades For example, 2 of these 12 had losses of $1/2 billion over  a period of 30 days; there were some offsets involving very complicated transactions The  scenario that LTCM worked out attempted to take into account negative movements in each of  the asset markets That is, if the market moved against the position in the direction where  liquidation was likely to occur, there would be an acceleration of the losses But neither the  people at LTCM nor I nor others who looked at this thought a meltdown scenario was involved  The losses actually were the result of discrete bad days in each of these markets They had  generated a counterparty loss of $28 billion that was spread among the top 17 lenders That was  at a time when the net asset value of the collateral was about $1 billion or $1 billion plus, so  there were $1-1/2 billion or so of losses to be shared among the top counterparties I think a  number of us who eyeballed that analysis thought that it was one thing to focus on just the trades  in question; but if all the trades of those firms were included, this direct loss could rise to $3 to  $5 billion That was a number that the other firms that were actively looking at the numbers also  thought was a plausible forecast of a liquidation scenario involving just the top 17 lenders  I would like to offer one final perspective on the numbers that I  discussed One of the surprises for people who went to look at LTCP's position, myself  included, was the tremendous size of their equity and equity volatility positions People knew  they were dabbling in that sector of the markets, but everyone including a lot of the press had  thought of LTCP as a fixed-income shop Some of the firms who looked at LTCP's position in  more detail than I, who had the weekend to investigate, felt that the preponderance of the  exposure, if one uses the $3 to $5 billion number, that needed to be stabilized was the equity  position and the equity volatility position That's in trades with LTCP in total-rate-of-return  swaps A lesser part of the losses was in the fixed-income financing area So, the bigger risk  was this huge equity volatility position that LTCP had taken on  It was something of a signature for this firm to insist that if a  counterparty wanted to deal with them, there would be no initial margin Not many other firms  have gotten away with that  All this relates to the question of how this financing got to be so big  and nobody realized it was happening "
6260,1998-11-17," Thank you, Mr Chairman I am going to be referring to a package of colored charts that you should find in front of you1/ My report today will be in two parts First, I will discuss market conditions and review domestic open market operations, answer your questions, and seek your ratification of our open market operations After that vote, I will seek your approval on the two special matters identified in the revised agenda  Turning to the first page of colored charts, the top panel shows forward rate agreements in red for the United States While the forward rates have backed up from the lows they reached in late October, both the 3-month forward and the 9-month forward 3-month rates are still trading below 5 percent The 9-month forward rate is still trading slightly below the 3-month forward rate This certainly continues to suggest a decidedly downward slope to interest rate expectations here in the United States  Turning to Germany and its forward rate panel in blue, I would make four points First, it is interesting to note that German forward rates broke below the current 3-month rate following this Committee's September 29 decision to lower rates by 25 basis points Secondly, it is worth at least observing that rate cuts in the periphery of Euroland had no impact on German interest rate expectations Indeed, the German rates have backed up gently and consistently throughout a period of rate cuts by other European countries  Third, much ado has been made of the political pressure on the Bundesbank to lower rates following the German election, but we do not see that in the forward rates At least we don't see any downward or upward movement after the initial break downward in the forward rates following this Committee's action I think there unfortunately is also a certain sense  1 / Copies of the charts used by Mr Fisher are appended to the transcript    11/17/98  of irony in that political outbursts may be preventing both the Bundesbank and perhaps the European Central Bank from making a rate cut that they might be inclined to make absent the political outbursts  Finally, it is worth noting that the German 9-month forward rate is also trading below the 3-month forward rate So, there still is a decidedly downward tilt to interest rate expectations in Germany  In the bottom panel relating to Japan, we can see the rather steady trading in a clump of forward rates around and just below the current 3-month rate, reflecting the Bank of Japan's policy of providing ample liquidity But these narrow ranges, I think, mask a number of other developments in Japanese money markets  If you turn to the second page, in the top panel, you can see one measure of the Japan premium, which is expressed here as the spread between the 3-month Bank of Tokyo/Mitsubishi $LIBOR rate, and the $LIBOR rate fixing in London You can see that the spread is rising much earlier this year than it did last year The real shock that occurred to the Japan premium last November and into the year-end followed the bank closings in Japan This year, we see more of a persistent updrift from the summer through the fall, reflecting I think the broadening and now generalized negative sentiment toward the Japanese financial sector and, more recently this autumn, the effects of risk aversion and credit line cutbacks to Japanese banks by non-Japanese banks  In their search for alternative sources of dollar funding, the Japanese banks have turned away from the Eurodollar market and toward the foreign exchange swap market where they buy dollars and sell yen spot, and simultaneously enter forward contracts to sell dollars and buy yen As the Japanese banks have swarmed into the swap market eager to swap out of yen and into dollars, implicit costs of yen funding have fallen toward and through zero for non-Japanese banks, as you can see in the bottom panel Here, the red line depicts the 3-month yen interbank borrowing rate in Tokyo--the average borrowing rate for Japanese banks--and the green line is the implied yen borrowing rate for non-Japanese banks taken from the prevailing spot-forward swap and $LIBOR rates, assuming covered interest rate parity  The extraordinary movement into negative territory reflects at least two factors There is reduced demand for yen funding in general in global financial markets, with the general delevering and the unwinding of the carriage rate that has been abruptly occurring throughout the fall There also is the increased supply of yen coming into the swap market from Japanese banks looking for dollar funding These two, the demand/supply nexus,    11/17/98  together caused the non-Japanese banks to express their reluctance to take more yen by posting zero or slightly negative yen/LIBOR rates at the fixing in London  Not depicted here but occurring simultaneously is another effect you may have seen reported in the papers, namely the glut of yen in the hands of non-Japanese banks that they now seek to invest to avoid credit risk This is driving Japanese Treasury bill rates toward and through zero, not at the auctions but in secondary market trading  Turning to the top panel of the next page, you can see selected credit spreads in the US markets depicted in various time slices first, at the time of your last meeting; second, just before the intermeeting rate cut; and third on November 13 which was last Friday The table also shows the highs and the lows for this year The simple observation one can make is that spreads are down from their highs and from where they were in mid-October, but they are not down a great deal  The more interesting problem in my view is that it is very hard to judge where spreads should be I don't want to pretend that I have any idea I think that uncertainty is a real problem for the market Most people know and understand that the highs were somewhat uncomfortable Most people understand that the lows of last spring were probably unsustainable But what that means in these rather risk averse year-end funding markets is that the market as a whole has yet another challenge of just trying to find a new equilibrium for these various credit products That in itself is quite a challenge  In the bottom panel, we have depicted the spreads between the top tier and second tier for 90-day and for 30-day commercial paper, with the former spread shown in the blue line and the latter in the red line I should be careful to point out that these spreads are based on indices This panel, in brief, shows the more pronounced than normal year-end effect we are experiencing this year There usually is some year-end aversion to A2/P2 paper This year it is a bit more pronounced than it has been in the past, reflecting the general reluctance to hold the lower grade paper over the statement period at year-end  Turning to domestic operations, we did not do quite as well as I would have liked since your last meeting in containing the fed funds rate around the Committee's target So, I thought this might be a useful time to show you a little about how we assess our own performance On page 4 we have depicted the distribution of daily observations of one standard deviation of the fed funds trading range and of the deviation of the fed funds effective rates from the target On the vertical axis, we have a measure of volatility    11/17/98  expressed in terms of the number of basis points of the trading range contained in one standard deviation On the horizontal axis, we have similarly measured the negative or positive divergence of the daily effective rate from the Committee's target, expressed as zero Each dot represents one day The red dots represent days when we know there is going to be some difficulty because of high payment flows, such as a quarter-end, a month-end, a maintenance or a coupon settlement date The blue days are all other days The period here is for the year through the end of July of this year  In the upper right-hand corner, you can see the little red dot for last June 30 when the effective rate was almost 160 basis points above the target and one standard deviation of the trading range was almost 350 basis points As you may recall, that day was a rather volatile day Luckily for us, most of the other observations are clustered much more tightly around zero, which indicates the Committee's target This cluster is depicted on the next page, where we take the same sample of data for the same 12-month period within the constrained range of approximately 50 basis points  The two small boxes drawn on the chart depict the two smallest areas in which we can contain 25 percent and 50 percent of the observations, respectively Luckily for us and gratifyingly, the 25 percent box falls exactly plus or minus 1/16 percentage point around the Committee's target, the 50 percent box being of course somewhat larger This gives us some notion of the norm for the calendar year through the end of last July as a comparison for how we have done in the last few months  On the next page, we show in the same constrained range the data from August 1 through last Friday, distinguishing two subperiods within this more recent period The hollow dots are for the August 1 to September 28 subperiod and the filled-in dots for the September 29 through November 13 subperiod The contents of the two boxes are summarized in the lower left- hand corner of this chart You can see there that from August 1 to September 28, we got about 30 percent of the observations inside the 25 percent box and 58 percent inside the 50 percent box Now, this included the period of late August and September when there was considerable volatility and convulsion in global financial markets, but that disturbance did not flow through to the funds market However, in the next period from September 29 through last Friday, we had a much tougher time Only 19 percent of the observations fell within the 25 percent box and only 25 percent within the 50 percent box It is rather hard to avoid the conclusion that the market conditions that have prevailed since your last meeting indicate at the very least that we have not lived up to our own standard that we set during the prior year    11/17/98  On the next page, there is a chart that I normally show you to illustrate conditions in the federal funds market In the top panel, the green dashed line is the Committee's target, the blue vertical lines represent the federal funds trading range on each day, the red horizontal tick is the daily effective rate, and the red vertical line shows one standard deviation of the fed funds trading range In the bottom panel, the blue bars depict on the left-hand scale the daily excess reserves we in fact provided to the banking system, and the red dots indicate on the right-hand scale the deviation of the daily effective federal funds rate from the target  Looking at both of these panels at the same time but focusing on the top panel, two background factors came into play that I think are useful for you to note First, there was a rather significant shift of volume into the fed funds brokered market in late September and October This shift reflected a cutting back of credit lines and a general aversion to risk in the term funding markets by both buyers and sellers On the lending side, there was an aversion to lending money at longer term and over year-end, and that created a reluctance to post offers On the buying side, there was an aversion to be seen placing bids high enough to attract the limited amount of money the other side was willing to sell--a reluctance to post bids So, we saw a literal thinning out of the market, with a paucity of offers and bids and a consequent shift of both demand and supply to the overnight market But the rush of this volume into the overnight market induced the kinds of behavior patterns that contributed to volatility  The second consistent background factor during this period was that the major banks that normally would be willing to act as two-way traders tended to hold on to funds through most of the day in this period They were willing to sell those funds late in the day at very low rates, which they viewed as the expected cost of minimizing the risk that they might have to come to the discount window This was true not only of banks that were subject to rumors Discount window aversion affected the full range of depository institutions  The first challenge we faced after the rate cut at the September 29 meeting was the month- and quarter-end on September 30 when markets usually are quite tight You can see that we had a wide trading range and a firm market on that day We supplied reserves in an effort to lean against the market's firmness on that day and on subsequent days when the firmness seemed to carry over The resulting excess reserves led to the soft rates that were hard to counter toward the close of that period  During the second maintenance period, it was widely assumed that the intermeeting announcement of lower rates at 315 pm on October 15 reflected an abrupt action to deal with one or two troubled institutions This    11/17/98  then caused an extreme level of discount window aversion over the subsequent days, particularly as you can see in the chart on October 16, 19, 20, and 21 We faced a trading range that was consistently above the target, the blue line, during the morning on those days as banks held on to as many reserves as they could to avoid late day surprises and the risk that they might have an overdraft on their reserve account Once they reached a comfort level where they felt they were not likely to see an overdraft at the end of the day, they were all willing to sell their funds in the market at quite low rates The surplus reserves we had been providing to lean against the heightened rates then began to show through  I should acknowledge that during this period we were reluctant to be stingy late in the period for fear that a negative miss on our part might spike the funds rate upward or force a reluctant bank to the discount window That would make it even harder for us to lower the rate to the intended level on subsequent days We faced similar difficulties around the October month-end, which was in the next maintenance period, but as you can see on the chart market conditions may now be stabilizing It is my hope that we can do better, but I think, to be candid, that we may continue to face an extreme form of discount window aversion and some volatility through year-end and into January  Finally, I would like to discuss a few matters relating to our outright operations We have reduced the size of our normal purchases of Treasury coupon securities that we do at one time to about $600 or $700 million In the relatively illiquid conditions we have seen, going into the market for smaller and smaller bites at any given time means that we cause less and less disruption in the market I am quite pleased that despite the volatile conditions we have experienced, our operations have become something of a non-event That is precisely the objective toward which I have been aspiring  A second item I want to mention--and give you an opportunity to express an opinion, if you wish--is my intention to purchase inflation- indexed securities in our outright operations We have not been purchasing such securities in the secondary market We have been acquiring them at auction I know that when we began doing so, a couple of members of the Committee expressed a degree of reluctance, wondering why the Federal Reserve needed inflation protection [Laughter] I would like to be clear We do not buy them because we need inflation protection We buy them because the Treasury issues them The general asset class involved in all our purchases is US government credit As the Treasury has shrunk the size of its bill issues, we have not been able to purchase bills in the same proportion to coupon securities as we did in the past We do not purchase agency securities outright We accept them in repo, and I have no particular    11/17/98  desire to acquire them on an outright basis But if we should have the good fortune to confront federal government surpluses going forward, we are going to face the challenging question of finding new asset classes to add to SOMA over time So, as long as the Treasury is issuing indexed securities, I think it is useful for us to buy them at least in rough proportion to their issuance by the Treasury  I mention this because as an operational matter, it doesn't make any sense for us to purchase the indexed issues at the same time we're buying the regular coupon securities We cannot judge the relative value of regular coupons and indexed securities So, to make this operationally practical, I propose to go into the market and do a mini pass of the entire index yield curve I suppose we would start out by purchasing around $300 to $500 million I'm not entirely sure how much we might purchase in a mini pass of the index yield curve For every $5 to $7 billion that we purchased of regular coupon securities, we would periodically conduct one or two passes to buy a small tranche of the indexed securities benchmarked against each other to allow us to make some relative value choices about the prices the dealers were showing us But I did not want to do this without informing you in advance and giving you an opportunity to express your views on the subject  Mr Chairman, we had no foreign exchange intervention operations during the period I will need the Committee's ratification of our domestic operations I would be happy to answer any questions on any aspect of my report, but I think our plan is to seek a vote on the ratification and then go on to the two special items  That is a very good question, and I wish I had a precise answer to it I  think that it is important to look at the last two months I didn't talk a lot about the big move in  the dollar/yen that we had That was an extraordinary event, obviously, in terms of the standard  deviation of the move It was also an extraordinary event in terms of the factors that came into    11/17/98  play One major fund began to move rapidly out of a series of positions as has been reported in  the markets Other funds then had positions that triggered--  This was the unwinding of the yen-carry reversal and a move down in  the dollar/yen  Right! I see the big move down in the dollar/yen as just a reflection of  the delevering That delevering was going on in many places, and one place where it showed up  was in the dollar/yen exchange rate The latter then triggered a series of extraordinary  movements that developed into a big technical move down, forgive the term In the general  back-up of the dollar against the yen in markets dominated by considerable uncertainty and  reluctance to take risks, I think we were seeing precisely the effect that I believe you are trying to  explain The glut of yen has been spilling over gradually and not in the shocking way in which  the downward move occurred But we are getting a move back up in the dollar The market has  gone from 111 back to the 120-123 range If we were not looking at that against the standard of  a move from 124 down to 111, the size of this move back up would seem impressive  Yes  There is something of a ""Catch-22"" about the liquidity issue I'm  particularly sensitive to that issue because, while Wright Patman was free to have his views, one  of the jobs the Committee has assigned to me is to worry about what I would do if I had to sell  large amounts of securities within a short period of time What if I have to make changes to the  System's balance sheet along the lines that we talked about a couple of years ago? In that  context, I feel I need to be as diversified as possible among the full range of assets that I am  allowed to hold, so that I will have maximum flexibility in the event that I have to shrink the size  of the SOMA portfolio to a major extent We currently hold about 30 percent of the Treasury  bills outstanding, about 10 percent of the coupon issues outstanding, and 5 percent of the  index-linked securities outstanding Now, the share of Treasury bills in SOMA has been    11/17/98  declining recently because I can not in good conscience, and the Treasury is rather  uncomfortable as well, continue buying such large amounts of Treasury bills as to dry up the  supply in the public market So, I am constrained on the bill side  On the coupon side, our operations currently are geared toward trying to smooth out  our holdings so we will have roughly a 10 percent share across the coupon spectrum Once we  have reached a smooth distribution across all maturities, then we will have to step up our  purchases of coupon securities In my discussions with the dealers, I tell them that they are  responsible for fostering a deep, liquid market; and, in turn, they suggest that I also have some  responsibility in that regard Now, you may feel that this is a camel's nose coming into the tent  but if the System, having purchased Treasury indexed securities at auction, were never to  purchase them in outright operations, the market would see that as a rather big black eye for  those securities But I'm not sure I want to be providing such a negative signal to the market  about a type of security that the US Treasury is offering  Consistent with the spirit of your concern, President Jordan, I want to proceed very  carefully I certainly have no intention of holding a larger share of the outstanding indexed debt  than I do of the regular coupon debt, and I would move in that direction very gradually and  episodically However, I have a problem in terms of the asset classes that I hold, and I feel some  constraint on where I should go And as you and I were discussing before the meeting, it will  only get worse next year in the Y2K environment So I'm feeling somewhat hemmed in, and if  people have alternative solutions for me, I am all ears  You would have to authorize me to do that I think! It is a choice of  asset class  The discount window aversion is probably the message Don Kohn  and I have been working for several years with the discount officers in the System We have  been talking with money center banks, trying to get them away from the discount window  aversion that was prominent in the late 1980s and early 1990s We have seen all our good work  evaporate in a very short period of time The problem is that the people who were the CFOs  eight years ago are now the chairmen of the big banks So, they have been there and it didn't  take much of a scratch of the old wound to have it all come back It will be interesting to see  whether this is just a year-end effect or we are really going to see a new round of discount  window aversion    11/17/98  Yes  Yes, absolutely There is going to be a headline effect When I enter  the market to do a coupon pass exclusively for TIPS, it will generate a certain amount of news I  have the authority to do this, but I didn't want to do it without informing you in advance  That's why I'm raising the issue  If I can first respond a little further to President Poole, I then will  address your question, Governor Kelley The Treasury knows in advance what we are going to  be buying They make the decision regarding the size of a floating supply they want to have  Part of their decision is based on knowing what we will tend to hold on average along with a  recognition that our securities lending program gives a little elasticity to the floating supply By  the way, I'm going to be coming to the Committee in the near future to seek some changes in the  lending program  The Treasury's reaction to the question of our participation in the first TIPS auction  was one of encouragement We wanted to participate so that we would have securities to lend  out, to provide elasticity to the public supply as a means of avoiding the problems of squeezes  and so forth We are not interfering with the Treasury's judgment about what the floating supply  should be, and I don't think we're going to make a big difference in the liquidity of the market  by buying $300 or $400 million periodically That is not going to be a big issue However, it    11/17/98  already is a big issue that we have not bought any So I see the shoe as being on the other foot,  at least from where I sit, Governor Kelley Dealers are asking the Treasury, and occasionally  me, why the Treasury and the Fed are not doing more to promote these securities when the  Treasury requires that dealers bid on them in auctions But I take your point We can not make  this market liquid all by ourselves It's up to the market to create the liquidity  We are part of the US monetary authority and the largest holder of  US Treasuries The dealers view our periodic coupon passes, through which we expand our  holdings of securities, as a normal part of our support for the Treasury market And our  purchases are seen by the dealers as a process that thins out their inventories of securities  We will be adding a fair amount permanently to the System portfolio  over the next 30 days It would be nice to make the purchases in the next 30 days, but we will  see how it goes It is not vital I think you've made a very good suggestion, Chairman  Greenspan  There are very few foreign central banks that have the kind of  permanent portfolio that we have There is also information from the UK and other countries  about their experience with inflation-indexed securities I don't think it is going to be apropos  central bank operations  I need a vote on my operations during the period  I have two other items, which I hope can go a little more quickly  First, I need a vote authorizing renewal of our swap agreements with the Bank of Canada and the  Bank of Mexico By my silence and your inaction, all our other swap arrangements would lapse    11/17/98  as described in Mr Truman's memo and my memo to you of September 28 This is consistent  with what we have discussed in recent years Karen Johnson is working with other central banks  to insure that the announcement of this action in the FOMC minutes that will be released shortly  after the December meeting will be consistent with statements that might be issued by other  central banks That issue is still being worked on With regard to the second item, I am seeking  your approval of an amendment to the Domestic Authorization to allow repo operations of up to  a 60-day maturity This was explained in my memo to you of November 10 I would be happy  to answer questions on either of those two items I seek your vote on both  If I may add, our Canadian colleagues, who face the Quebec issue at  this moment, feel even more acutely than the Mexicans that this is not the time to let go of those  swap lines    11/17/98  We certainly have that in mind  It is very much about solving a problem for me, though the dealers are  comfortable with the notion, so in that sense there is reciprocity here We had been discussing  this long before the emergence of the credit market conditions of the last two months We had  been thinking about this particularly in terms of Year 2000 problems when we expect a rather  large increase in the demand for currency, which we hope will run off rather quickly But it is  also something that Sandy Krieger and I have talked about for several years in terms of the  difficulty that we sometimes have in getting collateral for shorter maturity RPs When we have a  hard time getting collateral for a large volume of two- or three-day repos, we often find that the  dealers are willing to offer a lot of collateral for 10-day operations That has led us to believe  that it might be worthwhile to try to do a 20-day or 25-day repo to meet occasional longer-term  peaks, and in the case of the year-end, maybe 30- or 45-day RPs This would let us to lay a  foundation by doing occasional smaller operations at longer maturities, so that we would not be  put in a bind in the infrequent circumstances when we need to do a big operation for which we  cannot get enough short-term collateral I want to be clear that it doesn't happen very often that  we get insufficient propositions from the dealers, but I think it should never happen and it is not  a situation I want to be in I am proposing it now because I want to practice this year-end before  I come to year-end 1999  First, I think it is important that we are working in the repo market, not  in the fed funds market There are very different dynamics involved There are different supply  and demand dynamics for funds and securities Secondly, I do not think we are going to affect  the term structure; we are price takers; we do not set a price The dealers know there is risk  involved if the Desk does a 30- or 60-day operation and there's an FOMC meeting during that  interval And they are going to price accordingly That also is relevant to our outright open  market operations vis-a-vis TIPS; we hold an auction We do not publish the price at which we  operate in the repo market The dealers attempt to discover the stopout rate, but I don't want that  to be an issue and so we don't publish it Their estimates of stopout rates reflect only rumor and  gossip You are raising a good issue, but I think we are unlikely to affect the term structure, and  we certainly have no desire to do so "
6283,1998-12-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to the four pages of colored charts you should find in front of you 1/ Beginning on the first page with the deposit rates, you can see by the red lines in the top panel that the US forward rates are little changed since your last meeting But it is worth noting that both the 3-month and the 9-month forward rates continue to trade below the current 3-month deposit rate, suggesting some expectation of an ease coming in the first half of next year, but without much specificity to it The two forward rates are trading on top of one another, so it does not look as if they imply a series of easings, but some further easing seems to be priced in here  Looking at the German forward rates, you can see that those rates partially anticipated, in late November and into early December, the December 3 rd Euroland rate cut And the forward rates continued to drift a little lower after that Also, the forward rates in Germany are trading below the current 3-month rate, suggesting again some expectation of an easing in the coming year You can't see it in this chart, but let me note that there is very little evidence of greater year-end pressure this year than last year in German funding markets It does seem to be worth noting, given the coming of the euro that the markets do not seem to have priced in any extraordinary year-end effect That is also in contrast to the pronounced year-end effect we are seeing already for the year after next--for the year  1/ Copies of the charts used by Mr Fisher are appended to the transcript    12/22/98  2000 So there's not much special pressure in German funding markets surrounding the anticipation of the euro  In the bottom panel showing the Japanese rates, you can see that on this scale, which is comparable to the top two panels, the deposit rates show a barely detectable rise But, as small as it is here on this chart, by Japanese standards this really is noticeable Let me say that I think we have found too many, rather than too few, explanations for this gentle backing up in Japanese money market rates whether it's that the economy is expected to bottom out in the first half of the year or that the yields on Japanese government bonds (JGBs) are backing up, as I will get to in a moment, or that the Bank of Japan is not being quite so generous in its provision of reserves None of the explanations is entirely satisfactory to me, but there clearly has been a gradual backup in Japanese money market rates  Turning to the second page, the three panels give something of a review of the last six months in financial markets In the top panel, we have major exchange rate pairs indexed to 100 as of July 1st It shows marks per dollar, yen per mark, and yen per dollar, and their percentage change over the last six months  In the middle panel are the three major equity indices, also indexed to July 1st at 100 In the bottom panel, for the moment please ignore the red line which depicts the JGB yield; I will come back to that shortly But the other three colored lines in that bottom panel show various spreads as they have traded from July to the present  My point in bringing these three panels together is to show that there were really two very distinct episodes of delevering, which occurred roughly in the weeks following the Committee's August and September meetings There has been a third more modest delevering event in the last few weeks associated with the year-end The very pronounced decline in both the mark and the dollar against the yen seen in the top panel coincided with the significant turmoil in early October You can see in the bottom panel that the three triangles point to the peak spreads reached also early in October In the middle panel you can see where equity markets, at least in Germany and Japan, reached their nadirs during that period, and the Dow almost reached its nadir and began coming back  More recently, there has been some gradual decline in the dollar against the yen, but it has been relatively muted, more or less associated with year-end thinness, with some reversal of that move in the last day or so Also in the bottom panel you can see that swap spreads and the on-the-run/off-the-run spread have backed up a little I would emphasize the thinness of markets rather than anything else here But in the middle panel you can see the somewhat manic behavior of our equity markets It    12/22/98  seems to me rather pronounced and in contrast to the events in the other markets  Focusing now on the red line in the bottom panel, which depicts the benchmark Japanese government bond yield, in the last few days--and since your last meeting in fact--there has been an extraordinary backup in this yield The bond was trading at a yield of around 80 basis points at the time of your last meeting or just before It traded at 150 basis points yesterday It was off a further 40 basis points earlier today, or up to 190 It has come back a little from that level, having traded the limit down today both in the Tokyo and London futures markets, and it is now at about 180 basis points  The Japanese government first began leaking and then yesterday announced its borrowing plans for the coming year, which in their forecast will amount to roughly a 65 percent increase in the amount of Japanese government bonds to be absorbed by the public portfolio--that is, by private sector demand The bond market has begun to price this in  Back in September Japanese banks were given a choice by the Ministry of Finance either to treat their bonds on a mark-to-market or on an original cost basis Most of the banks, virtually all, elected to do it on an original cost basis In my view, that simply is going to delay the day of reckoning as yields back up, given that the holdings of JGBs on the balance sheets of all kinds of financial intermediaries are rather significant as a credit substitute As the yields back up and approach the average cost of any one institution's JGBs, that institution will have an extraordinary incentive to sell out its positions That already seems to be under way and is providing something of a continuing accelerator for the backup in Japanese government bonds Given the extraordinary scope of this backup in just a couple of days, I think it is reasonable that the US and European bond markets have been backing up a little, as Japanese accounts experiencing these losses are off-loading some of their holdings of US and other fixed- income instruments  Now, all this is in anticipation of the rather exciting year Japanese government bond markets are going to have in 1999, so we have that to look forward to We in all likelihood have the specter, in my humble opinion, of the Ministry of Finance trying to change the accounting rules again at the end of the fiscal year if these losses become too extreme on insurance company and bank balance sheets  Turning to domestic operations on the next page, the funds market has been a little less stable than normal, but there has been some improvement over the last intermeeting period in terms of some reduction in the extreme volatility This chart is similar to the one I presented at your last meeting On the vertical axis are the basis points contained within one standard    12/22/98  deviation of the daily trading range, and on the horizontal axis is the basis point variation of the daily effective rate from the target The hollow dots represent observations in the intermeeting period between your September and November meetings The filled in dots represent days since your last meeting And as I did last time, I have summarized in the lower left-hand box the results, roughly speaking, against the benchmark period of the prior year before August  As you can see, while we had fewer days with very low volatility, where trading was in a tight range around the expected rate, we had roughly the same number of days within the 50 percent box Without counting the dots, let me point out a different way of looking at this In the September- to-November period, fully 1/3 of the days observed had a standard deviation of greater than 4, whereas in the more recent period only 1/6 of the days had a standard deviation of more than 4 So we haven't come to the point of a quiet market, but we have reduced some of the extreme volatility I think this has been caused by a reduction in credit concerns and some greater access to term funding markets, which have opened up to a wider number of participants Also, early in this intermeeting period we leaned rather heavily against firmness, being quite generous in our reserve- supplying operations, and when we began to take that away from the market, it actually took the market a while to figure that out They assumed, perhaps, that we were being more generous than we in fact were  On the last page I have shown the comparable data for the same period exactly one year ago I would note that the red dots represent the days with high payment flows--tax payment dates, bond settlement dates, or maintenance period settlement dates They are really the days when one would expect to see the higher volatility, and that is what we see here In the 1997 period the dots on normal days are much more densely clustered than in the comparable period this year, where we see a mix of blue and red dots at the higher volatilities, indicating the higher volatility we still are facing But I think that has calmed down somewhat  Let me note that we did conduct a pass to purchase indexed securities and we also undertook three longer-term repo operations These elicited relatively little market reaction and went much as I had hoped We already have $12 billion in repos on the books for the turn of the year, which will help us unwind automatically as reserve needs diminish after the peak year-end period  Mr Chairman, we had no foreign exchange intervention operations during the period We have completed the renewal of our swap arrangements with our Mexican and Canadian colleagues, but all our other swap arrangements have lapsed I will need two votes, however I have circulated to the Committee a request to add the euro to the currencies in    12/22/98 5  which we are authorized to operate I would propose to come back to you at a meeting early in the new year to discuss removing the legacy currencies But for the moment I thought we would leave those alone So, I am seeking a vote to add the euro to the foreign currency authorization I will also need ratification of our domestic operations I would be happy to answer any questions  My understanding is that once the price of the JGBs declines below the  cost at which they were purchased, the banks will have to recognize a loss  It is cost or market, whichever they chose They were given a choice  Virtually all chose cost I may be wrong, but I went over this with the Ministry of Finance  representative in New York just yesterday, and my understanding is that once the market price  reaches cost, the banks will then have to recognize a loss  That's right But I think the way they will view this is not on a  bond-for-bond basis They will look at the average cost of their JGB portfolio And as the  market price approaches that level, they will want to be liquidating the portfolio before the  breakeven point is pierced  Well, would it surprise you if that were--  I have not found an acceptable explanation of that myself It is  something I have tried to follow So my first response is that I see it as a bit of a mystery I  think it's especially a mystery if you realize that these swap spreads, as most of us measure them,  are from a common panel of major international banks So the difference in spreads should be a  credit issue, but it is hard to pull that out when one is looking at a common panel of global  players who are the ones we look to for quotes on these swap spreads That mean that is  somehow embedded in--I don't even know how to express it No term comes to mind to express  this; I'm at a loss    12/22/98  There are some in the market who think that European central banks  are active in this market  Yes, that would be  It is coming in through the demand side rather than the supply side, if  you will But I have not interrogated my foreign central bank counterparts enough to determine  this  Yes, I may be able to do so  Yes, we will try to look into that further  You saw a rather significant 1-hour reaction, President Poole I think  the 1-day and 3-day and 3-week reaction was rather muted So, my first point is that trying to  measure this on a minute-by-minute basis involves working with too short a time horizon My  second point is that I really do not understand the logic of your position We are active  occasionally in purchasing securities on the other side of this spread whose purity you care  about; we purchase 30-year and 10-year and 5-year nominal bonds If what you care about is the  clarity of the spread, the logical position is that we should operate either on both sides of that  spread or on neither I do not see the logic in suggesting that we should operate on only one side  of the spread I view the market reaction to which you refer as a short-term reaction to our first  purchases of these securities I would expect an abrupt reaction on the first day we operate in  any new area of the market But I think it largely disappeared and was very hard to find on  subsequent days  That is one thing we look at; it is not the only thing We are also  looking at our holdings of securities and trying to keep a balanced portfolio across the whole  yield curve That is really the first order of importance  No, I disagree with you completely on that That is precisely why I  wanted to do a TIPS-only pass So the only relative value statement we would be making would  be vis-a-vis other TIPS issues Thus, when we purchased TIPS I would make a judgment as to  the rough order of magnitude, how many hundreds of millions should be purchased Then the  traders' judgments are restricted to making a relative value choice across the range of TIPS  propositions they are given That's precisely so we will not be making a comment on the  appropriate spread relative to the nominal yield "
6307,1999-02-02," Yes, let me mention a few points, if I may The Committee   reviews the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations at the first meeting   each year I have proposed an amendment to the Authorization for the Committee to   consider You have a rather lengthy memo from me on the subject There are a few   points I would like to try to cover again I think I could have done a better job in the   memo in providing a clearer contrast between the existing program and the proposed   program Let me try to do that very briefly   Under the current program we lend securities for one week We do it in   accordance with the rather low limits on bills and coupon securities as described in the   memo We charge a flat fee of 150 basis points, regardless of the security’s current   value in the market, and there is a prohibition on short selling That is, we are not   supposed to lend to dealers who have sold the security short, even though that is   virtually impossible for us--and in some cases for the dealer--to determine with   accuracy   A major change we are proposing is that instead of charging a flat fee, we would   hold an auction with a minimum reserve fee of 100 basis points In effect, for the   dealers who want the security, this provides an allocation mechanism that involves   something other than a first-come first-served, helter-skelter basis of who calls the Desk   first An auction is also a mechanism that allows us not to waste public assets, so to   speak That is, when we charge a flat fee of 150 basis points for something that is worth     2/2-3/99 4   more than 150 basis points “on special” in the Treasury financing market, we are giving   away System property, if you will, by accepting less income than the System could   receive   The second change that we are proposing is in the limit structure Instead of the   rather low limits, higher limits are proposed, as explained in the memo The most   important shift is from the one-week term of the lending to overnight lending I don’t   think I underscored quite enough in the memo what an important shift that would be I   have previously described to the Committee my concern that any change in this program   should not simply move both the demand and supply curves out equally That would not   accomplish very much The longer we thought about this, the more we realized that the   willingness of dealers and market participants to short securities is really based on term   financing No one shorts a security and plans to finance it through a series of overnight   borrowings They think in terms of one-week or longer time periods when they are   trying to finance their short sales That is where the demand and supply for shortening   securities come from By limiting the System’s lending to an overnight program where   transactions occur only at noon, which is rather late in the day, I think we would do a   better job of providing a lending facility that addresses clearing issues and keeps the   market moving, without encouraging dealers to short securities We are trying to stand   apart from short selling activities   On the 25 percent limit that I suggested we begin with, we would actually be   lending less than we are lending currently, as a rough-cut calculation I noted that I   would clearly expect to raise that limit somewhat as I saw increased demand, but I   certainly would not do so without talking to this Committee As I also indicated in the   memo, it is hard to imagine raising that limit at any one auction to anything higher than   50 percent of our total holdings in an issue   We think of the proposed program changes as enhancements that will better   enable us to achieve our existing objectives These changes are designed to provide a   little grease for the clearing mechanism and to enable the dealers to avoid some of the   games that go on when a security is so scarce that borrowing it has essentially the same   cost as failing to cover Then people may not try to cover shorts at all and that creates   some perversions     2/2-3/99 5   That is the nature of the proposed program As we have designed it, it is still   intended to be a limited program I would be happy now to answer any questions about   what I have just said or about any aspect of the memo that I circulated to the Committee   It certainly was not my intent that any aspect of the program   would suggest anything about the maturity structure of the portfolio; and if the memo   suggests that, I want to correct that misimpression In fact, the demand for borrowing   comes as much from the bill sector as the coupon sector So, I really think this proposal   is independent of the structure of the portfolio We could talk about that, and we have in   the past, but I think this proposal stands apart from that debate     2/2-3/99 6   On your second point, we have tried to establish a set of rules that will avoid our   using any discretion I am not sure I would characterize the issue as involving a moral   hazard problem I want a set of rules that will enable this procedure to operate every day   without our having to make any discrete decisions affecting prices or changing our   behavior If we were to change any of the program’s major features, the big change   would be to move from overnight lending to, say, one-week lending I would imagine   that in a situation like the Drexel crisis, we would have to come back to the Committee   to propose such a change I would add that we probably have had a rather bizarre, if   marginal, impact on current prices by giving away the scarcity value of the securities to   whatever dealer happens to call the Desk first in the morning So, while the lending   program clearly has some impact on the price-setting process, I think the open auction   feature of the new program will result in a more transparent and less egregious impact   on prices   The short end of the market currently is not very deep, though I   know we all come with habits of mind about “relative to what” In fact, the bill market   is as tight as a drum, and the Treasury supports the proposed change As I have noted a   couple of times, we have a bit of “after you, Alphonse” on whose proposal this is They   do not want to be telling us to do it or not to do it Their interest in this actually is   focused on the short end because the bill sector is so tight that if we decide to lend a   little more in that area, they think that would be helpful That conclusion is based only   on my conversations with Treasury officials As I pointed out in the memo, if we had   wanted to get out of this business in the late 1980s and early 1990s on the grounds that   the market was very deep and liquid and we really didn’t need to lend securities, that   could have been a compelling argument But we have seen a decline of 25 percent in the   number of primary dealers in the last two years Issue size is contracting As I will   discuss later in the day, the spread between the on-the-run and the twice off-the-run 30-  year bond is still at 20 basis points This moment in history, when the markets are going     2/2-3/99 7   through this supply-shock transition, would seem to be a rather awkward time to say   these markets are deep and liquid and can take care of themselves That would be my   counter to the argument you are making   At the extreme, one is worried about--I hope I can get all of my   signs right--the problem that arises when the specials price approaches zero That   occurs when a security is so scarce that to get me to lend the security to you, you have to   give me the cash collateral for free At the Desk, we lend bonds against other bonds as   collateral because cash collateral would drain reserves from the banking system and we   want to avoid that; however, the market practice is to use cash collateral Once the   specials rate goes to zero, everyone in the market who has a short position in that   security is encouraged to “fail” There is then a tendency for the problem to escalate   because those who have an obligation to unwind short positions and deliver the     2/2-3/99 8   securities to others have an economic incentive to do nothing and create a series of   “fails”--failures to settle The multiplier effect kicks in and worsens the adverse market   impact The result is a series of fails that generally make life miserable and divert   attention from price discovery to back offices and lead to settlement shortages and   unsecured positions And this situation creates other perverse incentives I imagine you   get the picture So, at the margin we are trying to reduce the frequency with which that   happens   When I first brought up this issue at the May meeting last year, I think it was   President Hoenig who asked me whether we could do all this discreetly Could we just   lend securities when it looked as if we were on the cusp of a problem?  But as we   thought long and hard about it, that seemed to pose the moral hazard issue that we are   now discussing What is the right specials price? That is, we would be deciding when   to interject ourselves, and we would end up intervening in the Treasury market in a   manner similar to our intervening in the foreign exchange markets, trying to pick a level   and decide when to intervene We don’t want to go that route That would create big   problems for us So, if we want to have some impact on the margin, we think the better   way is to use this lending device and do what we can with our large supply of securities   Now, in the spirit of this, let me be clear This relates to what Don said With   the hats that the Committee and the Treasury have given me, I am engaged in market   surveillance to prevent the next Salomon Brothers episode from happening I go around   giving talks to dealers, telling them that if they have a long position, they ought to be   lending it back into the market Well, we have a long position and a lot of securities If   we are concerned about the smooth functioning of the markets and if we think good   behavior of portfolio managers involves being on both sides of the market to help keep it   deep and liquid, then I think we have a duty in that regard, too We really live in the   financing market That is where our operations are And I think we owe something to   the market to help keep it as liquid as possible So, that is the positive reason I have   also described what we will be trying to avoid, which is the risk of fails and specials   rates approaching zero That happens from time to time, and I don’t want to say that we   are going to prevent that from happening But at the margin should we be leaning   against that with our large portfolio?  I’d say “yes”     2/2-3/99 9   Let me go back to the bills we now hold in our portfolio Having sat still and not   bought a bill in a bill pass for a couple of years, we have gone from owning 23 percent   of bills outstanding to 30 percent That illustrates how much Treasury issuance has   contracted So, in the bill sector in particular, we may really have something to offer in   terms of trying to keep the market liquid And that market does indeed have a very close   connection to the money market in which we operate   Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to the package of   colored charts that begins with the chart on 3-month deposit rates You should have that   package somewhere in front of you on the table 1/   The charts depict forward rate agreements as they have traded over  the past seven months since July 1st  As you can see in the top panel for  the United States, the 9-month forward 3-month rate has been rising rather  consistently since November That trend continued in January, with some  fits and starts, and that rate is now above the current 3-month rate, while  the 3-month forward rate is trading just below current rates The point of  interest here, I think, is that the positive spread in the 9-month forward  over the 3-month forward is now the widest since June 1997 For the first  time in the period shown in this panel, expectations are upward sloping,  with the 9-month forward trading above rather than below the 3-month  forward   Looking at the middle panel--for Germany or the euro zone--I think  the continued fall in both the current and forward rates reflects the  expectation that the European Central Bank will respond to signs of  weakness in the continental economies with further easing, even if that  occurs a little later this year The weekend conversion to the euro went  quite smoothly, as did our conversion of 324 billion of System and  Treasury holdings of deutschemarks into 164 billion of euros There were  some problems related to volume in the European payments system and  the target system that links the national payment systems This caused   1/ A copy of the material used by Mr Fisher is appended to the transcript (Appendix 1)     2/2-3/99 14   some frustration with lags in moving funds around the euro zone, but  those seem to be working themselves out now after a month of transition   Looking at the bottom panel for Japan, the 9-month forward Japanese  3-month rate backed up a fair amount in late December and into January  and has been trading as much as 20 basis points over current 3-month  rates There is much going on in Japanese money markets that I don’t  pretend to understand, but the simple point I have come to understand is  that since October Japanese government T-bill rates have backed up  approximately 30 basis points Having come off their zero and below zero  levels, they have backed up 30 basis points in a period when the Ministry  of Finance has increased bill issuance by about 20 percent This increase  in bill rates seems to have flowed through to the money market   On January 11, with dollar/yen having broken through 109, the  Japanese authorities intervened by purchasing This seemed to  provide some stability to the exchange rate at around 111 or 112 Last  week the yen traded up toward 115 on the increasing perception of the  US economy’s robust performance It is back down to around 111 to 112  this week There is still a fair bit of noise in the dollar/yen market but,  again, I wouldn’t pretend to understand why   Instead of focusing the rest of my remarks on the Japanese economy  or the US equity markets or Brazil, which have received a fair amount of  attention in our own written reports and elsewhere, I thought I would  focus on two areas that have been getting less attention Nevertheless,  these areas have generated a great deal of uncertainty as well The first is  how to price the dollar/euro and the second is how to price fixed income  markets in general   On the second page you will see a 10-year history of a synthetic euro,  based on a methodology developed by Hong Kong Shanghai Bank There  are a number of methodologies out there, but over the 10-year history  there is not much difference among them This chart is for broad-brush  purposes A basic fact to keep in mind is that the euro is quoted in dollars  per euro The dollar was weakest--at the top of the chart--in 1992 when it  traded at almost $150 per euro; it was strongest--at the bottom of the chart  --in 1989 and 1997 when it traded through $105 To give some  perspective, we have indicated weeks in which the US authorities  intervened in dollar/mark, but we did not include dollar/yen interventions  They are not marked here, but clearly there were occasions when we  intervened in dollar/yen, and that intervention had a rather strong impact  on dollar/mark as well This just lists the dollar/mark interventions to  provide reference points     2/2-3/99 15   My point in bringing this to your attention is, first, that there seems  to be relatively little awareness in the markets about how strong the dollar  has been recently; it traded around 10-year highs during most of 1997 and  1998 Secondly, it is not at all clear what people mean when they say that  they expect the euro to be a strong currency Do they mean that they  expect it to trade above its launch rate of about 118?  Do they mean that  they expect it to trade up into the 130s during a normal cycle?  Or do they  mean that they expect its average rate over the next 10 years to be higher  than its average rate over the past 10 years?  The fact of the matter is that  people speak rather loosely about this That reflects, in my view, a great  lack of conviction on how to price this currency Even though people  think they know about dollar/mark, dollar/euro is really a different animal  To give you some flavor of that lack of conviction and the jitteriness in the  markets In the first week of the euro’s existence, it lost a cent because the  target system closed one hour late   Mr Chairman, at the last meeting you asked me if I could explain the  differential between US and UK swap spreads and those on the  continent, and I feebly mumbled something about central bank trading  On some reflection, I would not want to hang my hat on that answer I  know that staff at the Board and New York have tried to come up with  some explanation, but we are still uncomfortable with our lack of  understanding of that phenomenon One reason I am uncomfortable is that  the longer I look at the relationships, the more I realize how much I don’t  understand about the underlying relationships among government bond  yields, which are shown at the top of page 3   The top panel shows the yields since last July 1 on US, UK, Italian,  French, and German 10-year government bonds as well as the yield on the  US Treasury inflation-indexed 10-year bond, which is depicted by the  dotted red line You can see that there was quite a rally in European  government bond markets in November and December That brought us  to the moment on January 5, which was the day before an auction of new  US inflation-indexed 10-year securities, when the yield on both the  outstanding Treasury indexed security and the outstanding Italian  government nominal 10-year bond stood at an identical 394 percent  While the US inflation-indexed yields have fallen about 15 basis points  since then and the Italian nominal yields have traded sideways, both  German and French government 10-year bonds have traded through the  US inflation-protected 10-year rate   We know that the pricing of our inflation-indexed security is  problematic, but the problems are likely measured in tens of basis points  I don’t pretend that I have a magic rule here, but we know we are dealing  with a premium for illiquidity and in particular for the tax treatment that  the dealers complain about quite a bit But there must be something     2/2-3/99 16   happening on the European side of this equation as well The optimists in  Europe would like to explain the low government bond yields as a  reflection of the rush of capital into the euro and the confidence that global  investors have in the ECB Others, perhaps more plausibly at least so far,  suggest that the declining yields reflect the deteriorating outlook for the  continental economies But if the euro’s own economies are as weak as  these yields suggest, where are the tax receipts going to come from to help  these governments avoid issuing a lot more bonds?   To make the general point, let me offer what is clearly my own  opinion That fixed income markets have been slow to recognize that the  so-called short-run supply/demand dynamics have recently been having a  much bigger impact on yield curve movements than have changes in  inflation expectations, at least over the most recent period Consider the  US Treasury market over the last 2 years with decreases in new issuance  and the flight-to-quality buying Consider the Japanese government bond  market over just the last 2 months   There is also considerable unease in the US government bond  market In the bottom panel, you can see that the Brazilian shock had  relatively little impact on spreads that were greatly affected by the events  of last August, September, and October The traders in US Treasuries  are still not at all comfortable Liquidity remains at a very high premium  The bottom red line shows that the twice off-the-run spread is still around  20 basis points, as contrasted with the 2 to 5 basis point spread that had  prevailed for most of the last 5 years until the events of the past few  months   Again, let me make clear that I am offering my own opinion While  the events of last fall effectively knocked fixed income markets off their  then-existing equilibrium, markets have not yet found a new equilibrium  that they are comfortable with I don’t mean to suggest that markets are  fragile, but I do mean that they are still groping and do not have a great  deal of conviction about their pricing of fixed income instruments It  would be fair for any member of the Committee to point out that I may be  having problems getting supply and demand right in my own backyard of  the fed funds market!   Turning to the next page, let us go over our operations in the domestic  markets for the last several reserve maintenance periods In the two  periods depicted in the top two panels, we set out to be quite generous--to  lean against the tightness that we had been seeing during the late fall and  in early December and against the normal year-end funding pressures We  then found that our generosity in supplying reserves was heavily  supplemented by unanticipated weather-induced float from the winter  storms across the Midwest and the Northeast In the first maintenance     2/2-3/99 17   period, our generosity was aimed at avoiding a firm end-of-period  settlement date, which we feared might set us up for a tight year-end that  coincided with the first day of the settlement period We debated at some  length among ourselves how best to prepare the market for the December  1999 year-end Y2K event We debated whether we should be  intentionally generous to calm anxieties or intentionally stingy to engineer  a tight close this year in order to encourage everyone to think they had  better lock in their funding in advance for the next year-end We chose  the generous route and were rewarded at least in one sense with a  noticeable decline in the 1999 year-end premium, as evidenced by futures  prices over the last couple days of the year   In the second period, bad weather contributed to especially high,  unpredictable float and we drained reserves aggressively on several  occasions In the third maintenance period, I have only myself to blame  for the softness I thought we had room to do a term operation of modest  size and thereby avoid the need to operate each day with overnight RPs of  different sizes and still leave room for any additional float or change in  other factors I was either wrong or unlucky or both, and we ended up  with a little more float and a soft rate through the middle of the period   Overall, I am glad that we now have the long-term RP in our tool kit,  and I thank the Committee for adding it We are going to continue to  reflect on our experience of this past year-end as we begin to plan for the  coming year-end   Mr Chairman, I will need a vote to ratify our domestic operations,  and I would be happy to answer any questions   We did a series of foreign exchange trades with ourselves, which   is really what everyone did to convert These are not done with any counterparty We   just take out all the assets denominated in marks and then put them back in denominated   in euros, asset by asset Then the challenge is to confirm that with all our counterparties   and custodians down the supply chain, if you will, to make sure we get to the same   numbers But essentially the conversion involved a rather rudimentary process of doing     2/2-3/99 18   a foreign exchange trade with oneself; that was the case for us and for all the market   participants   Yes I meant to cover that I did say that our conversion went   quite well; maybe I covered that too quickly We were among those who experienced   some of the glitches in the new European payment system We were holding our breath   sometimes to make sure we did not fail on our delivery of euros while waiting for the   queue to work through, but we avoided any problems with that The real issue came in   the first week when the German payment system did not seem to be up to the volume,   which is curious because the volume was much reduced The Germans had put through   some changes in their own domestic payment system simultaneously with the shifted   target That taxed the capacity of the German payment system and there were some   bottlenecks   Yes, and euro-denominated repo agreements with our   counterparties, with Deutsche Bank as our custodian   We will not, until this Committee discusses whether I should buy   some other assets That is, we are limiting our repos to German government   instruments  I think I mentioned some months ago that we will see how the markets   develop, and we may come back to the Committee to discuss diversifying In particular,   the French short end is much more liquid, so the issue is whether we would want to   migrate there if we want our holdings to be more liquid The Desk will not make that   decision--the Committee will make it--though we may recommend going one way or the   other I already have a list of people from non-German EU government finance   ministries who want to come visit with me I am very much looking forward to being     2/2-3/99 19   able to say “I’m happy to consider your proposal but I have to talk to the FOMC before   we make any decisions”   That is a well phrased question My view is that a lot of issuers   want to test the market quickly That is, we are talking about the issuance of new bonds   Everyone wants to get in because in their sector of the euro market they can be the   benchmark, just as all European governments are debating who is going to be the   benchmark If Philips or whatever corporate entity can get in and create a name for   itself, will it have a leg up on others? Some corporations may find it works very well for   them, and they may expand their program  I have a sense that it’s a matter of “Let’s try   it and see how it goes” If I followed your question, I’m not quite sure I see a smooth   transition from that to how the euro/dollar exchange rate will trade and what its bid-ask   spread will be   Right I think the January effect we are observing is a curiosity   effect Your other hypothesis may well prove right over time, but I don’t expect a   smooth movement from where we are now, given what happened in January   That is something some of us have speculated on I don’t think   we have firm evidence that there will be a lot of borrowing by people who don’t live in   the euro zone, since they have to take their proceeds out So, the first-run effect of such   borrowing would be to weaken the euro Some of us have been telling ECB and NCB   officials for some years that having a deep and liquid capital market is not a one-way-up   ticket for the exchange rate, and I think there may be some of that I still ascribe the   thinness of the market and most of the tentativeness in exchange rate trading to that  "
6335,1999-03-30," Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to the three   pages of colored charts that should be on the table in front of you 1/   As you can see in the top panel, this time I have added in the 6-month  forward 3-month rate as a black dotted line; it should not be infected with  any end-of-year Y2K premium, at least for the next few days You will  recall that I used to include routinely the 6-month forward rate in all of  these panels until all three of the money market yield curves became so  compressed that they were too hard to see on the charts   Looking at the top chart on the US dollar forward rates, you can see  that the upward drift in money market rate expectations began in mid-to- late January and was accelerated significantly by the market’s initial  reaction to the Chairman’s Humphrey-Hawkins testimony These  heightened expectations began to unwind rather quickly over subsequent  days, however, as data came out indicating an absence of price pressures  and comments by members of the Committee suggested an absence of  urgency for a monetary policy move But even ignoring the peaks of late  February and early March, as shown in the chart both the 9-month forward  3-month rate and the 6-month forward 3-month rate are almost 40 basis  points higher today than they were in mid-January In particular, I would  note that the 6-month forward 3-month rate, the black line, has been trading  for the last few days at a premium of about 15 to 20 basis points over the  current 3-month rate And that is the widest spread between that forward  rate and the current rate since the June-July 1997 period   The middle chart depicts the German mark and euro forward rates It  is intriguing to see, even with an eventual further ease by the ECB being  widely discussed, the extent to which those forward rates moved up in late  February and early March coincident with the rise in the dollar forward  rates In the bottom chart, on the Japanese forward rates, I would suggest  that the spread shown there between the 9-month forward and the current   1 / A copy of the material used by Mr Fisher is appended to the transcript (Appendix 1)     3/30/99 2   rates probably reflects a Y2K premium and should be interpreted that way  and not as the anticipation of a significant upward movement in Japanese  rates   Turning to the second page, let me go over some yield and spread  relationships In the top panel you can see yields on selected 10-year  government bonds for the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, and  Germany and for the 10-year US inflation-indexed security A very  simple point to note in this panel is that during the period from October  through December some rather dramatic changes in the relationships  among major G-5 government bond yields emerged, and those changes  occurred abruptly But from January forward--dating roughly from the time  of the real float on January 15th--you can see that these bond yields began  to march in parallel, giving the market a rather strong sense that UK and  continental government bond markets are following the lead of the US  Treasury market   The middle panel shows a series of spread relationships over the on- the-run Treasuries In the top orange line, you can see that there was a  narrowing in the mortgage-backed spread as long-term rates backed up in  this country, reflecting a reduction in the prepayment risk for the mortgage- backed portfolios It is interesting that the other spread relationships have  remained rather constant, notwithstanding the backup in the US Treasury  yield curve and the rather heavy issuance of securities in the fixed-income  market I think this at least suggests a growing comfort level in fixed- income markets with the current spread relationships On the other hand,  the bottom red line, the twice off-the-run US Treasuries, shows that while  this spread has narrowed a little to around 15 basis points, or roughly half  its October peak of 30 basis points, it is still 3 times its pre-Russian-crisis  norm of around 5 basis points So, while there has been some unwinding  of anxiety in that area, there still is a rather pronounced desire for liquidity  in fixed-income markets; market participants seem anxious to hold  instruments that they can sell quickly if they want to   In the bottom panel, you can see that both Mexican and Argentine  Brady spreads have returned to, or just past, their pre-Russian-crisis levels  And the Brazilian bond is now trading at a spread against Treasuries that  prevailed in December of last year, before the intensification of the  problems in Brazil   Turning to domestic open market operations, page 3 has a scatter plot  similar to one I have shown you before in which each dot represents a day  The horizontal axis shows the divergence of each day’s effective funds rate  from the target rate And the vertical axis depicts a measure of volatility     3/30/99 3   expressed by the number of basis points contained within one standard  deviation of trading around the effective rate The blue dots on the chart  cover the period from September 30th of last year through February 3rd  and the red dots cover the days since your last meeting   Eyeing the chart, you can see that the red dots are giving us a rather  better cluster around the target rate, showing a tendency toward lower  volatility than we experienced in the rather difficult period from the end of  September through your February meeting In the lower left corner is a  panel with a more precise measure of this to give you a sense of how the  funds market is calming down That panel shows the median value of the  daily divergence of the effective rate from the target rate regardless of sign  and the median value of the daily standard deviation Looking at the first  line, in 1997 there were as many days on which the effective rate diverged  from the target by less than 7 basis points as there where days on which it  diverged from the target by more than 7 basis points Similarly, on roughly  half the days the standard deviation was less than 9 basis points and on  roughly half the days it was more than 9 basis points As you can see,  those values were more or less maintained through much of 1998 until the  end of September After that we experienced a rather significant period of  volatility, when roughly half the days had an absolute deviation from the  target of more than 15 basis points and a volatility standard deviation of  more than 24 basis points But, as seen in the red line covering the period  since the last FOMC meeting, the values have returned to more normal  levels   Looking back, I think it is quite clear that in the fourth quarter of last  year we faced a very anxious funds market, with elevated and erratic  demand for excess reserves leading to volatility and firm rates To be  candid, in January we on the Desk probably were slower to reduce our  anxiety than the market; we were just a little behind the market in  unwinding those anxieties and we were probably tending to be a bit  generous in the provision of reserves But that effect was overwhelmed by  the generosity that the weather-induced float provided, giving us some  rather volatile and squishy-soft days in January But we seem to have  come through that, and in the last intermeeting period the funds market  appears to have returned to much more muted and normal conditions   Let me conclude by noting that starting this coming Monday we will  be moving our routine operating time to around 930 am, one hour earlier  than has been our practice I want to thank the staffs of the Board and the  Reserve Banks as well as the Treasury for their efforts to provide data on  reserves to us more quickly so we can do this and participate in the market  when it is a little more deep and liquid than later in the day     3/30/99 4   We had no foreign exchange intervention operations to report We  concluded the foreign currency rebalancing that the Committee authorized,  which we will report on in full in the written quarterly report we will be  sending you during the month of April I will need the Committee’s  ratification of our domestic operations I will be happy to answer any  questions   I have data going back about 15 years, and the difference has   been around 5 or 6 basis points   No, it is not   Yes, the 5, 6, 7 basis point difference was the long-term trend   for many, many years   I don’t have that on the tip of my tongue   No embarrassment as long as my staff gets the credit!  "
6358,1999-05-18," Thank you I will be referring to the package of charts in front of   you1/   I will be discussing three distinct topics this morning first, recent  interest rate and exchange rate developments; second, the recent behavior  of the funds rate and Desk operations; and third, some preliminary  thoughts about the Y2K issues the Desk may be facing   Turning to the first chart on forward rate contracts for 3-month  deposits, you can see in the top panel that after the last meeting US  forward rates drifted lower and then began rising, intriguingly, from about  the time of the European Central Bank (ECB) rate cut Subsequently, they  rose significantly further after the release of the first-quarter GDP data and  the Chairman’s May 6 remarks in Chicago Of course, last Friday the CPI  data caused an even bigger jump in the forward rates, with the 9-month  forward 3-month rate backing up 21 basis points to 551 percent and the  3-month forward rate backing up 10 basis points to 518 percent The  September fed funds futures contract rose 8 basis points on the day to 450  percent and the long bond backed up 17 basis points to around 592  percent   In the middle panel you can see that the ECB managed to surprise the  markets a bit with a 50 basis point cut in its repo rates about a week after  your last meeting And forward rates have shifted lower more recently,  with the 3-month forward 3-month rate right on top of the current 3-month  rate   The bottom panel shows rate movements in Japan While a few  brave souls were suggesting a few weeks ago that there may be evidence  of a reviving Japanese economy--the Wall Street Journal, for example,  brought out the old hackneyed story about a rise in golf club memberships  --there are no such signs in the forward interest rate market Looking at  interest rate markets, it is hard not to notice that at this point, almost   1 / A copy of the material used by Mr Fisher is appended to the transcript     5/18/99 2   halfway through the year, the US economy seems to be chugging right  along, while the rest of the world is at best sluggish   Turning to the second page, the top panel shows selected 3-month  deposit rates in terms of the change in basis points from January 4 and the  bottom panel shows the percentage change in various currencies against  the dollar, indexed to January 4 Without going through all the details--the  specifics are covered in our written report--twelve central banks have cut  rates since your last meeting, six of them more than once As you can see,  much of the world has declining 3-month rates and declining currencies  relative to the dollar But as can be seen clearly in the bottom panel, two  interesting exceptions are Mexico and Canada, whose currencies have  been strengthening against the dollar However, it may be worth  considering the possibility that the weakening of our exchange rate with  our North American counterparts could reflect the strength of the US  economy and its spillover to the north and to the south   The charts on the third page display changes in the Treasury yield  curve over the last two years The top panel shows rates for on-the-run  coupon securities from May 1, 1997 through May 14, 1999 and the bottom  panel depicts selected yield curves Again, as a consequence of the CPI  release last Friday, you can see that the long end of the on-the-run curve  has backed up to about where it was a year ago That backup is a little  hard to see in the top panel because of the brownish-orange vertical line,  but the bottom panel shows it more clearly; the yield on the 30-year bond  rose to 591 percent and the 10-year rate went to 561 percent But it is  worth pointing out in the micro picture of the last few days that the  30-year bond had backed up--you cannot see it in this scale--to 586  percent on Wednesday in anticipation of the PPI numbers to be released  on Thursday Those data gave the market something of a pleasant surprise  and the bond closed Thursday at 575 percent So the market had been  bracing itself for a negative inflation shock, got a head fake from the PPI  numbers Thursday, and then got faked out again Friday This morning,  the long bond is actually trading at 587 percent, only 1 basis point higher  than the close on Wednesday It certainly was a big move, but it is worth  noting that some of it had already occurred, was taken away, and then  given back   Of the four yield curves shown in the bottom panel, the steepest was  on May 1, 1997, which is before any of the pressures developed in  Thailand The panel also depicts the rather flat yield curve of May 1998,  the inverted curve of last October, and last Friday’s yield curve The  floating diamonds reflect the twice off-the-run 30-year bond yield, which I  have noted there as a placeholder I think of that rate as providing  something of a crude measure of market uncertainty about the level of  long-term rates Which way to look at the liquidity premium is something     5/18/99 3   worth pondering To anticipate what the Chairman may ask me after my  remarks Yes, bid/ask spreads on both on-the-run and off-the-run  securities are a good bit wider today than they were at the time of your last  meeting They had come in a little further by the end of April, but the  noise of the last few days has moved them out a bit   Turning to open market operations, the top chart on page 4 shows the  trading range of the funds rate over the last four maintenance periods As  shown in the upper left portion, covering the first maintenance period from  March 25 to April 7, we supplied a high level of excess reserves to try to  get through the quarter-end and month-end period, but we faced fairly  typical pressures for such a period However, the intriguing interval was  the second period, depicted in the upper right portion of the chart, when  we never quite appreciated the speed with which banks shifted to a desire  to be on the short side of meeting their reserve requirements You can see  there how softly the funds rate traded over the period, when we supplied  only $900 million of excess reserves on average Initially, lower-than- expected tax receipts through most of April were a contributing factor, as  receipts lagged our daily estimates They caught up at the end of the  month, leaving the market initially in the next period with higher reserve  levels than we intended There also seems to have been some hangover  effect from last year when we had a very soft funds rate   To bring pricing back in line, we left excess reserves in rather short  supply at the start of the April 22 maintenance period, which was  compounded by a bit of a miss and gave us a rather firm market on April  26 with a standard deviation of 197 basis points That did seem to shock  the market back to a trading level a little closer to the target But, again,  we have seen some oscillation Yesterday’s funds market was a bit firmer  than we had hoped, but rather typical for a quarterly refunding day; the  effective rate was around 501 percent The average rate for the period we  are in now is still just 476 percent, including yesterday’s firm rate   Turning to the next page, I’ve provided a quick summary so you can  see that this year’s tax season was roughly similar to last year’s tax season  The blue dots represent 1998 and the red dots 1999 Funds have traded  around zero for the effective rate minus the target rate, as is evident by the  cluster of dots near zero on the vertical axis showing the standard  deviation If you look rather carefully--perhaps if you squint--you can see  that the softness of last year was not entirely repeated The shorthand way  to see that is to note that there are slightly more red dots than blue dots to  the right of the zero, ie on the firmer side But the pattern was roughly  similar to last year’s   Let me mention a few other issues regarding our open market  operations We commenced the securities lending program on April 26     5/18/99 4   Since then we have lent securities on 16 different days, and on 5 occasions  we had overbidding in the 30-year bond, beyond our lending limit of 25  percent of our holdings There were also 3 occasions when we had more  bids than we needed in the 10-year area There were 4 days of no  borrowing Interestingly, on 8 days we lent bills and coupons that were  not being actively traded I view that as a very good sign for the program  --that it really involved securities loans that were very close to maturity  and might have led to fails; so, that was very helpful Let me be clear that  I think this program is going well As I mentioned last time, I am likely to  want to raise the limits at some point in the future, but before doing so I  will complete a more thorough analysis of our experience with the  program, which I will share with the Committee and the Treasury   In our outright operations since your last meeting, we added a net of  $1174 billion to the SOMA portfolio in 16 different pass operations over  12 different days We did a TIPS pass where we purchased $303 million  of inflation-indexed securities against bids by the dealers of $39 billion  The reaction to our purchases in the TIPS market was very muted   I would note that currency in circulation has been growing more  rapidly this year than last year, which explains in part the extent of our  outright operations through April The currency component of M1 has  grown at an average annual monthly rate of 109 percent versus 67  percent last year For the coming intermeeting period, we are now  forecasting a $99 billion growth in currency as opposed to $53 billion  over the same period last year   A number of you have asked me about our preliminary thinking at the  Desk on Y2K issues I thought it would be helpful to share with you some  thoughts on this, but I want to be clear that these are very preliminary  views I am not committed to these ideas, but it might be helpful to take  you through them, even though I am not looking for approval or  concurrence at this time   If you turn to the next page, I have listed some of our preliminary  thoughts on this subject First and most importantly, I think there is an  increased likelihood that later in the year the Desk will be operating on  both sides of the market, alternately adding and draining reserves in any  given period of time Secondly, the Special Lending Facility that the  Board addressed yesterday, if used as intended, will provide a means for  the System’s balance sheet to expand as we lend to small banks, who may  be perceived to be less well prepared than the large banks to handle any  Y2K problems Small banks may lose deposits either through outright  withdrawals or transfers of deposits to larger banks that are perceived to  be better prepared     5/18/99 5   Now, the large banks may not be comfortable with either holding  high levels of excess reserves or recycling deposits back to lesser credits  This could lead to a tiering in the funds market, with the System acting as  an intermediary--providing added reserves to the small banks through the  Special Lending Facility and perhaps needing to drain reserves from the  large banks Thus, the System’s balance sheet may expand through the  use of the Special Lending Facility as well as through our outright and  longer-term repo operations We are likely to need to fine-tune more  frequently, alternating the use of repos and matched sale transactions  Perhaps the simplest way to put this is just that we may have greater  uncertainty; and in a period of greater uncertainty, the Desk is likely to  need to be on both sides of the market   A separate and much narrower issue is that as we approach the year- end, if there appears to be a developing scarcity of collateral, as some fear,  we may be inclined to oversupply reserves intentionally early on with term  repos Then we can fine-tune total reserves over the turn of the year  through matched sale draining operations, where we provide the collateral;  thus we would not be dependent on the securities markets to come forward  with the collateral for our operations   Also, we are giving some consideration to the need for late-day  operations We are still thinking this through, but we think we might need  to conduct some operations late in the day; otherwise there might be  pressure around the time of the regular 3 pm close of the securities wire  To drain reserves, we might do matched sales late in the day, though we  would have to find some means of crediting the collateral to the dealers’  accounts after what would be the normal close of the wire To add  reserves, we are giving some consideration to the use of a third-party  custodian--really just Chase and Bank of New York who could act as  custodial agents for us--in the acceptance of certain types of collateral  The Desk’s systems simply are not geared up to take some forms of  collateral that in fact are eligible for use in our operations   Finally, the next page is a chart of the year-end butterfly trade for  1999/2000, the red line, and for the previous three year-end periods The  difference between the yields on the 3-month December Eurodollar  contract against the average of the two surrounding contracts is an  expression of year-end funding anxiety You can see the rather  extraordinary levels to which that differential rose over this past year-end  and early this year It has come off quite a bit since then While it was  trading at the higher levels, we gave some consideration to the question of  how we might respond, if you wished us to, to anticipated year-end  pressures in the funding market The only tool that we have in our arsenal  now would be a forward RP--to inject reserves by doing forward RPs that  the dealers might execute with us I have to say that gives me some pause     5/18/99 6   in terms of putting on our books operations that may not be necessary It  seems to me to be a less-than-optimal approach Conceptually, a tidier  tool would be the use of options We would sell options on both repo and  matched sale transactions at strike prices out from the Committee’s target  and allow the dealers to bid for those as a way of getting assurance that  year-end financing would be available I want to repeat that this is really a  conceptual issue regarding how we might respond if this premium began  to rise again and the Committee were concerned about funding in the year- end market That is really all I can say at this point on these Y2K issues  that a number of you have asked me about I hope this gives you a sense  of our thinking on the subject   In conclusion, Mr Chairman, we had no foreign operations during  the period but I will need the Committee’s ratification of our domestic  operations I have a separate issue to bring before the Committee about  the renewal of our Mexican and Canadian swap lines I sent a memo to  the Committee explaining that the appropriate timing for a vote on that is  now rather than later in the year So, I will also need a vote on that issue  I would be happy to take questions on any aspect of my report, and then,  as you wish, we could take the two votes separately   I would not consider myself the System’s leading expert on the   subject I think they have collateral At the discount window we can take pretty much   anything they have in terms of customer notes   Well, if your question relates to what collateral we currently   have in our possession, I should note that we also take on-site collateral in some cases   The discount officers have been working on this issue, writing letters encouraging the   banks to get their collateral in and pledge it, but we are not there yet   Yes   That is the issue that I think the most thoughtful institutions in   the market are anxious about in terms of Y2K concerns What will be good business   practice with regard to closing out counterparties?  How many grace days are going to be   appropriate?  Will this be a one-day hurricane and then everything will be back to   normal, or will it be something more than that?  Swap agreements have three days, repo   agreements have two days; a grace period is written into the contracts So having the   loan as collateral makes things a bit easier, but there are a huge number of instruments   out there that are on what might be considered hair triggers It is a very awkward subject,   and not just for us We will be part of a larger community that will be grappling with that   question   Absolutely But if you think of banks as big as Chase or   Citibank, it’s a virtual certainty that some of their customers will have computer   problems   Yes, I sent the Committee a memo on May 13 about the renewal   of our swap arrangements with Mexico and Canada that were established under the North   American Framework Agreement A reading of the fine print--indeed Mr Truman’s   reading of the fine print--made us realize that under the terms of these swap arrangements   6 months’ notice is required to terminate them Therefore, the appropriate time for the   Committee to decide to renew or not to renew them at year-end is now and not, as has   been our custom, in November Given some of the Y2K issues as well as the separatist   issue still afoot in Canada, our counterparts in Mexico and Canada may be particularly   anxious about them So it is my recommendation that the Committee vote to renew these   two agreements at this time     5/18/99 11  "
6380,1999-06-29," Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to the usual package of   colored charts that is in front of you 1/   Mr Chairman and members of the Committee, four perceptions are  currently influencing financial market behavior It seems to me that each  of these perceptions contains certain elements of truth but also, I fear,  certain fallacies that could come back to haunt us These perceptions are  First, that signs of a pickup in European growth are causing a rise in  expectations for a European Central Bank (ECB) rate hike later this year;  second, that the strength of the US economy has been the major factor  causing the weakening of the euro over the last six months; third, that the  Japanese monetary authorities can be relied upon to stabilize the yen with  verbal and official intervention; and fourth, that the levels of interest rates  and of economic activity in the United States will be principally  determined by the words and deeds of the members of the Federal Open  Market Committee In my remarks, I will address each of these  perceptions in turn   In the charts on the first page of the package, you can see that the  forward rates jumped a bit on the Committee’s announcement on May 18  but stabilized or even rallied a bit until May 27 and then began to back up  through most of June I will return to the issue of the course of US  interest rates later when I discuss the bond market   For now, I would like to focus on the euro forward rates, which  appear to have followed US rates up Euro-area 6-month and 9-month  forward 3-month deposit rates are up 25 basis points or so since your last  meeting There have been a number of positive signs for the euro-11  economy, including greater-than-expected first-quarter GDP in Germany,  increased German manufacturing orders, and improvement in German and  French business sentiment But some less upbeat data have also been  reported in Europe, including an increase in German unemployment in  May, a decrease in German retail sales in April, weak French exports in   1 / A copy of the material used by Mr Fisher is appended to the transcript (Appendix 1)     6/29-30/99 2   April, and weak Italian production in April So, while some signs of a  bottoming in the European economy have emerged, I don’t think that  translates directly into concrete expectations of an ECB rate hike Rather,  evidence of a slight pickup in activity coupled with strong expectations for  US rate increases, against the backdrop of a weak euro, have completely  eliminated any expectations of further rate cuts by the ECB and in that  sense have increased the risks of a rate hike   But this has left euro-area interest rate markets without any direction,  leaving them highly susceptible to being dragged around by the movement  in US rates Unfortunately, I did not include in these charts a panel on  the German yield curve But in the period since your last meeting the  10-year German bund and, most surprisingly, the 2-year German bund  have marched along with our yield curve almost in lock step as they too  have backed up over the last 60 days It may turn out that the euro-area  economy has turned and will pick up steam from this point forward, but  most of the backup in euro-area interest rates appears to me to be a case of  their following our lead   In the bottom panel of this chart, which depicts Japanese forward  rates, you can see that the 9-month forward 3-month rate backed up  following the report of a much stronger-than-expected GDP number for  the first quarter Then, it seems to me, the data go berserk in this panel  Even though we have checked and doubled checked them, this is the best  we have been able to come up with But you should also recognize that  this scale is twice that of the other panels on this chart in order to provide  any view at all of Japanese interest rates There is a level of noise in the  Japanese markets that I don’t even pretend to understand But I will hold  with my assessment that I don’t think anyone really expects the Bank of  Japan to raise rates any time soon There is much seesawing in views  about what to expect in the Tankan survey Every few days authorities  step forward to say they still think the economy is weak, and this has been  going on for some time   Turning to the next chart, the steady weakening of the euro against  the dollar since its launch in January has been widely attributed to the  surprising strength of the US economy Obviously, the relative strength  of the US economy versus the European economies has played a role in  the movements of the dollar against the euro but it does not explain the  weakness of the euro against the yen It strikes me that if one wants to  make the case that Europe’s growth differential with the United States has  been the principal cause of the euro’s weakness, one needs to look at the  relationships among all three currencies  If one does that, I think it is  evident that the yen has been playing a dominant role, both in the last six  months and over the last two years     6/29-30/99 3   In the third page of charts, the top panel presents a view of G-3  exchange rates from the dollar’s perspective, depicting the value since  January of 1997 of one dollar in terms of the euro in red and the value of  one dollar in terms of the yen divided by one hundred in green The  bottom panel provides a view of exchange rates from the yen’s  perspective, depicting the value of one hundred yen in dollars, the green  line, and the value of 100 yen in euros, the blue line   With the naked eye I think you can see that the yen-based pair in the  bottom panel track each other much more closely than the dollar-based  pair in the top panel Comparing the correlation coefficients noted in the  subperiods in the top and bottom panels, you can see that the only period  in which the daily changes of the dollar pair tracked more closely was  from January through April of 1997 From May 1997 onward, when the  unwinding of the yen carry trades began to put pressure on the Thai baht,  the daily changes in the yen pair have correlated much more closely   Now, neither of these graphs nor the correlations is proof that the yen  is the principal driver of the G-3 exchange rates But I do think the data  powerfully suggest that the differences between North America on the one  hand and Europe on the other are much less significant than the  differences, as expressed in exchange rates, between Japan on the one  hand and North America and Europe on the other   If euro/yen and dollar/yen are moving to the beat of one drum, there  is only so much room left for independent expression in the euro/dollar  exchange rate Again, I certainly believe that differences in growth  prospects between the United States and the euro-11 influence the  euro/dollar exchange rate But I also think that the weak Japanese  economy and the crippled Japanese financial system have had an  oscillating influence on portfolio allocations that in turn have had a  significant impact on the major exchange rates--an impact that has been  ignored by those who do not take the time to consider all three sides of the  triangle   Turning to the fourth page of charts, the top panel depicts euro/yen  and dollar/yen exchange rates as they have traded since the start of the  year The bottom panel shows the implied volatilities of one-month  options on all three of the major currency pairs since the start of the year   Now, the third perception I mentioned at the outset was that the  Japanese authorities can be relied upon to stabilize the yen with verbal and  official intervention The germ of truth in that perception is that the  Japanese authorities have stabilized the yen so far this year, at least to  some appearances The problem is that the market’s apparent reliance on  the authorities’ ability to do so is likely to be misplaced On January 12,     6/29-30/99 4   indicated by the vertical line on the left in the top panel, the Japanese  authorities purchased And the shaded area on the right  indicates the of dollar intervention and the of  euro intervention the Japanese authorities conducted in mid-June   While there was a modest uptick in the implied volatilities, as shown  in the bottom panel, what surprises me is how little and how short-lived  that reaction was Indeed, dollar/yen and euro/yen implied volatilities are  back to their lows of the year Anecdotal evidence from the market  suggests strongly that many who have exposures are simply leaving them  unhedged and that others are eager to write options and collect premiums,  leaving themselves unhedged, all in the expectation that the Japanese  authorities will keep the yen contained It is possible that the yen will  stabilize; I don’t want to rule that out entirely But I think it is more likely  that the reliance on that expectation will simply delay the position  adjustments--or worse, will encourage an entirely new round of yen carry  trades   The fifth page of charts addresses the last perception I mentioned-­ that the levels of interest rates and of economic activity in the United  States will be determined principally by the words and deeds of the  members of this Committee I should, of course, point out that there is an  element of truth behind that perception also, particularly with respect to  the predictable impact of the Committee’s deeds on short-term rates   Within the last few weeks, in the absence of what we might normally  think of as noteworthy data, it seems to me that bond yields have been  pushed higher by a medley of unattributed voices The top panel depicts  several stages of the bond market’s movements since your last meeting  First, I think it is worth noting that in the days following the Committee’s  announcement on May 18 the bond market rallied The long bond rallied  every day that week; along the rest of the yield curve other bonds backed  up on the day after the announcement but rallied for the rest of the week  Now, in defense of the market, I don’t think its initial reaction was  unreasonable After all, the 10-year Treasury had already backed up 50  basis points in yield from early April I think the market took some  pleasure in seeing that the central bank was preparing to react to the  perceived risk of inflation but did not plan to do so abruptly or in a knee- jerk fashion  I think it is also worth noting that many market participants  interpreted the FOMC’s announcement as implying a heightened risk of a  25 basis point increase in rates   However, beginning on May 27, the market began receiving a series  of reports about the views of the Committee, including comments by  FOMC members and other Fed officials suggesting that a more aggressive  tightening should be expected This threat, giving the market a new sense     6/29-30/99 5   of risk, triggered a backup in yields and anxious reactions to several not  particularly significant data releases   On June 1 the long bond backed up 11 basis points after the NAPM  prices paid index came in at 552 rather than closer to the expected 533  On June 4 the bond market backed up only 3 basis points in reaction to the  release of the data on employment and average hourly wages; but then on  June 11 it backed up 9 basis points after the report of a 1 percent increase  in retail sales versus expectations of 07 or 08 percent Subsequently, the  release of the flat CPI on June 16 and the Chairman’s June 17 testimony  before the Joint Economic Committee calmed the market with a  perception that a moderate tightening was in store But as you can see on  the chart, the “relief rally” was short-lived By early last week, the market  was once again on the receiving end of a chorus of voices threatening  more aggressive actions   In my judgment, if you had tried to trade in the bond market during  this period and had followed only the FOMC’s announcement on May 18,  the data releases as they came out, and the Chairman’s Joint Economic  Committee testimony, you would have lost a lot of money On the other  hand, if you had subscribed to all the high-priced insider rags and  carefully tracked the utterances, attributed and unattributed, of FOMC  members, you would have fared a good bit better   Looking at the bottom two panels on this page, you can see that credit  spreads and volatilities did back up a little, but not very much--less than I  would have expected, given all the fits and starts in the bond market I  think it is particularly noteworthy that the implied volatility on the S&P  futures contract was actually lower on the period   In sum, there seems to be a very odd mix of anxiety and complacency  in this market, which I don’t pretend to understand fully nor do I yet see  how it will work itself out   Finally, turning to domestic open market operations, the chart on page  6 depicts the volatility of the fed funds rate We had significantly less  volatility and a much better contained funds market during this period than  we had earlier in the year The red dots cover the intermeeting period and  the blue dots cover the period from January 14 through May 18 As you  can see, the median value of the effective deviation from the target in  absolute terms was only 5 basis points and the standard deviation was  down to 8 basis points during the recent intermeeting period So we have  had a much calmer funds market and funds have traded a bit on the soft  side     6/29-30/99 6   The rather extraordinary conditions in the current maintenance period  have posed something of a challenge for the Desk The market had a very  low appetite for reserves coming into this period, expecting to hold large  quantities of excess reserves at the quarter-end And even as we left  reserves quite short, the market traded on the soft side Last Thursday, as  the market began to turn its attention to the shortage for this week, we  arranged a 3-day forward RP for settlement Monday to inject about $7  billion to cover these last days   But given the combination of events tomorrow--a quarter-end, a  maintenance period end, and a very high expectation that the Committee  will raise rates--it has been rather hard to get the funds rate to trade very far  below 5 percent, even though I think we have finally succeeded in that effort  today I will be candid, however; I have some fears that our efforts to do  this over a Monday and Tuesday will lead to a fed funds rate of zero by  tomorrow night, notwithstanding your announcement, whatever it may be   I should mention that over the first six months of the year the SOMA  portfolio has expanded by almost $30 billion, which is a record expansion  of our outright holdings This has been in response principally to currency  in circulation, but we have been adding to the portfolio all along the  maturity spectrum Even with the slightly stronger currency growth, we  still think that the normal $12 billion leeway will be adequate for the  coming intermeeting period   Mr Chairman, we had no foreign exchange operations during the  period but I will need the Committee’s ratification of our domestic  operations And I would be happy to answer any questions   Our perception is very much that the daily changes are still being   driven by the yen The anxiety of the Japanese authorities is now as much focused on   euro/yen as dollar/yen, and they intervened in euro/yen for the first time ever during this   period I agree with you but I think some other things are going on here; I don’t mean to   suggest that this encompasses all of the inputs that determine exchange rates Still, during     6/29-30/99 7   these six months and even in recent weeks, the daily changes up and down in euro/yen and   dollar/yen seem to be moving together Although I did not refer to this in my remarks, we   hear anecdotally that there is a sense among market participants, both in Europe and in   Japan, that a lot of the pressure on the yen reflects Japanese investors who had established   positions in Europe and are coming back into yen now that they are deeply under water   What you can’t tell from this panel, because it is not expressed in terms of exchange rates,   is that at the end of September of last year, the end of Japan’s fiscal half-year, euro/yen   was at 160 Now it is at 124 or so So, anyone from Japan who took on a position in euro   assets at that earlier point is deeply under water It is actually a widespread perception in   Tokyo that the Ministry of Finance’s incentive to intervene was to try to help institutional   investors get out of those positions without strengthening the yen So, other things are   certainly going on The sense of the strong US economy vis-à-vis Europe is also   certainly apropos   The normal course that I believe the Bank of Japan is following is   that they sterilize this intervention It is a very complicated arrangement It’s as if the   Exchange Stabilization Fund, the equivalent accounting entity, could actually issue its   own bills to the market to finance itself That’s in effect what the Bank of Japan does on   behalf of the Ministry So in the first step, the Bank of Japan gives the Ministry yen   liquidity But the Ministry then has to finance that by borrowing yen in the markets and   issuing securities directly to repay the Bank of Japan; it would be the accounting   equivalent of the Exchange Stabilization Fund issuing its own bills directly So it is   sterilized I think that question is different from the question of the extent of   accommodation in the Bank of Japan’s monetary stance It is still a very accommodative   stance They have managed to keep their overnight rate trading at 2 or 3 basis points,   which is the brokers’ spread So that rate has been effectively zero throughout the period     6/29-30/99 8   At the aggregate level, it is quite hard; the data are rather poor At   the firm level, I presume one can find out what decisions individual firms have made   Tracking this involves relying on anecdotal information There was an attempt to   tabulate some data for Japan, which was not very satisfactory The results were   published by some outfit here in Washington whose name I don’t recall, but the data were   pretty poor once you scratched the surface When I checked with the Bank of Japan, they   told us to be very suspicious of those data So unfortunately, the answer is no, we cannot   track that at an aggregate level But it is something we are always talking about with   others in the market and we get some anecdotal information I don’t know how accurate   that is   Yes, it is certainly easier to try to get a handle on it at the firm   level   I am worried about the risk that people perceive it as a dollar thing   when in fact I think it is a yen thing I think sloppy policies, sloppy policy reactions, and   uninformed market behavior can result if people think they are responding to one   stimulus when that stimulus really isn’t the dominant one So my first instinct is to make   sure my thinking is as clear as I can make it regarding what may be influencing exchange   rates That is really the major thrust of my message, nothing more than that   No, they did not They hold a few marks but I don’t believe they   ever formally intervened in marks   MRMCTEER So this could be the beginning of the euro as an intervention   currency?  This is the first time it was ever used that way?     6/29-30/99 10   It was the first time it was used by the Japanese I think it   reflected a certain flamboyance on the part of the Ministry of Finance, trying to grab   attention for itself in Tokyo But also, to be fair, a lot of the pressures were emanating   from the movement in euro/yen So to the extent they wanted to respond, they realized   that if they only intervened in dollar/yen, it would be a release valve and would be hard to   get their hands on the problem So there was a tactical reason, but I think flamboyance   might also have been a reason   I was very surprised to see the ECB begin a relationship by intervening as agent   on behalf of the Japanese authorities because the Bundesbank had always resisted doing   that   I should be clear that this normal courtesy may increasingly   become something of an artifact since most of the foreign exchange market trades   through a single computer, or at least the price setting takes place in the electronic   brokering system (EBS) terminal So liquidity is not a geographic phenomenon; it is a   temporal phenomenon of when people are connected to and are watching the EBS So   we may get away from this notion of geographic intervention, but that hasn’t quite   happened yet   I think the bond market has been focused on the words of   members of this Committee, both for attribution and not, to an extent that I have not seen   in my admittedly not very long tenure in this position I find that disturbing in terms of   the influence on policy It looks to me as if this bond market has priced in a 25 basis   point move about four times I can’t prove that and I don’t know that   They have taken that 25 basis point increase in and out I am not   suggesting that that has any profound macroeconomic effect But the in and out pricing   repetitions have been in response to the rhetoric, not the economic data That was my   point     6/29-30/99 11   Clearly something very different happened after the last meeting   with the announcement of a bias I said at the end of my remarks that there is a strange   mix of what market players are anxious about and what they are complacent about I   looked for a way to express to the Committee what I thought they were anxious about and   what I thought they were complacent about I think their focus is misplaced but, to be   candid, I can’t quite put my finger on it They seem to have some expectation that words   from this Committee, whether individually or collectively, will somehow remove all the   uncertainties That is rather naïve and myopic But they hang on every word as if it were   going to solve the uncertainties for them I just don’t think it will Indeed, it hasn’t, as   you can see by how the bond market has behaved So if I was not clear enough, I hope   that helps   I certainly defer to Karen for a view on the real merits of what   you’ve suggested In terms of the view on the Street, I think most non-Japanese   observers are still highly skeptical They are not yet in the camp that thinks this is for   real, although they are intrigued and are wondering where the opportunities may be   After all, the Nikkei turned up So there is a little bait-on-the-hook dangling there for   them I think the Japanese are quite anxious and wondering if it is time to bring their   money home The quantities do not matter, but the price should So in Tokyo there is a   lot of anxiety about that There also is a lot of anxiety about what the impact on Japan     6/29-30/99 12   might be of any action by this Committee It doesn’t make any sense to me, but they   think that if this Committee raises rates, it will strengthen the yen And that actually is an   issue within Japan as well So I think the anxieties about this being a turning point are   somewhat geographically separated, if I can put it that way But if Karen wants to add   anything on the specifics-­  If I could just clarify my comments, in the short run I am more   worried about a rapid yen appreciation such as the one we had in 1997-98--that kind of   episode that they’re currently bottling up That’s not a forecast of where it will all come   out in the wash once the Japanese economy settles down But it’s the oscillation of the   portfolio effect in and out of the Japanese financial sector--rushing out, rushing in--that   could give us a burst That’s what they are resisting now, they think So there’s just   more volatility there in the short run In the long run I wouldn’t stake my bets there The   weak euro/strong yen is the short-run scenario   I think a great deal of the markets’ attention over the last couple of   weeks has not been on how many basis points the Fed will move at this meeting but on   what the wording of the announcement will be and whether there will be symmetry Our   traders have responded to foreign central banks wanting to know the rules this Committee   follows in deciding whether to say something about symmetry or not The whole world   is really interested in the second part of the announcement  "
6403,1999-08-24," Thank you, Mr Chairman In front of the members of the Committee   is a package of charts, similar to the one I usually show1/ I will begin by addressing agenda   item 3, my report on markets and the Desk’s activities   The first page, covering the period from June 1 through August 20,  presents a slightly different configuration of charts than I usually show  you The top panel depicts US deposit rates, current and forward; the  middle panel shows yields on US Treasury securities; and the bottom  panel shows the percent change in various equity market indices   In the top panel, you can see that from the time of the Committee’s  last meeting on June 30 until the Chairman’s Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony on July 22, current and forward 3-month deposit rates moved  more or less sideways They began rising fairly consistently after the  Chairman’s testimony through the time of the release of ECI and GDP  data and the nonfarm payroll employment numbers, and then came off  noticeably following the publication of the PPI on August 13 and, two  days later, the CPI Even more interesting than that movement in rates is  the changed structure of the forward rates from the beginning of June to  the beginning of August On June 1, shown at the far left-hand side of  the chart, the 6-month forward 3-month rate and the 9-month forward  3-month rate were trading rather closely together at around 58 percent  and the 3-month forward rate was around 54 percent Now, I would  suggest that the proximity of the 6-month forward and the 9-month  forward rates had to do with the market’s expectations that the  Committee was likely to tighten a bit in the future They didn’t quite  know when, and they didn’t know what would happen after that There  might be just one move So, some of the term premium between those  two maturities was squeezed out   By August 1, you see that the 6-month forward rate had shifted and  was then trading in line with the 3-month forward rate Several things  happened in the month of July, I think  Obviously, the market’s attention   1 / A copy of the material used by Mr Fisher is appended to the transcript     8/24/99 3   was focused on the Chairman’s Humphrey-Hawkins testimony,  particularly his comment that the Committee would act promptly and  forcefully There was increasing attention during the month on the  funding pressures anticipated in the fourth quarter and in early January as  a result of the century date change Also, there was the rolling forward of  the maturity of these contracts, which changed each day   To make the point very specifically, on August 1 the 3-month forward  3-month rate involved a deposit whose term covers precisely the period  when the greatest pressures are expected--November, December, and  January If you look at the early August period on the chart, you see that  the 3-month forward rate actually traded below, even if just a few basis  points, the 6-month forward rate Now, I’m not sure the market’s  expectations are correct But the forward rates are showing us that the  market is pricing up considerably the deposit rates for this 3-month  window, erasing whatever term premium one might expect to exist  between the 3-month forward and the 6-month forward because of the  anticipated pressures around the year-end   Turning to the middle panel on Treasury yields, you can see that  those yields more or less followed the same pattern relative to the data  releases However, just before the release of the nonfarm payroll data on  August 6, there was a two-day rally across the yield curve after the  Treasury’s refunding announcement in which Treasury officials  discussed the introduction of buy backs and the elimination of the  30-year auction in November That rally was short lived, unwinding after  the release of the nonfarm payroll data I’d note that the 30-year bond  from Friday, August 20 through today traded at a rate identical to the rate  at which it closed on June 30, the day of your last meeting, whereas both  the 10-year and the 2-year rates are roughly 10 basis points higher   In the bottom panel you can see that equity markets here in the United  States more or less tracked inversely the movements in yields If we  include yesterday’s change in the DOW on that panel, the increase in the  DOW would be 66 percent   Turning to the second page and to European markets, the top panel  shows the forward rates and current rates for 3-month deposits on euros  As is evident in the middle of the top panel, the 9-month forward  3-month euro deposit rate jumped appreciably following the European  Central Bank’s press conference on July 15, during which President  Duisenberg suggested that there was bias creeping into the ECB’s  deliberations Several days later, on the release of German IFO survey  data on business confidence, which was somewhat stronger than  expected, there was a very abrupt jump in the 3-month forward deposit  rate; but that was completely unwound subsequently What I think is     8/24/99 4   noticeable both in the top panel and in the middle panel depicting  European bond yields is the extent to which these rates moved in  response to US data releases and moved more or less in a pattern similar  to that in US markets   The bottom panel shows the euro-dollar exchange rate One can see  that the euro has moved up a bit off its lows against the dollar,  particularly in the week of July 19 to July 23 There are two stories  circulating in foreign exchange markets about movements in exchange  rates One is that a revival of global growth, especially in Europe and  Japan, will be narrowing growth differentials with the United States The  second is that the Fed is about to tighten and that that will be bad for US  assets and bad for leverage and, therefore, for the dollar Now, both of  these stories could be true I don’t mean to discount that possibility But  I would note that many observers, particularly in the foreign exchange  markets, have tended to focus in their conversations on the first story--the  narrowing of global growth differentials But it seems to me that the  asset market movements reflect more of the latter story--that is, the fear  that a Fed tightening will be bad for assets and bad for leverage   In the bottom panel, one can see that in the week beginning July 19,  following Duisenberg’s comments about creeping bias, the dollar came  off quite abruptly That Monday morning several large asset managers  thought it was an opportune time to buy euros They did not expect the  kind of exchange market reaction that occurred They found a very, very  thin market and the dollar moving downward quite briskly It appears to  me and to others, in hindsight, that the market was very thin partly in  anticipation of the Chairman’s Humphrey-Hawkins testimony That  dollar trend accelerated some on the release of the German IFO survey  data even though, as you can see in the other panels on the page, the IFO  survey had very little impact on forward rates or on the yield curve   I would underscore that the dollar is still quite strong against the euro  If my chart depicted it through this morning, it would be trading at 105  Translating this morning’s rate into a rate more familiar to us all, the  dollar-mark, that rate would be 186 So, I just want to emphasize that,  regardless of its movements against the euro, the dollar in historic terms  is quite strong   Turning to the third page, which depicts Japanese markets, you can  see on the left side of the top panel that Japanese forward rates rose a bit  following the release on July 29 of stronger-than-expected Japanese  industrial production data for June Japan’s IP was plus 3 percent on a  month-over-month basis as opposed to minus 1 percent in May But it is  hard not to notice that, again, Japanese forward rates more or less in their     8/24/99 5   own muted way also are tracking the pattern of US forward rates and  US interest rate expectations   There has been much attention paid to the Japanese equity market of  late, and its movements are shown in the middle panel But all that  chatter is now overshadowed by the extraordinary performance of bank  shares in the Japanese market following the merger announcement of last  week On this scale, if the bank index included Monday’s trading, the  Topix Bank Index would show a 268 percent increase over its June 1st  level   The bottom panel shows the value of the yen expressed against the  dollar and the euro Since your last meeting, the Japanese authorities  intervened on three occasions--on July 5 in conjunction with the release  of the Tankan Survey and again on July 20 and 21--for a total of   We acted as their agent on one occasion I think there are two  distinct periods to focus on here in terms of the dollar’s movements  During the week of July 19, the dollar weakened against both the euro  and the yen But as you can see in the blue line on this panel, the euro­ yen rate was mostly unaffected That was the week during which the  markets were most intensely interested in the global growth differential  story, and bond yields started backing up I would note that the anxiety  about a Fed tightening being bad for assets was particularly acute in  Tokyo Market participants and also Japanese officials, I’m afraid, have  coalesced around the view that a Fed tightening in 1999 is likely to have  the same impact on the dollar as the 1994-95 Fed tightening episode I  don’t share that view I think that’s a bit of a stretch But that view has  become rather widely held in the Tokyo market and also by the Ministry  of Finance   In the more recent episode last week, the yen appreciated against both  the dollar and the euro At the start of last week Governor Hiyami  suggested to Japanese corporate leaders, I think wisely, that they should  take more responsibility for hedging their own foreign exchange  positions That had quite an impact on the mood in Tokyo Later in the  week, former Vice Minister Sakakibara somewhat less wisely let slip that  further intervention by the Japanese authorities was not likely until the  yen/dollar rate reached 110, and the market promptly obliged him and  traded down toward that level   Turning to the next page, the chart depicted there for the period from  May 1, 1998 to August 20, 1999 is similar to a chart I’ve shown before  on various spread relationships between private instruments and  comparable US Treasuries Several of these spreads have widened to  levels above those of last October In particular, note that the 10-year  Fannie Mae benchmark and the 10-year US swap rates, shown at the     8/24/99 6   bottom of the chart, have backed up above their prior peaks of last  October 12 and 7, respectively The index of 10-year A2 investment  grade corporate securities, the green line, and the mortgaged backed  securities, the red line, haven’t quite backed up to their prior peaks, but  they also have been rising Corporations and federal agencies have been  eager to lock in what they perceive as rather low rates They used the  swap market initially to try to lock in those rates, and the aversion of  swap market intermediaries to holding on to fixed rate risk has led to the  sharp backup   Now, I want to be very clear that I think this is quite different from  what was happening last October There is no sense of panic in these  markets That said, however, we have to recognize that these markets are  quite thin and that the intermediaries are quite reluctant to hang on to  risks We have triple checked the data for the period of marked volatility  in the swap rate last week, when it oscillated 10 and 15 basis points from  one day to the next, and those are valid data points   The other thing I would point out is that the lower grade credits, the  more risky credits if you will, such as mortgage backed securities which  are shown on the chart and junk rated issues not depicted here, have not  backed up to their peaks of last fall I would not want to suggest,  however, that that is an indication that everything is warm and fuzzy in  those markets--on the contrary But there is very little being issued in  those markets as opposed to the rather strong issuance of higher grade  credits So part of the reason why those rates haven’t backed up further  is because of a reluctance to issue in those markets   Finally, turning to domestic operations, on the next page you can see  that there was very little of note in the fed funds market during the  intermeeting period Deviations of the funds rate from target and the  intraday standard deviation in the volume were quite moderate The only  point of note was that the demand for excess reserves appeared to run a  little below the allowance of $12 billion that we had in the path   Mr Chairman, during the intermeeting period we had no foreign  exchange operations on behalf of the System or the Treasury  I will need  the Committee’s ratification of the domestic operations in the period   Also, I sent to the Committee a memorandum on August 9,  explaining my intention to raise the per-issue limit in our securities  lending program from 25 percent to 45 percent I would be happy to  answer any questions about that at this time or on any other aspect of my  report, before your vote to ratify the domestic operations   Let me distinguish a couple of things First, if I thought the   management of any dealer firm was not taking seriously the intent of our program, we   would escalate the issue rather quickly I believe the problem we’ve had in the first three   months of the program is that some traders looked to take what advantage they could of it   and did not understand the last resort nature of our program So, in each case where this has   happened--where a dealer appeared to have a large position and was also bidding in our   auction--we suspended their bidding for that issue until such time as we were persuaded that   their position was more in line with the intended usage of our program   We have discussed already, Cathy, that if there were multiple infractions from a single   dealer and the management didn’t amend its ways, the first step would be to suspend them   from use of the program for a year or some period like that We are still discussing what   constitutes a “strike” and whether our rule should be two strikes or three strikes and you’re   out I would be inclined to pursue it that way--by prohibiting them from using the program   I think the analogy to the Salomon case is a little extreme I don’t want to overplay it, but   raising the limits per issue-­  But not changing the per-dealer bid I am hopeful will reduce the   potential for dealers thinking they can make something of this So that is one incentive for   us to raise the limits at this time   There are quite a few different US Treasury securities outstanding   For any one of them, I don’t think the frequency of use is continuous other than for on-the-  run issues But one of our major incentives in this program was to try to reduce the risk of   fails to deliver in the on-the-run issues So we always anticipated that the use would likely   be frequent with respect to those issues It is not the same dealer borrowing every time   That gives me some comfort, and I hope would give the Committee comfort, that the   program is being used by the vast majority of dealers appropriately as a last resort I want to   underscore the overnight borrowing constraint we put in the program We only lend   securities overnight now, whereas previously we lent them for a one-week term The   dealers themselves view that as a fairly onerous condition They would much rather finance   a short position for a one-week or a one-month term To have to come back every day   means that in an operational sense borrowing from us truly is much more like a last resort   for them So in that sense I think it really is consistent with how we set up the program,   although in a period when Treasury supply is contracting as rapidly as it is, I believe one can   understand why the facility is being used as much as it is   Yes   Thank you, Mr Chairman Included in my package of charts are two   pages of outline notes that you can follow as I speak You also have a one-page document   containing a revised list of the votes that I will be requesting They provide a guide to my   specific requests In that regard, there is some revision from those in the memo I sent you   on August 17   To begin, as I explained in my memo of August 17, my first proposal is to remove the   constraint of the guidelines that restrict our operations in federal agency securities These   “Guidelines for the Conduct of System Operations in Federal Agency Securities” have been   in effect since 1977 The formal proposal I would like to make is to ask the Committee to   suspend the guidelines until April 30, 2000 At the FOMC meeting in March of next year I   would expect to review thoroughly our experience with temporary operations in agency   securities and, as I’ll explain in a minute, our use of tri-party arrangements in our operations   in agency securities in general So, that is the first item I would plan to request     8/24/99 10   As my memo spells out, Board staff and New York staff see reasonable potential for   reserve needs to grow during the fourth quarter by around $100 billion I want to be clear   that that is not a forecast; it is a scenario I’d also like to be clear that my own seat-of-the-  pants judgment is that our range of potential error is about the same size; that is, reserve   needs might be $50 billion or they might be $150 billion I don’t know how I could tell you   with any confidence where reserve needs are going to fall within that band If they come in   at $50 billion, that will be just terrific and we won’t have the kind of strain that I’m   concerned about If they come in at $150 billion, triple the amount we’ve ever injected into   the banking system at a time of peak demand for reserves, we will face some considerable   challenges   As I outlined in the memo, but perhaps I should have given some more emphasis to   this, the supply of Treasury securities and straight agency debt in which we conduct our   temporary operations is going to be subject to some considerable demand The entire   private sector is going to be engaged in a flight to quality and will be looking for liquidity   There was an article in yesterday’s Wall Street Journal about the many corporate issuers   who were so proud of themselves for borrowing all the money they need through year-end   in the third quarter instead of the fourth quarter Nowhere in the article did it mention what   they were going to do with that money now that they’ve borrowed it They aren’t going to   put it under their mattresses! They are going to try to put it in Treasury bills or in short-term   deposits and make the banks put it in Treasury bills I’d also like to underscore the fact that   foreign central banks are busy changing their operating procedures in order to accept US   Treasury securities as collateral for their open market and discount window lending   operations So the whole world is thinking that around the year-end the place to be is in   US Treasuries and, as a close substitute for that, straight agency debt--precisely the   markets we have relied upon for our collateral   Therefore, I’d like to expand the pool of collateral that we can accept in our temporary   operations around the year-end In framing this proposal we focused on the language of the   Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations itself  That authorization allows the   Desk to operate in all US Government securities, “securities that are direct obligations of,   or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States”   Significantly, that would include mortgage-backed securities that are agency pass-throughs     8/24/99 11   because they are “guaranteed as to principal and interest” and thus would fall within the   scope of the Authorization There are two constraints on our ability to do this One   constraint is the Desk’s own custody systems and our competence in valuing mortgage-  backed securities I’m not trying to disparage my colleagues and our staff, but we simply   have never developed the skills to value mortgage-backed security collateral We do not   have the custody systems And I blush to think what kind of supplemental budget authority   I’d have to request for the second half of the year to try to build those systems, which   probably would be impossible, or to acquire the necessary staff, which would be nearly   impossible   The other constraint relates to the 1977 “Guidelines,” which in practical effect   constrain us in two ways First, because of the structure of the Authorization for Domestic   Open Market Operations, we presume that we can conduct temporary operations only to the   extent that we can conduct outright operations Since the Authorization limits the types of   securities that can be used as collateral in our repo operations to those securities that are   eligible for purchase--and since the Guidelines set rather low thresholds for outright   operations in federal agency securities--that restriction would carry over and constrain our   temporary operations In today’s market, however, when we accept collateral we simply   aren’t in a position to pick and choose the collateral dealers offer us or to set very precise   limits on that collateral That is not how the repo market works today The other principal   effect of the Guidelines is that they effectively preclude us from operating in GNMA   securities, which is particularly counter-intuitive given the structure of the three major   agencies   Therefore, in order to expand the pool of collateral during the fourth quarter and early   in the first quarter, we need to set up tri-party custodian arrangements with the two major   clearing banks, Chase and Bank of New York The entire dealer community uses these two   banks; half of them are with one and half are with the other And we would simply try to   piggyback in this very short time horizon on their existing tri-party custody arrangements   As noted in my memo, this would be more or less identical to the arrangements we currently   have with Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt for the management of our euro-denominated   German government securities posted as collateral on the repos through which we invest   System and Treasury foreign currency reserves     8/24/99 12   I should add, as mentioned in my memo, that the tri-party custody arrangement would   also permit us to take Treasury STRIPS, which our current systems are not configured to do,   also expanding somewhat the pool of collateral I guess that about summarizes the major   points So, focusing on this first request, my view is that suspending the 1977 Guidelines   until April 30, 2000, as I mentioned at the outset, would give us a window of opportunity to   expand the collateral pool so we can hope to meet the year-end upside risks Then, as I say,   we would review at the time of the March meeting the tri-party arrangements and all our   operations in agency securities before the temporary authority lapses I’d be happy to   answer questions on the reserve needs or on this proposal   As you may recall, in my August 17 memo I proposed that the   Committee act upon my request with the understanding that we would still adhere to the   principles incorporated in those first two paragraphs I suggested that a statement to that   effect could be included in the minutes of this meeting I’m agnostic about the precise   wording on which the Committee votes The Secretary of the Committee may have a view   I’d be happy to suspend only paragraphs three through six of the document   It is identical in spirit to what I was suggesting in my August 17   memo I’d be happy not to suspend those first two guidelines   The Treasury is forecasting its total cash balance at roughly double   what it was last year I’m not expert in this; Don Kohn or someone on his staff may be   better qualified to respond, but $20 billion of that has to do with the rules Congress passed   for--  So that bumps the level up considerably Then the rest is a safety   buffer for the Treasury   Let me underscore that our problem in this area is that the Treasury’s   starting point, when they told us about this, was that they were going to put all this cash   comfortably in Treasury Tax & Loan (TT&L) accounts I just don’t believe it is going to sit   there I think the banks are going to push that back to us I might even be more comfortable   if the Treasury were to leave some rather large share of that cash on our balance sheet That   would put us in a better position to reduce the volatility of day-to-day fluctuations stemming   from what comes out of the TT&L accounts and what comes back to us   Yes, but the TT&L banks will have to have additional-­  That’s right If the cash is in the TT&L system, the banks have to have   collateral against that; and if it is on our balance sheet, we’ll have to get collateral   somewhere It won’t be one-for-one in Treasury bills There will be a little more supply out   there, but the asset side of the balance sheet-­  Yes   Yes   We have been doing some thinking about this in New York One   issue that is novel, at least in my thinking in the last month, is that if currency is going to   flow more quickly through the banking system--that is, when banks draw on us and the cash   goes out--there will be less of a benefit in holding vault cash That’s because, having moved   to lagged reserve accounting, they actually take a debit They ask for cash from the Fed and   they have to pay us, so that’s a debit to reserves They get the cash in their vault and it     8/24/99 15   counts four weeks later If it’s moving faster through the system, that vault cash is never   there to be counted as reserves for them If it’s still on hand it can be counted, but if it is   flowing more quickly-- I don’t fully understand the implications of that yet, but we think   there may be a little difference in how we view that   Yes, I think you’re right There are a lot of uncertainties here   Turning to Item B, I would like to ask the Committee to amend the   Authorization permanently to give the Desk authority to operate for periods of up to 90 days   in our repurchase agreement operations To be candid, as my memo says, with the benefit   of hindsight I wish I had asked for that authority last year when the Committee raised the   maximum maturity on repos to 60 days I think the normal difficulties we face over almost   every year-end period would be well met by 90-day repos The 90-day term is also the   standard in the marketplace and I see no reason why we should intentionally be different   from the standard market practice If we had a good reason, I’d be happy for our practices   to be different, but I think there is some benefit in trying to operate in a way that is   consistent with market practice And particularly this year, we would like to start to address   the buildup of pressures as we approach the year-end through term operations that would   roll off in early October and then extend them through the end of February As I said, I   wish I had asked for 90 days when we discussed this last year I think it is the right place   for us to be permanently in any event So I’d like to ask for 90-day authority   Item C, to amend temporarily the Authorization for Domestic Open   Market Operations to authorize reverse repurchase agreements, I would like to try to explain   in some detail     8/24/99 17   Matched sale purchases and reverse repurchase agreements are functionally equivalent   transactions But the prior view in the System had been that we were only authorized to do   matched sale purchases and not reverse repurchase transactions In recent years, as I think   the various memos in your package explained, the evolving view was that reverse repos are   within our authority The dealers have for many years been strongly urging us to move   from the matched sale paradigm to the reverse repo paradigm Our outside auditors have   been pressing us to do this They are much more comfortable with the accepted market   practice of reverse repos and would like us to get away from the involved accounting   methodology used for matched sale transactions The legal memos in the package suggest   that the switch would be acceptable to our lawyers, though recognizing that it would be a   change from a prior view   Let me be clear that I have been planning for some time to ask the Committee for the   authority to do reverse repurchase transactions--as you can see from the dates of the memos   --in conjunction with the Desk’s acquisition and development of a new trading and   processing system We are currently finishing up a proposal that we will be bringing to the   Board to seek approval to spend the monies on a new system As part of putting in place a   new system, I had been intending to ask for this authority However, we won’t be able to do   reverse repos as part of our regular operations until we build a new system, which will be at   least 18 months or 2 years from whenever we begin and maybe longer We plan to have a   phased introduction of the new system in all our operations   Now, in considering the use of tri-party arrangements, we realized rather early on in   our thinking that tri-party operations offer us the opportunity to operate later in the day, as   Cathy Minehan has already alluded to, on both the add and the drain sides The add side   presents us with no particular problem; we can pursue that as we talk to the clearing banks   But on the draining side, if we are trying to get this done for year-end and just want to   piggyback on their existing systems, there is no possibility of getting the dealers and the   clearing banks to rebuild their systems They might not want to do it anyway, but there is   certainly no prospect of accomplishing it ahead of the Y2K date change to accommodate our   current matched sale accounting system   So if we want to pursue the development of a contingency plan--and I want to be very   clear that I’m not certain we can make this work, though I’m hopeful that it could be a     8/24/99 18   useful tool for us--it will depend on some systems we haven’t yet built And it will depend   on the willingness of the dealers to accommodate us late in the day, to change their balance   sheets in response to our needs If there’s too much liquidity in the banking system, they   ought to be willing to do that, but I don’t want to pretend to you that I can go out and make   this happen all by myself However, to do that we would need to adopt the reverse   repurchase authority so that we could do those transactions through tri-parties Given that   we’re not going to be able to put this in our new system for at least a couple of years,   temporary authority to do reverse repos is certainly what we need just to get us through the   fourth and the first quarters But you are on notice that I’m interested in this for the long   run, too We can see how it goes over the turn-of-the-year period   So, I’d like to ask the Committee to amend temporarily the Authorization for   Domestic Open Market Operations to authorize reverse repurchase transactions by adding   the language shown as paragraph 1(c) in Attachment VIII of my August 17 memo   Mr Chairman, turning to Item D, I’d like to ask for temporary   authority to sell options on repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase transactions, and   matched sale purchase transactions through the end of January 2000 The language, which   we will come to, was in Don Kohn’s memo to you of yesterday, which was included in your   packages last night Let me give my views on this and explain why we’re seeking this   authority   As the Chairman said at the outset, there is a small risk of some extreme events at the   end of the year that I think it prudent for us to lean against From my perspective, I’d just   like to offer the view that to a certain extent we are seeing some expectations among market   participants that are already a problem There is a problem now Cathy Minehan referred to   it and the Chairman was alluding to it   Yes, I understand I just want to focus on the problem that we already   see today of growing levels of anxiety and uncertainty on the part of financial   intermediaries, both banks and securities firms, which they are communicating to their   customers in ways that are very unhelpful Let me elaborate on that The banks are telling   their customers “We may apply quotas We may not take your deposits We may give you   a zero or negative interest rate” And securities firms are telling their customers “Don’t   count on us; we may not be able to finance you in the last week of December Go look   elsewhere” And that is creating uncertainties about the functioning of financing markets,   particularly repo markets, in the weeks around the year-end which go beyond the problem   just of how much collateral we can get   One of my motives for this request is to try to put some limit on the upside risk of that   potential development It is not just a quantity issue That is, if the markets are not   functioning--if the dealers are not willing to be on both sides of the market for us in some   depth--regardless of the amount of collateral we’re prepared to extend, we may find it quite   difficult to carry out our objectives So I see appreciable risks that market conditions may   frustrate the Desk’s ability both to add and drain reserves in the period around the year-end   and to keep the funds rate trading around the Committee’s target I feel it would be     8/24/99 20   imprudent of me not to seek your approval for the tools that I believe are necessary for the   Desk to carry out the directive   As I outlined in my memo and as I mentioned, I think, at the May meeting, our having   the ability to write options on repos, reverse repos, and matched sale transactions could be   quite effective In my view it has not just a reasonable prospect but the greatest prospect of   enabling the Desk to carry out its mission in what could be extraordinarily illiquid markets   Whether or not something goes wrong in the markets, we are reasonably certain that these   markets will be very illiquid Now, whether some triggering event or some extreme   circumstance will occur is the risk we’re uncertain about, but I’m reasonably confident that   these markets will not be tame The idea, as my memo explained, is to auction options on   repos and matched sale purchases for exercise during the days or weeks immediately   surrounding New Year’s Day at rates that would be in some band around the Committee’s   fed funds target Now, I want to be candid about a dilemma we face I believe the greatest   impact this device could have is the announcement effect Its secondary impact would be in   actually providing low-cost assurance to the intermediaries that the money markets would   not become dysfunctional and that funds would be available in some band around the   Committee’s target rate However, it would be a measure of success of the program if very   few of these options were exercised If they are purchased, that will give the market some   comfort So if they are exercised, that would be fine; but it would be even better if market   players came to the conclusion that they didn’t need to exercise them   The dilemma is that, while I believe the greatest impact would be in the announcement   effect--at least I hope it would be--I’m not quite sure that we can develop the precise details   of the program I would like to ask you to approve without talking to the dealers I think we   need a candid back and forth flow of discussions with the dealer community on how to   structure this program We have some ideas I outlined them in my August 17 memo But   a practical issue is that we have to put a good face forward and show that we have some   confidence in announcing this and also work out the details with the dealers to make sure   this approach is really practical and will have the intended effect And thus Don’s memo to   you of last night indicates that we seek this rather broad authority--I’ll be candid about that-­  fully understanding that we’ll have to work out quite a few details to make it actually fly   I’d be happy to answer any questions I can about this request     8/24/99 21   If I could respond, President Parry, I think a major difference between   this institution and the private institution you’re referring to metaphorically is that our cost   of covering this option is quite different If a private firm were to write options on   financing, their cost of cover would be market-based They would have to find financing   out in the marketplace That is the risk of options to private participants  In this case, we   would only be writing options on our own balance sheet While there are upside risks in   terms of the growth of our balance sheet, and that’s obviously what I’m trying to constrain,   our cost of cover is not a real constraint I think the challenge for us is how to price the   premium sufficiently low, because in market-based terms we face no real risk here We   have some transactional risks There are risks, I want to be clear, but we don’t face the kind   of risk a private institution would face in providing this service And that is really why it   works at all  If we were a private institution, this would be a very risky undertaking Early   on in my thinking about this--this was a month or so ago--one dealer told me that a customer   approached them and asked them to provide an option on over-the-weekend financing for     8/24/99 23   December 31 The dealer thought about it and said “no” He said there was no premium   they could charge that customer that they would be prepared to have known publicly   because of how they saw the risks In their view, the risk to their reputation was too great   They would have to charge such a high premium that they didn’t want the charge for that   risk known in their customer base For our balance sheet, just the reverse is true It’s hard   to figure out how low to price this because we do not face a market-based risk of covering   the option I do think that makes a considerable difference in a comparison to a private   institution   I’m sure it would be appropriate if I thought we could do it You’ve   seen the confidence interval I have on my estimate of reserve needs for the fourth quarter   It’s around $100 billion I ask you to think for a moment how much better I could do in   trying to anticipate what the use of this program would be, especially where the ultimate   goal is not to have it used Our hope is to minimize the exercising of the options   Obviously, and I think my memo was candid about this, the problem of   setting a reservation price and what we would ask the dealers to bid for in the auction is a   major challenge and one of the primary reasons I want to talk to the dealer community I   think an auction sale is the right approach to take; the problem is how much to auction We   want to have it open; we want to have competitive bidding and a reservation price set quite   low I don’t have an absolute answer on what the right quantity is to auction each day or   how to conduct the auction Again, that is why I want to talk to the dealers So I want to   give you a scenario that’s in my mind but I don’t want you to think that I’m invested in any   one of the details   I would imagine that there would be a two-week period on either side of the year-end   in which the dealers could exercise overnight options either on matched sales, reverse repos,   or repos I’d say that sometime in October we would begin auctioning each day a set   quantity of overnight options for any one of those 20 business days One way of thinking of   the arithmetic would be that we might be prepared to put up to $200 billion on either side of   our balance sheet If we had 40 days’ worth of auctions, we’d be auctioning $5 billion a day   for each of the one-day overnight windows the dealers could bid on I think I will have to   put out some proposal like that as a straw man in talking to the dealers in order to get their   creative juices flowing on how to think about the reservation price  We want to set it very   low, but we don’t want the option to be a free good They will want it because it’s cheap,   but not because it’s free In earlier discussions about this I said I didn’t want them to think   it was as cheap as water, but under the drought circumstance I’ve learned that everything   has a price!   So it would be something like that I’d be tempted to begin discussions by talking   about setting a rather low limit It’s easier to raise the auction limits than lower them in that   environment I’m just trying to think about ways of creating an auction process the dealers   would participate in The idea of having a small amount auctioned each and every day   would be a way to get the dealers to anticipate their demands and not wait until the end--to   try to smooth out their demand and buy a little each day For this to be successful and   involve the right kind of pricing, it is not that I want to see the price start high, but I’d like to   see it trend lower as the market relaxes about the availability of year-end financing   Nevertheless, I want to be clear that I don’t know today what the right limits are I think     8/24/99 26   there are limits There are some very tricky issues we would have to think about, such as   what assets we would be putting out for doing the matched sales and whether we’d be doing   them through tri-parties or through our DVP system, which is why both are mentioned in   Don’s proposed paragraph   I mean to offer these as examples, because I believe the reactions are   likely to be quite diverse The anxieties of the major money center banks, and therefore of   the major bank dealers, tend to be focused on what to do with the surplus cash they’re going   to have They are afraid of being excessively liquid So I think they would likely buy in on   the cash-put collateralized option drawn on us My hope is that that would permit them to   be less obnoxious in talking to their customers about the risks of zero or negative overnight   interest rates on corporate deposit accounts because the banks would be more confident that   they can pay some kind of market-based rate So that’s a behavior we do want to see   changed On the dealer side, the premier dealers in the world have been telling customers   not to count on them for financing around year-end and it’s making their corporate   customers very anxious I think the behavior change we’d like to see among the major   dealers is that they would be less obnoxious in telling their customers to go away and not   count on them to finance their inventory of securities during the last two weeks of   December and the first two weeks of January So those are the two behaviors I know I want     8/24/99 27   to change I agree with you that there are bound to be other behaviors that would change   that I haven’t anticipated But those are the two I’m aiming at; I’m trying to get the   intermediaries to behave more like intermediaries and less like risk avoiders My hope   would be that the markets would behave more as we would like them to   Forgive me for interrupting, but I would like to underscore what Don   just said I think the only reason to do this is to have the dealers pass the benefits through   directly or indirectly There are accounting issues that I'm not going to be able to think   through here as to how this would all work, but we will strongly impress on the dealers that   they are to make the benefits of this available to their customers That’s the purpose of the   exercise It is not to have the dealers sleep better at night while their customers don’t   Could I add a comment?  In your package of charts, page 10 is a   background chart that I did not discuss but would like to point out to you, President Hoenig   I have given some considerable thought to adverse consequences, and the one I’m most   concerned about is whether we would discourage market intermediation in some way when,   in fact, we’re trying to encourage it I’ve at least thought through what the worst perverse   consequences would be if we discouraged market intermediation and arbitrage   opportunities   What the chart shows, starting from October 15 of last year across the   top panel and March 23 of this year across the bottom, are the rates on repos on Treasury     8/24/99 29   collateral in blue, the rates on mortgage-backed securities collateral in red, and the morning   federal funds rate The latter is based on an informal survey we take in the morning that   tells us where funds are trading There is an extraordinary correlation here, which is   wonderful to see; it shows that markets work and arbitrage takes place Most of the spikes   on the chart are at month-end or on Treasury refunding dates or tax payment dates It’s all   rather predictable behavior I’m drawing it to your attention to show that even in the chaos   of last fall, shown at the upper left, the range in which these repo rates moved during the   morning, the most active time of the day, was contained at 425 to 575 percent And that   even includes the period through the year-end last year, and I’m sorry that precise date isn’t   shown So, in my memo I discussed a 150 basis point corridor on either side of the then-  existing funds rate target That’s something we will want to talk about I think it is going to   be hard for it to be any tighter, with the precedent of the special lending facility on the one   hand and the coincidence of the negative 150 basis points, which is our minimum bid when   we lend out securities and put out collateral So if we were to do matched sales and put   collateral out at a tighter spread, I think we would be creating some perversions Now, I   want to be able to talk to the dealers about this and think about it As you can see, the   corridor in which rates actually vary is very narrow So a range of 150 basis points is   considerably wider than the range in which normal arbitrage takes place Therefore, with   respect to the issue of the most perverse unintended consequence, I think anything like the   spreads we’re going to talk about is really going to be the disaster insurance We’re trying   to offer the market disaster insurance to get them more comfortable intermediating within   that range I just wanted to be clear that we’ve done some of the work here   I’m not aware of any that are using this in their management of   domestic interest rates I know the ECB has made a point of saying that they have the   authority to use all instruments; if they want to use options and other derivatives they can   They have often stated that they have the full arsenal of weapons if they need it A number   of central banks use options in their investment activities in foreign currencies, in managing     8/24/99 31   their foreign currency reserves and limiting the risks The Bank of Mexico uses a   nonsymmetric option in its intervention strategy That is, when they’re accumulating   reserves they do it through an option that avoids having their operations exert an impact on   the day’s price In other words, it is always backward looking When the exchange rate   strengthens, they accumulate a few reserves The bank’s exercise of options is one-sided I   may be mistaken, but I’m simply not aware of any central banks that use options for   domestic interest rate management   I think there is that risk today in our money market, which is why   we’re proposing these extraordinary measures As I alluded to earlier, the Bank of Japan   wants to find ways to be sure it can take US Treasuries as collateral when they lend yen to   their banks European banks and others are doing the same thing The world is focusing on   our money markets and financing markets as their adjustment mechanism I think that’s   where some of the pressures are coming from that we’re seeing So, yes, if we’re trying to   address our money market problems, I think there is a risk that the benefits and the demands   will spread beyond our nation’s markets But that’s the reality we confront to begin with, so   I don’t think we can do anything about it   I didn’t mean to say it should be viewed as a risk It may be good that   somebody in this whole world is going to do this But these are the implications   That is even more challenging than the reservation price My guess is   that we will go out with a proposal of $200 billion, as I suggested, telling the market that   with the Committee’s review and approval we might raise that limit if we saw a demand I   would try to go out with a program involving a limited number of contracts per day and tell     8/24/99 32   them they should price accordingly, but give them notice that there’s a risk that the quantity   could be raised if we saw the demand   There’s an interaction of limits and pricing   As I say, it should be low enough so that we are making insurance   available to the market to calm it down but high enough to provide some constraint on   demand   Exactly   It’s my recollection that the publication of the primary dealer list is a   consequence of the New York Fed asking the dealers to report to us their inter-dealer   transactions  The dealers said, in effect, “We’d love to report our inter-dealer transactions;   you just have to tell us who the other dealers are” And that is how we got backed into   having a list It has already occurred to me that we will want to ask the dealers--“ask”   politely--to report to us secondary market transactions on similar contracts so we can keep   track of the pricing     8/24/99 33   It is with that in mind, though my plans are a little inchoate, that I have   thought of auctioning set amounts each day That way there will be a price today, but more   will be coming online tomorrow and more will be coming online the next day   Yes, precisely   Absolutely That is another reason daily auctioning somehow seems   preferable to me   No, I mean to set a minimum price We don’t want people to put in a   bid of zero or $1 at the auction We’d have a minimum or reservation price and they would   bid upward from there   I don’t think so   Because we are uncertain about the supply--whether we are going to   provide an unlimited supply That is, we haven’t yet figured out-­  I just mean that we are talking about a reservation price because we are   uncertain about whether we are going to set an upside limit on the supply and, if so, where   Those are two ways of talking about the same thing I am agreeing with you, I think, Mr   Chairman   I alluded to the timing--probably too briefly--in my memo of August   17 I believe it is very important for us to work with the custody banks, BONY and Chase,   before we go public, so we can set a reasonable date certain on when we could begin tri­  party operations We would propose to begin immediately, tomorrow morning, working   with the two clearing banks in the hope that over the next business week and a half we could   resolve the various issues Then we would be in a position shortly after Labor Day to   announce at least a date certain My hope is that by the first full week of October--for the   reserve management needs I mentioned earlier--we will be laying in the 90-day RPs so that   we could begin tri-party operations in the broader collateral pool then Now, that’s my   hope We want to work out some of the nuts and bolts details with the clearing banks so we   can announce with certainty that we will be doing tri-party operations, using the collateral   pool, and doing 90-day repos   So, a day or two after Labor Day, we certainly will be announcing that we have the   authority We would begin working with the senior leaders among the dealers about the   same time we would be making public that we have this authority and plan to offer these   options We would be developing the details with the dealers, and I would hope to be able   to conduct the auctions on the models I’m roughly thinking of, if not by the first full week   of October, by the middle of October That would give us roughly two months of     8/24/99 35   auctioning until we get to the period when these options are likely to be exercised by the   dealers in the last two weeks of December   Thank you  "
6425,1999-10-05," Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to the package of colored   charts that should be in front of you 1/   I offer the array of forward rates shown in the first chart as a precaution  against any thought that there is a simple, single description of interest rate  expectations, given the pronounced Y2K effects we’re seeing in conjunction with  some shifts in expectations about the outlook around the world In broad brush  strokes, you can see in the top panel of this chart that US rates drifted sideways  after your last meeting and then moved a bit lower before ticking up late last week  on some data releases that suggested continued strength in demand in the US  economy Euro rates have moved up more or less consistently since your last  meeting And they increased quite a bit at the end of last week, as forecasts for Euro  area growth were revised up and as the market became filled with the thought that  the European Central Bank might actually raise rates before the end of this year  Japanese forward rates generally declined throughout the period and were down  substantially until the speculation around the time of the Bank of Japan’s September  21st policy meeting created some noise But clearly, the show was stolen by the  current 3-month Libor rates, which are usually the sleepy flat line at the bottom  As  we moved into the fourth quarter and the end dates of that contract included the turn  of the year--both the December 31st and January 3rd dates--those rates shot up Now,  this may be just a brief effect and may calm down a bit, as we have seen with other  Y2K spikes over the past year I hope so, but I don’t think we know in any way for  certain   There is also, as you can see particularly in the Euro rate chart, a sort of  fanning out of these rates as one reflection of the uncertainty Anecdotally our  traders report, as we have moved into the fourth quarter, increasingly diverse pricing  by our counterparties for a number of instruments--sort of idiosyncratic firm  approaches to pricing for the year-end Some firms think one thing is going to  happen and other firms think something completely different is going to happen So  a lot of the data sources we look at--the data points we take off of Bloomberg, for  example--are going to be the blended averages of some very disparate rates as firms  take increasingly idiosyncratic approaches to the uncertainties about the year-end  And I think we should be even more cautious than usual in interpreting these interest  rate charts   1/ A copy of the material used by Mr Fisher is appended to the transcript     10/5/99 2   Turning to the second page, the top panel shows exchange rates since the start  of the year yen per Euro in green; yen per dollar in red on the left-hand scale; and  dollars per Euro in blue on the right-hand scale Interestingly, the two scales happen  to match in percentage terms with a slightly different location of the decimal When  I look at this chart, what I see is the herding behavior of Japanese institutional  investors rushing back into the yen in the third quarter You can see the shift  beginning at the time of our meeting on June 30th Now, it may be that economic  fundamentals change abruptly with calendar quarters, but to my way of thinking it is  much more likely that it is investor behavior that changes abruptly with calendar  quarters I don’t know what to expect with this change of calendar quarters, but  when I look at the third-quarter picture I see a rush of Japanese investors back into  the yen   The bottom panel depicts 1-month option implied volatilities on each of these  exchange rate pairs If there are anxieties being expressed in foreign exchange  markets, those anxieties to me seem focused on the yen and not the dollar, at least so  far this year As you can see, the green and red yen-based volatilities tracked one  another and spiked as we came to the end of the third quarter The euro/dollar  implied volatilities traded at a rather calm pace   Turning to page 3 and domestic open market operations, during the three  maintenance periods since your last meeting, with the exception of last Thursday  and Friday, the fed funds market behaved in a fairly typical and calm manner The  deviation of the effective rate from the target and the intra-day volatility, expressed  in the standard deviation, were both moderate and similar to the experience of other  recent months Last Thursday, September 30th, was actually a fairly typical month- end day Friday, October 1st, also a day of big flows in the market, was a little less  typical We ended up providing sufficient reserves on the day to have the effective  rate trade on the target, as you can see with the red horizontal tick right on the dotted  line But in doing so we clearly provided a sufficiency of reserves that was more  than the market looked for in terms of the standard deviation, and we had a very  wide trading range and a whopping 60 basis points standard deviation of the trading  range But that’s in effect what it takes to try to get the fed funds rate to trade on  average at the target on a day of volatile payment flows   I’d just note that currency in circulation has continued to grow at a rather  rapid clip of about 10 percent per year That is consistent with the rates we have  seen this year, but well ahead of past years I don’t know about the Board’s staff,  but we have not found any evidence suggesting that consumer demand for currency  is Y2K-related We do see what appears to be some stockpiling of currency by  small banks in anticipation of consumer demand, but we don’t yet see anything we  could pinpoint as indicative of consumer demand for notes   Turning to the next page, the fourth chart depicts spreads on selected longer- term instruments to comparable US Treasuries I included this chart to emphasize  the noticeable impact on September 8th when we announced our special year-end     10/5/99 3   operations and again on September 14th when we had a meeting with the primary  dealers to discuss the details of our operation and get some feedback You can see  that both of those events seemed to have had a pronounced effect, particularly on  mortgage-backed spreads, the 10-year swap spread, and the Fannie Mae benchmark,  but they obviously had hardly any effect on the corporate index I want to be careful  not to overstate the impact Our announcement came just a few days after Labor  Day when traders were coming back and were likely to bring more volume into the  market The backup in spreads that occurred in the thin markets of late August was  going to unwind at some point in September absent some exogenous shock We  may have just provided a bit of the impetus to pull the spreads down a bit--and a  little more quickly than they might have come down otherwise But all in all we  were pleased with the market reaction to our announcement and we received quite a  lot of feedback on it   In the next few pages I have outlined some notes to try to take you through a  number of issues associated with our year-end operations Forgive me for this  format, but I thought it would be the most efficient way With respect to the  expanded collateral, tri-party, and longer-term operations, we’ve now completed the  legal documents The basic operational procedures are in place and we expect in the  next few days to be able to start the tri-party operations with a broader array of  collateral I want to be quite blunt that I think we are going to scuff our knees a few  times as we try to figure out the best way to do this We have different classes of  collateral, and a number of dealers have urged that we provide separate pricing for  each of the major types of collateral  At the same time, there is a difference between  tri-party settlement and fed-wire settlement, and some other dealers want us to price  that We cannot do all of those things at once It would just be an operational rat’s  nest if we tried to do all that So we are going to learn something from doing and  we will just try to get a feel for how we can slice the operations to try to let the  dealers price as efficiently as possible   Another point is that I’d like to announce the pricing details of the Desk’s  temporary operations By tradition, the Desk has not announced the lowest repo rate  at which we operate nor any details of dealer propositions The philosophy has been  that we’re managing quantities of reserves and that there is no operational--and  certainly no policy--significance to this stop-out rate, or lowest rate at which we  operate However, given the intense interest in turn-of-the-year financing rates and  to avoid rumors about rates paid on our operations, I’d like to begin announcing the  details of rates submitted in our operations, both for repos and matched sales It  would be possible to limit these announcements just to those operations that span  the year-end But I think trying to maintain that distinction would be awkward and  probably unsustainable given dealer interest in pricing other time horizons, not just  the turn-of-the-year period Moreover, a number of central banks now routinely  provide this information and, taking a step back and thinking about it, I concluded  that we also should provide this information I would plan to include a review of  this announcement practice in March of next year when we present the Committee  with a complete review of our year-end operations     10/5/99 4   At the top of page 6 I have listed in detail what we propose to announce after  each operation the range of repo rates submitted by dealers; the total volume of  propositions submitted; the stop-out rate, ie the lowest repo rate accepted; the  volume-weighted average of repo rates accepted; and the volume of propositions  that we accepted, and thus the reserves we injected The latter we have been  announcing for some time now We would make similar announcements on the  breakdown of information on matched sales used in reserve draining operations  And, obviously, if we have different classes of pricing, we would make the  announcements for each class of collateral that we price   Turning to the standby financing facility in the options proposal, we received  a number of comments from the dealers and we sent the dealers another revision to  that program last Wednesday, which I circulated to you in memo form last  Wednesday I would plan to announce the details of those auctions also Along  with the results of the auctions, we would provide pricing information to the dealers,  the range of bids submitted, the volume of bids submitted, the lowest bid accepted-­ which in the Dutch auction would be where all awards are priced--and the volume- weighted average of all accepted bids Consistent with our practice of announcing  the amount of reserves injected, we would also plan to announce the dollar volume  of options exercised each day during the period of time when options can be  exercised   We’ve received from the dealer community and from other market  participants a fairly wide range of indications of the potential demand for these  options If one listened to the money market mutual fund managers and some of the  big corporate players in financing markets, one would think we would be writing  $100 billion or $150 billion of these options Making a guesstimate on the basis of  listening to the CFOs of dealer firms, the number of options we would write would  measure roughly in the tens of billions, probably in the several tens of billions If  one listened just to the repo dealers, who are very picky and think these things are  deeply out of the money and rather a nuisance, they suggest that we might need to  provide an amount in the $5 billion to $20 billion range So we have a full range of  reactions from the market Just in the last few days, in response to our revised  proposal, we’ve gotten the sense of the demand going up a little even in the CFO  community--the ones who really do want to take out the flood insurance And I  think we’ve structured this whole package on the premise that we’re going to meet  demand We’re going to sell enough for that constituency to be comfortable So,  we may need to revise up the amounts for our initial auction that I put in the revision  last week and make those a little higher Inevitably, we’re going to need to adjust to  the demand as it becomes evident in the first auction and over the series of auctions  But I’d like to be clear, since meeting demand is one of our objectives, that an  unfilled auction is not going to be an embarrassment but one sign of success We’re  not looking for a high bid-to-cover ratio here but rather the opposite We’re trying  to meet the communities’ demand   After we have launched the expanded collateral and tri-party operations and  the stand-by financing facility auctions on repos, we will then turn our attention and     10/5/99 5   the dealers’ attention to the practicalities of late-day operations and possibly provide  options on matched sale transactions As I noted on the last page of my package,  some dealers and some money market fund managers have continued to press us to  write options on matched sales and reverse repos The longer one scratches the  surface of that, though, it is clear that the impulse behind that request is the desire of  the money market funds to save a few basis points It really isn’t an issue of the  functioning of markets; they’d just rather get a slightly higher rate of return We  will continue to listen to their views once we get the other pieces in place and will  talk about this some more But my interest has shifted to just trying to ensure that  we have the flexibility to add or drain reserves on any day Even some of the money  market fund managers admit that if we are leaving the market roughly in balance  each day, that really addresses their concern, even if we are not addressing their  individual set of leaky pipes, if you will   But if demand for Treasury securities becomes sufficiently high to push the  general collateral rate on overnight repos toward zero for a prolonged period of  time, that could create a negative spillover on confidence and the functioning of  financing markets If that were the case, we might then want to consider  undertaking matched sale or reverse repo transactions in order to add to the supply  of Treasury collateral available in the market But we’d look at the systemic issue  of the functioning of the markets, not whether some money market funds feel they  are missing out on a few basis points in their return   Mr Chairman, we had no foreign exchange operations during the period I  will need the Committee’s ratification of our domestic operations I would be happy  to answer questions on any aspect of my report, including our year-end operations   Earlier this summer we raised the amounts we’re auctioning off through that   program and it is in a sense on autopilot Without getting too far into the arcana, that program   actually is one of the things I’m worried about We price that at a negative spread, 150 basis points   off of the general collateral rate If the general collateral rate were to trade down toward zero   because of the scarcity of Treasury collateral, we could be running with a negative rate there, which   we would have to think through That’s not somewhere we’d want to go While that’s on autopilot   and will be available to the dealers, it really will not address a systemic issue--if, say, all Treasury   securities were trading at such a premium that they were being financed at rates approaching zero   It helps at the margin, but it is not going to be an answer That’s one of the issues of concern We   are consistently providing supply through that program at predictable amounts, which we spent a     10/5/99 6   long time designing it to do The dealers are happy with that If we divert our supply of Treasury   bills into some intervention in the market, we’ll then be crimping what we can put out through that   structured program So that’s exactly one example of the issues that create complexities for us in   the matched sale area   I think two factors are involved that are hard to put one’s finger on Traders   at many different firms have talked to us about the fact that our options program provided them   some relief but in their minds provided the Committee with more flexibility to raise rates in   November and December As I say, they talk about that, but it is hard to find evidence of it in the   fed funds futures pricing The other factor is that as we approached September 30th, a whole host   of contracts--like the 3-month Libor I showed on my first chart--then captured the year-end date   And all sorts of rates traded up in sympathy with that year-end pressure--some rationally and some   maybe not so rationally I think that had a general and pervasive effect on a lot of interest rate   pricing Those are the two stories that I can cite   The dealer firms certainly now feel a little more comfortable that they have   a flexible tool or “flood insurance” to manage their balance sheets at the end of the year I think   that has put them in the position that they can’t turn around and tell their customers, “Gee, we just   can’t do anything for you” It has forced that discussion, rather awkwardly, clearly onto price   That may be having a spillover effect in some of the interest rate markets It is all about price now;   it’s not about availability That’s how I would put it   I’m sorry I got that term in my mind in late August and I should take it out   again I have some neighbors who had some serious flood damage who didn’t have flood   insurance     10/5/99 7  "
6448,1999-11-16," Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to the usual set of  charts and some additional materials that should be on the table in front of you 1/   As usual, the top chart in the package shows the current 3-month deposit  rates implied by traded forward rate agreements Looking at the top panel of the  first chart, you can see that in the United States forward rates continued to back  up after your last meeting and peaked with the release of the CPI on October 19th  They have been declining since then, particularly on the release of third-quarter  GDP data and the ECI Thus, 3-month expected rates for most of next year are  now at the same levels as they were just prior to the Committee’s meeting in  October   In Europe, forward rates have roughly the same pattern, but moved up to  twin peaks on the release of our CPI and the release of Euro area M3 data on  October 27th; they also have come off their peaks Thus, despite a 50 basis point  rate increase on November 4th by the ECB, expected 3-month rates in Europe for  next year are now at the same levels as in early October It seems to me that what  has happened in Europe is that one or two rate increases that for some time had  been expected to occur in the first half of next year have been brought forward  into November of this year and nothing else has changed   In Japan, despite interest in political circles in Bank of Japan policy  meetings, you can see from the bottom panel that forward rate expectations took  quite little notice of those meetings However, there has been an updrift in the  current LIBOR 3-month rate, the black line in that panel This appears to reflect  some increased tiering in yen money markets of the type we have seen in past  years but it is not yet anywhere nearly as severe It also suggests, as I understand  from our traders, some shifting back and forth in views about who will and who  won’t be lending money over the end of the year, causing changes in expected  rates for the turn of the year in Japan   Turning to the second page, the top panel shows 10-year yields in the United  States, the United Kingdom, and Germany On the left side--the little numbers   1/ A copy of the material used by Mr Fisher is appended to the transcript     11/16/99 2   there are basis points--are the 2- to 10-year spreads on July 1st and on the right  side are the 2- to 10-year spreads as of last Friday What I enjoy about this chart  in particular, as it relates to what is of interest to me, is how little I understand  about what’s going on here German and other Continental yields began to rally  just ahead of, but through the release of Euro area M3 data, which to all observers  were higher than expected But the bond markets took off on a nice rally that  continued with the release of our GDP data and then continued through the 50  basis point ECB rate increase Now, this has been explained different ways in  Europe Most have focused on the idea that uncertainty about near-term ECB  intentions has been removed and a related perception that the ECB is now on  hold Another theory is that the ECB has gained credibility by being pre-emptive  and is now ahead of the curve   The first theory uncomfortably suggests to me that the uncertainty premia for  anticipated central bank actions have a larger positive basis point impact on long- term rates than does an actual central bank rate increase For the second argument  about credibility to hold water, Europe would have to be more sensitive to short- term rates than to long-term, because otherwise the decline in long-term yields  would undermine the restraining influence of short-term rates But throughout my  career and through current events, my colleagues in Europe have always told me  that Europe is more sensitive to long-term rates than those silly Anglo Saxon  economies that are so focused on short-term rates So, I am not quite sure how  the credibility argument plays here either   Looking at the United Kingdom, it’s intriguing how the 10-year gilt yield has  marched along with German and other Continental yields despite the fact that  these countries are at very different points in the economic cycle To draw a point  on it, the 2- to 10-year spread in the UK is inverted to the tune of 85 basis points  while the German spread, as you can see, is positive from 2- to 10-years in the  amount of 115 basis points Notwithstanding the economies being at different  points in the cycle, these yields are marching along rather in lock step Maybe the  rally in gilts is what is pulling Continental yields lower   Looking at US yields, I’d just note that with 2- to 10-year spreads having  narrowed from 26 basis points on July 1st to 15 basis points last Friday--and I  think to 12 basis points this morning--one might understand that there are few if  any voices in our bond market who are prepared to join the “bubble-ologists” in  proclaiming that the Fed is behind the curve   Looking down the page, the next three panels depict yield spreads of various  instruments over US Treasuries In the first of these three panels you can see  that the emerging market index spreads to US Treasuries have been narrowing  consistently since last summer’s highs; and they have narrowed by an additional  150 basis points since the October release of the CPI In the next panel you can  see that the spread of the Merrill Lynch high yield index, or junk bond index, to  Treasuries has been relatively stable but has widened recently, moving in just the     11/16/99 3   opposite direction of the emerging market spreads Market talk is focused on an  explicit shift of funds out of US high-yield instruments into emerging market  high-yield instruments and also on increased sensitivity to rising default rates in  domestic high-yield markets Finally, in the last panel you can see that spreads on  10-year swaps and the Fannie Mae benchmark have come off their recent highs of  last summer and returned more or less to the levels of early July And corporate  spreads are off their highs, but are still just a tad wider than in July   Turning to the third page and year-end funding markets, this chart shows the  three components of the current butterfly That is, it depicts the November,  December, and January LIBOR 1-month contracts As you can see, the decline in  the December contract from late October to mid-November has been noticeable  That seems to reflect at least a couple of things coming together First, in an  exaggerated way the December contract follows the same pattern as the  November and January contracts, I think reflecting the ebb and flow of  expectations for rate action by the Committee, particularly following the release  of the GDP and ECI data However, it also seemed to get quite an impact from  our third round of auctions of options on November 3rd and particularly from our  announcement on November 4th that the Desk would hold four more rather than  only two more auctions   Turning to the next page, let me go over the details of each of the auctions  we’ve held The vertical columns give you for each of the three strips the actual  auction amounts, the total propositions, the bid-to-cover ratio, the awards we gave  out or the stop-out rates on a Dutch auction, and the high and low bids Having  told the dealers we would try to meet demand for these options, we felt a need to  respond to the high bid-to-cover ratios of the first two auctions In all cases these  were at rather elevated levels 4 to 1, 47 to 1, 64 to 1, etc So we raised the  amount sharply for the third auction, doubling the amounts for both the turn of the  year strip and for the January strip   While the bid-to-cover ratio came down in the third auction, the stop-out  rates and thus the Dutch awards came in quite high You can see that in the  awards column in the third entry in each panel 11 basis points, 16 basis points,  and 115 basis points So, after the third auction we left the amount for the turn of  the year strip constant at $50 billion but raised the amounts for the surrounding  strips We also announced that we would hold at least four more auctions for a  total of seven, rather than just two more for a total of five   We think this helped calm the dealers and their customers considerably,  as reflected both in the December LIBOR contract and in the much reduced stop- out rates for the fourth auction We’ve reduced the amounts for the fifth auction  to be held tomorrow for each of the three strips to $15, $30, and $20 billion and,  obviously, we will see how the subsequent auctions go     11/16/99 4   Looking forward, as I’ve mentioned previously, I would consider this  operation a complete success if none of these options is exercised The  motivating principle still seems valid to me that the more we sell, the less likely it  is that they will be exercised But there still is a risk that they will be exercised  If relatively small amounts are exercised on any one day for reasons specific to an  individual firm--its own funding position or its own collection of collateral--we  should be able to drain sufficient reserves to manage the impact on the funds rate  that day through our own matched-sales operations But if all, or even substantial  amounts, are exercised on any day it is harder to anticipate the impact on the  funds rate Any shock sufficient to cause a large-scale exercise of these options  can also be expected to have a profound impact on the funds rate and on other  short-term market interest rates So, it is hard to know in advance with any clarity  what it is we would be doing vis-à-vis that day’s funds rate In any event, if such  an exogenous shock were to happen, we would likely be trying to drain reserves  not to manage that day’s funds rate, but to try to moderate the impact on  cumulative excess reserves for the period--the impact over the rest of the period  But that is obviously something we’ll have to decide on a case-by-case basis   Turning to the next page and our more traditional open market operations,  the top panel depicts various forecast scenarios involving a cumulative reserve  drain from currency in circulation Reserve needs have continued to grow  recently--reflecting, it seems to us, typical seasonal growth in currency in  circulation and the strong demand from banks for increased vault cash in  anticipation of Y2K-related demands of the public Shown in the bottom dotted  line of this panel is the New York staff’s previous “low” projection for currency  in circulation We called that a base-case scenario in which we imagined there  would be no Y2K impact The higher dashed line is what we called a “high”  forecast--not a worst case scenario but just a strong Y2K effect The two solid  lines reflect how we’ve revised up both of those forecasts because the actual  levels have come in more or less right on track with our high, but not worst case,  forecast So, we’ve revised up our low forecast for currency by almost $20 billion  for the turn of the year, based on the experience we’ve seen through mid- November   In the bottom panel is a chart depicting the pricing of our long-term RPs Let  me give you a little background on that before I describe the chart We have  conducted five long-term tri-party RPs that run through the turn of the year,  totaling about $27 billion We have done more than 20 overnight and short-term  tri-party RPs In each of these RPs we have separately priced US Treasury  securities, agency debt, and mortgage-backed collateral and have carefully tried to  maintain a consistent relationship between our sense of current market rates for  each type of collateral and our stop-out rates, consciously choosing not to violate  the existing spreads   What is depicted in this chart is the cumulative propositions we’ve received  on all five of these long-term--through the year-end--RPs The vertical axis is the     11/16/99 5   dollar value expressed in millions; therefore, the top amount is $55 billion of  collateral propositions Across the horizontal axis is the deviation of the rates  given us from our sense of where market rates were for each type of collateral  So, the lower left corner represents 4 basis points above where we think market  rates are and, moving across that axis, the progression goes to 44 basis points  below our sense of market rates   In the table at the bottom is listed the collateral we accepted--about $137  billion of Treasuries, $22 billion of agency debt, and $105 billion of mortgage- backed collateral On average, our stop-out rate has been about 4 basis points  below our sense of where market rates were Now, some observers in the markets  have been disturbed about the quantity of Treasury collateral we have taken off  the market--$13 billion--through our year-end operations I felt pretty strongly  that we should not be disturbing the existing spread relationships unless we made  a very conscious decision to do that So we have been trying to take collateral as  the dealers have priced it And the fact of the matter is that the dealers have  shown us very lackluster--and they will concede greedy--pricing, particularly on  agency debt and to some extent on mortgage-backed collateral They have been  more aggressive in pricing the Treasury collateral to us We will continue to be  disciplined about this At some point the time may come when in order to calm  widening spreads we might intentionally change our behavior and take  disproportionate amounts of agency and mortgage-backed collateral My sense at  this point is that we would probably do that by simply reverting to one pricing In  that case the three types of collateral would all be given to us in one set of  propositions, which would automatically advantage the higher yielding collateral  But so far we’ve taken the spreads as we have found them rather than taking on  the job of setting the spreads ourselves   Finally, on the last page you can see that in the period since your last  meeting the fed funds rate has traded slightly on the soft side except in the last  couple of days, even though daily volatility has been relatively contained For my  taste, there appear to be too many unsatisfying explanations for this softness  rather than any single persuasive one Many have focused on our novel long-term  operations and the general perception that we will be generous about year-end  funding, but that doesn’t quite get me far enough to explain the softness in the  first two maintenance periods   In the last couple of days funds have been quite firm, and yesterday we had  an elevated effective rate of 56 percent, even though we had $10 billion of excess  reserves on the day But yesterday was quite an extraordinary day We had a  Treasury refunding, a minor corporate tax date, some security problems at Bank  of New York that delayed the close of the securities wire, and moves of 1/16th or  1/8th or so in the market in anticipation of Committee action today All those  factors contributed to a rather elevated rate yesterday And the hangover from  yesterday is with us today as the funds rate is trading at 5½ percent     11/16/99 6   Mr Chairman, we had no foreign exchange intervention operations during  the period I will need the Committee’s ratification of our domestic open market  operations and, of course, I’ll be happy to answer any questions   They would give us notice of exercise We would then do RPs with   them through the tri-party vehicle Anyone who exercised an option would have to deliver   collateral to the custody banks And we would then be putting out the funds to them through the   custody banks   Yes On the reserve adding side, we have looked at this to make sure   we have the capacity to do it We are still reviewing it but we think we can handle the exercise   of the options with no problems The question is going to be how many matched sales we can do   if we want to drain all the reserves back out again We are working on that There is a limit on   our bill portfolio Our traditional means of doing this is just against bills; we are mostly geared   up to do matched sales against bills, which involve easier pricing than against coupon securities   That is one issue we are looking into We are also looking into whether we can do matched sales   or reverse repos through the tri-party agents, as I mentioned at previous meetings There are   operational issues that are throwing some sand into the gears--which we had a faint fear of   before--causing us concern as to whether that will actually work The bigger constraint, I feel, is   whether we could do as much as $150 billion or $200 billion of matched sales to drain out the   reserves we’ve put in But I think it is possible that we will be able to drain amounts of around   $100 or $125 billion or maybe even $150 billion It will be a complicated operational exercise to   do it But we think the capability is there on both sides The quantity of the reserves to be   drained back out is the issue, not the exercise of the repos in the first instance   Absolutely That is just what I meant by my remarks that our   focus will really be on the impact on the cumulative average of excess reserves in the period As   to whether we will actually drain them all out that one day, I doubt it But we will try to if what     11/16/99 7   is involved is the sort of exogenous shock that you are imagining That is just what I meant We   would not be pretending that we know where the funds rate should be trading or that we are   trying to target it   Now, to get the scaling right, it’s important to keep in mind that the total balances   traded in the funds market run about $15 to $25 billion daily; $25 billion is more likely at year-  end Who knows what the upper range of the repo market is? But $600 billion and up is the   turnover in the repo market, so the scale there is quite extraordinary It is possible that once we   announce significant exercise of these options, the fed funds traders will realize the rate is going   to go to zero regardless of any exogenous shock That is, we will smother whatever pricing up   for fear may be there That is going to be in the minds of the fed funds traders and the bank   treasurers and it is very hard to anticipate   That is a likely scenario   Yes   It is the vault cash that clearly has exhibited an extraordinary buildup   As for the rest, we think of it as a slightly stronger than usual seasonal impact but still in the   range of the normal seasonal increase  "
6472,1999-12-21," Yes I wanted to elaborate a little on Louise Roseman’s memo to   Don Kohn about the unresolved difference between the internal accounting records of the   Markets Group Accounting and Control Unit and those reflected in the Integrated   Accounting System regarding the System’s net interest accruals on foreign currency   investments I thought it would be helpful if I gave a couple minutes of background, if you   will bear with me   Last spring, as members of the Committee will recall, we entered into a series of   transactions with the ESF to re-balance our euro and yen holdings so we could come to a   better split both in terms of total holdings and the currency mix This involved a number of   transfers of ownership of a series of investments and resulted in quite a significant amount   of accounting activity In the course of reviewing that, our own accounting staff identified   an error that had been introduced in the prior year in our treatment of the premium on bonds   held in the accrual account, overstating the accrual account by about $5 million In the   course of confirming that, they identified an additional $266 million overstatement in the   accrual account for interest on foreign currency investments We have had a number of staff   members working full time trying to trace the source of that $266 million overstatement   They have worked back through the records to December 1994, before which detailed   records at the transaction level just no longer exist due to the routine and appropriate   destruction of documents   The Board examiners were at our Bank to conduct an examination of the System   Open Market Account in September and PricewaterhouseCoopers also has looked over our   methodology to try to trace this overstatement back through time and find its source   PricewaterhouseCoopers is confident that we have traced it back as far as we can They     12/21/99 2   have tested our work papers and agree with our conclusion that we simply can’t go back any   further   There are two possible causes of this overstatement that we have to confront One is   the diversion of funds and the other is error Now, we cannot rule out the possibility of a   diversion of funds But people from our own audit function and from Pricewaterhouse-  Coopers have reviewed the control procedures we’ve had in place for the last decade and are   very comfortable with the conclusion that these control procedures are sufficiently robust   that the likelihood of diversion is remote It cannot be ruled out, but for diversion to have   occurred it would have had to involve the collusion of many people--just an extraordinary   number of people--on several different staffs If anything, our control procedures run a little   to the “belt and suspenders” direction in regard to control of the flow So, there is   reasonable confidence that no diversion of funds occurred The much more likely cause is a   simple accounting error  The failure to credit the accrual account when cash was received   would have left this account overstated But we have worked the accounting back as far as   we can take it and cannot find the erroneous entry or entries   Dave Sheehy, the New York Fed’s General Auditor, and I are both looking into a   fundamental reappraisal of our control procedures We have introduced an additional   mechanical check to maintain detailed records of the accrual stream by instrument, so that   when a final principal payment is received we can trace the record all the way back on each   instrument and double check the accounting   More fundamentally and more importantly, what troubles us is how we could have   gone for so many years without scrubbing this account more vigorously That is something   we are looking into and we are going to be revising our control procedures--both the audit   procedures and those in our own Markets Group The Board’s staff and our accounting   function at the New York Fed have worked out an accounting treatment to correct for both   the $5 million and the $266 million errors That involves reducing the accrued interest   asset account by the entire $316 million, with an offsetting reduction in interest income on   foreign currency investments We will make that adjustment before the end of the year and   spread it among all the Reserve Banks Of course, for all of us with responsibilities for   SOMA this is an embarrassing, indeed humbling, event As a technical matter, though, I   understand that PricewaterhouseCoopers is comfortable with the conclusion of both our     12/21/99 3   accounting and audit function and the Board staff that this is not a material event for   purposes of disclosure for any Reserve Bank I would be happy to try to answer any   questions   No, there is not   Yes, we have looked into that Many of the staff people are still at   the Bank, though others are not But we have found nothing of that nature   We only know that the difference existed prior to December 1994   The details certainly don’t exist for pre-December1994 records, so I   don’t know how we could determine the beginning point--in 1973 or 1963 or where Prior   to 1994, the only interest income we were receiving in that account was coming from the   BIS, the Bundesbank, and the Bank of Japan So the source of the income was official   institutions It was really a very simple accounting process to bring that income in at that   point; the complexities have been introduced since that time So, as I say, Pricewaterhouse-  Coopers and our audit function are confident in looking over the control procedures we have   had in place that it’s implausible that a diversion could have occurred But we cannot rule it   out   Turning to the packet of colored charts,1/ page 1 depicts  the rates implied by forward rate agreements As you can see in the top  panel, in the period since your last meeting forward rates rose steadily  until the release of the employment report on December 3rd when the  market reacted to a lower-than-expected average hourly earnings figure,  and the forward rates came off a little The rates then bounced backed up  again on the release of retail sales data, reaching highs for the year   1/ A copy of the material used by Mr Fisher is appended to the transcript (Appendix 1)     12/21/99 4   In the middle panel you can see that euro forward rates continued to  follow the movement in dollar forward rates I think I have been harping  on this all year, but let me say it one more time  To me, the most  unnerving thing in markets today is not the state of equity markets, the  dollar/yen relationship, or the weakness of the euro, but rather the extent  to which European interest rates at the short end follow the peaks and  valleys of US forward rates I find it, as I say, unnerving that those rates  fall even as the ECB raises rates and rise when we raise rates  It is really  very odd and hard to understand   In Japan, as you can see in the bottom panel, the forward rates backed  up in mid-November But this time the Nikkei was rallying and there was  increasing anticipation of a strengthening recovery By mid-November  the 9-month forward 3-month rate, which as of now covers the fourth  quarter of next year, had doubled since October But with the release of  third-quarter GDP numbers and the Tankan Survey, those rates began to  wind down a bit However, I should note that Bank of Japan officials have  been candid, if muted, in explaining that they are beginning to look for an  exit strategy from their zero interest rate policy, and that is seeping out  into the markets a bit So there is still a bit of lift in the Japanese forward  rates   Turning to our extraordinary year-end operations, on the next page  you can see that we have completed the auctions of options on repos, with  the final auction held on December 1st If you scan down the page in the  columns labeled “total propositions,” “bid-to-cover ratio” and “awards/  stop-out rate,” you can see that those numbers were generally declining  over the course of the auctions In our view that reflected the fact that we  did what we said we were going to do We tried to meet demand--maybe  not each and every last bid, but the serious bids for these options The one  exception to the general decline in these numbers was the last auction of  the January 6 strip, as can be seen in the very bottom line Total  propositions jumped up from $36 billion in the prior week to $43 billion,  the bid-to-cover ratio backed up, and the stop-out rate backed up a little  from 2½ to 4 basis points I don’t want to make too much of that, but I  think it reflects an epiphany of something going on in the markets The  closer we come to the end of the year, the more the anxieties and  uncertainties seem to be about the first two weeks of January--what will be  on the other side of the great divide of the millennium--and less about  liquidity in late December That is progress at least in one sense   Turning to the next page, in the top panel you can see the cumulative  reserve drain from currency in circulation The two red dot-dash lines  reflect the same projections--labeled “high” and “moderate”--I showed  you last time In the middle line I’ve shown the actual experience to date     12/21/99 5   and our current projection That current projection is running a little  closer to the high end than to the low end of our previous range of  projections Most of this still reflects growth in vault cash, although we  do see some outflows to meet consumer demand that is higher than in  prior years We don’t know whether to attribute that to Y2K or not, but  we are beginning to see a little of the cash seeping out   In the middle panel are the New York Bank staff’s estimates of free  reserves or reserve needs through year-end, including yesterday’s  operations but not yesterday’s actual performance As you can see, this  produces about a $42 billion need from here to year-end, not including  whatever excess reserves we may need to put in on the last day, which  might be around $10 billion So, from this point to year-end in our current  forecast it looks as if we will need to provide about $52 billion more   This past August, I suggested to you that we might face reserve needs  from then forward of about $100 billion, with a band of uncertainty of  $100 billion--$50 billion on either side of that estimate At that point in  August we had an underlying need of about $8 billion Since then we  have purchased just under $10 billion outright and have done $60 billion  in term operations through the turn of the year So on the present course,  dating back to August and adding in the $50 billion for uncertainty, we are  at about $120 billion That’s roughly our estimate of reserve needs from  where we were in August through year-end   Looking toward the end of the year, some of the market estimates of  year-end financing for mortgage-backed collateral that we were hearing  about--and we were calculating ourselves--were coming close to and  sometimes over 7 percent, which is the strike price for our options That  began to catch our attention After thinking about it, we executed two  forward transactions for the turn-of-the-year weekend We thought we  would take on in advance some of the mortgage-backed collateral that  might be looking for financing over the century date change Our  reasoning was as follows If it was going to be exercised as an option  around the turn-of-the-year, we would have been taking it on anyway, so  why not do it in advance?  Also, as we thought more about it, we decided  this would be an opportunity for price discovery both for us and for the  market   Let me take you through this bottom panel on page 3, which  represents a bit of the evolution of estimates of term financing On the far  left, you can see that the implied turn-of-the-year repo rates from our term  operations on October 8th were about 7 to 7½ percent for Treasuries, 10 to  12 percent for agency securities, and 11½ to almost 14 percent for  mortgage-backed securities Now, I want to be clear that a lot of heroic  assumptions are built in here There were uncertainties about Committee     12/21/99 6   policy and one had to make estimates of where other financing rates would  be But these are fairly typical of where most people in the market  thought turn-of- the-year financing rates were, understanding they might  be a little overstated In the second column you can see the comparable  implied rates from our longer-term operations on December 17th   The next two columns are the bid and offer rates taken off broker  screens yesterday for Treasury and agency collateral And on the far right  are the rates, taking the high proposition and the low proposition, in the  two turn-of-the-year RPs we executed Both came in a little lower than  the rates on broker screens The high bid was 627 percent and the low bid  was 45 percent on the first five-day RP we did for the turn-of-the-year  period; 638 and 525 percent were the comparable rates on the second  one I think the tightening up in the second operation actually just  reflected the market coming to a sense of the pricing The low bidders in  the first operation were wishful thinkers, hoping financing would be that  low So, I view it as a sort of healthy bunching up But looking at these  rates again does suggest to me that more of the uncertainty the market is  pricing for is in the early days in January, not just the century rollover  date Some of the assumptions we have been making are probably in  error, in that they attribute much of the premium just to December 23rd;  more of it is probably an uncertainty premium for the initial days in  January One way to put it is that the market may believe that we can  keep financing rates low on any one day in light of our operations, but it  may be harder to believe that for the first two weeks of January   Finally, the last page depicts how the fed funds rate has traded since  your last meeting The upper right section shows the maintenance period  surrounding Thanksgiving In that period we had a slightly elevated funds  rate as we faced pressures typical of the turn of the month and of  Thanksgiving, especially when it comes so close to the beginning of  December   In the next maintenance period, from December 2nd to 15th, we leaned  rather heavily in the direction of generosity, with the 15th being the end of  the maintenance period and a tax payment date We wanted to be very  certain not to have firm rates on that day, which might set us up for the  end of the year So we were quite generous in providing excess reserves  from the early through the middle part of the period Then we worked  down the period average excess to just $11 billion, as you can see, but  that gave us some soft rates over the last few days of the interval That  was intentional on our part   That is all I have to report We conducted no foreign exchange  operations in the period I would be happy to answer any questions     12/21/99 7   It may just be a relative issue in that anxieties about the last few days   of the year, when people thought markets would be most illiquid, have gone away So   relatively speaking, the state of anxiety, whatever it may be, is now about the first ten days   of January   Yes, it was just shifted out into the new year There are certainly a   number of people who are more worried about the state of settlements and heavy volume   after an accumulation of slow days If the whole system gets as sticky as molasses, the   problem is not going to be on January 3rd and 4th; it is going to be on the 6th or the 10th if   everyone is being a little too cautious I think that is where a lot of anxieties are focused   There are a number of other markets in the world where, notwithstanding when banks are   closed for holidays, the authorities have not been as vigilant as we have tried to be in   making sure the banks do not de facto close down the markets Some small non-euro   European countries have allowed their banks simply to declare the first ten days not good   value days for foreign exchange transactions, for example, even though the banks are going   to be open So their retail customers can walk in the door and take out money, but their   corporate customers can’t get their foreign exchange trades settled That’s the sort of thing   that is gnawing at confidence about those first ten days     12/21/99 8   Could I just give a perspective from the market?  In my view, if you   put out that statement, it’s like putting up a neon sign that says “Coming soon A big   change in our bias!” I just don’t think the market is going wait and give you a chance to   draft a well crafted press release  The crescendo of interest in that, I think, is going to be   extraordinary  "
6496,2000-02-01,"  Yes, sir    Members of the Committee will recall, as Norm Bernard’s memo   spelled out, that the authority to sell options on RPs, which the Committee granted the Desk on a   temporary basis last August, will expire at the end of this month  The authority to do reverse   RPs and the liberalization of the “Guidelines for the Conduct of System Operations in Federal   Agency Issues” put in place at the same time will run through the end of April, however  The   latter two authorizations will be on the agenda for the Committee to discuss at its March   meeting    Yes    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the package of charts   with the peach Class II cover on it, beginning as usual with the chart on forward deposit rates 1     The top panel depicts US forward rates and current 3-month rates  As  you can see there, forward rates backed up from the time of your December   meeting through early January and then flattened out a bit, even as the  current 3-month deposit rate--the black line--remained quite steady  Then,  with the noticeable exception of the spike in the 6-month forward rate, the  solid red line--that spike being a true data point--these rates generally moved  sideways from the time of the Chairman’s speech on January 13 at the  Economic Club of New York through last Friday  The movements in these                                                               1 A copy of the charts used by Mr Fisher is appended to this transcript  (Appendix 1)           8  rates seemed to reflect noise rather than any specific developments we could  point to      By the time we reached mid-January, the markets had already pretty   much priced in an expectation of about 50 basis points of tightening  sometime during the first quarter of this year  Now, the release of the GDP  and ECI data on Friday did affect the forward rates a bit, as the 9-month  forward rate shown at the very top right of the chart backed up almost 20  basis points  However, the April fed funds futures contract backed up only  about 9 basis points from a rate of 597 to 606 percent  The fed funds  futures isn’t shown here, but to give you the flavor, I’d say that the market  had pretty much built in its expectations of a first-quarter tightening by the  middle of January  My point is that the data releases on Friday changed the  outlook beyond the first quarter somewhat, but did not change very  profoundly the sense of the Committee’s likely actions during the first  quarter     In contrast a bit, while European forward rates also drifted up, as   shown in the middle panel in blue, once we got to January these rates leveled  out to a considerable extent and remained that way until the 27th when the  euro closed below dollar parity for the first time  You can see the uptick at  that time in all the rates  Particularly noticeable is how much the current 3- month deposit rate, the black line, moved in the expectation that the ECB  might need to respond in some way       In the bottom panel, you can see that Japanese rates also rose a bit from   late December through early January, and then began to drift off after mid-  January  There had been a fair amount of talk in Tokyo in late December and  early January about the need for the Bank of Japan to develop an exit strategy  from its zero interest rate policy  But around mid-January Bank of Japan  officials, both in reports and in comments, began to express more anxiety  regarding the fact that the self-sustaining recovery was not in sight  This  seemed to be confirmed by the very weak consumption data that came out  last Friday  But from the middle of January onward, as you can see, the  forward rates in Japan began to fall back to their low levels       Turning to the next page, there was rather more excitement in the   Treasury bond market  In the top panel you can see 2-, 5-, 10-, and 30-year  Treasury yields as they have traded since October 1st  The bottom panel  depicts various spreads within the yield curve--the 2- to 5-year in green, the  5- to 10-year in blue, and the 10- to 30-year in red       Treasury yields were rising from late November and continued to rise   after your last meeting, but they too began to move sideways roughly from  January 13th forward   In this case, in addition to the Chairman’s speech on          9  that day, Secretary Summers announced the final plans for the buyback  program to repurchase outstanding Treasury debt  In his remarks and the  press release he suggested they would be buying as much as $30 billion in  the year 2000, most of that probably at the long end  That should be seen  against the backdrop of expectations already in the market, before the  buybacks came into play, that the Treasury’s net paydown of securities in the  first half of this year would be something on the order of $150 to $200  billion      With that shift in the bond supply outlook being emphasized in the   market, you can see in the bottom panel how quickly the 10- and 30-year  spread began to invert after the January 13th announcement  The drama came  last Friday with the release of the GDP and ECI data  Prior to that date, there  really had been two contending camps in the market  One saw the inversion  of the yield curve as a temporary phenomenon, expecting the curve to  steepen again once this Committee began to tighten over the course of the  first quarter  They were thus taking short positions in the long end  A  different camp expected the inversion of the yield curve to continue  They  expected it to flatten when this Committee began its widely expected  tightening They anticipated a reduction in Treasury supply at the long end  but an increasing agency and corporate supply in the short end  And it was  also their sense that a late cycle firming by the central bank should slow  activity and foster a rally in the bond market  Thus, they took long positions  in the long end of the bond market       Last Friday, the initial reaction seemed to favor the first camp as the   yield curve backed up, and some in that camp seem to have been tempted to  double up their positions  But then the yield curve began to go down rather  quickly again, and they were caught scrambling to cover their shorts, which  caused a fair bit of see-sawing in the yield curve all day on Friday  Bid-ask  spreads in the market on Friday were not as wide as the widest we saw in  October 1998, but during the course of the day they were comparable to the  averages of October 1998  So, bid-ask spreads widened out quite a bit       You can see in the bottom panel the profound impact that last Friday’s   new data had on the 5- to 10-year and the 10- to 30-year spread  The only  upward slope left in the coupon curve is in the 2- to 5-year sector  As this  position adjustment washes through the market, I think we are increasingly  going to see a flat Treasury curve, with conversations in the market  increasingly turning to whether this is just a Treasury supply story or a  fundamental story in some way       The next page depicts some domestic yield curve comparisons  In the   upper left is the Treasury yield curve from last October 5th, showing the  closing rates after the Committee’s October meeting and those as of yesterday           10  In the upper right is the interest rate swap curve  The lower left panel has  Fannie Mae yields and the lower right those on Ford Motor Company debt       While they are all at different levels, the spreads to Treasuries are really   very little changed from October  Only the 30-year swap spread is discernibly  wider than in October  All other domestic spreads to Treasuries have  narrowed slightly or are unchanged from October 5th  The short ends of each  of these other domestic curves are noticeably steep, but they are less steep  than they were in October  And they are all quite flat now from 5 to 30 years  and from 10 to 30 years  My own sense is that the Treasury yield curve has a  very powerful influence on these other curves, the habit of trading at certain  spreads  So, while I don’t want to overstate the importance of the Treasury  supply story, I would not want to understate it either  However, none of these  yield curves suggests to me that the rest of the domestic interest rate market is  expecting a sudden outbreak of inflation  I don’t think they would be trading  at such a flat long-end spread even in thin markets       A rather different picture emerges on the next page where our yield   curve is compared to other national government yield curves  As you can see  in the top two panels, US and Canadian yield curves are really quite similar,  with Canadians yields just a bit below U S Treasury yields, as they have  been since the fall  But in the bottom two panels you can see the rather  dramatic differences between our yield curve and those of the United  Kingdom and Germany       The United Kingdom is everyone’s poster child for the impact on a   government bond market of a firm to tightening central bank policy and a  shrinking government issuance of long-term debt  Those who are wondering  how long a rally we can get in our bond market have in the back of their  minds this picture of the UK yield curve       In contrast is the rather steep continental curve, the German yield   curve; relative to last October it provides a striking contrast to the UK and  US yield curves  I don’t think the difference between their yield curve and  ours is a first-order cause of the weakness of the euro over the last few days,  but it is certainly a contributing one, given that the differentials have  continued to widen in the dollar’s favor since last October       The chart on the next page depicts from the beginning of October to   date the percent change in selected currencies against the dollar  This  highlights how much of an outlier the euro is  As you can see, the Brazilian  real and the Canadian dollar have been firming against the dollar, the Japanese  yen and the Mexican peso have been trading around zero, and the euro has  weakened profoundly over the last few days               11  One of the most anticipated events of January 2000, I would guess after  all the hoop-la about the Y2K bug, was the expected rally in the euro  It was  so widely anticipated that there was no one left to make it happen!   Institutional investors have been buying euro assets and running them on an  unhedged basis mostly in the currency market, hoping for the euro rally to  give them a greater kick in their investments  In the last few days, as we came  to the end of January, these investors ran out of patience and began hedging  those exposures in rather vast amounts, rushing to hedge the unhedged  I was  given some advice once by someone in the market that the history of  exchange rate volatility is the history of successive new classes of actors  learning how to hedge and how not to hedge     Turning to the next page and our open market operations, you can see   that the movements in the three key reserve factors since December 15th  required us to add a total of $70 billion in reserves from that point forward   You can also see how, after the turn of the year, the Treasury balance and  currency in circulation began to drop off very quickly, causing the whole  position of reserve factors to reverse       On the next page is a bar graph showing how our operations at the turn   of the year were structured to help us meet this buildup and then to pull back  rather quickly  The dark blue portions of the bars represent the RPs that we  already had in place as of the 15th of December; the green-dashed portions are  those that we put on starting on the 15th  The yellow portions indicate the  forward RPs we executed in our effort to put in some additional reserves  around the year-end  The red negative parts are the matched sales that we  conducted during the first half of January as we tried to get our position back  in balance  But overall, the rather large amount of RPs that we had put on the  book and rolled off rather quickly in January worked rather well        I included the charts on the next page to show you the interest rate   behavior at the short end of the money market that we saw around year-end   The top panel has comparable data for last year’s turn from December 1998 to  January 1999  The effective fed funds rate is the green line, the Treasury RP  rate the blue line, the target fed funds rate the black line, and the morning fed  funds rate at the time we operate the red line       You can see at the bottom how we did this year  We had a much softer   market several days before the year-end and then rather less volatility in  January once we got through the turn of the year  What led to the rather  profound softness those days before the year-end is in part a mystery, but as  best we can judge we think that the scarcity of Treasury collateral was a major  factor that pulled repo rates down and had some influence on the funds rate   In addition, however, there was a widespread perception in the market that we  were flooding the market with liquidity  Market participants had data on our          12  gross operations but not our net operations  They were not able to see the  information depicted in the first chart I showed you on the factors that were  draining reserves       The next page shows the behavior of the funds rate and reserves in the   two maintenance periods that surrounded the year-end  In the top two panels  on the funds rate, the blue line depicts the trading range, the red horizontal  line is the daily effective rate, and the red vertical line represents one standard  deviation  In the bottom panels on the key reserve factors, the blue bar shows  the actual free reserves on the day and each black dot represents our intended  level of free reserves on the day  The red bar is the borrowing that occurred  on each day, both discount window and SLF borrowing       Interesting from my perspective is how soft the funds rate became, as   you can see in the top left panel, on December 24, 27, 28, and 29  That  happened even though, as you can see below, we actually were leaving in  rather normal, if modest--some might even say skimpy--levels of free reserves  on each day  The amounts were quite typical, or if anything skimpy, for the  end of a maintenance period  Nonetheless, the funds market got quite soft on  those days  And, as I say, that occurred I think significantly on the perception  that we were flooding the markets, since they only saw our gross operations  and not the impact of our net operations     Clearly, at the start of the next period that covered the year-end, we did   flood the market for the reserves in that new maintenance period on the 30th  and 31st  But as you can see, we had a negative miss on the 31st itself of more  than $2 billion  So we did not even get in as many reserves as we were  shooting for  Again, though, we subsequently were able to get the funds rate  to trade around the target level relatively quickly by draining reserves  We  got down to an historic low operating balance in the banking system of $8-1/2  billion on January 6th and still kept the funds rate reasonably well behaved       Another way of viewing our operations during the fourth quarter of last   year through the period until this meeting is shown on the next page  You  may recall that I have used this chart before as a measure of our performance  Each dot is a day  The horizontal axis is the deviation from the target rate--  that is, the effective deviation, zero being the target and plus or minus either  side  The vertical axis is each day’s daily standard deviation in basis point  terms  As you can see, over the fourth quarter of last year and January of this  year the funds rate was reasonably well contained  As indicated by the  median values in the table in the upper right, the deviation of the effective rate  from the target in absolute terms was only 8 basis points and the standard  deviation was just 9 basis points               13  The next page shows comparable data for the previous year, October  1998 to January 1999, also covering the period of market turmoil typical of  the fourth quarter  As is apparent, we had a rather more volatile market in  1998 than we had this year       The final page gives one more way of comparing volatility; it plots the   same data against a norm established from the two previous years  That is, the  brown box and the green box are based on data from October 1996 through  January 1997 and from October 1997 to January 1998  Fifty percent of the  observations in those two 4-month periods fell within the brown line and 25  percent within the green line; that provides a sort of base case You can see  that in October 1998 to January 1999 we succeeded in getting only 11 percent  of the days to fall within that tight range and only 24 percent within the 50  percent range, whereas this year the comparable figures were 31 percent and  51 percent  So I guess we can say we at least lived up to our own standard for  managing the funds rate for the two year-end periods prior to 1998       I would like to thank the Committee for giving us the tools to help us   to do this  It made a great deal of difference  I should note that the funds rate  has been firm thus far over the last two days  Those days encompassed a  month-end and a first day of the month, normally firm days in the market   But there is also a widespread expectation of a firming in rates by the  Committee, and there is not much chance of getting the funds rate to behave  in a “normal” way in these last couple of days           Finally, we distributed to the Committee copies of the Desk’s annual   report via our secure Web site  I hope you all had access to that as well as to  the other reports that we now make available there      Mr Chairman, we will need to ratify the Domestic Desk’s operations   since the last meeting  I would be happy to answer any questions     Thank you very much!    Well, we will be bringing forward as many of those issues as we can   think of to be discussed formally at the March meeting  I will say that what was very frustrating   for us, and I am partly responsible, was the asymmetry of the information we provided  That is,   we gave the market very detailed information about our gross operations and then they got a   once-a-week snapshot of the System’s balance sheet  They thought that page represented our   operations--that it was our base  They saw our only our gross operations  There were days when   there were rumors that the Desk was flooding the market with reserves, and in fact we were   leaving them barely enough to get by   So that was very frustrating  If I had to go through a   period like that again--and maybe always, but certainly in similar circumstances--I think I would   want to be more balanced and give out information on our net operations as well as our gross   operations    If I could--I should have mentioned it in my briefing--I would like to   thank the staff from all the other Reserve Districts, particularly those in the cash offices, that          15  provided us with a much higher level of information than usual and made some of this   forecasting a lot easier  There was a tremendous effort on the part of every Bank’s cash   operations staff, and we may be coming back to you to find out whether we shouldn’t make some   permanent improvements in the flow of information in that regard  But I want to thank staff   from the whole System for their efforts during this period  "
6520,2000-03-21,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the  package of materials in front of you, which includes charts and some  text1  First, I will briefly review interest rate developments and ask for  ratification of our domestic operations  Then I would like to go over  some background material in anticipation of Item 2C on the agenda,  which encompasses the two items on which I am seeking a Committee  vote                                                          1 A copy of the material used by Mr Fisher is appended to this transcript              - 4 -     The chart on the first page depicts three-month deposit rates  implied by forward rate agreements  As you can see in the top panel,  forward rates have moved little on balance since the Committee’s  previous meeting  They rose a bit on the Chairman's Humphrey- Hawkins testimony and came off a little toward the end of March,  around the time of the strong revision in fourth-quarter GDP  But I  have a hard time understanding the causal connection there, which is  why I didn’t include the GDP release date as a trip wire on the chart  It  does seem that there has been a slight increase over the intermeeting  period at the short end of the forward rate curve, that is, the three- month forward three-month rate, whereas the nine-month forward  three-month rate--the top line--has really not moved at all on net  I  think the one thing that could be said about market expectations is that  the markets are anticipating a little more action from the Committee  sooner, but the same net amount over the next twelve months     As you can see in the euro area panel, the one in blue, the ECB   raised rates 25 basis points last week and their forward rates declined  ever so slightly  I think that may reflect something of the same  phenomenon in that the ECB was moving a little sooner than the  market had been expecting  In this case that might be reducing  slightly the amount of tightening the market is looking for further out   But there is a lot of noise in these rates, with a lot of seesawing back  and forth  I think the ECB is being unfairly treated  On the one hand,  a lot of analysts are saying that the ECB is confused, lost, and  hopeless  On the other hand, there is clearly a germ of truth in that  assessment  Members of the policy committee are bringing out their  disagreements in the public domain  That there is disagreement is very  evident; the markets are not mistaken about that       In the bottom panel, you can see the slight upward drift in   Japanese forward rates since the release of their fourth-quarter GDP  data  Over the last few weeks Japanese officials have been talking up  the prospects for growth while trying to talk down the currency  That  is giving people in the markets a bit of a headache  The Bank of Japan  has intervened since your last meeting--directed by the Ministry of  Finance--buying a total of 94 billion dollars and 700 million euros  over the period      Turning to page 2 and developments in the fed funds market, it’s   clear that we've had a rather quiet time of it since your last meeting   The fed funds market has been remarkably well behaved, with some  modest and predictable volatility at the end of maintenance periods, at  month-end, and at tax dates  So, we have the pleasure of reporting that              - 5 -     the effective intermeeting funds rate was 575 percent  It's nice to be  both good and lucky!     Mr Chairman, there were no foreign exchange operations since   the last meeting, so at this point I would be happy to answer questions  on this portion of my presentation and seek the ratification of our  domestic operations since the last meeting      Mr Chairman, turning to page 3 of my handout, I have  outlined some significant changes in conditions in the fixed-income  markets over recent months  Coincident with the inversion of the long  end of the yield curve, daily volatility of the 30-year bond has risen  above the volatility of both the 5-year and 10-year notes  Ten-year  credit spreads have widened to their 1998 highs and beyond; and ten- year spread relationships among private credits have become much less  stable  The bid-ask spreads on Treasury securities have widened  And  the scarcity value of Treasury securities can be seen in lower overnight  repo rates  I have included on the next three pages several charts that I  will use to discuss each of these points       The top panel of page 4 simply shows for background the yields on   5-year, 10-year, and 30-year U S Treasuries since January of 1992   The middle panel depicts the daily volatility of US Treasuries on a  rolling 50-day interval basis, annualized  You can see the rather  extraordinary spike in the volatility of 5- and 10-year notes after the  Russian moratorium that was associated with the unwinding of Long- Term Capital Management’s positions  What is worth noting is the  little blip in the red line on the far right side of the chart, showing that  for the first time in eight years the volatility of the 30-year bond is  higher than that of either the 10-year or the 5-year notes     The bottom panel depicts the correlation of daily changes in   Treasury yields  Again on the right-hand side you can see the  extremely rapid breakdown in the correlation of movements between  the 5-year and 30-year issues--the dark blue line--and the 10-year and  30-year issues--the red line  On the one hand, looking at this with the  benefit of hindsight, we can say that this type of breakdown is an  entirely predictable consequence of an inversion of the yield curve  As              - 6 -     that process gets under way, we would expect to see such a breakdown  in correlations within the yield curve  However, while that is certainly  true, the market does not have the benefit of hindsight when it  experiences this  And the abruptness of these changes and the rapidity  of this breakdown are really a very dramatic altering of pricing  relationships that the market has relied on for many years  So, I think  the suddenness of the breakdown needs to be understood as partly  reflecting the fact that the market is not seeing this breakdown in  relationships to the 30-year bond as a transient event, as perhaps some  of the other episodes of volatility across the page were  There is a real  question in the minds of market participants as to whether relationships  with the 30-year bond will be re-established to levels that have been the  norm for the last quarter of a century        In the top panel on the next page are three credit spreads to the    10-year Treasuries  A corporate spread, using the Merrill Lynch A-2  index, is shown in red; a swap spread is in dark blue; and an agency  spread, with the Bloomberg index of noncallable debt--that is, their  straight 10-year debt--is in light blue  You can see that recently these  spreads have widened out to and beyond the levels they reached in the  fall of 1998  Looking now at the whole eight years’ worth of data, the  adjustment of spreads since 1998 looks to me much less like a one- time shock or even a series of shocks and a little more like a resetting  of spreads at higher levels  Indeed, since the fall of 1998, all three of  these spreads have traded at roughly double the averages that had  prevailed from 1994 to August 1998  It’s a little under that, but a  rough approximation is that those spreads have almost doubled     Clearly, some of this can be attributed directly to the decline in  Treasury yields resulting from the cutbacks in Treasury issuance,  particularly more recently  But I also think there is an indirect impact  of the supply/demand imbalance on the confidence with which market  participants price credit risks  One way I have tried to think of it is  that the changed supply outlook for Treasuries has introduced a fair  amount of noise into the Treasury yield curve  As a consequence, the  efficiency of our most basic measurement device for credit risk has  been significantly disturbed  And in that environment, one might  expect a heightened uncertainty premium to be built into all credit  spreads  And at least in part, I think that is what we are looking at in  the top panel     In the middle panel I have depicted the correlation of weekly  changes in the spreads of the corporate swap and agency indexes to the  10-year Treasury  Again, you can see that the Treasury/agency  breakdown is rather abrupt  In the bottom panel is depicted what I              - 7 -     think of as the “intramural correlations” of the three indexes--the  private credits--to each other  And there the breakdown is even more  extreme, particularly for the corporate/agency index      What I want to be clear about is that this result did not surprise me  when I looked at charts like this for the 30-year area, given what has  happened to 30-year rates with the inversion of the yield curve  But  this is the 10-year sector  I think the extremity of these moves and the  breakdown in the intramural pricing of credit within the private sector  is really an extraordinary shift for the market to adjust to  Some of this  may reflect market efforts to take on agencies in lieu of Treasuries as a  hedging device, thus creating a fair bit of noise  But I think that’s a  very imperfect part of the story on which to rest too much of the  explanation  There are also very complex interactions between the  swap curve and the agency market, given how much the agencies rely  on the swap market for laying off their duration risks and their callable  debt risk  So, this is an area where these relationships are breaking  down, and market participants really are not certain when more normal  spreads can be expected to reassert themselves or in what form  predictable relationships might come back into play     Turning to page 6, the top panel shows the yield curve for 5-year,  10-year, and 30-year Treasury securities since 1997 as background for  the bottom two panels  In the middle panel are the mean bid-ask  spreads for 10-year and 5-year Treasuries  You can see the spike in  those spreads in the fall of 1998 after the Russian moratorium  And it  is clear that since the end of last year they have been drifting up again,  with a very sharp spike on the day of the quarterly refunding  announcement, which was also the day of your last meeting  So, these  spreads are widening a bit     Shown in the bottom panel are the 10-day moving average and    30-day moving average Treasury overnight repo rates less the fed  funds rate  The question this panel addresses is  How many basis  points relative to each morning's fed funds rate does Treasury  collateral in the repo market command?  As you can see, we have been  getting lower lows, somewhat more volatility, and in general slightly  more valuable Treasury collateral relative to the morning funds rate  over the last six or seven months compared with most of 1997 and  1998     Turning to page 7, as I explained in my memorandum to the  Committee of March 13th, in order to serve the System’s portfolio  objectives and to avoid exacerbating the supply/demand imbalance for  Treasury securities, it is my recommendation that we should take              - 8 -     several steps  First, I believe we should begin to moderate our reliance  on net additions to holdings of Treasury securities as the sole means of  accommodating the upward trend in the asset size of the System’s  balance sheet We should evaluate all plausible asset classes and  operating techniques that could be appropriate alternatives to Treasury  securities for the System Open Market Account (SOMA)  As I  outlined in my memo, I think we would want to look at both the  advantages and disadvantages of individual assets and carefully  consider them from the System's perspective in terms of how well they  suit our purposes  And separately, we need to consider the impact our  operating in those assets would have on the evolution and behavior of  credit markets  Until the Committee can thoroughly consider  alternative asset allocations for SOMA, my recommendation is that we  should rely on long-term temporary operations to meet the growth and  underlying reserve needs that cannot comfortably be met by further  outright purchases of Treasury securities  In so doing I would  recommend that we distribute our demand for collateral as broadly as  possible so as to minimize our impact on spread relationships     On page 8 I have outlined some specific plans that were also set   forth in my memo  I suggest that we set a target of no more than 35  percent--and a firm ceiling of no more than 40 percent--for System  holdings of any one issue of Treasury bills And I would manage our  auction participation accordingly  This buffer would allow for the ups  and downs of Treasury issuance from quarter to quarter; as you know,  there is some volatility there  At this point, I would plan no outright  purchases of bills  However, after we get through the April tax season  and look at the likely size of bill issues, we could evaluate whether we  would be able comfortably to acquire more of those issues of which  we hold significantly less than 35 percent  I want to say that this is a  possibility to consider cautiously because I don’t think we want to  whipsaw the bill market by coming in and buying an issue only to run  it off at the next auction     In coupon holdings, I suggest that we continue to roll over existing  holdings at auction but monitor the impact of the Treasury's buyback  program and the changes in note and bond sizes on our percentage  holdings of individual coupon issues  As my memo explains, I don't  think that is an immediate concern, but it is something that we need to  keep an eye on  Also, I suggest that we adopt a try-and-see approach  to meet a portion of our underlying reserve needs through outright  purchases of around $20 billion over the rest of this year, spread  evenly across the coupon curve  And finally, I suggest that we meet  the balance of underlying reserve needs with the rolling book of term  repos, accepting Treasury securities, straight agency debt securities,              - 9 -     and mortgage-backed securities as collateral and pricing them  separately as we have since last October     Finally, on the last page, Mr Chairman, I reiterate the questions I  posed in my memo for Committee members to consider  First, are  there particular issues or concerns that members think the study that  Don and I are planning on alternative assets for SOMA should  address?  If so, we would welcome any comments of suggestions  regarding particular assets that should be looked at or topics that  should be covered  Secondly, are members comfortable with my  35/40 rule for bill holdings?  And thirdly, what are members’ views on  the desirability of further coupon purchases this year?  In particular,  are members comfortable with the approach I have spelled out?     At this point I am seeking votes on two proposals, Mr Chairman   First I ask that the suspension of paragraphs 3 through 6 of the  Guidelines for the Conduct of System Operations in Federal Agency  Issues, adopted on August 24, 1999, be extended through the period  until the first FOMC meeting in 2001  Secondly, I request that  paragraph 1(c) of the Authorization for Domestic Operations, which  permits the use of reverse repurchase agreements, be retained as a  permanent amendment to the Authorization       My suggestion is that I attempt first to answer questions on my  presentation and my memo  Then the Committee could vote on the  issue of the Guidelines, the first of these two proposals  After the  discussion and vote on that issue, I would then cover the more  technical questions relating to the use of reverse repurchase  agreements     That is correct    I have tried to structure this proposal in a way that allows for an exit   strategy, but I take your point, Mr Chairman   Maybe I did not say it bluntly enough in my   written materials, but I see the Committee as having a very difficult choice to make  One choice   is to create a wrenching and straining experience for the US Treasury market currently by   placing the entire weight of our demand there, which would cause dislocations in credit markets   more generally  But that has to be weighed against the scenario that you spelled out  I don't   deny at all the plausibility of your concern and the Treasury’s concern; the scenario that you laid   out is one that might come to pass  But in my view, if we put the full weight of our demand on   the US Treasury yield curve for the next six or seven months, we could create equally   disturbing--or perhaps greater--stresses than those that would arise from a gradual rolling off of   diversified RPs in agency securities              - 11 -      There are no substitutes  There is US Treasury debt  There is   straight agency debt, which we have been taking for a long time--that is, the debt securities of   Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and other agencies  And there are mortgage-backed securities,   including Ginnie Maes, which we have only been taking since October of last year  So for us to   go back and place the full weight of our demand exclusively on Treasuries would be unwinding   much more than just what we have done since last October  That would involve unwinding   practices that have been used since--I couldn't give you the date  I was probably trading baseball   cards!    I have reserve needs by June of $30 billion  The hypothesis you are   offering is relying exclusively on Treasuries to meet this?    We would create, if the Committee approves what I'm suggesting, a   rolling book of 30-, 60-, and 90-day forward RPs of rather modest size  Small amounts would   mature every day, so we would ladder in what we would accept in each case of Treasury, agency   debt, and mortgage-backed collateral  And we would take the relative pricing that the Street   gives us to avoid disturbing the spreads Our experience with longer-term RPs is that we get   mainly agency debt and mortgage-backed collateral but very little Treasury collateral  In fact,   our ability to get Treasury collateral currently decays after overnight  That is, we get mostly   overnight Treasury collateral  As soon as we are talking about 3-day or 4-day RPs, the Street   does not want to give us Treasury collateral  This involves just a rolling buildup and it could be   unwound, I think, without causing any shock over any one week or even a one-month period  It   would roll off rather gracefully, if that is what the Committee wanted    We have a $20 billion underlying reserve need now  We face   significant reserve demands in April because of the tax season  I would hope to have this issue   resolved before we hit the tax season, frankly, to give us some flexibility    Yes, my issue  I would like the flexibility to take a look across all the   assets and have a broader pool--    Let me just make sure I understand  In this case by “issue” you mean   the issue of the Treasury’s sentiment toward federal agency issues on the Federal Reserve’s   balance sheet?     No, it will not be perceived as permanent  It is Don’s intent and mine   to try to get back to the Committee as soon as we can in the fall with a completed study and to   put this whole subject on the table  We think there is a lot of staff work to be done  It will   involve the disciplined task of comparing assets and coming up with the principles and criteria   regarding what assets the System should hold  Our intention is to put that on the table as soon   after Labor Day as we can  And our understanding is that the outer limit will be the first meeting   of 2001   Putting aside the relationship of the agencies to the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet,   one other aspect that motivated my request in my memo and presentation is that I think we have   to begin to moderate our exclusive reliance on Treasury securities for the underlying growth in   the asset side of our balance sheet  That has nothing to do with the agencies  That has nothing to   do with repos versus outright purchases  We have by tradition relied on outright purchases to   meet the growth in demand for currency in circulation, which as it grows forces the growth on   the asset side of our balance sheet    Mr Chairman, I am referring to this year  We would be buying   somewhere between $40 and $60 billion of Treasuries if we followed our previous norm  That is   not a way-out forecast  That is a reasonable number in the circumstances  Last year we bought   $45 billion  The Treasury market exploded on February 2nd when the Treasury announced it   was going to buy back $30 billion of its debt  The Japanese have bought $48 billion over the last   12 months  The collective monetary authorities keep siphoning assets out of this market and that   contributes to very bizarre behavior  That is my biggest worry  I urge the Committee to   understand that    Absolutely   That’s certainly one of the alternatives  It would be possible for the   Committee today to give the Desk the authority to go to the full extent allowed statutorily  The   Federal Reserve Act would permit us to do foreign currency swaps; it also allows us to take on   state and municipal debt in anticipation of revenues--so there is a limit set on state and local debt    We could do all those things  You could authorize that!  I’m not sure I could go out tomorrow   morning and actually begin to carry out such a decision, given the mechanics of the market, and   I’m not sure we would know what the consequences would be  And that, I think, is Don’s point   and mine  We care about the consequences There are some other alternatives, but we want to be   careful to avoid the law of unintended consequences in jumping into them  We have been taking   agency debt, the straight debt, for many, many years  And adding mortgage-backed securities to              - 18 -     that actually lets us bring in Ginnie Mae mortgaged-backed securities, which are the equivalent   of federal government debt; we had not been taking in Ginnie Maes before last October  So   bringing in the mortgage-backed collateral at least partially corrects a slight imbalance in our   previous behavior  If there is an alternative that we could implement tomorrow morning, I am all   ears  But I’m afraid I don’t have one in my pocket    Thus, we need to think about other assets    No, I don't think so  The problem is that wherever we sit down we   displace a lot of water  It doesn’t matter whose obligations they are  And the further problem is              - 21 -     that we have to sit somewhere  At the present we are giving the subsidy to Treasury and agency   debt and to mortgage-backed bonds; it is spread around  If we were to settle in on municipal   debt, we would give that market a little kick as well  We cannot avoid the consequences    Yes    I’m sorry if the memo did not speak clearly enough on this point  If   the temporary extension lapses, it is a very narrow issue  It is scheduled to lapse on April 30th   and thereafter I would not be able to take Ginnie Maes  I could still take Freddie Mac and   Fannie Mae issues, both straight debt and mortgage-backed securities  Now, for many years we   have taken the straight debt and, therefore, we have been doing a “favor” to Freddie and Fannie   and none to Ginnie  So if the current authority lapses, we will go back to that status of just   taking the straight debt of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and the other minor agencies and taking   nothing of Ginnie Mae  Given the concerns, that seems to be one of the more perverse ways to   go  So it is in part to avoid that perverse outcome that we want to extend this authority  As I   tried to spell out at the very end of the memo, the most rational and perhaps pure-of-heart way to   proceed would be for the Committee to issue me a new guideline saying that I can only take              - 24 -     Treasuries and Ginnie Maes  If the Committee did that in the current environment, I promise   you that would be a Molotov cocktail in the credit markets  I wish it weren’t; I wish you had that   freedom  But it is my advice to you that that would be throwing a match into a room full of   gasoline  I regret where we are  I understand Jerry Jordan’s frustration that there is a sense of   limited options, but that is where we are  And that is why the lapsing of the authority now is so   awkward    As soon after Labor Day as we can, given the sequence of meetings   and topics    There are two points at which that will come up  The market is aware   that our authority to take a broader pool of assets lapses on April 30th and that our reserve needs   peak around that last week of April and into early May  The other point will be the minutes of   this meeting  It would be desirable for me to say something so that the market is not surprised if              - 26 -     we start doing some RPs that roll into May  If we do a 30-day RP at that point, we wouldn’t   want to get a big market distortion  So I think we will have to say something to clarify our   authority to undertake such transactions  The minutes would come out somewhat later    I have a second issue on which I need a vote  I hope this will be   quicker  Mr Chairman, I sent a separate memo to the Committee on March 14th asking that   Paragraph 1(c) of the Authorization for Domestic Operations, which gives us the authority to do   reverse repurchase agreements, be retained as a permanent amendment  When I say permanent,   though, please understand that of course you can change it at any time you want  As I explained   when we were asking for that amendment last fall because of our Y2K concerns, we thought we   might need to have this authority technically in the Y2K environment and the tri-party world    However, as I mentioned then, this is a practice that the market has moved to  Our outside   accountants have been urging us to move to reverse RP accounting  Our own internal accounting   people, both here in Washington and in New York, would prefer a move in this direction  We   are now in the process of installing a new trading system  It would be a shame not to lock this in   place so we can avoid the trouble of customizing a lot of software and line up with what              - 27 -     everyone has wanted us to do all along  So my second request is to retain Paragraph 1(c) as a   permanent amendment to the Authorization for Domestic Operations    The tri-party arrangements have worked reasonably well  They do   involve more complications than our regular clearing system, but we are working on including   that capacity in our new system as well  So I want to separate that issue  We did not do reverse   RPs via tri-parties; we never found an occasion to do reverse RPs, so we did not test that  We   may at some point want to test that  The issue here is that if we leave this paragraph in the   authorization, we will essentially have the authority to do both matched sales and reverse RPs   going forward  At some point, about two years from now, when we have a new system in place   and we see where we are, we may end up dropping the matched sale authority, but that is off in   the horizon    Our new trade processing system we hope will facilitate such   transactions  One of the reasons we did not use the reverse RPs to drain reserves had to do with   the clearing bank systems  But the clearing bank systems did do the valuation of the collateral,              - 28 -     which simply would have been impossible for us  So, I want to be clear that we couldn’t be   accepting this collateral if we were not using their valuation systems  I don’t recall precisely   whether we focused on late-day draining in our trade processing system, but we are at this point   accelerating the configuration of our system to accommodate tri-party arrangements  That is one   of the issues that is in front of us now    We are going to push for that  It is a question of how many dollars we   spend on it  "
6542,2000-05-16,"  Over here, Mr Chairman!  [Laughter]   There is a package of charts   and text in front of you, which on the first page has a summary of my remarks 1    Let me apologize in advance for the length of my report  I will  try to cut to the chase  Also, I should note that all the typos in the  written material are my own, as yesterday I engaged in the illusion that  last-minute changes result in improvements      I will discuss domestic market developments with respect to   policy expectations in short-term rates, movements in the euro as a  consequence of capital flow leads and lags, and the current shape of  US yield curves     With respect to domestic operations I plan to cover four topics,   including the mix of operations since the previous meeting, current  conditions in the Treasury market, and the impact of Federal revenues  and Treasury refunding plans on the flow of new Treasury issuance  and System operations  Then I would like to present to the Committee  a proposal for interim System operations that I’d like to discuss with  the Treasury  And at the end of my remarks I will remind you about  some foreign matters on which I sent you a memo     Turning to the second page of the package, which shows forward   rates, you can see in the top panel that US forward rates have risen  sharply since mid-April, when they had dipped a little following the  release of the CPI and more importantly the stock market turmoil  around mid-month  Since then they have moved up, most briskly on  the release of the ECI on April 27th and then again a little on the  publication of the nonfarm payroll report on May 5th  It is interesting  to note, however, that compared with the peak of these forward rates  just after your last meeting, the 9-month forward 3-month rate-- the  top dashed line--is only 25 basis points higher whereas the 6-month  forward 3-month rate--the solid red line--is 45 basis points  higher   There is some “collapsing in” of the market’s expectations of how far  the Committee is likely to go in tightening, even as more aggressive  actions are being priced in over the near term     In the middle panel, you can see that euro forward rates have   backed up from their low levels in essentially three steps over the  period  First, they moved up as the euro broke below 95 cents; then  they rose quite modestly after the ECB raised rates 25 basis points on  April 27th and rose again after the May 2nd release of euro area M3                                                     1 A copy of the material used by Mr Fisher is appended to this transcript        5  and the purchasing managers’ index  The market certainly has a sense  of backing up and raising forward rates in Europe as the euro has  weakened     The bottom panel depicts Japanese forward rates, which have   drifted lower over most of the intermeeting period and spiked down on  the release of the negative household spending number on May 9th  It  has been my impression during this period that the Bank of Japan has  been waving its arms in the air, trying to get people’s attention and  communicate that it might actually raise rates at some point  I think  the market is under-assessing the earnestness with which the Bank of  Japan is trying to send that signal  It is very much my sense that Bank  officials feel somewhat as our Chairman did in 1993 and early 1994   They are trying to warn everyone that a rate increase is coming and no  one is listening     Turning to page 3, I would like to talk a little about the euro’s   weakness, which I see as a function of two factors  The principal  factor is the exceptional leads and lags in capital flows, which have  been punctuated, if you will, by the extraordinary cyclical  developments in the United States over the last couple of years  Each  of the three panels shows data for the 17-month period on either side  of the January 1, 1999 launch of the euro  The top panel depicts         2- and 10-year U S and German swap rates and a 10-year Italian rate  up until the launch of the euro, and then the dollar and euro rates after  that time  In the middle panel are the euro/yen and euro/dollar  exchange rates  And the bottom panel shows the Italian stock market  in purple, the S&P 500 in red, and the German stock market in blue,  all indexed to August 1, 1997     Looking back over this period, it seems to me that non-European   investors bought the rumor of the euro before its launch  You can see  that in the rally in Italian and German 10-year swap rates and also  somewhat in the Italian and German equity markets in late 1997 and  into 1998  And talking to people over that time period, there were  anecdotal reports of a flow of non-European capital into the euro zone  as investors bought the rumor of the creation of the euro  During this  same period, euro-zone businesses braced themselves for the launch of  the euro by hoarding cash  Many of us no doubt remember Governor  Trichet of the Bank of France complaining repeatedly about how their  corporate sector was hanging on to high levels of cash--building up a  war chest for the more competitive environment they expected with  the launch of the euro--rather than investing     Since the introduction of the euro, it appears that European   businesses have actually been diversifying out of the euro area, as FDI      6  and portfolio flows away from the euro zone have picked up  That  seems to me to reflect an effort on their part to catch up with the  process of globalization and diversification that has seen US  corporations at the forefront  Now, inward investors into the euro  area--and the intermediaries who bought the euro exposure from the  outward investors--all hung on, waiting for the strong euro to  materialize around the start of this year and expecting finally to get the  rally they had been looking for  But this was just when US cyclical  developments gave them the “double whammy,” if you will  The last  quarter of 1998, as investors were anticipating the launch of the euro,  was just when this Committee was easing rates       There was much excitement about whether there would be an   economic slowdown and there were strains in the markets  At that  point the spread between 10-year US and German swap rates stood at  80 basis points and the spread between their 2-year swap rates stood at  120 basis points  Since then those swap spreads have doubled  The  10-year US/euro swap spread is 190 basis points and the 2-year  spread is 240 basis points  While those who were hanging on to euros  were hoping for the euro to rally and the US economy to slow down,  just the reverse has happened     If you look at the bottom panel and the recent equity rally, you   can see that the one place from which US equity values might look  cheap would be Milan; that is just one of the head fakes that occurred  to the exchange market  Everyone expected that the hiccup of the  NASDAQ in US equity markets in April might be the occasion to  spark a rally in the euro  On the contrary, it appears that European  businessmen, looking at their market valuations vis-à-vis US  valuations, saw that hiccup as a buying opportunity  And from the  newspapers, which one has to follow to see these developments before  they get picked up in the data, one can read about a continued flow of  deals involving European purchases of US assets     The euro bounced up at the end of last week amid a hail of   discussion and threats of intervention by prime ministers and central  bankers and finance ministers from all over Europe; but the bounce  was not much more than one would have predicted even without all of  that rhetoric  To me, the fact that it got only that rather marginal  bounce was again a somewhat bearish sign for the euro      Let me briefly cover the material on domestic yield curves on   page 4  These are the charts I have shown you before on yield curves  for US Treasury securities, interest rate swaps, Fannie Mae issues,  and Ford Motor Company debt  The yield curves shown are as of the  close of the day of your last meeting and as of last Friday As you can      7  see, the US Treasury yield curve is a little higher but also a bit more  inverted than it was at the time of your last meeting  All three of the  non-Treasury yield curves have more or less backed up by around 50  basis points, or maybe a little less  Thus credit is more expensive than  it was at the time of your last meeting  But even with credit spreads  widening to quite wide levels by the standards of the last several years,  my impression is that habitual notions of appropriate spreads to  Treasuries are still exerting a downward pull at the long end on all  non-Treasury issues  Treasuries are acting as somewhat of a magnet,  pulling the long end of these yield curves down     Turning to domestic operations, I have outlined on page 5 some   key points regarding our mix of operations since your March meeting  At that meeting I spelled out my plans to try to determine what would  be a comfortable pace of outright purchases of Treasury coupon  securities  I said that I thought we could target 35 percent for our  participation in Treasury bill auctions but would allow that to go up to  40 percent in the next month or so, as we expected bill sizes first to  shrink and then to rise again later in the year  I also noted that we  would use a mix of 30-, 60-, and 90-day repos to meet the balance of  reserve needs and that we would not be purchasing bills outright until  after the Treasury’s refunding announcements       In response to views expressed by Committee members and my   assessment of changing market conditions, we in fact purchased $42  billion in coupon securities on five different days  The principal  constraints were the Treasury’s buy-back operations and the novelty of  those operations being quite a big deal in the market  The Treasury  had a rather big window, a two-day notice window  That eliminated a  number of days when we might have been tempted to operate     We also purchased $23 billion in bills for System account on   April 11th  On that occasion we conducted operations from which we  learned something by doing  On the first day of the quarter,                                                                                                                                                                                                                   That was not                something I was expecting to wake up to that m                                                                              orning; their request  was a consequence of their intervention the prior evening                                                                                             it seemed to me  that the bill market adjusted rather well to that rathe                                                                                      r large effect on  supply  So, on behalf of the Committee, we purchased $23 billion of  bills on April 11th for our own account       We redeemed $16 billion of securities at auction--$977 million in   bills and $568 million of the last 7-year note  We now hold 40 percent  of two bill issues  But on two other issues that we anticipated      8  bumping up our share to 40 percent, we ended up with a lesser share of  the total outstanding as a consequence of the large add-ons                                And the Treasury in this case ended up with more cash th an  they wanted     Occasionally we have used 28-day repos to meet our underlying   reserve needs  We now have four separate 28-day repos on our books  for a total value of $82 billion  Most of our repo operations over this  period have been for only a few days’ duration because of the great  volatility in the Treasury’s account     On the next page of charts I have tried to convey a picture of the   conditions in the markets in which we operate  My assessment is that  the bill market has made a reasonably smooth transition to the new  supply conditions it is encountering  But I think the long end of the  curve is having a harder time making that adjustment, in part because  of the abrupt changes in supply and obviously in part because of the  policy actions this Committee has been taking       The upper left chart depicts bid/ask spreads on 3-month bills   going back to January 1997  You can see the increases in those  spreads in January 1998 when the supply changes were beginning to  come through to the bill market and then the dramatic spikes reflecting  the chaos of October 1998  But over the last six months or so the  spreads have about stabilized in the bill market  In the bottom left  panel are bid/ask spreads on the 10-year note  While they seemed to  be stabilizing last year at higher levels than prior to the crisis period of  1998, the trend now is a continuing widening of bid/ask spreads in the  10-year note market     On the right-hand side of the page are spreads of the 3-month bill   to LIBOR and of the 10-year note to the 10-year swap rate  I would  just note that in the 10-year area we are still seeing a widening out of  the spreads, which is merely another reflection of the greater  uncertainty the market faces at the long end  Moreover, even though  the spread of the 3-month bill to LIBOR is volatile, I think it is more  or less staying in a modest range that gives the market some comfort     On page 7, Mr Chairman, I have outlined recent developments   with respect to Federal revenues, surplus estimates, and the Treasury’s  refunding plans  These developments obviously have an impact on the  flow of new Treasury issues and on System operations   At the end of  March, the Treasury’s plans for debt issuance reflected the  Administration's forecast for a surplus of $176 billion in fiscal year  2000  On the basis of April receipts, the Administration's current  forecast is for a surplus of $226 billion  At its quarterly refunding in      9  early May the Treasury announced its intentions to buy back no more  than a total of $30 billion this calendar year, reiterating what it has said  previously  However, I think most knowledgeable observers expect  the Treasury to be buying back more next year  Treasury officials also  stated at the time of the May refunding that they would maintain the  10- and 30-year programs  But I think that statement also was about  this calendar year  In my view, the 30-year program is at some risk  going forward at least with this Administration       They also announced their intention to eliminate the 1-year bill   once Congress adopts some technical amendments and to trim the size  of the 2-year monthly note auctions They indicated, too, that further  increases in revenue would likely lead to a switch from monthly to  only quarterly 2-year note auctions  In addition, although this has not  been announced, the Treasury has told us that the amount of bills  likely to be issued each week for the rest of this year will be reduced  by more than 20 percent  That means the amount auctioned weekly  will be down to $16 billion for the rest of the year, not just for the brief  period in April and May that we were anticipating      These reductions in the Treasury’s issuance plans obviously have   implications for our operations this year  The table on the next page,  page 8, shows projections of the Treasury’s debt issuance over the  remainder of the year, projections of the percentages to be purchased  by the System, and estimates of the System’s net redemptions  I won’t  go through all of it with you, but I’d highlight the top two rows  The  first row shows the Treasury's issuance plan by refunding quarters,  May to July, August to October, and November to January  In the left- hand box are the figures projected in March--that is, what we were  looking at around the time of your last meeting  Going across the  page, the next box shows what our holdings would have been  And  the next box indicates what our net redemptions would have been  under the plan of holding up to 40 percent of any one issue this quarter  but going back down to 35 percent for the rest of the year     On the right-hand side of the page, the next three boxes show you   the currently projected figures for those same variables--the Treasury’s  issuance plans, the reduction in our holdings under the 35 percent  objective, and our implied redemptions  But now the implied  redemptions become somewhat more material in maintaining the 35  percent limit  For the 2-year note, for example--the next set of boxes,  which I have put in bold print--the percent of our holdings as a  consequence of the reduced size of the Treasury's offerings would be  moving up significantly Moreover, that still assumes monthly auctions  and we face the risk going forward of the Treasury cutting back to  quarterly auctions      10    Let me go over with the Committee a proposal for interim System   operations that I would like to discuss with the Treasury  The key  points are summarized on page 9  At your last meeting, I thought we  might be able “comfortably” to purchase outright up to $20 billion in  Treasury securities  In light of both Committee members’ views and  the changes in the outlook for new issuance, I have tried to devise a  means to increase the amounts we would be purchasing  Given the  uncertainties the Treasury faces in debt management and the impact of  our operations on their primary and secondary markets, I would like to  inform them in advance of my plans for managing the System Open  Market Account (SOMA) over the coming months, in part to permit  them to adjust their strategy  It will also be vital for us to  communicate clearly to market participants any changes we make in  our strategy     In brief, I would like to operate SOMA on a schedule for   participation in Treasury auctions that essentially locks in the status  quo in the percentage of SOMA’s holdings acquired in the primary  market  I would then like to increase the pace of outright purchases of  coupon securities, skewing our purchases both to the middle and the  shorter end of the yield curve  We would also need to rely on 28-day  repos to meet the reserve needs that cannot be filled through this  process and to serve as a buffer between the timing of redemptions and  outright purchases       I have provided for your information a very rough approximation   of just three of the reserve factors we face over the coming months,  from now until the end of January  Our current underlying reserve  need for this period is $21 billion  The implied redemption from the  35 percent bill limit would be $42 billion  And the New York staff  forecast of 85 percent growth in currency adds $22 billion, for a total  of $85 billion  I want to be very clear that this figure takes into  account only three reserve factors  We know there will be  demonetizations of SDRs that will add to reserve needs, and we face a  risk that the Treasury’s cash balance will be higher and spill over into  further reserve needs  So this is not a topside estimate of our reserve  needs  We know other factors will tend to add to those needs     Turning to the next page, as I have indicated there, we face both a   stock and a flow problem that we are trying to address   As a number  of you noted at the last meeting, with over $3 trillion in marketable  Treasury debt outstanding it seems clear that we ought to be able to  find sufficient assets to grow the SOMA balance sheet from the  existing stock  However, the amount of marketable Treasury  securities outstanding with remaining maturities of more than 10 years,      11  exclusive of SOMA holdings, totals only $433 billion  And that  amount will decline as a consequence of both Treasury buybacks and  System purchases  There is also strong demand for these long- duration assets in foreign and domestic private portfolios, as reflected  in the inverted yield curve  While relatively comfortable with private  credit risks for shorter duration assets, investors perceive few  acceptable long-term substitutes for Treasury securities  Thus the  stock of such Treasury issues is not large relative to apparent demand  and that stock is expected to decline  The total flow of new Treasuries  reaching the securities market has continued to decline, with total  issuance exclusive of cash management bills falling from a little over  $2 trillion in 1997 to $17 trillion this year  As I have tried to explain  at previous meetings, my concern is this  If the growth of the  System’s balance sheet absorbs an expanding share of both the  primary and on-the-run issues too quickly, there is a risk that System  operations will come to be seen as a major disturbance, even if only  transitional, in the price discovery process      Briefly, it seems to me that we have some very basic portfolio   objectives in that we have a preference for Treasuries as an asset class  to grow our balance sheet  We have over time had a preference for the  shorter rather than longer maturity issues  We have expressed that  preference principally through our large holdings of bills, whose  growth has been relatively limited in recent years  But some members  of the Committee have expressed frustration to me that, with the  reduction in the size of the bill auctions, the average duration has been  creeping up rather than going down  The concerns center on our  interest in maintaining sufficient short maturity assets to provide us  with adequate maturity liquidity  It also strikes me that it is not  obvious that we have much of an interest in paying a premium for the  special liquidity of on-the-run Treasury securities       In the current setting, it seems to me that the Treasury has three   paramount debt management objectives  The first is to reduce the  issuance of debt in line with revenues  The second is to avoid a  lengthening of the average maturity of its outstanding debt  And the  third is to maintain issue sizes and key benchmark maturities to sustain  an active secondary market  In trying to reconcile these interests, it  seems to me that we could limit the System’s share of the primary  market and on-the-run issues in order to leave room for private  demand, particularly for long-duration securities, as investors adjust to  the reductions in supply  We could expand System holdings of off- the-run and shorter-duration Treasury securities to meet our balance  sheet needs, in the process of acquiring as much of the preferred asset  class as possible, and adjust SOMA to a shorter overall maturity that is      12  closer to our basic preference  Doing this will have an impact on the  average maturity of privately held Treasury debt outstanding     The particular proposal I am making is outlined on the next page    Let me say in advance that there is nothing magic about these numbers  and percentages  They represent my best seat-of-the-pants judgment at  this point and if someone has a better idea, I am all ears  But my  suggestion is that we maintain roughly the status quo of our existing  holdings as the share of SOMA participation in upcoming auctions;  that would involve taking shares of the now-anticipated size of  offerings in accordance with the percentages shown in the schedule at  the top of page 12  We would tell the US Treasury in advance that  SOMA’s bids at auctions would be the lesser amount of SOMA’s  maturing holdings or the percentage limit from the schedule  This  would have only a very limited impact on our currently forecast  rollovers  But in the event of further declines in issuance, this would  hold constant the System’s share of the primary market and, therefore,  should increase the amount available for private demand from what it  would have been otherwise  It also should assist the Treasury in  forecasting and thus managing its cash position, which is an incidental  benefit of some consequence to the Desk     We would also take the schedule to imply a graduated set of   guidelines for SOMA outright purchases of off-the-run issues  Over  time we would make outright purchases in the primary market under  the following schedule up to 15 percent of securities with remaining  maturities between 10 and 30 years; 15 to 20 percent of securities in  the 5- to 10-year area; 20 to 25 percent of securities in the 2- to 5-year  range; and 25 to 35 percent of securities with a remaining maturity of  under 2 years  Also, we could perhaps continue to bid as we have  been for 5 percent of inflation indexed securities at auction, and we  might be prepared to bump that up to 75 percent in the secondary  market     Page 13 shows in the second row the very marginal impact this   would have on net redemptions  There would be no change in the bill  redemptions and we would have rather modest redemptions of the       2-year note if we applied this schedule to our primary market  operations  But we would share in the upside risk that the market  would experience if issue sizes decline  In that case we would be  taking smaller nominal amounts and our redemptions would grow     The chart on the next page tries to depict the opportunity we have   to implement this plan  This shows SOMA holdings as a percent of  the size of outstanding issues  The blue bars are bills and the other  colors show coupons in various remaining maturity brackets  The bold      13  red line represents the proposed guideline graduated for each and  every issue in the Treasury yield curve  The white area under the red  line gives you a sense of the size of the opportunity we would have to  purchase these issues if we skewed our demand toward the shorter end  of the maturity spectrum     Turning to page 15, I have shown that a very rough calculation of   the amount available for purchase using this schedule would be around  $178 billion  We would continue our current practice of waiting to  purchase new issues until they are thrice off-the-run  This compares  with a comparable reserve need of $88 billion through the end of  January, which is close to the $85 billion estimate I mentioned a  moment ago plus the $37 billion in redemptions implied on the 2-year  note  Again, I want to emphasize that these numbers are very rough  and intended for illustrative purposes     The pace of outright purchases could have a strong impact on the   Treasury yield curve, tending to produce lower yields, and at least in  the short run could be seen as being at cross purposes with the  Committee's policy actions  This could also be seen as a reverse  operation twist even though it is motivated, in my opinion, by the  System’s reasonable portfolio objectives  I doubt that we could  comfortably purchase the full amount of our reserve needs for the  remainder of the year--$80 billion to $90 billion--under this schedule  within the next six or seven months  But provided we communicate  clearly to market participants about this radical change in SOMA's  secondary market behavior, I think we could purchase considerably  more than the $20 billion I was suggesting at your last meeting  One  of the features of this plan is that we would be limiting our purchases  at the long end and leaving the market a little more leeway to express  its demand there       Finally, I would remind you that this is clearly just a stop-gap   measure  It delays the onset of problems meeting our reserve needs   If Treasury’s supply were to begin to expand over the coming year or  so, we would have assets to roll into  However, if Treasury’s supply  continues to decline over coming years, SOMA's need for new assets  would only have been delayed     Let me turn now briefly to the recommendation I sent to the   Committee in a memorandum on May 11th regarding the renewal of  our swap arrangements with Mexico and Canada and noting two  changes in our investment practices  The latter do not require a  Committee vote  I will need a vote to ratify our domestic operations,  Mr Chairman, and a separate vote to approve the renewal of our swap      14  arrangements  I would be happy to answer any questions and, again,  my apologies for taking so much of the Committee's time      Thank you  If I could just note, Mike Prell has wisely counseled me   that the number I quoted to you on the Administration's surplus of $226 billion is not for   publication  That number is embedded in what the Treasury has in its cash forecast for the   rest of the year, and that is not in the public domain    You got me!    You are kind to say so!    Yes, we will look into that  Thank you, Mr Chairman    The $178 billion is the product of the sequence of my thinking   about how one could cap SOMA temporarily in our primary market behavior and in some way   communicate that effectively to the market  The question is how to communicate effectively   to the market that we were skewing our demand in the secondary market toward the short end    The $178 billion is just the number that was very crudely calculated off a current snapshot,   and too much stock shouldn't be put in it  It just gives a sense that there is a sufficiency of   securities in the market if we use this formula that could carry us for a while  The $88 billion,   rounding to $90 billion, represents the current reserve needs we see over the next seven   months  Now, I'm not sure we are going to be comfortable buying $90 billion over the next   seven months, but we'll see if we can pick up the pace as we go along      Yes, how long we could tread water in this way    We do not purchase on-the-run issues in the secondary market  My   point has been that if we let our share of the primary market expand, we would be collapsing   the market for the on-the-run issues in nominal terms  That's the only point  We have not   been purchasing the on-the-runs  However, we have been suppressing our demand, if you   will, vis-à-vis this schedule for decayed securities that are way, way off-the-run  You can see   on page 14 that we've been trying more or less to work our way up toward 15 percent all along   the coupon curve  In that sense we have been buying issues decayed way, way off-the-run   more aggressively; issues decayed in the 7-year area and the 4-year area are way off  So it is   in that sense that I'm making the distinction here      Thank you, both!  "
6566,2000-06-27,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the package of charts   in front of you that begins with the chart on forward rates1   In the top panel on US dollar forward rates you can see  that for much of the last few months the 9-month forward and the  6-month forward 3-month rates have been trading right on top of  one another  They are both down a bit from their levels prior to  the June 2nd release of the nonfarm payroll report and have  returned roughly to where they were trading after the release of the  ECI on April 27     Looking down the page at the euro forward rates, it is clear   that their 9-month and 6-month forward rates have also been  trading on top of one another for some time  This leads me to the  following inference  Notwithstanding a great deal of verbal  intervention from the official sector in Europe about how the  growth differentials between Europe and North America are likely                                                               1 A copy of the charts used by Mr Fisher is appended to this transcript  (Appendix 1)           4  to narrow and reverse over the coming year, the short-term interest  rate markets do not seem to share that assessment  If they did, it  would seem to me that the euro forward rates would show more  forward upward lift than they do     At the bottom of the page, you can see that the Japanese   forward rates have begun to tick up again of late as the melodrama  continues about whether the Bank of Japan will or won't raise rates  sometime soon  The speculation regarding a rate increase goes on  apace and we see again the modest ticking up of forward rates     Turning to the second page, it is clear that over the last four   maintenance periods the fed funds rate has behaved rather well,  trading right around the target with very low volatility since your last  meeting  There really isn't much interest or excitement in our  management of the funds rate per se     As you can see on page 3, however, behind the veil of a   nice stable funds rate is a rather different development having to  do with the scarcity of Treasury collateral beginning to show  through in the repo markets  Depicted on the chart in red is the   30-day moving average of the spread between the repo rate on  general collateral for Treasury securities and the fed funds rate as  we get a snapshot of it each morning  The solid blue lines  represent 6-month averages over the periods encompassed by  those blue horizontal lines  Clearly, over the last two years that  average has been trending lower, with a widening of the negative  spread at which Treasury collateral trades under the funds rate     Two developments have in all likelihood taken place here    One is the scarcity of Treasury collateral; it is at a premium and  will trade under the funds rate  There is also an element of  defensiveness among the major institutional investors and money  managers during a period when the Committee has been  tightening, as they look for the safety of Treasury collateral  But  to my mind the march down of those average rates is impressive   And I will note that one major dealer has said to me that they can  fund themselves at 50 basis points under the funds rate with  Treasury collateral, so acute is demand of their customer base for  Treasuries as a safe haven cash management vehicle     On the fourth page I have tried to summarize our reserve   management operations this year as they relate both to the growth  of reserve needs and the mix between outright and RP operations   I used as my base here the February 9th maintenance period, which  gets us out of the year-end effects of the seasonal and the Y2K           5  buildup of cash and to a reasonable starting point for a base case   In the top part of the page I have shown changes in supply of Fed  balances from the February 9th period to the current June 28th  maintenance period  Autonomous factors have drained a little over  $1 billion net over that period of time; that’s overwhelmingly  comprised of currency  We have had redemptions of $49 billion  since that time, adding to reserve needs  And $69 billion has been  added through SOMA purchases plus net changes in RPs over that  period, leaving us a very marginal change in the total of  nonborrowed Fed balances     Let me first work down the page rather than across; I will   come back to the figures at the upper right in a moment  The mix  of activity involved in getting to that marginal change included  outright purchases, here expressed in par values, from the end of  January through June of $129 billion in Treasury securities,  distributed as shown in the middle table on the page  Moving down  to the next set of figures, we had a mix of a little over $11 billion in  short-term RPs of under 15 days and $8-1/2 billion of long-term  RPs in the February 9th period, for a total of nearly $20 billion  outstanding at the beginning of February  We have decreased the  amount of short-term RPs and increased the amount of long-term  RPs, so that currently the level of RPs outstanding is $26 billion  under 15 days--but that number bounces around every day--and $14  billion in longer-term RPs     At the bottom of the page is a memo item giving the mix of   collateral that we had in February compared with what we have  today  Currently 42 percent of the collateral we have in the 15-day  or longer RPs is Treasury collateral, 16 percent is agency debt, and  42 percent is mortgage-backed securities     Going back to the top of the page, at the upper right I have   shown projected reserve factors for the period from now to the  September 6th maintenance period, which begins just about the  time of your next meeting  We expect a little over $8 billion to be  drained by currency, but over $15 billion to be drained as a result  of net redemptions, principally from the 35 percent limit being  applied to bills  That leaves us with a need to add about $23  billion on net from now until the beginning of September     There is one other issue with respect to Treasury supply   that I would like to mention  It just occurred to me that this is a  matter that may become public before your next meeting  For  over 20 years the Treasury has given foreign central banks  preferred access, if you will, to the auction process in Treasury           6  securities, providing a mechanism through us for those  institutions to bid in the auction  They have an “add on” in that  they can always get their needs filled in the auctions      This has created a problem for the Treasury in an era of   declining issuance in that the Treasury can end up with more cash  than it actually wants as the foreign central banks exercise their  right to add on to the auction  The Treasury is very anxious to  find a way to end this process, which gives them some uncertainty  about the amount of cash they will raise  They are trying to cap  the amount the foreign central banks can bid for in the auction at a  set dollar figure, and they would like to cap that amount at a  rather low level No matter how you slice this--and we are  working with the Treasury to come up with different formulas-- the big accounts will have to find some way of bidding for  Treasury securities other than through the noncompetitive foreign  accounts mechanism  That is something we do for the Japanese,  for example  We at the Desk are working with the Treasury to try  to find a way to take care of the very small accounts--those of the  developing economies all over the world that have very small  cash balances and want to reinvest in bills  We are attempting to  come up with a procedure that will ensure that those countries are  taken care of through an automatic process but one that will  require the big countries to look elsewhere      This is overwhelmingly an issue involving the Ministry of   Finance of Japan  It means finding some way for them to deal  with their rather large investment needs, which they like to park in  the short end of the market  Both the domestic and the  international sides of the Treasury have been working on this and  we have been giving them technical advice on different ways that  it could be worked out  I don't know how it will be worked out,  but it is likely that the Treasury will want to announce something  in conjunction with their refunding at the beginning of August--at  least that is when I understand they would like to move forward  with this  So I just wanted to warn you of that upcoming event     Mr Chairman, we had no foreign exchange interventions   in the intermeeting period  I will need a vote to ratify our  domestic operations since your last meeting  We distributed  copies of the draft announcement summarizing the operational  changes we discussed at the Committee’s last meeting and, as my  note explained, we've gone over these with the Treasury  In  addition to any questions on my briefing, I would be happy to  take any comments or suggestions on that document, which the  Committee members may now have  Thank you           7       We are going to be as nice as we can be to our large creditors!  We   have for some time, in our rather modest participation in the Ministry of Finance’s auctions, had   to compete directly by putting in competitive bids to buy Japanese Treasury bills  We have had   no preferential treatment in Japan  Their procedure has been to                                                                   we can only submit bids through their dealers  We will still permit foreign central   banks, even the Ministry of Finance in all likelihood, if they wish to submit a competitive bid   through us  We will accept it, but they will have to choose the rate  We will not give advice on   rates or take part in that process  But it is a fact of life that the Treasury is now trying to find a   way to work down its cash balances and the amount they issue at each auction without ending   up with an uncertain and higher amount of cash than desired  It is a real mechanical problem    Yes  The Treasury, I think, would like to have the total of foreign   noncompetitive bids be around $1 billion, summing up the needs of all the small countries  The   Japanese Ministry of Finance is routinely rolling over                                                  in Treasury   bill auctions    That is clearly a problem  I don't think the Treasury can go that way;   part of the answer here, no matter what else is done, is to get the big accounts into the   competitive process  Obviously, they can’t sustain an auction process in which--    I hit a wall there!  I'm open to suggestions and I'll be happy to relay   them to the Treasury  But if someone isn't prepared to put out a few prices as to where they   think the market will clear, I’m not sure we can get there  "
6590,2000-08-22,"  All right  Thank you, Mr Chairman  [Laughter]    At least I’m worthy of note  I’ll be referring to the usual package of   indecipherable charts, which have been relabeled specially, in accordance with your wishes, Mr   Chairman1    The top panel on the first page depicts forward and  current deposit rates  Since your last meeting, both the current and the       3-month forward deposit rates have declined  And the current 3-month  LIBOR rate is about 10 basis points lower than at the time of your last  meeting  Moreover, the 3-month, 6-month, and 9-month forward 3-month  deposit rates are all more or less right on top of each other, yielding 68  percent  If one assumes the existence of some term premium, the fact that  the 9-month forward rate is about the same as the 3-month forward rate  implies that something funny is going on, or at least that the market may be  expecting an easing or is filled with uncertainties  I think it’s very hard to  sort out whether this is one of those cases where uncertainties about the  state of macroeconomic conditions and fiscal and monetary policy in the  first quarter of next year are leading the market to price interest rates for  differing maturities in a glob together  But implicitly, it looks as if the  market is pricing in an easing in the further-out contracts      Looking at the euro area, euro current and forward rates have risen   since your last meeting  It is noteworthy that this is the first time in the                                                     1 A copy of the charts used by Mr Fisher is appended to this transcript  (Appendix 1)       4  euro’s history that those rates have moved in an opposite trend from our  forward rates for an extended period of time  Recent ECB musings and  their bulletin about inflation risks pushed the rates up most recently     In the bottom panel on the page, you can see that the Bank of Japan   finally did it--raising their rates, as everyone knows, on the 11th of August    I think it is worth going back over some ground here  Forward rates and  current deposit rates in Japan backed up in late June as they have every  year for the last several years, as all the contracts start to incorporate  forward period-end dates--the fiscal half-year ending in September, the  calendar year-end in December, and the fiscal year-end in March  And that  elevated all the deposit rates as it has very consistently for the last several  years  They remained elevated into early July, as the market began to  anticipate a Bank of Japan move at its July meeting  Then with the Sogo  bankruptcy just a few days before that July 17th meeting, the rates came off  as the market concluded the BOJ wouldn’t be moving in the event  Indeed,  the decision was for no change in rates Then rates began to price up in  anticipation of the meeting on August 11th when in fact the BOJ did raise  rates  One point worth noting is how much steeper the rise in the current   3-month deposit rate was than the anticipation  I think that reflects the fact  that Tokyo bankers have for the first time in a decade had to deal with an  increase in rates and how to price deposits in such an environment      Turning to the next page, I thought I’d briefly discuss the plight of the   euro  The top panel shows the 10-year and 2-year dollar and euro swap  rates and the middle panel depicts the differential between those rates--the  2-year and the 10-year dollar/euro differentials And in the bottom panel I  have plotted the euro exchange rates against both the dollar and the yen   Since the start of May, the 2-year differential has narrowed almost 100  basis points, approximately half due to our rates coming down and half to  theirs going up  The 10-year differential has narrowed almost entirely as a  consequence of our rate coming down, with only a very little uptick in their  10-year rate  While the initial narrowing of these differentials coincided  with the euro’s brief rally off historic lows in May, at first appearance the  more recent narrowing in interest rate differentials seems to have done little  for the euro  The euro has drifted back down to its springtime lows and  was trading below 90 again this morning  I think a better interpretation,  looking back, is that in all likelihood the euro would have been a great deal  weaker had these interest rate differentials not narrowed as they did       Forecasts for euro-area growth have been revised up to around, and in   some cases even above, 3-1/2 percent, while forecasts of US growth have  tended to be revised down toward that neighborhood, just north of 3-1/2  percent  Many market participants, myself included, had long expected  that a convergence of anticipated growth rates and the erasing of a growth       5  differential would be the signal for a strengthening of the euro  But that  has not been the case  I think European business confidence continues to  express itself in a quest for outward investment, particularly into North  America  And the capital markets in general have been mesmerized by the  graceful moderation of growth in the United States and the continued  productivity gains, both of which for the time being are reflected in the  strength of the dollar     On the next page, I have depicted the four domestic yield curves that I   show you from time-to-time--those for US Treasuries, interest rate swaps,  Fannie Mae, and the Ford Motor Company--on three selected dates  In  green is the yield curve in July of last year, in blue the curve on the day  after your February meeting, and in red the most recent reading as of last  Friday  Most are noticeably lower than they were in early February of this  year  The one exception is Ford Motor Company’s yield curve, which is  almost identical to where it was in February  But I think it’s important to  note that that is not only fairly typical of corporate yields but also probably  reflects the strength of issuance we’ve had over the last few months  So  that outlier is more likely indicative of a supply effect than a market-driven  expectation for interest rates     Turning to page 4, I thought I’d briefly go over the impact of the   announcement we made in July of the changes in our operations with  respect to outright purchases  We announced on July 5th that we would  tend to concentrate more on outright purchases for the System Open  Market Account at the short end of the yield curve and lean more toward  purchasing off-the-run issues and limiting our participation in the primary  market  The top panel shows the eurodollar futures strip for September and  December 2000 and for March 2001 as background, in terms of policy and  macroeconomic expectations  The middle panel depicts 2-year and 10-year  Treasury yields, which you can see follow a more or less consistent pattern       From the time of our announcement on July 5th, 2-year yields did   outperform 10-year yields very marginally until the auction of the new     10-year issue on August 9th, when the relationship began to reverse  But  this behavior is really consistent with the economic data the market was  seeing and with our announcement that we would be buying more in the  short end  Those factors may have given a slight boost to the short end of  the yield curve, but it’s very hard to parse that out from the policy impact   The short end was rallying across the curve, as you can see in the top panel     In the bottom panel, I’ve depicted one measure of the differential   between on-the-run and off-the-run yields in the Treasury market  Here it  is a little easier to see that our announcement had an impact  After July 5th  you can see a narrowing of these spreads There is a lot of noise in this       6  series, especially as we come up to the new auction where the cycle will  change and a new 10-year issue will come into the market  But we did  seem to have an impact, as we expected  We hoped to avoid having much  of an impact on the shape of the yield curve, and I think we succeeded, but  our announcement did seem to affect the off-the-run spreads     Turning to page 5, let me go over our operations since the last   meeting  At the time of your July meeting our reserve needs were  projected to grow as a consequence of economic factors by a little over $8  billion in the intermeeting period, as indicated in the first column of  numbers We expected to redeem about $15 billion net of Treasury  securities, so that was going to add to our reserve needs  And then, given  our forecast of a slight decline in total nonborrowed Fed balances, we  thought we’d have to do about $22 to $23 billion in combined repo and  outright operations       The next column depicts where we were in fact through yesterday    The autonomous factors drained fewer reserves than we anticipated  Most  of the $62 billion differential between our forecast and the actual was a  result of less demand for currency than we expected  Our redemptions  were somewhat lower at $12 billion, not $15 billion  The Treasury upped  the size of its bill offerings a bit and that reduced how much we were going  to redeem under our 35 percent limit  Thus we had less of a need to add  reserves than we had expected, $14 billion rather than $22 billion       Looking forward to the next intermeeting period through early   October, we are expecting autonomous factors to drain about $4-1/2  billion, SOMA redemptions to be about $5-1/2 billion, and our need from  September 6th forward to grow by about $9 billion       On the next page in the top table, the numbers in the left-hand column   are the ones I showed you last time, indicating that we purchased about  $128 billion in outright securities from January through June  So, in the  first half of the year we purchased a little over $12-3/4 billion  Just in the  past intermeeting period we purchased $12-1/2 billion--rather aggressive  on our part  But under our new guidelines we thought that was manageable  and we did that  In the table below you can see that the average level of  repos outstanding, with the shift in reserve needs less steep than we  expected, has declined to about $115 billion, in contrast to $165 billion in  the period ending June 28th       Looking forward, I don’t think we’ll try to buy another $12 billion in   Treasury securities between now and your next meeting  But in all  likelihood we will try to purchase something on the order of $10 billion by  your November meeting, probably doing $5 billion between now and the       7  next meeting and $5 billion from that point to November  Obviously, as  I’m going through this, if members of the Committee have opinions on the  appropriate pace of this activity, I would like to hear your views       Finally, I might just note a couple of other points, Mr Chairman  At   the last meeting I mentioned that the Treasury was very seriously  considering changing the bidding rules for foreign central banks to curtail  their ability to bid noncompetitively because of the uncertainty that  preferential bidding procedure gives the Treasury in managing its cash  balance  As I said at the time, this is overwhelmingly an issue of managing  relations with the                                                                                                        The Treasury did not announce that change in early August, as                                                                                         original ly planned, in part to ensure that our Japanese colleagues  understood what was likely to transpire and were comfortable with the way  we could work with them on this  This is a matter of some considerable  sensitivity  The market has become aware of the fact that if the current  bidding procedures for the foreign central banks continue, by the middle of  next year that will overwhelmingly dominate the market The market has  realized that something has to give  I don’t think there have been any leaks  on this matter      That’s right, Mr Chairman  So the market is waking   up to this situation  It isn’t really an issue of the 10-year fiscal forecast  It  is a matter of the maturity schedule over the next two years  There is likely  to be a noticeable decline in issuance about a year from now, as the amount  the Treasury has to roll over declines sharply  The Treasury and we at the  New York Bank are trying to work with both                                                                               to ascertain their comfort level with this change and                                                 our announcement of it  The question is whether to announce this in  September or to wait a little longer and work a little harder in our  discussions with the                    That is something the Treasury will be  deciding in the next couple of weeks             Mr Chairman, the funds rate has behaved quite well over the   intermeeting period, so I’m not even going to report on that  We had no  foreign exchange intervention operations to report  I will need the  Committee’s ratification of our domestic operations  Also, I have sent the  Committee a memorandum on changes I’d like to make in coordination  with the Treasury on the investment of the System’s euro reserves and I’m  hoping the Committee will concur that this is a prudent thing to do  I’d be  happy to answer any questions       8   Yes, in discussions with my central bank counterparts in other countries it   is clear that a great deal is going on in that area  Let me try to distinguish a couple of classes of   central banks  There are some central banks that have rather sophisticated foreign currency reserve   management programs  I mean that in a complimentary way, not a disparaging way  They have   thought very hard about how they want their portfolio structured and have diversified out of a simple   portfolio of Treasury holdings  In that category the                                     comes to mind; they really   are rather distraught at the idea of a shrinking supply of Treasury securities because they already   have achieved their diversification out of Treasuries in a way they view as optimal  So that’s one   case where there is some concern about the shrinking supply; they don’t want to be responsible for   chasing Treasuries that are lower and lower in yield  But they feel a need to do that as it suits their   portfolio   Another category of central banks involves ones that are sophisticated but more   aggressive  I mean that in a slightly less complimentary way  They are trying to generate as much       9  yield as they can, rather aggressively  They’ve diversified out of Treasury holdings pretty   effectively  And they will look at this as a very opportunity-driven situation and probably will shift   as yields change  I think of                                                   as the sine qua non of this group                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      which they want to leave in Treasuries  They   don’t want to change that strategy  I have some grave concerns, as do my colleagues at the   Treasury, that                        left to their own devices, would bid to hit in every auction in which they   feel a need to participate  They could push yields lower very fast if they took a rather mechanistic   attitude  We’ve done some analysis, which I’ve shared with staff here at the Board and the Treasury,   and have concluded that at least over the course of next year, 2001, we could work with                         authorities and perhaps get them to diversify their holdings  What we are thinking about is   essentially 10 percent of their holdings across the entire spectrum out to 10 years, their current   maturity ceiling  They haven’t gone beyond that  Their current holdings are very lumpy  In some   issues next year they could well bump up against the 35 percent legal limit the Treasury puts on any   one bidder  You can imagine what would happen in a Treasury auction where 35 percent of the total   was being bid on with the bidder wanting the certainty that all its needs would be filled  That could   really move yields around quite a bit   So, at a very mechanical level, that’s what we’re trying to work out with the                                       We are trying to work with them with the objective of buying them another year of time in   which we could help them stay in the asset class of US Treasuries, but diversify themselves more   evenly across all the available issues outstanding That would buy them some time before they even   need to think about diversifying into other asset classes  But undoubtedly, there are other central       10  banks with smaller holdings than                                                       , which may be in the same   behavioral pattern as the Ministry, as you suggest    Yes, there is always some chance of that  But I believe                                             has very good relations with                                       and we’re hopeful that the officials   from both countries will be able to talk this through  I think the more junior people in                                                                           understand the complexity of this, and on that side of the house I’m   quite confident that there is no animosity among the                                                     The staff people   on both sides have worked together for a long time in managing these assets  I don’t think the   problem in            is stonewalling but inertia  The                                     does not move quickly in   the best of circumstances  There may be some skepticism about our fiscal forecasts  Is it all pie in   the sky?  And why do they really have to bother with this?  And there is a question of the   sophistication and interest on the part of the                                  to deal with this kind of change    It’s a daunting prospect    Yes, there may have been something of a rotation there--we have custody   of their holdings of GSEs--but it’s been pretty stable  It has not really been changing much in total    Some may have been driven to them and others were dissuaded from thinking of holding them as the       11  single answer to the problem by some of the statements about GSEs of the Chairman and the   Secretary of the Treasury over the last eight months  But it’s a very delicate balance  They want to   put their funds somewhere in our markets  And I believe they will take a more cautious attitude as to   the amount of their exposure in GSEs  But many of them are not in a position to avoid that asset   class  It simply is not something that makes sense for a large holder of fixed income products  But I   don’t think their GSE holdings are growing very rapidly at present    Obviously, it’s not the level of the yield, which would be a saving for US   taxpayers  It’s the lumpiness of the                                  In one five-year auction they might take   down 35 percent of the offering and in the next one they wouldn’t participate  And we don’t really   have any way for the market to get a transparent sense of what the                 are going to bid for  We   have put details about the composition of our portfolio on line, with weekly updates  I’m not   expecting the                                  to do the same in the near term  So it’s mostly a question of the   disproportionate size of their holdings of individual issues and the fact that aggressive behavior by   them would have a volatile effect on our auction outcomes    And, therefore, market yields    Yes, absolutely  The feedback effect of making the market more volatile,   more quickly is a concern    Yes, in due course  It would need to come out in the quarterly report on   our foreign exchange activities that we produce jointly with the Treasury  The announcement effect   is something that I think the Treasury in particular needs to be sensitive to in terms of our relations   with other ministries of finance as issuers of debt  So the language I used in that last paragraph   about public announcement has the type of wording that we have been discussing with the Treasury   for inserting in the quarterly report  My basic posture would be that if the Treasury thinks it   important to preannounce it in some way, I’d leave that to them      Yes, we certainly don’t want people to think that how we invest our   reserves has anything to do with our intervention appetite  And we will try to make sure that,   however announced, it is communicated as “good housekeeping” in our investments    Let me just add to that point, in light of President Poole’s comment  The   Treasury is motivated here by the cash management nuisance  They just don’t want to end up with   more cash than they need, which is a result the foreign add-on procedure has produced several times   in the last six months  That’s also a nightmare for us  If the Treasury is routinely ending up with   much more cash than they anticipate, it makes it harder for us to manage reserves  So we share the   Treasury’s objective  And they are trying to make clear to the                                     that that is their   motive--it’s a mechanical issue that is driving the need to change these bidding rules  That is how   we’re trying to present our position  Our posture is that I am then giving them advice, as a manager   of reserves, regarding how we have gone about participating in                         and Treasury bill       14  auctions                to avoid disturbing the market  We don’t bid to hit  We try to put in a reasonable   set of bids, and then if our needs are not filled at auction, we buy in the secondary market  We don’t   want to have an outsized impact on their markets  So we’re trying to couch the conversation in   terms of collegial advice about managing reserves, given the sensitivities Bill Poole has alluded to    I should have that number right in front of me somewhere, but I’d say it’s   about $30+ billion at current market values    When the dollar is very strong, as it has been, the value of those foreign   currency holdings goes down  That is a factual matter  I’m sorry I don’t have the precise number    I have no idea what the right amount of foreign currency reserve holdings   is for the US monetary authorities    I thought it might be  "
6611,2000-10-03,"  Thank you Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the package  of charts with a peach cover1  On the first page, as usual, is a chart depicting the  forward rates You will note on the far right of each of the three panels that the  recent spike in the current 3-month LIBOR rates, the black line, occurred as their  maturities moved into the period that covers the calendar year-end  I don't draw  any other significance to that spike           The red lines on the top panels depict US forward rates As you can see there,  since the September 1st release of the August employment report, both the 6-month  and 9-month forward 3-month rates have been driven below the current 3-month  LIBOR rate and the 3-month forward 3-month rate  More recently, the 6- and        9-month forward rates have traded down to within less than 10 basis points of the  Committee’s current fed funds target rate        Summarized differently, 3-month rates in the second and third quarters of next   year are now expected to be below current rates and below those in next year’s first  quarter as well  It’s hard to resist the conclusion that markets are pricing in  expectations that the Committee’s next move will be an easing  But there are very  few market participants who will say so in words, let alone date it, though they are  actually predicting it in their pricing behavior  So, while we see it in the prices, it’s  a funny kind of reflection of group behavior to which few are willing to confess      Yes, that comes to mind  I think your former colleague, Wayne  Angell, well summarized this curious state of affairs, at least to my way of  thinking  When recently asked what the Committee’s next move would be, he  responded that it would occur in the year 2003  [Laughter]           Turning to the middle panel, as you can see, the euro forward rates declined a  bit after the ECB raised rates on August 31st but moved down principally on  September 1st, as US rates fell after the release of our employment report  They  rose again a little but then declined throughout September as evidence seemed to  accumulate that euro area growth was slowing and may have hit a near-term peak  earlier in the summer  Japanese forward rates, as the green lines in the bottom  panel indicate, have become a little noisier as calendar and fiscal year-end dates                                                               1 A copy of the charts used by Mr Fisher is appended to this transcript  (Appendix 1)      4  have traded into the forward rate maturities, but the overall levels are little  changed      On the next page I have shown some long-term rates  The top panel   shows US Treasury yields on 2-year, 10-year, and 30-year securities and  the bottom panel has the US and euro swap rates for those same maturities   In the top panel you can see that from August 31st through last Friday, the  latest date depicted there, 2-year Treasury yields declined by about 18 basis  points  Those expecting a slowdown in economic activity have eagerly  cited this as evidence supporting that outlook  Both 10- and 30-year  Treasury yields backed up, with 30-year yields trading above 10-year yields  for the first time since January, and this has been eagerly cited by those who  have been concerned about inflation risks  Now, I don’t want to downplay  concerns about inflation, which are widely being discussed in the market,  particularly with reference to the volatility in oil prices  But the modest  backup in yields on 10- and 30-year Treasuries did appear to coincide with a  heavy pace of new corporate issuance and with indications from the  campaign trail and the Congress that both major political parties might yet  find a way to spend some of the surplus     Moreover, in the top part of the bottom panel, you can see that swap   rates show a slightly different and less pronounced trajectory  The 2-year  swap rate, like the 2-year Treasury yield, fell by 18 basis points from August  31st through last Friday  But the 10-year swap rate fell 8 basis points while  the 30-year swap rate was unchanged     At the bottom of the page you can see that euro swap rates, at lower   levels, roughly tracked the movements in US 10- and 30-year swaps, with  the 2-year euro declining 17 basis points and the 10-year declining 5 basis  points  But the 30-year euro swap backed up by 11 basis points  Thus, both  the dollar and the euro 2- to 30-year swap curves steepened by 19 basis  points from August 31st through last Friday  But on the dollar side, all of the  widening occurred by falling 2-year rates, while on the euro side it was  divided between a fall in the 2-year rate and a rise in the 30-year rate       These relative movements in US and euro area swap curves not only   reflect but reinforce the perception that while growth in the United States  may be slowing--with the risk of an uptick of inflation, perhaps from oil  prices among other things--that in Europe is slowing also  And the  slowdown in Europe is from lower levels of growth, while the uptick in  inflation could perhaps be of a greater magnitude from the combination of  rising oil prices and the falling euro     Turning to the next page and directly to exchange rates, you can see in   the top panel the percent change since May 1st in the three major currency  pairs  The bottom panel depicts implied volatilities of one-month options      5  for those same pairs  We should recognize, of course, that the dollar has  been strong against a number of currencies for some time  But over the  course of the summer and into September, among the three major currencies  I think we clearly have a problem of a weak and volatile euro, particularly  against the yen  The red line showing the euro/yen rate leads the way lower  in the top panel, as the spot rate has traded down, and the way higher in  implied volatility in the bottom panel  The dollar/yen line, in blue, is  remarkably stable across the top panel, with declining implied volatility in  September       Why did the euro come under such pressure in September?  I see three   reasons that work together  First, in anticipation of the Japanese fiscal half- year-end statement date on September 30th, Japanese investors were seeking  to reduce or hedge their euro exposures  Second, in a market with this ready  class of euro sellers, there were some very confused policy signals sent by  the Europeans  On September 5th Chancellor Schroeder in a prepared  speech said that the current euro/dollar exchange rate is more of a reason to  be happy than concerned  The ensuing cacophony of official utterances  drew attention to the lack of a clear voice on euro exchange rate policy and  made the euro’s exchange rate an increasingly political issue  The third  factor was the ECB’s mistake, in my view, of announcing on September 14th  that it would sell accumulated interest on its foreign exchange reserves,  amounting to 25 billion euros, and that in the future it would consistently  sell interest income  I want to be clear that I don’t think that’s a mistake in  principle; in principle that’s a fine thing for a central bank to do  But timing  is everything  I’m confident that the ECB thought that with this device they  could intervene a little without exposing themselves to the credibility loss of  an actual intervention  From my way of thinking, by taking an insufficient  amount of funds to make a difference in the market, they sent a muted and  garbled signal of a “nonintervention” intervention  And they created the  risk of inducing more euro sellers to come into the market by announcing  their intention to buy     Why did we join the intervention on Friday the 22nd?  The short answer   is                                                                       virtually every important  condition that we spelled out  At the start of that week,

informed Thursday evening, while the                                                                         details of the agreement were           wor                           being               ked out, that Secretary Summers would  state on Friday after the operation that US foreign exchange policy remained  unchanged and that a strong dollar is in our national interest           Turning to the operation itself, you can see in the bottom portion of this last  page various rates at certain selected times from Wednesday September 20th  through last Friday  I’d like to make three points about the joint intervention  operation  Sadly, the operation appears, at least to my cynical eyes, to have been  anticipated by some in the market  From Wednesday’s close to Thursday’s close,  the euro rose more than a cent, and it rose another cent from Thursday’s close to 7      7  am Friday, just before we entered the market  While it is often said that  intervention works best when it’s pushing the market in the direction it already  wants to go, this isn’t quite what we mean by that           Second, even so, I think the operation should be recognized as having been  fairly successful in a narrow technical sense  The rate closed on Friday the 22nd at  8784, higher than the prior day’s close and higher than the rates when we entered  the market  At the close of the following week, Friday the 29th, rates were higher  than when we entered the market on the preceding Friday  We can have bigger  movements than these, but I don’t think it’s reasonable to expect much more of  intervention than a one-day or one-week impact, particularly in the absence of a  subsequent concrete policy action to which the intervention can be thought of as a  bridge            Third, I think the impact on expectations about the Committee’s future actions  and US exchange rate policy was quite limited  During the operation the dollar  rose against the yen, as you can see in the exchange rate data on the bottom line of  the page  While the December fed funds futures contract came off about 1-1/2 basis  points on Friday the 22nd, most people in the market attributed this tiny bit of noise  to the weakness in US equities that day and the previous day rather than to the  intervention             Mr Chairman, for the first time since 1998 I will need a vote of the Committee  to ratify the System’s foreign exchange operations  In those operations we sold  669,723,900 US dollars and purchased 750 million euros as the System’s share of  the US portion of the September 22nd intervention            In domestic operations, the fed funds rate has been quite well behaved since  your last meeting  We have redeemed $48 billion in Treasuries at auctions under  our internal limits and have purchased $61 billion in Treasuries in outright  operations since your last meeting  I should note that the currency component of  M1 has been weaker than we had expected This reflects both weaker domestic  demand and continued net inflows of foreign currency from abroad  Our detailed  extended forecast of reserves is available on our Market Source web site  I will  need a separate vote of the Committee to ratify our domestic operations         I’d be happy to answer any questions       I haven’t made that calculation, but I’m sure we could do it in just a few   minutes; it could be done off of the rates I have provided here      8   Yes, it’s a couple of percent    Dino gave you the answer It’s about 15 to 30 million dollars    I don’t disagree with the way you’ve described it, Mr Chairman  But it’s   a very small data sample of only a few weeks  And I think in the microcosm of a couple of weeks,   the heavy pace of private corporate offerings helped to move those rates up to their peak  A number   of investors looked at the pickup in yield from a move out of a 30-year Treasury into a 5-year private   debt issue, and that opportunity cost looked very attractive to them  I’m not disagreeing with you   that when we look back, whatever the trend line is here, probably the supply consideration will be      9  more significant, but in this microcosm I offered both developments as factors in the bit of noise we   were seeing here    I would agree with you on where to put the most weight  But I would   want you not to put zero weight on this different issue--and maybe I should have been more explicit   about it--that there will be a process of investors coming out of the long end of the Treasury market   at lower and lower yields  Even if the supply of Treasuries comes back from the dire forecast people   have made of no 30-year issues outstanding, these yield levels relative to what is available elsewhere   suggest that investors will be drawn to the higher-yielding instruments  I just urge you not to put a   zero weight on that    I don’t think it was qualitatively different from operations of the early   1990s in the sense that there usually have been two channels of communication with the United   States  In those days, it was between the Bundesbank and both the Federal Reserve and the   Treasury  Those two channels operate concurrently  The Treasury was and remains in the driver’s   seat, as we say     That was the case this time    I’m sorry, I meant that to be explicit  There is a novel awkwardness with   the ECB in that, as Secretary Summers has said, there is no one to answer his phone call--there is no   one place where he can call his counterpart--whereas there is someone to answer our phone call  So   there was some awkwardness  And there’s still an intramural dispute on the Continent as to who’s   on first in that regard  This made the process considerably more awkward and cumbersome for both   the United States Treasury and for us    I’m sorry I wasn’t clear about that    June of 1998    If I understand your question, it’s the price we get when we enter the   market  We call our counterparties and they quote a price at which we may buy  The Chairman’s   question had to do with the set of numbers across the bottom of page 4 in my material  Had the rate   not traded up 2 cents, how much would--    The operation was front-runned or leaked--or at least there are all sorts of   questions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           19                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I want to be clear that I don’t think                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Little countries on the periphery of the exchange rate system of   our world economy can have active reserve managers  I don’t think it works for a major currency or   even a component of it in an NCB to have an aggressive reserve management program  For your   benefit, we at the Federal Reserve--as I’m sure you pretty much take for granted--do not adjust the   currency composition of our foreign currency reserves other than through official acts of   intervention  It’s routine for other central banks around the world to trade actively for profit in the   exchange market and to hedge their reserve positions actively and dynamically  Malaysia comes to   mind in its operations a number of years ago  When it’s a small country whose currency doesn’t   play a particularly dramatic role in the world economy, I think everyone knows how to deal with   that  When it’s a component of an institution that is one of the major central banks of the world, it   really is very different  The Bank of England, I want to be very clear, has a long tradition of being   an active foreign currency trader in the open markets  They’ve had some good and some bad   experiences with that, and they’ve developed a century-long tradition that lends a note of distinction      20  to that kind of trading operation  I think that’s the exception that proves the rule rather than a good   pattern for others to follow    Well, we don’t know what they will decide at their Council meeting later   this week with respect to their interest rate  But just as we target an interest rate, they target an   interest rate  So I’ve taken it for granted, and I think the market has too, that they will be managing   their repo operations just as we would  And I believe there was some reflection of that in the market   there    That will only come out of their Council meeting, just as it would only   come from this Committee    It’s possible    This tells you how big the animal behind door No 2 is  It just doesn't tell   you what the animal is!  "
6637,2000-11-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to a  package of colored charts that should be in front of you1               On the first page I have depicted all on one panel the forward deposit  rates for the dollar, the euro, and the yen from May 1999 through November  13th  To give some perspective on changes in these rates, I have also shown  the sequence of rate moves that this Committee and the European Central  Bank (ECB) have made over the last year and a half      The orange and red lines at the top of the page are the dollar forward  rates, with the lighter color showing the 9-month forward rate  As you can  see, the 9-month forward 3-month deposit rate has fallen by almost 100 basis  points since its peak in May of this year, at the time of this Committee's last  rate action, unwinding almost half of its total increase from May of 1999   The 9-month forward 3-month rate is now trading below the 3-month  forward 3-month rate, which itself is trading below the current 3-month  deposit rate  Still, the 9-month forward 3-month rate [Laughter]--      That’s the Chairman’s language!  At any rate, the   dollar’s 9-month forward 3-month rate is about 100 basis points above its  euro counterpart  The ECB has raised their policy rates 100 basis points  since May of this year, but their 9-month forward 3-month rate has not  changed  It's essentially trading at the same level as it was in May  Taking a  step back, the market has priced in a fair amount of easing by this Committee  over the coming months but has been reluctant to price in much of the  tightening that the ECB has put in place over the summer and into the fall     The green lines at the bottom of the page, which look like inchworms   crawling along there, are the Japanese forward rates  They have bunched up                                                     1 A copy of the charts used by Mr Fisher is appended to this transcript  (Appendix 1)        4  a bit, as have the dollar and the euro rates, but on their rather suppressed  scale     Turning to the second page, I have included two charts depicting   exchange rates  In the top panel, going back to May of 1999 again, are  changes in the foreign currency values of our four major trading partners-- movements in the Japanese yen, the Mexican peso, the Canadian dollar, and  the euro against the dollar  In the bottom panel are comparable changes in  the currencies of five smaller countries     Looking at the top panel, you can see that the yen strengthened quite a   bit against the dollar last year but is really very little changed this year  The  peso and the Canadian dollar are down slightly over this period, but rather  marginally so  And the euro has lost 20 percent of its value against the  dollar, mostly this year     Of the five currencies shown in the bottom panel, all but the Korean   won, which is certainly something of an exception, have declined quite a bit  against the dollar, principally this year  Those currencies include the New  Zealand dollar, the rand, the Australian dollar, and the Thai baht     Now, however we may feel about the dollar's movements and whatever   our analytic framework, I think we should recognize that the movements of  the euro and several currencies of smaller countries against the dollar are  viewed by people elsewhere in the world as extreme or extraordinary  And  they are seen by our counterparts in other countries as reflecting a drawing in  of capital into the United States and safe haven flows that persist on the order  of those experienced in 1997 and 1998  We may not see it that way  We  think there is a distinction between what has been going on this year and  what occurred in those prior years  But they see it as a continuation of those  safe haven and capital flows into the United States     So, while one can point to significant differentiation in the pressure on   different countries--for example, the Argentine peso is under pressure but the  Hong Kong dollar is not--the dollar's strength is not seen by the rest of the  world as a consequence of the fundamentals  Rather, the dollar’s strength is  seen as a cause of their problems and the stress that besets their economies   That view is held much more firmly now, I think, than in 1997 and 1998  when other nations tended to understand the nature of the safe haven flows   This continuation of capital movements into the United States now seems  more mysterious to our counterparts in other countries     On page 3, I have provided four snapshots of three different yield   curves  Those snapshots are for the following dates  May 3rd of 1999, before  the Committee's recent tightening cycle began; January 10th of this year,       5  which was just prior to the Treasury’s buyback announcement and when the  yield curve began to invert; May 16th, the last occasion the Committee  changed rates; and November 13th, this past Monday  Each red diamond  reflects a Treasury issue  The gap for the period between 10 and 14 years  reflects the fact that for this exercise the callables have been located on their  call date and not their maturity date  So we've shifted all those maturities  down     I'd make four observations from looking at these comparisons  In the   chart for November 13th, while the slope of the A-2 industrial corporate index  is roughly the same now as it was in May of 1999, it is clear that the yield  curve has shifted 100 basis points higher  So over that time horizon we see a  certain tightening of financial conditions, at least for this credit grade   Secondly, however, the short end of the corporate curve is considerably  lower now than it was in May or in January of this year  So, over that time  horizon, for this credit grade you would see a certain easing of financial  conditions  Third, the widening of the corporate spread to Treasuries of this  index actually occurred between January and May--between the dates  depicted at the upper right and the lower left  And there's really only a  modest uptick in the widening of their spread to Treasuries from May to now  for this higher grade  We know that lower grade credits have deteriorated  over this period, but I found it quite significant to realize that the widening  relative to this higher credit grade occurred in the first half of the year     Finally, the most noteworthy movement on these panels is the collapse   of the short end of the Treasury curve, which occurs between May and  November, with the hump out to two years completely inverting and coming  down  Clearly, this reflects the anticipation of easing, which has increasingly  been priced into the markets over the summer and into the fall, reflecting the  markets’ reading of the data  You pay me in part to worry  I must say that I  do have a small worry that we will never know what part of this collapse of  the hump was caused by our change with respect to our outright operations   About $30 billion of the $37 billion of outrights we purchased this year have  been in maturities of five years and under  Now, we’ll never know the  counterfactual  But I believe had we continued to purchase evenly across the  curve, that we might have had a more profound effect on the long end, where  conditions were getting thinner and where the Treasury was buying back  issues  So there was no free lunch here for us  I want to be clear that I think  the predominant movement in the short end should be attributed to the  markets’ pricing in the ease based on the fundamentals  But it's not without  some anxiety that I note our own operations could have played a small part     Turning to the next page, let me just go over the current status of our   operations  In the top portion of this table we show the changes in our  forecast looking forward to the year-end  There has been relatively little       6  change in our forecast of reserve needs from late September to now  Things  seem to be coming in pretty much as expected  I’ll actually come back to  these in a minute; I have a better picture of our projections on the next page     In the middle of page 4 you can see details on our outright purchases    We had purchased a little more than $32 billion through early October and  we have purchased another $5 billion since then  And you can see how much  has been in the short end, following the guidelines we adopted in July     In the bottom panel you can see that the average level of our short-term   RPs in the current November, shown in the right column, is running about $3  billion  We’ve started to increase the longer-term book a little, anticipating a  year-end average of almost $13 billion  In the bottom part of the table on  RPs you can see that the mix of collateral we are taking now is still  predominantly Treasury debt, at 64 percent  The rest is divided between  agency debt and mortgage-backed securities     Turning to the last page, I’ve tried to give you a sense of how we plan   to manage reserves around year-end  In the top panel we've depicted factors  draining reserves from the system  The orange line shows the impact of  changes in autonomous factors, principally currency  The green line shows  the additional drain occurring as a consequence of our cumulative  redemptions, here all based on changes from October 3rd  As you can see, we  are expecting a drain of about $30 billion as we get into the year-end period     The bottom panel gives you a sense of how we’ve been managing this   reserve need and how we plan to manage it  The dots represent actual  operations and the solid lines give a sense of our forecast Working up from  the bottom of that page, we plan to buy another $5 billion outright between  now and the year-end, meeting part of the reserve needs that way  We expect  to increase our 28-day book of repos to a peak of $24 billion at year-end and  then begin unwinding that  And on our current forecast we will have about  $6 billion outstanding of temporary short-term RPs at year-end  I don't yet  have any precise forecast, and I wouldn't pretend to, of how we will manage  that on the other side of the year-end  But the 28-day book will start to  unwind and we’ll see where we are We’d then begin accumulating outrights,  but I think I'll wait to see how things evolve before making a forecast for  that     I’ve mentioned to the Committee that the Treasury was planning to   announce a change in the bidding rules for our foreign accounts  They made  that announcement yesterday  I think it went rather well  We’ve worked  with the Japanese authorities and I think their comfort level with respect to  this change is now much higher  We are in a position to help manage their  participation in competitive auctions next year by working very closely with       7  them on this  Very few other countries are really affected by the rule change,  but we have been talking to those countries that are affected  So, I wanted  you to be aware that that announcement was made yesterday     There are no foreign operations to report, Mr Chairman  I'll need the   Committee's vote to ratify our domestic operations  I'd be happy to answer  any questions      I believe so  I can’t think of any problem that would--       I can't think of a variable over the next six or eight months that would   really press us in that way  If we had to add a lot of reserves, we could affect some spreads  But   I don't think there would be a capacity limit    Our current level of operations is not trivial in size as we look to the   year-end  I don’t think we’re disturbing spread relations now as we anticipate increasing the   book to about $30 billion I’m sure there are extreme scenarios under which we would have a   temporary effect on spreads over the next six months if we had to inject a really large amount of   reserves, which I assume we would do through aggressive repo operations  But I think our       8  methodology of pricing our three tiers of collateral separately and trying to reflect what’s in the   market will mitigate, though obviously not eliminate, the impact that a significant increase in our   operations would have on spreads      I worry that we don’t know enough to answer that with any certainty    Had I plotted the Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac yields on these four panels, on this scale they   would have smothered the swap rates and not come through on the page     You wouldn’t have been able to see the distinction on the chart  They   would have been so close together that there would be no gap between them    Yes Those agency yields would have been right on top of the swap   rates  The impression I have from talking to people at those agencies and in the market is that   the agencies use the swap market very actively to manage their interest rate exposure  And I   have a fair amount of concern about which is the tail and which is the dog with respect to the       9  swap market  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt has performed well since their joint   announcement relating to the issues raised by Congressman Baker  The spreads have come   down and the swap rates have come down  I am increasingly uncomfortable about whether I   know enough to interpret the spread relative to the swap rate movements    That’s a concern I have  I want to be clear that I can’t put a finger on   it  But looking at financial conditions, I’m suspicious of the notion that the financial sector,   whose credit stands behind the swap rates, is somehow improving so much more in these   circumstances than A-2 industrial corporates  That seems to me to be something about which we   don’t have any real evidence  So you caught me unprepared  I intentionally did not address the   widening of the swap to A-2 spread because I didn’t have enough information to explain it  I   worry that it’s in part the agency role and in part that swap rates tend to be drawn down perhaps   more by Treasuries as a parallelism in how people trade them and use them      That’s a concern I’ve had for some time, whether agencies or swaps   are the right benchmark  If the two are moving in tandem, then neither one of them is going to   be a very good benchmark under certain conditions of stress    I agree with you completely, Mr Chairman  I was trying to give   members of the Committee a flavor of the angst among some of our colleagues     I don’t disagree with you, Mr Chairman    No  I think you hear these voices as clearly as I do, and perhaps more   so  But I thought the Committee should understand the level of anxiety about this in the central   banks around the world      I’m making sure it’s fully reflected in the transcript!  "
6660,2000-12-19,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to a package of charts with a   peach or salmon cover that should be in front of you1   The first page depicts deposit rates on forward contracts  US  current and forward rates have moved lower since the last FOMC  meeting, most noticeably in a series of steps  The first such step was on  November 28th, following the release of the durable goods data; the next  was on December 5th, following Chairman Greenspan's speech to the  Community Bankers group; and rates moved down again at the end of  last week following the release of the PPI and CPI     The current 3-month rate is now less than 5 basis points over the   Committee's target fed funds rate, and the 9-month forward 3-month rate  is now 85 basis points under the current 3-month rate  Euro deposit  rates have also moved lower since your last meeting, following roughly  the same pattern and timing as the declines in dollar rates  In addition to  moving down after the release of the durable goods orders data and after  the Chairman's speech on Friday, December 5th, they also fell last week   The latter move was in conjunction not only with the release of the CPI  but also the report of the sixth consecutive monthly decline in the  German IFO survey of business confidence      While the differentials have narrowed somewhat because of the   larger declines in the dollar, they remain rather considerably in the  dollar's favor  The differential in the current 3-month rate is still 160  basis points  In the 3-month and 9-month forward rates the differentials  are 125 basis points and more than 100 basis points, respectively     As for Japan, deteriorating sentiment about the Japanese economy   is not obviously reflected in the forward rates shown in the bottom                                                              1 A copy of the charts used by Mr Fisher is appended to this transcript (Appendix 1)      4  panel, which at first glance appear to be treading water  However, I  think the convergence of the 3-month forward and the 9-month forward  rates in the last few weeks does reflect an unwinding of the modest  hopes for an accelerating economy over the next year  The current 3- month yen deposit rate has ticked up on funding pressures, reflecting the  combination of the Bank of Japan's new payments system--launched at  the beginning of the year--and the normal fiscal year-end financing  requirements associated with the first calendar quarter, which is their last  fiscal quarter     In the top panel of the next page you can see movements in the US   Treasury yield curve, with the 2-year note in red, the 10-year note in  blue, and the 30-year bond in green  These yields have moved down in  roughly the same pattern as the forward rates, with the rate on 2- and 10- year notes having come down by just less than 60 basis points each since  your last meeting     In the bottom panel I've depicted the differential between dollar and   euro swap rates--the 2-year differential in red and the 10-year in blue   The dramatic narrowing of the latter since the Chairman's speech to the  Community Bankers has been explained as reflecting expectations of a  more pronounced slowing in the US economy as compared with  Europe  While that perception is around, focusing on the 10-year sector  seems to me to overstate the change in the relative outlooks  If there had  been a sharp divergence in growth expectations, one might have  expected to see a bit more of it reflected in the 2-year rates  While the 2- year differential has narrowed by about 20 basis points since your last  meeting, that is considerably less than the narrowing of 46 basis point in  the 10-year differential  The explanation I have been offered by market  participants is that the pronounced fall in 10-year swap rates reflects the  needs of those who manage mortgage portfolios and have to extend their  portfolio's duration as interest rates decline in order to hedge prepayment  risks  And with thinning Treasury markets, these portfolio managers  increasingly look to agency securities and the swap market as additional  sources of liquidity to complete their hedging     In effect, the more pronounced narrowing of the 10-year swap   differential reflects the greater extent to which the agency financing of  the housing stock is marked to market on a daily basis here in North  America as compared with Europe  Two-year rates may yet prove to be  a lagging indicator, or the short end of our yield curve may yet decline  by more than the market now expects  But as long as the 2-year  differential remains over 100 basis points in the dollar's favor, it is hard  for me to think that market participants are expecting markedly  diverging growth paths for Europe and North America      5  On page 3 I've provided a set of charts on yield curves similar to the  charts I showed you at the last meeting, this time with addition of the  BB1 industrial corporate index  At the upper left is the yield curve as of  May 16th, the day the Committee last raised rates  The upper right panel  shows yields just after your November 15th meeting  The lower left  panel is for November 28th, after the release of the durable goods orders  data, and the lower right one is for December 15th, after the CPI release     Looking from the upper right to the lower right--comparing rates at   the end of the day of your last meeting to today--you can see that the  US Treasury yield curve has moved noticeably lower  One might say  that the 2- to 30-year curve now hovers around the central tendency of 5- 1/2 percent, 100 basis points under the funds rate  The swap curve over  that maturity range has been pulled completely below the funds rate   And 2-year A2 industrial corporate paper yields the same as the  overnight rate The BB1 yields have moved appreciably lower, by 50  basis points in the 2-, 5-, and 10-year maturities since the time of your  last meeting       Now, with the short ends outperforming the long ends and the better   credits outperforming the lesser credits at the long end, what seems to  me to be happening is that very different sets of concerns in the markets  at the moment are converging in terms of investor behavior  From  whatever their different starting points, investors are tending to shorten  duration and move into the higher quality credits  Those who expect a  pronounced and enduring slowdown of activity expect a considerable  easing of monetary policy and thus are positioning themselves to enjoy a  rally in the short end of the yield curve  Those who think the current  slowdown may only be a pause are concerned about the potential  volatility of GDP and thus are tending to reduce their duration in order  to minimize their exposure to the long end  Those who are concerned  about corporate earnings strains and deteriorating credit quality are  fearful of corporate event risks and are reducing the maturity of their  credit exposures while shifting into better credits  Those who have  finished their risk-taking for the year because they have a sufficiency of  either gains or losses, have positioned themselves into the short end  while they await next year’s opportunities  As the short end of the curve  and the better credits across the curve have rallied, the hedging by  mortgage portfolio managers has accelerated the movement down     On the other side are those who think that interest rates, or at least   some portion of the 2- to 30-year curve, are at or near their bottom  because the soft landing will be achieved  In their view any pause in  activity will be quite brief or may even be over  These accounts have  been content to sell Treasury securities and swap contracts to the eager  buyers  Implicit in this view is the intriguing idea that the market has      6  not only led the Fed but that the market has lapped the Fed  Even as  they expect the Committee to lower short-term rates, they expect longer- term rates to be steady or rising  All of these views are usually reduced  to the simple dichotomy between those who expect a hard landing and  those who expect a soft one  On the one hand are those who anticipate a  pronounced weakness in demand and a deterioration of credit, and on  the other are those who think activity will stabilize or pick up and that  credit spreads will normalize once we pass through the typical year-end  seasonal risk aversion       Turning to page 4, you can see some extraordinary movements in   the commercial paper market  In the top chart are spreads of A2/P2 30- day commercial paper over the A1/P1 paper for all borrowers, financial  and nonfinancial, from September through February of each year since  1996  In the bottom chart are comparable data for 90-day commercial  paper  In both cases the heavy red line represents those spreads over the  period since September of this year      Clearly, the pattern in 2000 is outside the range of recent   experience, reflecting something more than normal risk aversion  associated with the window-dressing of year-end balance sheets  In  talking to those in the commercial paper market, one does not get a  sense of crisis in the A2/P2 market  But there is a rather strong sense of  saturation of higher risk assets  Portfolios that might have carried A2/P2  paper through the year-end have more than their fill of telecom paper  and other paper, whether long-term or short-term, of questionable credit  quality  And there is this wonderful notion in the markets that event risk  is somehow different from credit risk  It seems to me that event risk is  credit risk that they didn’t anticipate or didn’t price, but they'd rather not  admit that to their superiors  Clearly, the sharpness of the jump in the  30-day spread is a function of the term rolling through the turn of the  year  However, the extent of the spike can’t be attributed to the calendar  nor can the ratcheting up of the 90-day spread     On page 5 are the underlying data for the charts on the previous   page  Please don't try to read the fine print or take out your microscope!   Just view it from a few inches away and look at the shapes of the lines   On the left side are the 30-day yields and on the right side the 90-day  yields; the A1/P1 rates are the red lines and the A2/P2 rates the black  lines You can see the year-end for each year, marked by the heavy  dashed vertical line Compare the bottom panel, which depicts the 30-  and 90-day yields for this year, with those above from the preceding  years While the spike in the 30-day A2/P2 yield is quite abrupt, what is  even more extraordinary about this year compared to the previous four  years is the relative stability of the A1/P1 yields, with the 30-day yield  rising only modestly and the 90-day yield actually declining  This      7  seems to me to depict something of a noticeable flight into A1/P1 paper,  with that paper perhaps playing something of a safe haven role as a  substitute for Treasury bills  One can note that the A1/P1 yield for 90- day paper is right around 6-1/2 percent, which is about what the market  is being rewarded for holding 2-year A2 industrial paper  That's not  much of a reward for being that much farther out in duration  Market  participants are expecting some liquidity to come back to the market in  January and for some of this extraordinary spread to unwind  The  question that we won’t know the answer to until then is by how much         Turning briefly to domestic operations, Mr Chairman, on the last   page are two panels on reserve needs that are similar to the ones I  included last time  The top panel depicts actual and projected  cumulative changes in reserve needs as we forecast them  The solid  orange line is our current forecast for autonomous factors  The dashed  red lines show our projections at the time of your last meeting; we've  had very modest changes in our forecast  In the bottom panel is the path  of open market operations we’re contemplating for year-end  As you  can see, we’re on course for having about $23 billion in long-term, one- month RPs outstanding, and we expect to top off the year-end with just a  little more than $5 billion in overnight repos  This contrasts with the  more than $140 billion in repos we had outstanding on December 31st of  last year     Mr Chairman, we had no foreign exchange operations to report  I   will need the Committee’s ratification of our domestic operations  I’d  be happy to answer any questions        One is the S&P terminology and the other is Moody’s    A is S&P, am I right?    Well, the whole yield curve began to move  I think the mortgage portfolio   managers looked at your speech and saw in it a mix of a soft landing forecast and an easing forecast   without date specificity  And they came to feel a need to rush and anticipate the hedging needs for   their portfolios this late in the year  And that, I think, drove them to grab whatever assets were   available--whether they were agency debt securities, US Treasuries, or swaps--to move into to   hedge their duration risk  There was an arbitrage opportunity to wash some of this back out as our   10-year swap rate came down in a very pronounced manner, more than in Europe  But in the year-  end environment--     The explanation offered to me relates to the availability of futures market   substitutes  That is, the overall hedging market at the short end of the yield curve is so much deeper   than at the current longer end of the yield curve, the 10-year, that the result is this exaggerated   swing  And were this not happening at a year-end, the expectation is that it would have sorted itself   out more quickly    I don’t know    I guess I would share that sentiment  I’m trying to rack my mind on this; I   have a sense here that the commercial paper market lagged slightly what happened to the firms’   equity values in this case, and it's playing catch-up    No comment    This is the roll into December, the point at which the 30-day paper carries   over into the new year    To elaborate on what I’d hoped to convey in my remarks, I think it’s a   flight to quality issue of the substitution for Treasury bills being much more pronounced  In the   prior years, there’s a sense that the total sum of balance sheet credit to be offered is being   constrained as the intermediaries want to slim down for year-end, affecting both the A1 and the A2   market, though not quite equally  But you can see the impact in the prior years  What is quite   different this year is that there doesn’t seem to be any constraint on the A1/P1 market  So it doesn’t   look like a quantity constraint  It looks like a flight to quality  They’re substituting for Treasury   bills and maybe the A1 market is being pulled down a little by the rally in Treasury bills    "
6702,2001-01-30,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Effectively, I’ll just  be recapping the discussion and recommendations on possible near- term approaches presented on pages 3 through 5 of the memo that  Don and I sent to the Committee  I have some prepared remarks  and I’m going to try to respond to a few of the issues members  raised that relate to this topic     I’m going to be discussing what I think of as the immediate   challenge of operating over the next year or two, a different kind of  interim than the Chairman was talking about  In my personal view,  that’s the time horizon--two or even three years--before we could  implement any of the longer-term alternatives that are likely to be  pursued, whether they involve legislation or even the ACF  On the  ACF issue, let me just digress a moment  The idea of starting small  is, of course, a prudent way to begin  An open auction would be a  challenge because the big banks are not likely to be among the  bidders  The bidders will probably be the small banks in the  country who don’t have access to funding markets  So to make the     1/30-31/01 58  auction work at all, we really have to contemplate an electronic  auction process connecting thousands of banks  And that means a  nontrivial IT project, it seems to me  So in the next couple of years  we face an immediate challenge     There are really two constraints here  One involves our self-  imposed limits on our holdings of Treasury securities and the  declining supply of Treasuries  The other is the self-imposed  constraint of trying to keep our RP book small  I’d like to talk first  about the limits on our Treasury acquisitions that we set last July   Under those limits we still have a net authority to purchase $60  billion, so these limits are not going to be binding tomorrow  On  the forecast we’re working with, that carries us for another two or  three years, roughly speaking, given the relatively modest growth in  currency we expect to occur  But at present we’re dancing as fast  as we can to try to redistribute our holdings more smoothly across  the entire yield curve to prevent our pace of accumulation of  Treasuries from disrupting the markets  A couple of sensible  people in the market have reminded me that we--the Federal  Reserve System and its operations--are flying right under the radar   The Treasury is taking all the criticism for its buybacks and its  reduction of supply that is shrinking the liquidity of the market  But  we are there also draining the supply, and just because we do it  cleverly doesn’t mean that a lot of people in the bond market don’t  know it’s our operations that over time are working progressively to  reduce the liquidity of the market  When we think about the  alternative of raising the limits on our acquisitions of individual  Treasury securities, which is of course at the Committee’s  discretion, that’s really a question of how quickly the Committee  wants to be a party to eroding the liquidity of the market in which  we operate  That’s not a free good  Yes, buying more Treasuries  solves our asset accumulation problem for now, but the very act of  doing so diminishes the liquidity of the market on which we rely       In effect, recently we have been setting the pace of outright   purchases of Treasuries at a rate that we think will not disrupt the  market We adjust it gradually in an effort to keep out of the way of  the Treasury’s buyback operation--it’s sort of an intramural  courtesy--and we alter the size of our 28-day repo book to meet our  reserve needs  As I said earlier, the RP book functions as the  residual in that respect  Before the buildup associated with reserve  needs at year-end, we had about $10 billion of 28-day RPs  outstanding  I’ll be discussing that in more detail later in my  market report  At year-end 1999 we had roughly $140 billion in  RPs outstanding against a mix of Treasury and agency debt and     1/30-31/01 59  mortgage-backed collateral to match the substantial buildup in  currency in circulation as a result of Y2K       Let me remind you that we have been taking Freddie Mac and   Fannie Mae straight debt as a part of our repo operations for years   What we added that was novel for Y2K was mortgage-backed  securities guaranteed by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae as well as by  Ginnie Mae  The fact that we began taking mortgage-backed  securities appears to have reduced the financing rates in that market  by a basis point or so, something in that neighborhood  No one I’ve  talked to in the dealer community, though, thinks that the growth of  our RP book to $140 billion, with mortgage-backed securities as a  component, actually affected financing rates at all  That is a very  big market  The fact that we entered that market gave a certain  something to it, but the size of our presence in that very large  market didn’t really play a role--neither our moving into the market  at the end of 1999 nor rolling out of it in 2000     Let’s suppose we allowed the repo book to grow a bit and   combined that approach with measured purchases of Treasuries  under our limit structure--perhaps periodically revisiting the limits  themselves, but for the moment taking them as given  Under that  scenario, we in all likelihood would be able to meet our reserve  needs for the next three or four years, or maybe even longer,  depending on the rapidity of Treasury paydowns       Don and I certainly understand how some members feel about   our accepting Freddie and Fannie mortgage-backed securities as  well as straight debt  And that is the genesis of our effort to put a  self-imposed constraint on the RP book  Under likely scenarios of  near-term Treasury paydowns, notwithstanding political events,  moving to a Treasury only RP book would be a rather abrupt act on  our part  It would be confusing and possibly disruptive to the  market  And in my personal opinion just doing that could risk  making an overtly political issue of our asset selection       Given the Committee members’ discomfort with the status quo,   Don and I recommend that the Committee signal its intention to  move in the direction of diversifying the book of RP collateral  A  first step would be to instruct the staff to explore the feasibility of  adding tax exempt state and municipal securities and foreign  sovereign securities to the pool of collateral accepted for RPs  This  would involve discussions with Congressional staff and market  participants, as Mike Moskow noted  But as Don said in his  opening remarks, it is fully our intent that this subject would be  raised in the Chairman’s upcoming testimony--and certainly in the     1/30-31/01 60  minutes of this meeting, to be released in March--before we would  talk to anyone directly     Moving in the direction of diversification would tend to dilute   the special status that Freddie and Fannie obligations are now  perceived to have  As for RPs against foreign sovereign securities,  let me repeat that we envision doing dollar RPs against them; we  would put out dollars and take in foreign sovereign securities   Again, those are very big markets  There’s a table in the Madigan- Krieger paper that shows the size of various markets  We need to  think about trying to find ponds in which we will be a small fish,  which is not easy  And that is the huge attraction of the foreign  sovereign markets     Given the uncertainty in the fiscal outlook, I thought it would   be helpful to find a way to muddle through for the next few years  without departing significantly from our current mode of  operations  As I noted earlier, continuing to purchase Treasury  securities at a measured pace and allowing the book of term RPs to  grow to fill the gap could meet reserve needs for the foreseeable  future  Therefore, Don and I are asking the Committee to extend  the Desk’s temporary authority to operate in mortgage-backed  securities  More specifically, we ask that the Committee extend for  one year the temporary suspension of paragraphs 3 through 6 of the  Guidelines for the Conduct of System Operations in Agency Issues   We also request the Committee’s authority to explore the feasibility  of adding tax exempt and foreign sovereign securities to the pool of  acceptable RP collateral  So that’s our proposal  What we’d like to  do now is to have an open discussion of these matters     On the agenda you’ll see that we are asking for a vote of the   Committee on three proposals  One is the very technical issue of  changing the dates in the Authorization for Domestic Open Market  Operations  The second is the vote on the Guidelines for operations  in agency issues  And the third is the vote to renew three foreign  currency documents--the Authorization for Foreign Currency  Operations, the Foreign Currency Directive, and the Procedural  Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations--without  amendment  Before we proceed with those votes, however, the  Committee may wish to discuss these proposals or ask questions of  Don and me or other staff       Let me make a couple of points  First, that’s something we   would explore in our feasibility study, and that’s why we’re not really asking you to   authorize it yet  Second, I would remind the Committee that last fall we offered--and you   agreed and the Treasury has agreed--to change our investment pattern in foreign currency   reserves, particularly in the euro area  We had been in German instruments only and we   knew that was not sustainable  So we’ve come up with a mix of credit criteria that would   allow us to have a repo book against most euro-area sovereign nations And we have   developed even tougher credit criteria for outright purchases, which under present   conditions would make only the securities of Germany and France eligible for the   outright portfolio  We are currently discussing with the Treasury our view that it’s time   to put out the announcement about that so we can begin conversations with market   participants and be transparent about it before we actually make those investments  So I   think we have a fairly disciplined set of credit criteria for investing in a foreign portfolio   for a time  I admit that it would not be for all time but I think we could follow that   model  Eventually I’m sure we will be caught in a difficult line-drawing exercise, which   is no doubt what your question is driving at, and I don’t deny that    The category of municipals that we are able to purchase under   statute is rather narrow, as the papers have made clear  It involves issues of very short   maturity  I think we could also choose to set credit criteria or perhaps limit ourselves to   state sovereigns, so we would not be opening ourselves up to the whole market  But to   come up with some objective criteria I think we’d have to go through an exercise similar   to the one we have done with respect to the foreign RP book     1/30-31/01 62   In this case we’re talking about RPs, so we know the   underlying instruments themselves may be illiquid  The question is whether we can get   the clearing banks and the dealers to make them part of the pool of collateral that goes   into the assets they pledge in an RP with us  What is modestly promising about both   foreign sovereign and municipal securities is that the clearing banks are set up to do   them, though only a tiny amount is being done now  Nevertheless, that’s a big hurdle in   terms of technology  We probably wouldn’t have a liquidity criterion for the assets but   we might want to place limits on the amount of any one state’s securities we take for fear   that if we had to liquidate, we would have to worry about how much we were trying to   sell     Relative to its size  But we wouldn’t take much comfort from   thinking that some segments of that market are liquid  None of those securities is liquid     I guess that depends on whether you’re from Texas or California!     I don’t believe so  I’m sure that at the time of Drexel it crossed   our collective minds and we worried about it  But I don’t recall a failed RP in my time     I don’t agree that it does just the opposite  To make a   correction, I believe the deposit accounts we hold for the GSEs are authorized by statute    So that’s not a very useful break point  I know there are all kinds of legal issues   surrounding the GSEs that we don’t really want to get into  But signaling to the markets   that what this Committee wants to do is to diversify its asset mix certainly moves   people’s thinking away from the notion that agency issues, those of Fannie and Freddie in   particular, are going to be the assets of choice  And that’s an issue on the minds and even   the lips of some people in the market  They are questioning whether agency issues are   going to be our assets of choice as Treasury issues decline  I think the foreign sovereign     1/30-31/01 64  markets are big enough and deep enough to dissipate the perception that we are somehow   going to become dependent on Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae securities    Governor Meyer, I want to be clear  I certainly share the views   you expressed in your earlier remarks about the preferability of a clean sheet of paper as   well as the longer-term hypothesis that President Poole offered that if we are in Freddie   and Fannie obligations, why not commercial paper and corporate bonds  I’m looking at   what to do without a change in statute  So I share some of the views you expressed      Don and I both may want to comment on that  I certainly   would agree with you that it’s a risk  I think that our eyes would be closed if we didn’t   see that as a risk  We are in a rather awkward position  If we are too stern in the view   that we should only be monetizing our own government’s debt, I think that poses   questions about our consistency, given the eagerness with which we’ve encouraged   foreign sovereigns to monetize US Treasuries  There are $500 billion worth of them in     1/30-31/01 65  custody at the New York Fed  Other central banks seem to consider it reasonable to hold   our Treasuries in a permanent way as assets on their balance sheets  In many countries in   the world it is not viewed as a sign of central banking virtue to become a captive   financing agency for one’s own Treasury  The Bundesbank has felt very strongly about   that since the Second World War; they have tried to avoid taking on that role  So in a   broad world view I think there are a number of points that could be brought to the table to   explain why this is a reasonable thing to do and why reasonable central bankers might do   it  Other central banks do it now, as our study’s background papers indicated  But I   don’t want to ignore the risk that there would be some questions  I think keeping this   activity in the RP area and not purchasing foreign securities outright is clearly an element   in trying to address that concern  But I certainly wouldn’t deny that that’s an issue    We would stop taking mortgage-backed securities, including   those guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, and we would then be including in our repo book   Freddie and Fannie straight debt  There is an aspect of that which may look as if we’re   giving an even greater preference to Freddie and Fannie debt than we are to issues backed   by the full faith and credit of the United States  That is the awkward part of how we were   operating before the fall of 1999  I regret that we were in that position; it’s something we   should have understood better  It was a slightly awkward place to be and that would be   the consequence of the scenario you outlined    That’s a difficult political issue on which I would prefer that   others--perhaps those who live in this District--comment  As a market matter, I don’t   view it as a major challenge, given a reasonable time period to work it all out    Let me see if I read you clearly  I don’t want to put words in   your mouth, but I want to be sure I understand  You’re envisioning going forward with   foreign sovereign and municipal securities as a part of the RP book--putting aside the   issue of volume--and setting a forward date for getting out of Fannie and Freddie straight   debt and mortgage-backed securities in the RP book, right?    I think that’s in the feasible set  That would be an option to   consider  I’m not sure we know enough now to determine whether it is feasible and,   therefore, whether we would want to set that forward date now  That’s part of the   exploratory nature of the authority we’re looking for in “B”    I don’t like the metaphor of either a cat’s paw or front-running   very much, Governor Ferguson  I don’t think we’re doing either one  Clearly, as Don   and I have both said, it is our preference and intent to have the initial discussion of this be   put forward through the Chairman’s testimony and the Committee’s minutes, in which   you have a lot more input than I on how it is styled and stated  I think there are ways to   introduce this that make clear both the tentative nature of what we’re doing and the fact   that we are exploring a lot of options  I think that’s something well within our ability to   convey    It can be made effectively zero with daily adjustment of the   margins, which is how we would do it  The way I have thought of it is that we would in   all likelihood be accepting a rather low rate of return on our RPs of foreign sovereigns   because dealing with the System will be relatively unattractive from the perspective of   dealers who have those securities in inventory  We will have to be margining for both   the exchange rate risk and the underlying price risk  I would note, however, that both the   Bank of England and the Swiss National Bank seem to have gotten around that problem   and have found ways to make this work for them    That’s how we’ve thought of it    I think it’s in the feasible set  I don’t know how much software   engineering would have to go into it, but it’s something that several central banks have   set up  We might have to use a broader set of custodians  We currently are relying on   Chase and Bank of New York  We might well end up using Euroclear and some of the   European based clearing organizations to make this work and that might be rather   complicated  There would be legal issues if Euroclear is our custodian for the foreign   sovereign repo pool  Nevertheless, in my view it’s not just feasible but practical, though   I don’t know how much time it will take to make preparations to enter that market    Let me be careful in my answer  We do RPs with our   counterparties and they pledge a mix of collateral that they have in inventory  We can set   the credit criteria of what we’ll accept  We worked long and hard on the criteria for the   investment of our foreign currency reserves, which I discussed with you last fall, in order   to make those as objective and bulletproof as possible  Those criteria had nothing to do   with GDP weighting or political resources or which countries were big in Europe and   which were small  So, if we have clearly articulated objective criteria for what we will   take as collateral and adhere to that, I think it would be manageable  And we’re only   talking about repos, so it would be a question of what the dealers have in inventory,   which changes from day to day, and not making outright purchases  I don’t want to deny   the concern you’re addressing, but I think we’ve defined a series of conditions that make   it manageable    Yes, thank you     In my memo of January 25th to the Committee I indicated the   three proposals on which I’d be asking you to vote  The first one, I hope, involves no   controversy  I’d like the Committee to renew for one year the Authorization for   Domestic Open Market Operations, substituting 65 business days for the reference to 90   calendar days, with my apologies for bothering you with this  With that amendment, as   explained in my memo, I’d ask for a vote to reauthorize the domestic authorization    Thank you  The second vote is on the Guidelines for the   Conduct of System Operations in Federal Agency Issues, which we’ve just been   discussing  I’d like to ask the Committee to extend the temporary suspension of     1/30-31/01 74  paragraphs 3 through 6 of these Guidelines for one year, until the Committee’s first   scheduled meeting in 2002    Thank you  The third vote, Mr Chairman, is on the   Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations, the Foreign Currency Directive, and the   Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations  As explained on   the second page of my memo, I ask the Committee to reaffirm those documents as they   stand    Yes  Also, several members of the Committee mentioned the   near-term political uncertainty relating to spending and tax measures under consideration    A year from now we may have budget proposals from this Administration that will   provide a clearer picture of when those initiatives might have an impact--in a year or two     1/30-31/01 84  or three after that  So by then you may feel that a shorter list of options would need to be   explored on an expedited basis for that time horizon    I’m not a member of the Committee, but I’d like to speak for   the Desk and its role in conducting open market operations  The Lombard facility would   make adjustment credit more useful and increase its use, and that would be a helpful   aspect of managing reserves in the banking system  I may be an outlier, but by raising     1/30-31/01 85  the price I think we actually would reduce the stigma of borrowing and encourage its use    That is counterintuitive but in this situation, given the stigma historically associated with   borrowing at the discount window, I think it might work  So, I would hope that   discussion of the ACF would not postpone thorough deliberation of the Lombard facility   ideas you’ve been pursuing  That’s not a statement regarding where you might feel   comfortable moving the rate, which is a matter that the Board would have to decide    They’re just different tools      Yes, the Lombard facility is for borrowing at the end of the   day      No, it’s not an auction; it’s discount window borrowing    Let me interject to avoid a misconception  In all likelihood we   would institute a next-day settlement for an auction among the 8,000 or so depository   institutions that might be eligible to participate  Such an auction may not even be in the   realm of possibility for adjusting today’s reserves, whereas the discount window is really   about letting the banking system settle on a same-day basis    The Treasury keeps telling us that they will have enough   capacity in the TT&L system and I keep worrying that they won’t  But I don’t have a   good handle on that  Sandy, do you want to comment?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the familiar   package of charts with a Class II peach cover 1/     The first chart depicts current and forward deposit rates  US   rates declined sharply following the Committee’s January 3rd  reduction of the fed funds target rate by 50 basis points  But the  change in expectations has been noticeably less for rates 12 months  out than for rates in the next six months       The current 3-month rate, the solid red line, fell by about 70   basis points in the couple of days immediately after the  announcement  and is now 80 basis points below its level in late  December The 3-month forward rate is now roughly 60 basis points  below where it was at year-end whereas the 9-month forward rate,  after initially falling by about 40 basis points from its late December  level, is now back up to where it was just before the year-end  In  fact, though you can’t quite see it on this chart, the 9-month forward  3-month rate is a couple of basis points above the 3-month forward  rate, showing some reduced expectations of easing that may have  been priced in further out in the calendar       Euro rates fell modestly in sympathy with dollar rates after the   Committee’s action earlier this month  However, the 9-month  forward euro rate is now back to where it ended last year  Rates in  Japan have been grinding lower in light of the deteriorating outlook  for the Japanese economy, which Karen will be discussing     Turning to the second page, I’ve included a new set of charts   that provide a different indicator of financial conditions  The top  panel depicts two-year government yields for several countries less  their central bank’s short-term policy rate  Now, these involve  slightly different maturities in the different countries as explained in  the bottom footnote, but it gives some sense of the inversion of the  short end of the yield curve between very short-term rates and the  two-year rate  In the bottom panel, the same concept is depicted but  with the substitution of the swap rate for the government yield--and  thus the difference between the top panel, where we used German  government yields and the bottom panel which has the euro-area  swap rate     __________________________  1/  A copy of the charts is appended to this transcript  (Appendix 1)   In the top panel you can see that in the United Kingdom, the  United States, and Canada the two-year notes first moved below the     1/30-31/01 92  short-term policy rates last summer  In contrast, against the two- year swap rate shown in the bottom panel, the inversion really only  began later in the year, around mid-November  The important  question one could try to answer is the extent to which a consistency  in the movement toward an inverted short end reflects an  independent but parallel firming of conditions in each country or the  influence of dollar interest rates and US financial conditions on  other markets  I don’t think it’s necessary to try to resolve that  debate; it may never be possible to resolve it  Instead, if we  recognize this spread as an indicator of monetary tightness, it is clear  that conditions were rather tight by the end of last year and have  only eased a little since then in a number of markets     Turning to page 3, the top panel shows changes in the G-3   trade-weighted currencies since November 1st, using the Bank of  England’s indices  While there has been a lot of talk about dollar  weakness, you can see there that the yen is down by 10 percent and  that the euro is up by about 7 percent, though off its peak  But the  dollar is not much changed, at least through last Friday’s close,  although it may be off a bit today       The bottom panel depicts the differential that I showed you last   time between dollar and euro 2- and 10-year swap rates  Since your  action on the 3rd of January, the 2-year differential has narrowed  considerably and noticeably--through 80 basis points--and now  stands just around 75 basis points  On the other hand, the 10-year  differential has widened from about 50 basis points at the beginning  of the month to roughly 75 basis points or thereabouts now      In the 2-year area it’s relatively easy to see that the markets   place a greater likelihood on easing by the Fed than by the ECB  going forward, and that would be an explanation for the narrowing  of the 2-year differentials  The widening of the differential in the  10-year area seems mostly to have come on our side of the equation   It shows the swap yields moving in sympathy with Treasury rates   I’ll discuss that on the next page       The charts on page 4 are four snapshots of yield curves on   dates of Committee meetings or policy actions since November and  as of last Friday, January 26th  If you compare Friday’s rates, shown  in the lower right-hand panel, with those at the upper right on the  day of the December 19th FOMC meeting, you can see that at the  short end rates on all four of these yield curves are noticeably lower   At the long end, however, the industrial indices are slightly lower  and the swap and Treasury rates are slightly higher  I’d be careful  on my analysis here and begin by saying that this is a fairly brief     1/30-31/01 93  period from which to draw any particularly profound conclusions   But I think the corporate yields have declined modestly on a  combination of factors--reduced issuance and a marginal increase in  risk appetites relative to late December when the market was fairly  risk averse, as investors have begun to reach for yield  The modest  rise in US Treasury and swap yields reflects the other side of that  I  see some return of risk appetites, which has shifted investors out of  the long end of the Treasury curve into the short end, where they  were looking for a bit of a rally, and also into higher yielding  corporate securities      Also, compared with where rates were, certainly in November-  December, expectations of a reduced volume of Treasury buybacks  and shifts in the outlook for fiscal policy, given the heightened  prospects for tax cuts, may be influencing this slight backup in the  long end  There may also be some shift in inflation expectations, but  I think we have to be careful here  While the 10-year TIPS spread  has widened from its level of about 130 basis points in late  December to around 170-175 basis points now, that only brought the  spread back its level in late November, which was still 25 basis  points below where it was in early November  So, there’s probably  more noise in the positioning in these markets than in the underlying  data from these periods  All in all, I’d put a little more weight on the  short-term positioning story than on the unwinding of the extreme  risk aversion we had at year-end     Turning to the next page, the unwinding of the risk aversion   was somewhat more short-lived in the commercial paper market   The top panels are comparable to the ones I included last month on  30-day and 90-day commercial paper spreads  The bottom panels  provide detail on the levels of 30-day and 90-day commercial paper  rates  The bold red lines in the top panels show the extraordinary  extent to which the spreads of A2/P2 to A1/P1 widened out this year  compared with the previous four years     The combination of crossing the calendar year-end date and the   Committee’s rate cut at the start of the year clearly gave a jolt to the  commercial paper market, and people felt a lot better about things   But by the middle of January the worsening conditions in the  California energy area became apparent  So I think the deterioration  in the outlook for the utilities reminded the market about the  deteriorating outlook for earnings more generally and contributed to  this return to a picture of extreme risk aversion in the commercial  paper market        1/30-31/01 94  Turning to domestic operations, on the top of the next page is a  panel similar to the ones I’ve shown you before  The orange lines  and dots indicate the drain in reserves since early October from the  impact of changes in autonomous factors  The green line shows how  much more has been drained by net Treasury redemptions   Comparing the actual with the dashed orange lines--our projections-- shows that currency grew more than we had projected for the turn of  the year period, and reflows really didn’t get us back to the level we  had projected  The pace of the reflow was about what we were  forecasting, but from a much higher level that doesn’t seem to be  coming down as fast as we had expected     In the bottom panel you can see how we’ve managed the   relationship between 28-day RPs and our shorter-term RPs  We’re  working down the book of 28-day RPs from the $23 billion held at  year-end, and we now have about $12 billion      Turning to the last page of my packet, I thought I’d discuss   briefly the extended reserve outlook through the first half of this  year  Working down from the top of the page, on a maintenance  period average basis, we expect from now until the end of June--and  these are rough forecasts--the net impact from factor movements,  mostly currency, to drain about $6 billion  And the impact of  anticipated net redemptions by the Treasury should drain another  $10 billion--that’s probably a low-end estimate but one that’s rather  complicated to forecast--for a total drain of about $16 billion       Below that I’ve shown two examples of how we might proceed   if we try to reduce the term RP book  Case “A” depicts the impact  of reducing term RPs to zero on a maintenance period average basis,  the numbers I’ve been talking about here  In that scenario we would  have drains of another $19 billion and would face reserve needs of  $35 billion  If we put the term RP book to zero, that would imply  $35 billion in outright purchases of Treasury securities  If we were  thinking of working the RP book down to about $10 billion, shown  as Case “B,” that would imply outright Treasury purchases of about  $25 billion from now to midyear  My own comfort zone is closer to  the latter scenario, and that’s the approach I would intend to pursue   I’d like to note again that the net redemption estimate may be low  and that we could face a challenge of higher net redemptions  There  is a lot of uncertainty about the Treasury’s issuance pattern     Mr Chairman, we had no foreign exchange intervention   operations to report  I’d be happy to answer any questions, and I’ll  need a ratification of the Desk’s domestic operations        1/30-31/01 95   I am focusing on it as the residual  It's not a dumb question,   Cathy  I probably didn't make myself clear, so let me try to do that  In 1998 and prior   years we purchased Treasury securities outright to meet the growth in underlying factors,   and repos were used simply to deal with short-term fluctuations  As I tried to explain this   morning, we have shifted our approach markedly in the past two years  We now   purchase Treasuries outright at a pace that, were it much faster, could result in our being   a disturbance to the market  That is my concern  I can't put a fine point on it, but I work   this out with Bob Elsasser, who heads our government securities staff  We look at the   schedule of the Treasury's buybacks and its issuance of various securities  We look at   our pace of accumulation and try to assess its effect on the Treasury market   In 1998 we purchased $35 billion in the first half of the year and that put us on   pace for an all-time record accumulation of roughly $45 billion that year  And by all   accounts we were pushing the market  I'd like to try to step back from that pace of   accumulation  Now, even $25 billion of outright Treasury purchases in the first half of   this year and another $25 billion in the second half will result in a record-breaking   amount again this year  I'd like to correct any misimpression members of the Committee   may have  The numbers I cited are gross accumulations--not net--of Treasuries bought   on an outright basis  I'm only telling the Committee that I would prefer to continue to run   a term repo book of around $10 billion and take the risk that the repo book might grow a     1/30-31/01 96  bit more--say, to $15 billion--if net Treasury debt redemptions run faster  I’m just trying   to spell out for the Committee what we are planning to do    Yes, and shorter-term RPs--five-day, three-day, two-day    My preference would be not to reduce the book of long-term   RPs  I'm telling the Committee that I do not plan to reduce it to zero    On just a pure maintenance period average basis, yes, we are   going to move into the area of $10 billion  Forgive me, Cathy, it's my lack of clarity    There is a risk that redemptions will be higher or that some reserve factors will grow   faster than projected  If that happens, we could have a larger RP book between now and   June  That's why even if we get it down to $10 billion, it might at some point have to go   back up to $15 billion or even $20 billion if other factors alter our reserve needs    Case “B” is what we'll be aiming at  That is what I'm saying    My apologies!     1/30-31/01 97   When the Committee discussed this topic a year ago at the   February FOMC meeting and again in March some members expressed concern about a   large repo book against a mixed pool of collateral  I'm trying to run a middle ground   between those concerns, which I understand, and--     I think you've expressed it very well, Cathy  I'm suggesting   that taking the longer-term RP book down to $10 billion is a target but that faster growth   in reserve factors or higher Treasury redemptions would tend to push it back up toward   $20 billion, though I don't know quite how much  So the “fudge factor” is $10 billion to   $20 billion    Yes     1/30-31/01 98   Yes    We don't need to be driven by habit  But after Y2K we had a   term RP book of $140 billion  We were able to wind that down to about $10 billion,   given the pace of outright accumulation we were comfortable with  That's where we   were last August    The book then grew to about $23 billion at year-end and we're   in the process of getting that level back down     That level, though, may be higher than $10 billion, as I see it    No apologies required!  "
7722,2005-05-03," Thank you, Mr Chairman   I will do that, Mr Chairman   I’d like to ask a question of Karen about import price growth, particularly in   the retail sector In terms of imported goods sold through our retail chains and the timing of the   increasing price pressures we’ve seen, is that weighted heavily toward March and recent activity in   April?  Could you expand on that a little bit?   I realize I’m entering an ongoing conversation midstream, but sometimes it   may be useful to have a fresh set of eyes and ears to at least give an interpretation of what he or she   is seeing I went back and read the minutes of the last several meetings  I’m glad to see confirmed,   Mr Stockton, that you do have a sense of humor  [Laughter]   But I do detect something of a noticeable dissonance between the last several meetings and   currently in terms of what’s in the Bluebook, what’s in the Greenbook, and the tenor of the   discussion And I’m going to use a baseball analogy to describe how I see the situation from the   perspective of the FOMC as a batter at the plate   It seems to me that over the course of the last many meetings this Committee saw a fairly   consistent delivery from the pitcher’s mound  These were fast balls that came right across the   middle—in the strike zone between the knees with 1 percent inflation and the letters with 2 percent   inflation It was the predictable pitch coming down the pipe, as they like to say in baseball  And   you—I can’t say “we” because this is my first meeting—assumed a batter’s stance accordingly and   managed to continue to round the bases without creating any imbalances   Now the data and anecdotal evidence indicate that the economy has at least changed   pitchers, and we’re getting a few curve balls, maybe some knuckle balls, maybe some split-finger   fast balls, and an occasional change of pace The inevitable question is Do we adjust our batter’s                                 May 3, 2005 39 of 116  stance or keep what worked for the fast ball pitcher who has been on the mound for the last seven   innings?  And unlike you, Cathy, I’m going to save that discussion until the second part  But I do   want to address myself to the kinds of pitches we see coming across the plate in the Eleventh District   and also nationally and globally   Sitting where I’m sitting and looking at that map on the wall, of course, the District is   probably drawn in relative scale to the egos of my fellow country people  But as the second largest   manufacturing state, the second largest in terms of employment in the high-tech sector, and a major   transshipment point with significant retailing activity, I think there may be some proxy value in our   District’s performance  So I just want to report that, whereas before we were lagging the economy,   we seem to have caught up with the pace  We think economic activity in our region grew at around   3 percent in the first quarter   Manufacturing activity in general in the Eleventh District, and high-tech manufacturing in   particular, has picked up in pace There has been a notable improvement  As for energy-related   activity, which is a stereotype for our District—we do have oil—the best way to summarize it is the   way one of our contacts summarizes it  If you can pass a drug test and you can speak Spanish, you   can get a job in the oil sector There are a lot of price pressures from the standpoint of employment   However, in the petrochemical sector, we haven’t had any reports of pass-through activity in   terms of pricing power, and I don’t think that is unimportant  And we are not hearing reports of   increased pricing power generally from our retailers and others—other than for accountants because   of Sarbanes-Oxley Now, I don’t know how good a proxy that is We’re a very open economy  I   don’t know what the output gap of Texas is, for example; it’s a very porous economy  But this is   confirmed by our contacts with larger global operators  And against my background, having spent   the last five years as a strategic advisor to UPS, Exxon, EDS, and Wal-Mart, etc—and by the way,                                 May 3, 2005 40 of 116  particularly with the railroads—I’ve taken advantage of that to reach out and try to get a feel to see   how it corresponds with what we’re seeing locally We’ve had a couple of confirming impressions   On the domestic economy, there seems to be an expectation of a 3 to 3½ percent growth rate,   and people are adjusting to that expectation One of our contacts, the CEO of a company, reminded   me that we went through a period in the early 1990s when economists lowered expectations for   growth to 2½ percent, and we were very happy to see 3 percent against that set of expectations He   went on to say that now everybody is what he called “Eeyore”—down in the chops about growth   that’s not 4 percent But in his view, 3½ percent, and I quote, is “darn good growth”   On the energy sector, one can’t get a better view than from the companies that operate in our   state, the large transnational companies, and if you’ll forgive me, from a dinner we had last Sunday   night with those CEOs and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia It was a small group that met to   discuss what they thought was going on in energy prices, for what it’s worth  And it’s a fairly good   source, I think In terms of current pricing, the discussion at the table focused on the fact that some   percentage of that pricing is due to financial and speculative activity As summarized by the CEO   who will remain unnamed but who runs the largest oil company in the world, the market seems to be   pricing in a supply disruption some time this winter  To quote him, “For the life of me, I cannot   figure out where it’s going to come from and the degree of pricing, but it’s not insignificant”   Another company estimated that the amount being priced in for financial speculation and   potential disruptive activity is somewhere around $10 a barrel  But a key point is that the chemical   guys are not finding it easy to pass on cost increases at the national level or at the international level   either In addition, there is sufficient refining capacity for current production levels and not a great   expectation that there will be significant additions to refining capacity                                    May 3, 2005 41 of 116  They’re not able to pass on increases Neither are the retailers One retailer noted that an   abrupt halt to sales of household goods took place in March, which his firm thinks was driven by the   slowdown in new housing starts One of the nation’s largest retailers, which is continuing to build   its capacity to source in China, reports that price pressures in constructing new stores is significant   because of higher prices for the materials that are going in—steel aggregates and so on  But as to   what they sell, and I quote, “Prices have not risen; they’ve just stopped falling We can’t discount   aggressively without hurting our margins and we don’t have the leeway to raise prices”   And one last input from the CEO of one of the nation’s largest railroads, and by the way the   CFO of one of the largest air shippers their shipments are geared significantly to transoceanic trade   The nation’s largest railroad reported to us that they’ve seen a 21 percent growth this last quarter in   their international business That is particularly geared toward the trans-Pacific trade, and through   this lens it appears that our manufacturers and retailers are expecting to continue significantly   boosting their investments for sourcing in China  As one of them said, they are ramping up their   spending in China and continuing to arbitrage labor with China From this and our international   contacts—mine by the way ended abruptly and happily on March 31 when I joined this organization,   for which I’m grateful—we infer that the effects of globalization on our assumptions about resource   slack and the constraints on the economy and the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment have   yet to run their course Thank you   Again, Mr Chairman, I’m new, and I want to be appropriately humble and   respectful I listened very carefully to what you were saying The way I interpret the first part of   what you said is that we don’t want to signal the market that we know something the markets don’t   anticipate or don’t know Having been a market operator and being sensitive on that front, I agree   with that And I don’t think there’s an argument for a pause, so I would argue for a 25 basis point   increase in the funds rate   I’m a little worried about later in the statement signaling to market participants what they   may interpret as something that we know that they do not know  So I would again suggest that we   might consider a change in the “measured pace” language against that background  The idea of   maintaining a measured pace implies we will continue along this path; and if we deviate from that   path, that might come as an unpleasant surprise to the marketplace   As to the procedure, I’m too new to have any opinions on that  Like you, Cathy, I too have   sort of a Rubik’s cube of moving parts to place  I would suggest, against the background of what   Janet said, the possibility of just eliminating section 5 entirely in alternative A  That would give us a   shorter statement and even reflect a concern about some asymmetries that we’re detecting, and I   think that might do the job  "
7748,2005-06-29,"  Following up on Governor Ferguson’s question, I would imagine that one of   the differences here is that we have tremendous variations from market to market  And to the   Chairman’s question about the proportion of housing prices attributable to the land value, I would   assume that it has to do with local regulation and restrictions on land use  For example, if you look   at the numbers for homes being considered or under permit for construction in Southern   California—that includes Los Angeles, Ventura, and Orange County—in the ’80s it was in the   100,000 plus range This year it’s 37,000, in part because of the imposition of highly restrictive   regulations on land use  If you look at permits for current construction of single-family homes in   North Carolina, where there are almost no restrictions whatsoever, it’s over 50,000   So, the question is Can you assume that land price as a percentage of house price is a   function of regulatory and other restrictions imposed on land use and on construction?  Is there a   way to measure this?  I ask because it strikes me—and I’ve been thinking about other countries as                                             June 29-30, 2005 41 of 234  well, and Spain is an interesting example—that monetary policy would be a very blunt general tool   if, indeed, there are significant variations city by city, state by state, and market by market    I would imagine that it would be driven also by the kind of margins that the   suppliers can capture  Just for verisimilitude, I talked to Hovnanian, who builds about 20,000   homes a year at roughly $300,000 apiece  His margins are being squeezed in California, but in   these less restrictive areas he can capture a greater amount, so obviously he gravitates to where he   can capture the greatest margin  Now that’s just one example, but common sense would suggest   that it applies more broadly    Mr Chairman, I’d like to propose that he buy my house in Washington,   [laughter] given that confidence    No, sir Mine was on a similar line, neither a question nor a statement   [Laughter]    I just have a quick question, going back to the oil issue  There are some   770,000 outstanding futures contracts on the NYMEX  If you look at the CFTC [Commodity   Futures Trading Commission] data, 11 percent of those are noncommercial players—what they call   Wall Street and city refiners  To the extent that the staff measures that as an influence, I’m curious                                 June 29-30, 2005 108 of 234  as to what percentage of the spot price or of futures prices do you consider to be weighted by the   nonfinancial players?  Are they a driving force or are they inconsequential?    I was just curious about whether we know or feel that they can exacerbate   trends in a direction    Thank you, Mr Chairman    First, let me say that I’ll eschew any and all sports analogies in my   presentation and give it to you more or less straight up   The oddity about our District is that we have almost no banks but we have enormous   producers for the economy  For example—and I’m prefacing my remarks this way for a purpose—   together with the maquiladoras in Mexico we have two million manufacturing workers  We have   two of the largest airline companies  We have some of the largest railroads  We have Dell, Texas   Instruments, EDS, and so on  And I have assiduously been calling around and talking to the CEOs   of those companies in order to get a feel not only about developments in our District but also in the   national economy  And this is my report to you   First of all, Mr Chairman, our District lagged the nation in recovery and really didn’t come   out of the recession until 2003  We are now growing on pace with the national economy, at a rate   of around 3½ percent plus  That’s the good news    On the price front, obviously, there have been increases in the price of oil—and we do have   some major oil companies and oil producers  But other than in oil, oil field workers’ wages, prices   of ranch land that may have mineral rights, and in health care, we see no evidence of the price   pressures and pricing power that we’ve talked about before     I’ve taken some liberties, and with my colleague’s permission I’ve talked to a neighbor to   the north who is an officer of the nation’s largest retailer—Wal-Mart  The COO, whom I used to   advise in my previous capacity, and I had a conversation two days ago and I was struck by his   statement that “We’ve been surprised at the lack of inflation across the store”  It’s a rather large   store, I might add  He indicated that the dynamics of the world economy are exerting downward   price pressures, still to this day—deflating prices in electronics, clothing, and almost all retail   sectors There is one exception, which is a 46 percent price increase in diapers  But other than that,                   June 29-30, 2005 126 of 234  my contact noted that they were having trouble making any price moves other than in a flat to down   direction    This was confirmed by the CEO of Penney’s  It’s a different price point  They have about a   46 percent overlap with Wal-Mart  But in household furnishings and apparel—again, there are   concerns driven by Chinese production levels—they are trying to make up in volume for what they   see as continued downward pressure on prices  This is despite the existence of quotas in certain   areas And, in fact, my contact pointed out that they are forecasting that such pressure will continue   for several years to come   In terms of residential construction, as I mentioned yesterday, I talked to someone at one of   the nation’s largest homebuilders—a builder of 20,000 homes who has about $6 billion a year in   revenue  Interestingly, with construction costs—the cost of materials plumbing, furnishings, and   fixtures—there is continued price deflation  Again, that is based on imports coming into the United   States The two areas where they do see constant prices—cement and lumber—Mr Chairman, are   largely due to trade restrictions; lumber sales from Canada and cement sales from Mexico are being   restricted by trading arrangements     The largest paper product company, Kimberly-Clark, is in our District  Interestingly, its   CEO reported only one product line where they feel the ability to pass on costs based on energy   prices, which again was the diaper market  That has been the subject of quite a lot of discussion in   our District!  [Laughter]  The story is different for prices of paper-based hospital products, which   constitute a growing market because of linens being unsanitary  They have a labor component; and   because of the labor component from China, the Philippines, Estonia, and elsewhere, there is   continued price deflation                         June 29-30, 2005 127 of 234    Our contacts in the chemical industry, which is substantial in our District, report that they   cannot pass on price increases and have no pricing power  In the IT [information technology]   sector, our sources at Dell, TI, and EDS say that hardware and telecom costs continue downward    And India has begun to exert an effect that is keeping a price ceiling on software costs  As for the   shippers, I spoke with CEOs of three shippers—one again a former client in another District—and   they report that they see growth “a tad bit slower”  They are constrained by competition from DHL   and the US Postal Service and by their inability to pass on cost increases other than standard fuel   surcharges     The CEO of the largest railroad in our area reports soft patches in the economy  He noted   particularly that growth in shipments for trans-Pacific trade has slowed to the high single digits from   significant double digits  Most notably, by the way, this is occurring in steel where prices have   come off dramatically   Most interesting of all were the discussions we’ve had with shippers  I previously served on   a Norwegian shipping board—got off at just the right time—but have used those contacts to get a   better understanding of the shipping industry  And I think here are some interesting data  Other   than the category of LNG tankers, which was covered by the Financial Times adequately this   morning, the Baltic Dry Index, for example, has been dropping dramatically  In fact, the cost of   shipping at one point, as you remember, exceeded the cost of goods shipped  Last year, it cost   $100,000 a day to charter a ship to carry iron ore for the manufacture of steel—as we saw in the   charts—from either Brazil or India to China  Now the cost is $31,000     But here is the clincher  China has entered the shipbuilding business in a dramatic way  It   currently accounts for 14 percent of the shipbuilding market; 40 percent is produced by Korea and   32 percent by Japan  China will double its shipbuilding capacity in the next five years, and the data                   June 29-30, 2005 128 of 234  show that an additional 60 percent of the existing container fleet and 27 percent of the existing   tanker fleet will come on stream in the next three to four years  Needless to say, there is no pricing   power in shipping   So in summary, Mr Chairman, while the Eleventh District has caught up with the nation,    soundings in our District and nationally indicate no pricing power  And I detect a slight, but   noticeable, shift among the people we speak with toward concerns about slower growth and away   from concerns about inflation  Thank you    I support the 25 basis point increase in the funds rate  My only concern   about the statement is the word “elevated” in reference to pressures of inflation  But, like President   Minehan, I don’t think this is the time to argue  "
7779,2005-08-09," David, we’ve been discussing anecdotal evidence in the last few meetings   on the lack of pricing power in the corporate sector  And we’ve anticipated that margins would   be squeezed unless there was substantial top-line or revenue expansion  I’m wondering if you’re   seeing any evidence that that situation has changed  Is there any evidence in the data that   companies are not just meeting these increased price pressures through cost-cutting but are   beginning to pass their higher costs on?   And then, Karen, my question for you is Could you give a number for the trend-line rate   of dollar depreciation, including the yuan, you anticipate?   Mr Chairman, as reported in the Beige Book, activity in our District has   picked up substantially There’s a tremendous amount of activity in all but the manufacturing   sector And there’s an enormous surge in confidence, particularly in Texas, even though that   may seem like a redundancy to talk about confident Texans!    I’ll refer to just a couple of points very quickly as part of the broader discussion we’ve   been having at this table First, we’ve had a huge surge in housing starts  Houston now ranks   second in the country year-to-date in terms of housing unit permits, and Dallas ranks third  First,   by the way, is Atlanta Moreover, permits are running at rates roughly three times what we see   in New York City and roughly twice those in Miami or Orlando  But to illustrate the point that   we discussed at our last meeting, in terms of price pressures, Dallas ranks 250 out of 265 MSAs   [metropolitan statistical areas], which shows the geographic differential  In any event, we’ve had   a substantial pickup in housing activity                               August 9, 2005 35 of 110  The second point, with regard to energy, is that Texas, Louisiana, and New Mexico   account for two-thirds of the rig count in the United States  It’s a rather schizophrenic sector    One might say that schizophrenia beats dining alone, because we do get both sides of these   arguments  [Laughter] We have a very excited group of people—the rig operators—now   running at the tightest capacity rate in terms of rig utilization since December of 1985 in the case   of Texas and since 1986 in the case of Louisiana  As evidence of the kind of pressure that’s   occurring on the happy side, but also a testimony to globalization, we have the first case of a   company—a small company that was not able to find rigs—importing a rig with workers from   China to operate in a certain basin in Colorado  By the way, 70 percent of that rig content is   constructed in China and 30 percent in the United States  This is the first such case that we’re   aware of   On the opposite side, the depressive side, there is a constant fear of price collapse in the   oil sector One might describe it as a wild surmise, except that one of the most articulate and   outspoken champions of the view that oil prices could fall dramatically happens to be Lee   Raymond, the Chairman of Exxon and the Chairman of the National Petroleum Council  He   likes to remind listeners, and he lectures me constantly, that in 1985 or 1986—I forget exactly   when it was—we had a price collapse which took oil prices from $28 to $10 in two weeks  He is   constantly warning his colleagues—noting that it is a minority view within the oil patch—that if   we have a warm winter he expects that kind of price behavior in the oil market  And he certainly   is a noteworthy proponent of that view   On the high-tech side, I’d note a couple of points based on conversations with Texas   Instruments and Dell on the issues of capacity and capital expenditures  TI, having just   announced that they’re going to build a huge factory—a $3½ billion investment in the Dallas                   August 9, 2005 36 of 110  area—says that they expect this to be one of their last full-bore production facilities for wafers    By the way, even with that large dollar investment, the factory will employ only 500 people    What they’re finding now is that they can buy what they call commodity wafers—which is about   60 percent of the content they need—from Chinese producers at ever-lower prices  Dell repeats   the same kind of defiance of the laws of economic behavior, as they put it, in terms of what   they’re able to source out of China, and they claim now to be the second largest operator of US   companies in China  Moreover, they report that with each passing day, as we’ve heard from   retailers, somebody appears on their doorstep able to outbid any existing supplier at an ever-  cheaper price   As far as the retail sector is concerned, again, with my colleague’s permission, I do talk   to contacts from Wal-Mart occasionally—to the COO and to the President of Wal-Mart   International We hear the same kinds of reports, and there are substantial questions about   Chinese accounting And, Karen, the reason I asked the question about the assumptions   regarding the Chinese yuan appreciation or the general depreciation of the dollar against the   yuan—even though it’s obviously very volatile—is that the CEO of Wal-Mart International said   that it makes absolutely no difference that China has revalued the renminbi at this juncture    They constantly find that people that will come in and underbid existing suppliers  The   supposition, Mr Chairman, is that the Chinese (a) don’t pay back principal, (b) don’t pay taxes,   and (c) if they do pay taxes, they pay the tax collector rather than the government  All of that, of   course, gives them a substantial advantage  This has always been the case, and we assume it will   be not carried forward over time  But in terms of competition, there seems to be a voracious   appetite to continue to supply—a variation of the old Communist model in which they produced   for production’s sake and now they produce for sales’ sake  Again, our private sector— our                      August 9, 2005 37 of 110  retailers, our high-tech sector, and others, and now our energy sector—are taking advantage of   that situation   Having said all of that, I want to indicate, as did Mr Moskow, that with this strong   economic activity, even though there may be a risk that we’re borrowing from the future, we,   too, are concerned about inflationary pressures  So we would be in favor of further tightening to   the degree that my former colleague as Deputy US Trade Representative just mentioned  We’ll   talk about the wording of the statement later  Thank you very much   I support the recommendation, Mr Chairman, and I’m indifferent on the   word “gradually” I like President Poole’s rephrasing of the fourth box down  I think it makes   grammatical sense, but I’m not going to fight over it  "
7803,2005-09-20," Mr Chairman, I have two questions  One is to Karen with regard to the   energy futures markets  Have we seen any change in the dynamics of those markets during the   trading activity—higher numbers of contracts or size changes—from what we saw pre-Katrina?   The reason I’m curious about this is because I think we have been   struggling with trying to determine what the speculative element is in those markets  Clearly,   those who did speculate for whatever reason on an event, such as the one you just mentioned,   have been rewarded But sometimes the complexion of those people who then enter the market   changes; the smart ones get out when they’ve been rewarded and they’re replaced by what we   used to call the mullets who swim in smaller contracts  I’d just be curious to see what the change   in the dynamics is, if indeed a change is taking place at all  The other question—excuse me?   Yes   Again, as we talked about a couple of weeks ago, the point is the   volatility—not so much the direction—and yesterday reinforced that concern  I’m just trying to   get a sense of these dynamics   My other question is about the $85 billion fiscal stimulus assumption  Is   that based on rational expectations of, say, the women and men who sit around this table?  Or is   it based on some soundings of the politicians on Capitol Hill?  What is the source of the $85   billion figure?   Thank you, Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman, the Texas economy is faring better than the national   economy  Pre-Katrina we saw very strong evidence of that in all nine of what we call our super   sectors in the economy—including, by the way, the information and telecom sectors, which   suffered serious setbacks in the bursting of the dot-com bubble and the reversal, coming out of   the recession in 2003   Post-Katrina data are likely to be stronger still  Despite or perhaps because of the unique   position that we’re in geographically, 265,000 people from the area affected by Katrina have                               September 20, 2005 46 of 117  evacuated to the state of Texas  We expect about 40,000 of them to stay, and that’s above and   beyond Jack’s employees to whom we’ve tried very hard to be helpful    The way our economy will improve in the aftermath of the hurricane is by increasing the   convention business, for example, that has been displaced into Dallas  And the port of Houston   will have increased activity  We’ll see what happens with this storm that’s brewing presently    Our office and business relocation efforts are running full bore, and throughout the state we’re   getting commitments already from people who have been displaced along the Gulf Coast   Our data show greater business optimism than is seen nationwide  Our bankers are very   frisky [Laughter] As one of them, the CEO of the largest bank in our District, put it the other   day, “loan demand is stronger than horseradish” And it just continues onward One concern I   would note is that economic conditions in Mexico are worse than we expected, and—a point to   make about the Greenbook—we’re less optimistic than the Board staff about the second half of   the year There seems to have been an implosion in domestic demand in Mexico  We’re also   concerned about some developments in the building materials sector for cement, wood, and   steel—we’re seeing significant evidence of the hoarding of lumber, for example—and how that   might affect construction activity in our state  We are, at least in Northern Texas, second to   Atlanta in terms of housing starts, although fortunately not subject to significant upward price   pressures   On the national anecdotal side, this has been an aggressive period for us in that we talked   to as many CEOs—many with firms headquartered in our District—and other business contacts   as we could We spoke with a total of 15 CEOs for this round, one COO in retailing—everybody   knows who that is—several CFOs, and many directors from banks and other boards of different                      September 20, 2005 47 of 117  sizes and dimensions of conventional companies  So I’d like to summarize very quickly what we   heard   The retailers, from the convenience store operator who is headquartered in our District to   the largest retailer, emphasized two points  First, $300 per gallon gasoline seems to be the   tipping point in terms of having an impact on consumption  Whether Katrina is directly related   to that or not, the point is that one gets from these retailers evidence of a falling off of demand   and, very importantly, a bifurcation of demand  By the latter I mean that the higher-end retailers   like Nieman Marcus continue to do well while the lower- and middle-end retailers suffer    Second, there has been a change in product choice, with a move from branded products to   unbranded products My favorite example provided to me in this call-around was the   substitution of Gold Coast cigarettes for Marlboros  There’s a $250 per pack difference, and   retailers, particularly 7-Eleven, are seeing significantly higher sales of the lower-priced brand   The price pressures that are coming in retail are in areas one would expect—plastics,   packaging, transportation—and there is evidence of price pressures beginning to build  I   understand that Wal-Mart executives have called in the CEOs of all their suppliers and told them   that Wal-Mart will not accept further cost through-puts  But the company indicated that they   will work together with their suppliers to achieve efficiencies  Whether that experiment will   succeed or not is another question   On energy, we have what we call a SWOT team—we replace the A with an O, which is   for oil—that includes the largest integrated company down to some smaller gas producers  I’ve   been sending around some notes to my co-Presidents on what we have learned from these   sources, for whatever they’re worth  The bottom line there really comes down to natural gas and                   September 20, 2005 48 of 117  gasoline prices There are 25 ships at sea presently bringing in product, meaning gasoline  And   the expectation is not so much a direct price movement based on Katrina but increased volatility,   as we talked about earlier, dependent on whether or not the winter turns out to be a cold one    That’s what the producers are looking at in terms of the real side of the business as opposed to   the speculative side of the business   The effects are working their way through chemicals, and these are effects that don’t   come to mind readily  You can only take a natural gas molecule and divide it in so many ways    Our chemicals people are telling us, for example, that they don’t yet have the leeway to pass   through prices on things like nitrogen and hydrogen and other chemicals that we ordinarily don’t   think about but that are important to the chemical production process  But as one said “We are   going to look for every way we can to pass on prices there”   Regarding the shipping and rails, the largest barge company in the country gave us this   statistic 300 to 400 barges out of 15,000 to 16,000 were affected by developments in the   Mississippi related to Katrina  But it was “no big deal except for an impact at the margin”  We   received a similar report from the CEO of one of the larger of the five railroad companies  One   thing that everybody in the transportation business talks about that they applaud politically is the   waiving of the Jones Act  The estimate is that it will cut intercoastal transportation costs by ship   by half, which is obviously not insignificant   As far as express delivery is concerned, the key factor there in terms of ground   transportation is whether or not the US mail will move up its prices; the expectation is for a 54   percent increase in January  On the auto side, as President Moskow reported, Ford is probably   feeling more frisky—just to use that term again—and GM is as well  It’s interesting to look at                         September 20, 2005 49 of 117  the used auto auctions for Manheim and Adessa, the two largest wholesale used car auctioneers    There was a big spike in prices post-Katrina  If you do the math, whether 100,000 cars or even   more were lost from hurricane damage, this should be of assistance to the auto companies   As far as technology is concerned, TI reports the ability to pass on some price increases   in their broad semiconductor business  But again, all the tech folks, whether it’s Dell or EDS,   report continued pressure to lower prices and to outsource and new source their employee base   On housing, I have reported on the hoarding of lumber  There is another interesting   development, which is the disappearance of contractors and subcontractors from our state—and   apparently from Florida, Jack—because they are rushing to New Orleans to cash in on the money   that is going to be spent there   In summary, the comments from our business contacts on Katrina, while acknowledging   the human tragedy and the tremendous displacement of people and property, range from “no   impact” to “short-term shiver” to “sporadic impact”  And as cold-hearted as it may seem, this   comes down to the issue of where we are today  The way I have thought about it is that I believe   there will be less of an income statement impact but more of a balance sheet impact, which is   something I worry about  What I mean by that is that perhaps we will see a temporary setback in   terms of growth, a shifting in the complexion of that growth, and, to be sure, additional volatility   and potential price increases But what I worry about most, Mr Chairman, is what I have come   to refer to as the fiscal incontinence of the government  That is, I worry about money being   thrown at a problem and whether or not that will undermine the confidence that we depend on to   finance our economic growth                      September 20, 2005 50 of 117  I’m reminded of a story that George Shultz told me about his time working under   President Reagan, who was very frustrated about spending  George picked up the phone and   called I think it was Sam Cohen and said, “Tell me, Sam, is there really any difference between   Republicans and Democrats when it comes to spending?”  And Cohen said, “I want to think   about it, do some research, and give you a serious answer”  He called back the next morning and   said, “Yes, George, there is Democrats enjoy it more” [Laughter]  “But otherwise there doesn’t   appear to be any difference”   I want to vote for a 25 basis point increase in the funds rate  I agree with President   Santomero’s point about confidence  I worry about the price pressures that are building, but I   also think it’s very, very important that regardless of the amount of additional fiscal stimulus—   whether it’s $85 billion or more—that we not be viewed as being tempted in any way, shape, or   form, to monetize that fiscal spending, whether it’s incontinence or profligacy    I would suggest also, Mr Chairman—and this may seem odd—the possibility of looking   at the language in our statement, which I think Jack mentioned obliquely, and whether or not we   want to continue with the term “measured pace”  Has it run its course?  Has it become   synonymous with a 25 basis point increase or not?  And might we not use Katrina as an   opportunity to decouple that link in order to provide us greater flexibility going forward?  But, in   summary, I am in favor of continuing to remove policy accommodation  Thank you very much   I support your recommendation for tightening  I still wish we would   consider eliminating the words “measured pace”  I like the last sentence in the first alternative   that Vincent put forward as a substitute to that  I’d prefer adding that to alternative B without   guidance But if push comes to shove, I support you entirely, not only because it is the right   thing to do but also because it gives us a buffer                September 20, 2005 103 of 117 "
7825,2005-11-01,"  Karen, I didn’t bristle, but my ears pricked up when you mentioned Mexico    This is not a major point, but well before the hurricanes we noticed a disconnect between the   standard presumed correlation of, say, 90 percent—Mexican GDP to US industrial production    Something has weakened in Mexico  We’re analyzing it  It could be the onset of the sexennial   event, the presidential election  But, for example, our El Paso folks report that with the Delphi   announcement some 60,000 Mexican maquiladora workers have been affected  And your   comments on Mexican economic growth or your assumptions seem to be somewhat different than   what we’re hearing anecdotally and what we’re finding in our research in Dallas  I just wanted to   point that out and offer our input  If we can be of assistance there, we’d be glad to do so    I lost    Mr Chairman, growth in the Eleventh District, if anything, has been   accelerating in recent months—picking up steam  We appear to be the beneficiary of the natural   disasters that have taken place on the Gulf Coast, and that continued, incidentally, through Wilma   A small example is that the grapefruit growers have definitely benefited from the destruction of   grapefruit crops in Florida, which was nearly total  If I were to paraphrase Yogi Berra, who said the   future isn’t what it used to be, I think I would be on the mark because we’re now much more   confident   One of the most articulate, smartest, and at the same time conservative, bankers in our District,   Dick Evans of Cullen/Frost, says that building contacts are reporting the busiest business activity in   30 or 40 years in our state  At the very front end, which is site work for land development, one of   his clients, an engineer, reported that in his entire business career he’s never been busier  So we are   proceeding on all pistons, and we’re beginning to see it reflected particularly in real estate prices    The market has gone from a buyer’s market to a seller’s market almost overnight  In the Gulf area   of Padre Island, for example, record prices are now suddenly appearing overnight   So in summary, the bankers and the business community in the Eleventh District, as I reported   at the last session, are still frisky, Mr Chairman  Indeed, their tails are wagging at an accelerated   pace and I hope—to paraphrase another “Berra-ism,” which is that history isn’t what it used to be—                                    November 1, 2005 32 of 114  that history doesn’t repeat itself here  But we certainly have a much more enthusiastic business   community   I want to turn now to a broader perspective, based on our calls to headquarters of companies   that operate throughout the nation as well as in our District  At the last FOMC meeting, Mr   Chairman, you mentioned gasoline prices having a very visible impact as one of the few   commodities that consumers look at for price comparisons  In talking to our retailers, that is clearly   the case In sharing with President Poole our contacts with Wal-Mart, I talked to the new CEO of   US Wal-Mart yesterday, and he noted that while October same-store sales were up 42 percent, the   consumption pattern had shifted  Because of gasoline prices, people are making fewer trips to the   stores but they’re buying larger amounts   And we have a leading indicator ourselves in Harvey Rosenblum, who is the wine connoisseur   amongst our research leaders in Dallas  I’ve noticed that he, since he lives in a dry district of Dallas   —we still have prohibition in parts of Texas—is making less frequent trips to the wine store but is   buying in greater volume  Perhaps that’s because of the questions we’re asking him!  [Laughter]   Wal-Mart, 7-Eleven, and Dollar General all report that heavier items transported by truck—   dog food and bottled water are just two examples—are under tremendous price pressure due to   rising fuel costs And these higher prices are being passed on, although sometimes offset by   consumers substituting private label items for brand name products  American Airlines is passing   on their fuel costs  They managed to raise their average fare 8 percent in the third quarter  Once   again we hear them talking about $25 attachments to confirmation fees for standby passengers    Hovnanian and Centex, two of the largest builders, report rising costs of locally sourced materials   delivered by truck, adding to price pressures of labor and materials for roofing, siding, and   windows  We’re seeing fuel prices affect also the transportation costs that are charged and passed                                        November 1, 2005 33 of 114  on by the express companies UPS reports—and I don’t think this is public information—that   they’re targeting rate increases, pre-fuel charge, of 4 percent to be set in early November, knowing   that the US Postal Service will be pricing in an increase of 5 percent plus at the beginning of the   new year   There are some potential mitigating factors here  7-Eleven, Exxon, Wal-Mart’s Sam’s Club   stores, and other gas retailers report that the margin they are retaining on their gas sales—and 53   percent of 7-Eleven’s revenue comes from gasoline sales now—is still running 30 cents versus 13 to   14 cents normally They expect to hold these margins as long as they can, or at least until volatility   is dampened; but as gas prices ease, this could possibly be a cushion that will provide some relief   for retailers And the correlation is quite direct  At 7-Eleven, for example, they can walk you   through, week by week, the effect on sales of each downward movement in the price of gasoline   Three weeks ago they had an increase in sales volume of 2 percent; two weeks ago, 4 percent; and   this last week, 6 percent So we may have a little bit of relief coming from the reduction of margins   that might occur as the margins go from 30 to 13 to 14 cents   It’s still clear from our discussions with business operators that price pressures are building    A rising percentage of companies are experiencing price increases for what they sell as well as for   what they buy, along the lines that President Moskow mentioned  We see it particularly in   chemicals, as he mentioned  Caustic soda, formerly priced at $450 a dry ton, is now $800 a dry ton    Polyethylene, formerly priced at 38 cents a pound, is now priced at 55 cents a pound   I hope this is   expunged later, but Exxon’s CEO told me that they will take every measure they can to pass   through, and I quote, “sizable increases” on that front in every place that they can  Perhaps the best   indicator of what’s happening in the chemical industry is Pioneer Core Alkaline Company, which   was filing for bankruptcy and is now “printing money,” according to their CEO  Wal-Mart expects                                   November 1, 2005 34 of 114  to pass along price increases for all resin-based products, such as garden chairs and outdoor tables,   in the spring  The rails appear to be planning, according to BNSF’s CEO, a price increase of 5 to 6   percent before fuel surcharges next year   And of interest in all of our discussions is that we’re hearing what President Moskow is   hearing, which is that there are pressures on the wage front  To be sure, they are mitigated by   Delphi, Northwest Airlines, and also GM  But the numbers we’re hearing from the rails, from the   Belo Corporation, a large broadcaster, and others on labor prices are negotiation targets of about 3   percent, with a heavy focus on health care running in the 9 to 10 percent range   I think probably the best summary, Mr Chairman, came from the CEO of Wal-Mart US  He   said that “previously we were deflating and we can still offset a little bit through China, although to   a lesser degree than before”  He said “we will early-discount like all retailers, moving our discount   season, largely in terms of announcements, up to November 1  But at best we hope to ‘hold the   line’ on prices”  That’s a direct quote   So I feel that the heightened inflationary pressures that we talked about last time are lurking    Against that background, I favor further tightening to contain inflationary impulses and   expectations  I have some comments on the statement, but we can speak about that later  The   bottom line is that one can sense, even though we don’t see it in the data, inflation pressures   creeping up like little cat’s feet  Thank you    Setting aside the governance issues that Janet raised, it seems to me that the   key operative phrase and the change in alternative C is taking out “accommodation can be removed   at a pace that is likely to be measured” and replacing it with “likely making further policy firming   necessary” I’m of the school that we likely have a little bit further to go, partially driven by our   own analysis of the inflation trend—meaning PCE inflation data—that we do in Dallas  But I’m                               November 1, 2005 86 of 114  curious as to what the staff ventures might be the market reaction to this particular wording change    Would changing this language to “making further policy firming necessary” sound as if we have a   more severe situation on our hands that we are worried about?  What’s your judgment?    Well, I accept your suggestion, Mr Chairman  I was just thinking about the   introduction you provided, which is something I’ve been consumed with because I’m supposed to   give a lecture at Harvard on Thursday night on the globalization of monetary policy  I’m worried   about the phenomenon that you described—it’s one of the reasons I feel quite hawkish even relative   to President Lacker—and the direction in which it is proceeding  Let me cite a small data point    The retailers will tell you that they got 10 percent relief last year from China but that they’re only                                  November 1, 2005 97 of 114  getting 5 percent relief now  Now, where that number comes from, I’m not quite sure  But the   point is that the disinflationary mitigating factor is being reduced, and yet we have no sense of the   measure of capacity or of the utilization of capacity outside our own borders, particularly in the   parts of the world you spoke of  And I want to make sure, however we word things and whatever   we communicate in the minutes, that we don’t close the door to still be very vigilant, though not   vigilantes, on the inflation front  But I accept and support your recommendation  "
7847,2005-12-13,"  Very quickly, on the Chairman’s question to Karen  Clearly, there is virtue to   massive competition  My most delicious irony is the fact that similarly dated Vietnamese debt now   trades on a price basis richer, and on a yield basis lower, than that of Ford Motor Company   [Laughter]  It wasn’t too long ago that we were killing each other  But we do have, increasingly, an   independent central bank in Mexico  We have better reporting techniques in Brazil   And I would   submit that while it may not be Anglo-Saxon capitalism, part of this is just a matter of realizing the   value of capital and the desire to attract capital  Moreover, the improving at-home conditions make   many of these countries increasingly attractive as an alternative  And the competition is good   My question is to David, and maybe Brian or others  I wonder if you could—not now but   with some kind of briefing or a paper at some point—give us a sense about the issue you mentioned   of the lags in the effects of monetary policy tightening  I’m curious about the dynamics in a   tightening scenario such as the FOMC has been pursuing here  How do you calculate the impact and   the likely lag time intervals in the progressive process that we’ve been going through as opposed to a   one-time shock?  I assume that your models include a dynamic  I’d like to understand it better, and                                 December 13, 2005 22 of 100  maybe some of my other colleagues would as well  So it’s not a question to be answered now, but if   you’d be kind enough to do that, I’d be grateful  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, Texas and the Eleventh District are even more surprisingly   strong than the surprisingly strong rest of the United States  We see growth in retail sales and   manufacturing employment, strength in housing starts, and high occupancy rates  Houston is 100   percent occupied in terms of apartments, as part of the resultant fallout from President Guynn’s   District  In every single dimension, the Eleventh District economy is solid   There is price seepage from natural gas and other products  The most alarming will be utility   bills, which are expected to jump by 40 percent next year  But what is taken from Peter often goes   into Paul’s pocket or, as we say, what is taken from Pedro goes into Pablo’s pockets in Texas  And   the best example I can give you is from the CEO of American Airlines, who told me yesterday that   their fuel bill over the last two years has increased $3 billion  As he put it, “The blood is being sucked   out of me, and it’s going to our friends down the street”  In this instance, that is literally the case   because Exxon is a couple of blocks away down the street  In terms of our local economy, this is   healthy for us because we’re energy neutral  In the activity surrounding energy, the rig count is up 23   percent this year  Energy company profits are soaring, as I referred to earlier  Oil royalty streams and   mineral rights holdings are expected to rise dramatically, so we have a wash as far as energy prices   are concerned  The bottom line is that Texas is a very happy place, the Eleventh District is a very   happy place, and our economy is strong  And it shows you the dynamic nature of our country                                              December 13, 2005 33 of 100  Nationally, both the Greenbook and anecdotal evidence indicate that the economy is equally   solid We see it in the retail sales data, as David reported today  But one of the aspects of those retail   sales numbers, according to our interlocutors at the big box distributors, is that less than half the goods   sold in what they call the “November frenzy” were deeply discounted goods  In other words, the   sales were solid   I spoke to sixteen CEOs and CFOs in preparing for today  I basically heard only one new   concern, Mr Chairman, which goes back to the point that Karen was making earlier about   globalization  Also, I want to point out that one of the big homebuilders—Hovnanian—confirmed   what you said, David  As he put it Investors—meaning speculators—are exiting the business and it   is returning to normal  But the common concern coming from the retailers, the rails, the shippers, the   shipbuilders, and so on, was the following  Everyone I’ve talked to continues to try to figure out ways   to exploit globalization  Each of them, from the IT [information technology] guys to the big box   retailers to the specialty chemical firms to the service firms, wants to have offshore supply  One of   the CEOs said, “We have a long way to go in exploiting China”  We’ve heard that forever  And one   of my favorites was the comment, “China, India, and Indonesia can make Italian ceramics better than   Italians can now or could 200 years ago”  [Laughter]   The problem that I’m beginning to hear seeping into the conversation, Mr Chairman, has to   do with US infrastructure  If you read the New York Times article two days ago about Shanghai’s   new deep water port, you have to realize that those facilities are being built to ship goods out of   China, not so much to ship goods into China  And consider this, as reported by one of the shippers I   spoke with 50 percent of all the ships on order for construction are container ships  Capacity-  expanding container business is increasing at 15 percent or more per annum to carry cargo from   Shanghai and other parts of the world to the United States                         December 13, 2005 34 of 100  Now, this is good news on the disinflationary front  As the CEO of Northern Navigation, one   of the larger shippers told me, “Transportation by ship will essentially be free when these numbers are   realized in the marketplace”  The bad news is stateside  We don’t have the capacity to absorb it    Long Beach and the Northwest harbors are constrained  Work rules, according to our interlocutors,   are very slow to adjust  But there are ways to beat the bottlenecks, and I just want to mention two    UPS reports that they have gone from 6 to 18—and now for next year 21—flights from China  Wal-  Mart just built a four million square foot warehouse in the Houston port, in order to shift part of the   burden from Long Beach  But it is evident that the enemy is us as far as exploiting globalization, and   I think that’s a long-term problem that we might want to take note of over time   Presently, I argue that the economy is solid  We have very good growth  I’m still a little   worried about inflation, but I’m convinced that we’re nipping it in the bud by the action of the FOMC   and that we might want to pause sooner rather than later  But, again, we might discuss that in the   discussion of the statement  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, I listened very carefully to what you said  In 1997, I sold my   money management business because I figured I could no longer beat the house  For 23 years I was a   market operator, so I’m very sensitive to the power of markets and the issue you raised, although I   think it’s a very risky business for the FOMC to discuss how monetary policy might impact asset   prices Yet you’re right in terms of the power, the liquidity, and what that’s doing to affect real   economic behavior, so I look forward to that discussion   In thinking about this statement, I want to vote for the ¼ point increase announced in the first   sentence  I think the one-sentence statement in row 2 in alternative B says all that needs to be said—   the economy is solid, period  That’s good news  In row 3, I would prefer to say why core inflation   has stayed relatively low, because we talked about it at this table  It has remained low for two   reasons—because of competitive pressures and still robust growth in productivity, and I think we   ought to insert that  Those are the facts, and we just talked about them at length  And I suggested that   kind of language when I sent in my note   In the wording of the assessment of risks, I think there is an interesting trade here  We’re   taking out “accommodation,” which is a signal  One could make the argument to remove the word   “measured”  I respect the arguments that were just made  To mitigate the operative word “likely” I   think we could achieve the objective by just saying “further measured policy firming may be needed”   rather than “is likely to be needed”  That leaves us plenty of options, and I can honestly say that I feel   it may be needed; I cannot honestly say it will likely be needed  But then, again, I will not have a vote   next time  Thank you

7869,2006-01-31,"  Going back to the Chairman’s question on size, Dino, the press and many   analysts focus on central bank reserves when they talk about what’s buffeting intermediate-term   rates  If you talk to Barclays, they give you awfully big numbers of potential dedicated moneys on   the pension side, an order of magnitude of, say, multiples of six or seven times what central bank   reserves are  Could we study the potential size that’s at play here?  And, of course, the United   Kingdom is not just dedicated to UK fixed-income instruments  They’re also looking at our fixed-  income instruments at the longer end of the curve  So getting a sense of dimension here, if possible,   might assist this conversation  I think that this is very, very important   January 31, 2006 14 of 106     Mr Chairman, I took note of the two Davids’ forecast of 47 percent growth   in the first quarter  Especially against President Yellen’s comments, it brought to mind the name of   one of Henry Jerome’s albums on the Decca label called “Brazen Brass”  That is, some might   consider brazen or even brassy that it jibes or, in this context, jives with what I’m hearing   anecdotally both in our District and nationwide—though we have only three and a half weeks of   observations and the year-end to look at   Very quickly to sum up these observations, the CFO of UPS put it this way “The economy   feels much better than what I read”  UPS reports a very strong December adjusted for seasonality,   and January has stayed strong  Over the year-end in the recent past, they have had only one holiday   peak day of processing 20 million shipments  They had three at year-end of more than 21 million    Burlington Northern–Santa Fe’s volume for the first three weeks of ’06 is up 9 percent year over   year  Interestingly, they just auctioned off their entire lumber-carrying capacity for the year at an 8   percent premium over current market  Texas Instruments reports a positive book-to-bill ratio, which   is a very rare thing coming out of the fourth quarter  They find that they underinvested relative to   demand and report a seven- to ten-day delivery delinquency rate  As the CFO says, “We have   stopped scratching our heads about demand, and we’re just taking it all in”   The CEO of Wal-Mart USA reports that “the consumer hasn’t hidden” as expected  It’s   true that traffic is down, but average purchases are up in the Southeast and Texas, and the West is   strongest in overall demand, aided by the warmest winter by their calculations in 112 years  The   CEO and the top managers met with their 5,000 suppliers the week before last in Kansas City, and   he reported that the suppliers described themselves as “upbeat”  Wal-Mart and others report what   we’re hearing from the railroads, the shippers, and other retailers—all of which lends verisimilitude   January 31, 2006 40 of 106    to what was evident if you parse the Beige Book And that is that the rim—from Richmond down   through Atlanta to the State of Florida and then, of course, the “uber” states across Texas and up to   California and the West Coast—is enjoying robust growth  To the extent that there’s weakness, it   appears to be in the north central and northeastern regions   On the price front, Dick Evans, on our board, of Cullen/Frost, a very astute banker, says that   he “keeps hearing people talk about potential inflation, but the economy seems to be able to pull it   out of the hat”  Wal-Mart International reports no pricing power other than in resin-based products    The CEO marvels at how the world continues to, as he puts it, “replace technology at lower and   lower prices”  Further up the retail chain, Penney’s CEO reports no price inflation in home   furnishings and continued price deflation in apparel  And on the two subjects for which I reported   price pressures before, the CEO of DX Services, a large chemical company, reports that PVC prices   have fallen off because of overproduction but the prices of the key building blocks of chlorine and   ethylene are falling  “There’s no pricing on the upside,” according to that CEO  And as for my   other favorite subject of diapers, incidentally, Proctor & Gamble and Kimberly Clark have rolled   back their price increases of 5 percent   Our shipping contact at Northern Navigation reports that Panamax rates—and Panamax is   the key fleet of bulk carriers—are now down to $16,700 per day from $17,300 in December, which   was down 35 percent from the average for the year of ’05  The container fleet will absorb a   14 percent increase in fleet size per year for the next three to four years driven largely by what one   could consider Chinese ego because they have now entered the building market in size  And   interestingly, UPS worries that, if this continues, they will come under price pressure to decrease air   freight rates  Despite fierce demand and delivery delinquencies, Texas Instruments reports that it   has slowed down its price increases   January 31, 2006 41 of 106    So, Mr Chairman, we have forecast a core PCE inflation of 2 percent for the year, and we   feel comfortable with it  I started with Henry Jerome  Let me conclude with another Henry, the   Fifth, at least as written by Shakespeare  I’ve been honored to serve with you, Mr Chairman, the   least time of anybody at this table  In Alfalfan terms, I’m just a sprout in the crop of otherwise   experienced men and women  But I’m sure they would agree with me, without getting too   dramatic, about the appropriateness of Henry V’s remarks at Agincourt—and I’ll rephrase them—  economists and bankers now asleep (remember these are bankers) shall think themselves accursed   that they were not here  I consider myself privileged to have been here, Mr Chairman  This isn’t   Agincourt, but it’s important  I’ve served under two saxophone players now, [laughter] and I would   say without question, you’re a leader of the very best kind, and I thank you for your leadership    Well, I support a 25 basis point move  I think President Poole has made a   good point  I wrote a note in support of it, but I can accept the language that’s here  Then, finally, I   am in full accord with the President of the Reserve Bank of New York’s articulation of the issue of   procedure, which I think we should defer  "
7892,2006-03-27,"  Well, actually, I’m sorry, but I want to follow up on the zloty  [Laughter]    And, by the way, there are 24 million sheep and close to 4 million people in New Zealand But   I’m curious, just thinking about trip wires, one would think, as you said, that as rates rise and with   better credits, one would move away from emerging-market currencies  Do you see any undue   concentrations, or do you think that this might roll over, say, to the Latin Americans and some   others?    Mr Chairman, I’d note that the former president of Harvard is advocating   diversifying portfolios in these kinds of currencies    I have a question for David and a customer request for Karen  My question   to David concerns the elasticity of labor supply within our own borders, and my specific question is   the impact of immigration on the NAIRU  I assume that we have had some benefit in lowering the   NAIRU based on immigration, and I am wondering, David, if you have begun to calculate what the   effect of these anti-immigration bills might be on the elasticity of labor supply   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 26 of 167       And my customer request to Karen  One thing that I noticed particularly in reading through   the Greenbook, beginning with the domestic section, is that we are hit between the eyes right off the   bat with the question of capacity utilization and resource utilization  The international section   discussed net exports and growth figures  Is there a way, Karen, that we can over time get a sense   of what we get right to at the beginning of the domestic section  the degree to which resources are   being utilized outside the United States in a way that affects the decisionmaking of businessmen and   businesswomen in the United States?  You know that I worry about this dynamic  But I am curious   as to whether we can get a measurement of the capacity of others to supply inputs into our economy   or processes that not only facilitate economic growth but also affect inflation beyond just the prices   of imported goods  I do not see that as much in the international section  I see at least the attempt to   get to it, whether or not we agree analytically, in the domestic section   Those are my one question and my one request, if possible    Our guys—or at least the researchers we have in Dallas—tell us that a   substantial portion of employment growth has been fed by immigration in the United States since   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 27 of 167       1990  I don’t know the specific numbers, but I’m just worried and curious  I have a question about   whether cutting off that supply or changing the nature of that supply will affect us and, if so, how    I hope my question wasn’t too waffley    Mr Chairman, like the others, I am grateful to be here under your   chairmanship and also to be with the two new Governors who are on board  I will spare you Texas   hyperbole, with the exception of just saying that our District is growing faster than the nation and is   pumping on all cylinders  And I’m going to focus my comments on the CEOs and CFOs to whom   I’ve talked, who have national and international franchises, as I am wont to do at these meetings    The situation is best summarized by one who said, “It shouldn’t be this way, but it is”  What he’s   saying and what I’m hearing from almost every CEO and CFO I spoke to, from large and small   companies, with the exception of the housing companies, is that they see surprising economic   strength and no pricing power despite significant cost pressures  And that strength is being   projected not just into the current quarter but also into the second quarter   So let me start with the railroads, with Burlington Northern  They reported that last week   they shipped more units than in all but ten weeks of 2005  And they have internally raised their   forecast for shipments of consumer goods year over year for the second and third quarters, from   6 percent to 7 percent  To quote their CEO, “It’s just blowing and going”   UPS, which is not in our District but I talk to them a great deal, reports a 6 percent volume   growth based on last week’s numbers  It’s consistent with what they expect for the first quarter,   which is a number greater than 5 percent  And, again, to use a direct quote, “I just do not see people   pulling back”   On the retail front, to get to some of Dave Stockton’s points, the retailers at all price points   are reporting that demand is strong and that “the tone of business is beating our expectations”    Wal-Mart and their brethren point out that a slowdown would manifest itself in a shift of disposable   income to food purchases  They are not seeing that  To quote the CEO of that very large retailer,   “We thought that there would be a drag from $250 gasoline, but it’s not happening”  They expect   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 49 of 167       4 to 6 percent comps in April  By the way, assisted by the late date of Easter, a lot is being shoved   into March and then some is being carried through into April  The person I talk to there is the CEO   of their US operations, who is not given to overstatement  I had never before heard him say that    “demand is amazing,” but that’s what he said in our interaction this week  At a higher price point,   we talked to, for example, the CEO of JCPenney  He said, “We would expect to be running double-  digit declines at this point, but we are seeing positive numbers with great strength in the Southeast,   the South Central, the West, and also, by the way, the Northeast, which is overcoming weakness in   the Central and Midwest geographic areas”   At the last FOMC meeting, I reported concerns of a major manufacturer of drinks, juices,   food products, and snacks, based on the gloominess of what he heard at the grocers’ convention in   Phoenix  He now reports that they are less worried and that their concerns have lifted  And this   CEO, whom I would put, Mr Chairman—using a Winnie-the-Pooh analogy—in the Eeyore   category, always sees the glass less than half full  [Laughter]  Maybe because he’s in the drinks   business, I’m not sure  [Laughter]  He described the economy as “ticking along” and added that, as   I quoted earlier, “It shouldn’t be this way, but it is”   Kimberly-Clark, another interesting company, which is quite open with us, is a supplier in a   different sector of the market  They report that “despite everything the consumer has been hit with,   demand continues to chug along”     As for the semiconductor companies, Texas Instruments has a book-to-bill ratio right now of   111  That is, orders are coming in 11 percent faster than they’re going out  In the semiconductor   industry, a book-to-bill ratio of 105 is considered strong  And they are presently front-loading their   capital expenditures from the third quarter into the current quarter in order to meet demand   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 50 of 167       The other Eeyore to whom I talk suffers from a genetic challenge to being optimistic—he’s   a Norwegian  [Laughter]  He also happens to be one of the larger ship operators in the world, about   whom I have reported at previous meetings in terms of the imbalance of supply that’s coming on   stream and the demand for that supply  He reports that “there is much more demand growth than   expected”  And you see that growth reflected in the large bulk carriers, the Panamax carriers, which   are the most liquid part of the market, where prices, as I reported last time, had gotten down to   $14,000 for a daily rate and are now back up to $17,000  The container fleet is also holding up,   with some change of utilization from the transatlantic shipment to the transpacific shipment  But as   he says, “These markets have legs”  And he characterized the overall sense of the economy with a   very Zorba-the-Greek type of summary of events  “Demand side is stronger; tanker market is   holding up; container market growth is strong  In short, no catastrophe”   On housing, for which you find the most negative outlook, I have just a couple of   comments  I spoke to two of the five largest housing CEOs  What they and their competitors watch   for is the home cancellation rate—that is, when a buyer puts down a minimal amount as   downpayment, which is now down to $1,000, on a home and then walks away  The average home   cancellation rate has run about 22 percent in modern history  Right after September 11, 2001, it   spiked to 28 percent  It is presently running at 32 percent for the national builders  So, clearly,   housing is a not very happy area   Everybody I talked to reports continued emphasis on cost containment and on re-  engineering their production functions  One of the large chemical companies reported that they   used $11 gas to fix all their boilers and production facilities  “Everyone in the chemical industry is   wringing everything they can out of overhead and operations”   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 51 of 167       So I decided to follow that subject further down the supply chain and talked to the CEO of   Anadarko, one of the largest natural gas operations, who happens to be on our board  They, too, are   trying to control costs by centralizing their purchase operation  They purchase about $3 billion a   year, and they expect to drive down costs at the same time in order to finance a massive capital   expenditure expansion, which you would expect to be driven by the high prices that they   experienced recently  Wal-Mart has put in a massive one-time enhancement of inventory   management, which is pinching suppliers but is providing them with significant savings in dollars   All the companies reported continued interest in building their offshore interests—again, to   drive down the cost of operation  And I thought it was interesting that as Mike Duke, the CEO of   Wal-Mart International, was leaving India the other day, Michael Dell—a good Texas company,   Dell—got off the plane at the same time and announced that they are going to create jobs for 20,000   new employees in India  One of the largest securities houses reported that they had sent one of their   most senior officials four times in the past nine months to India to figure out a way to drive down   the analytical costs by having corporate spreadsheets and other things done there before they’re   presented to the decisionmakers for their buy-side analysis and their sales-side analysis  The CEO   of Kimberly-Clark gave me a remarkable number  He had just come back from India  They are   looking to fill 9,000 jobs  They received 14 million resumés in English  A Dallas director who is a   venture capitalist reported that they will no longer consider providing capital in a second-round   venture capital financing unless the company has a foreign component for offsetting costs  Finally,   one of our directors in El Paso, a woman who manufactures accessories in Mexico, has decided to   move her Mexican operations to inland China to save on costs  My point is that this appears to be   now part of our corporate DNA in terms of trying to drive down or contain costs  Again, as the   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 52 of 167       CEO of Wal-Mart said, “This is not just an issue of low labor costs  It’s an issue of effecting   enhanced profitability”   I want to end with a comment of concern in terms of my own District, with regard to   construction  If you look out the window of our offices in Dallas, you’ll see twelve gigantic   building cranes  It almost looks like Shanghai, and this is old downtown Dallas  And I’m reminded   of the comment that was made by one of my predecessors, Bob Boykin, at this table when he was   bragging about the fact that Caroline Hunt, in building a project and a hotel—where you’re going to   stay when you visit our District—had managed to dig the largest hole ever dug in history  And your   predecessor, Mr Volcker, said, “Are you speaking figuratively or literally?”  [Laughter]  I don’t   know where this will lead, Mr Chairman  I do sense that, on the anecdotal side, final demand is   much stronger than the econometrics would tell us  My gut tells me it will end in tears, but we’ll   talk about that tomorrow    I am concerned  I worry particularly because I think—and I’d have to get   the numbers, but I’m virtually certain—that the shift is taking place particularly in currencies that   don’t adjust to the dollar  India has just announced that they would open the rupee and open their   capital account  The Chinese clearly do not have a free-trading currency   And at the same time, just to show my bias—Janet is going to be very disappointed in me, I   think—I subscribe to Winston Churchill’s approach to trade, which is if someone else—I won’t use   his exact vernacular—wants to take advantage of their taxpayers and subsidize their production and   provide it cheaply for us, we should take it, add value, and capture the majority of the profits  So I   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 53 of 167       think we are doing that  I think there are limits as to how far we can run on the current account   deficit  I also expect that eventually the market will correct for that  But we’ve been talking about   that for a great deal of time  Last year, we worried about the dollar’s strengthening rather than   weakening  And I subscribe in part to what President Poole argues  The question is how long you   continue to attract capital     Just one more comment on that front, and this is why I asked the question about the Polish   zloty and the New Zealand dollar  One of the things I am concerned about, Mr Chairman, is that   my investment instincts tell me, as we raise rates here and as the yield curve perhaps shifts   upward—and perhaps someday at the longer end of the yield curve—that there will indeed be a   greater desire to invest in high-quality, risk-free credit like that of the United States and to withdraw   capital from some of these lesser, marginal credits  So there might actually be a short-term effect by   which we are encouraged and emboldened by greater capital influence rather than lesser capital   influence  My overall instinct is that we’re postponing the pain and the correction and it’s further   out there      Mr Chairman, in terms of what we see outside our window at our Federal   Reserve Bank, it is almost all condominium construction  The joke is that you want to be the fourth   owner of the building that is being constructed    Mr Chairman, I just wanted to ask Vince a somewhat radical question    Assuming that the Committee votes to tighten another 25 basis points and the language roughly is   what you have in column B, I’m curious as to what you think or maybe Dino and the others think   the market reaction would be if we eliminated row 4 in its entirety    So you are saying that we should tip our hand that we want to maintain or   we should indicate further policy firming—sort of like President Pianalto’s question    That is what I mean    Mr Chairman, this issue of tightening is kind of like Pascal’s wager   about the existence of God, and our personal gain–loss ratio as central bankers indicates an   answer in the affirmative  That is, I do think Vice Chairman Geithner made a very good point   about expectations and about the expectations of how we will perform our duties    Despite the question I asked earlier about row 4, I am in favor of further tightening  I   am in favor because I believe that the tightening that we’ve done, although we don’t yet have   answers to the question we’ve asked about lags, doesn’t seem to have done much harm in terms   of slowing the pace of economic expansion  I would like to build a reserve that we can then   subtract from if we need to respond to weakness  And so I am in favor of tightening, and I am in   favor of continued tightening because (1) it seems not to be doing great damage to economic   growth, which is stout, (2) I’d like to have something to give back when we see weakness, and   (3) I’d like to ward off inflation      I have only one request on the wording, and that is that we insert the word “global”   before “resource utilization”  [Laughter]  Thank you  I never give up     Mr Chairman, I applaud the way this meeting has been run  It was the most   enjoyable I’ve had in my long one-year tenure  I do want to weigh in with some sympathy for those   that come from the western part of the United States and have to go back for board meetings    Maybe we could front-load these at the beginning of the week and not lag them into Wednesday    That would be appreciated  Second, on special topics, I want to underscore them and also suggest   that the Banks themselves have very able research staffs, and we might call on their talents to make   some of those presentations  It would, I think, be good for morale, but importantly it would round   out viewpoints  "
7915,2006-05-10,"  Having nothing to do with the subject we’re currently discussing, but going back   to your chart of metals prices, is there a way to get a judgment from the staff as to how much of this is   May 10, 2006 9 of 120    speculative and how much of it is real demand and what the volume expansion has been on the different   exchanges?  We probably already have that, Vince, but it would be helpful  We keep discussing this   with regard to oil prices, for example  In terms of the big integrated companies, nobody knows the   answer, that I can determine, but clearly a good deal of this is speculative activity as opposed to real   demand  The question is, Could somebody send around a memo that gives us a breakdown, if possible?    Including the volume expansions?    For example, Exxon will tell you that, in terms of futures trading just on oil, West   Texas crude was 6 billion in 1999; this year it’s running at a 120 billion rate  That tells you   something—we just don’t know what  But it would be helpful for us to get a breakdown  At least it   would be helpful to me    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’d like to turn to the international side and first thank   Karen for the good work that’s in the book and your briefing  More in the book than in the briefing,   there is the note that continued expansion is taking place among our significant trading partners and   around the globe   I wonder if you have a sense, since we always use the term “resource utilization,” of what global   resource utilization is occurring  I raise this issue because we assume, for example, that the supply of   labor in China is infinite  If you read the recent data, you will see that in the Pearl River Valley price   pressure on labor is up  Wages are 800 yuan—$100 a month, up from $60 a month  Is it possible for us,   as we look at the rest of the world, to place a little more emphasis not just on our net import or net   export position, not just on the pressures that come from imported goods in terms of oil prices, and not   just on the growth factor, but also on developing a better sense of the kind of resource utilization we’re   beginning to see?   The second question I have is, since goods have to get from point A to point B, do you have a   sense of what’s happening with worldwide port capacity and congestion?     May I just interrupt you here to ask a question?  In terms of your BIS readings and   what you came back feeling  Do you have a sense that global resource utilization is tightening and that   there is a greater inflationary impulse deriving from global resource utilization?    Mr Chairman, at the last meeting, I reported the comments of a CEO of a big   box retailer who said the economy was “amazing”  I suppose the best summary of what I’m about to   report to you in terms of my readings in the field—this time I assiduously talked to twenty-five CEOs   and COOs, and I’ll give you that list separately so I won’t bore you with the details—the economy is   even more amazing than it was before  That is, we see a shift taking place from consumption-driven to   May 10, 2006 35 of 120    business-investment-driven growth, but also, unfortunately, we see evidence that inflation is raising its   ugly head and that inflation expectations are higher as we go through time   Let me give you some specifics  According to reports from shippers that I’ve talked to, the   shipping market for bulk and containers is stronger in the second quarter than it was in the first quarter    Karen, there is a report, which is why I would like to see a more definitive version, of fleet utilization   running well over 90 percent and waiting time in ports increasing significantly  My rail contacts report   that rail traffic as of April 22 is up 4½ percent for the year  They expect higher growth in the second   quarter than in the first quarter  UPS is planning for “some moderation in volume” but “hasn’t seen any   sign yet of a slowdown, discounting for the late Easter”  An airline with 80 million passengers reports   very strong advance bookings through July in every region of the country   Some pressure from gas going over $3 at the pump has been reported, particularly in the past two   weeks, by the retailers at every price point; and yet there’s an interesting shift taking place  For   example, JCPenney now runs a billion dollars worth of sales through the Internet  That growth rate is   increasing; it’s 23 percent  This way of presenting their products to the market helps to offset the oil   price effect   In the IT sector, the book-to-bill ratio of the large semiconductors is still greater than 1    Companies like EDS and other “productivity enhancers” are seeing increased demand for their products,   which they interpret as a vote of confidence  We’re also seeing increased demand for storage capacity,   which many would interpret as a vote of confidence going forward in the business picture   From the largest bank in our District, the report is that volume is “so good you’re able to eat it”    They report, by the way—I don’t want to give offense to any sector of our economy—that the only   people having credit problems are personal injury lawyers in Texas because of the reform that has taken   place there  But other than that, the credits, as reported by banks, look to be in very, very good shape   May 10, 2006 36 of 120    In terms of the housing market, you may recall my last report from a large house builder who   built 400,000 homes thus far  I’ve expanded that to another builder of similar size  The cancellation   rate now, David, is up to 40 percent—a key indicator  However, it has shifted around the country, and   in our state they report that you’d have to be a princess on a pea to feel any discomfort with the Texas   housing market  It is booming, unlike the Florida market—which, as you know, is cascading   As far as cost-cutting capital expansion, it continues  Fluor reports a remarkable first-time-in-  history statistic, which is that every single sector that they deal with, and every one of their product   lines, is on the uptick  I want to report one particular project in summary that just puts things in   perspective  Texas Utilities is about to announce a $10 billion coal-processing plant  This is conversion   from coal to electricity  It will generate 40,000 jobs in our state to construct and 21,000 permanent jobs    But here’s the interesting statistic  It’ll take 12 million manhours and womanhours to construct  The   CEO reports that ten years ago all those jobs would have been American jobs  Only 4 million of the   manhours and womanhours to construct this project will be American jobs; the rest of the construction   will be done in China or in Germany  Five years ago, it would have taken six years to build  According   to the CEO, they’ll build it in three years, and to go to President Moskow’s point, yesterday the CEO of   a large—as we used to say—“underwriting house” in New York offered to assume all the financing    They will finance at 100 percent nonrecourse  There’s a lot of liquidity in the system   We are concerned about prices  We see pricing power creeping upward in the reports we’re   getting from the CEOs  As you know, our compass in Dallas is the trimmed mean PCE  It’s running at   a rate of about 23 percent  At some point in the future, Mr Chairman, I would like to provide a memo   on that particular measure of inflation, which we consider to be a more reliable indicator of future   inflation  But the point is that, in all of our soundings among these operators of businesses, they are   feeling increasing price pressure, both at the intermediate level and at the consumer level   May 10, 2006 37 of 120    There are two little indicators that I found interesting  One is that Texas Instruments, which   usually has 200 or 300 jobs maximum outstanding and looks for highly trained engineers, is now trying   to fill 1,000 of those jobs and having trouble filling them  Second, at the other end of the range, 7-  Eleven reports that in Florida, the Great Lakes District, and the Chesapeake Bay area, they cannot find   $7- to $8-an-hour sales clerks  They are having to raise their prices   In short, we view this economy to be something like a 2006 BMW Z4 Roadster—Bluetooth-  enabled, by the way  It’s complex, it’s highly integrated, it’s a technically advanced machine that   apparently cannot help itself from exceeding the speed limit  [Laughter]  Thank you    The two house builders together built 700,000 homes; as you know, that industry   is consolidating  I asked them point blank whether the rates are killing them  Now, you have to take   this with some skepticism, but they said no  The real issue here is that this highly speculative medium is   becoming incredibly liquid  There is obviously a self-feeding mechanism, and the statistic that probably   illustrates it best is Palm Beach, Florida  Last year, 6,000 homes were listed for sale  This year, as of   last week, 17,000 homes are listed for sale  So what you have is a secondary market that is being   speculated with, and advance liquidity provided by the financing mechanisms, and a lot of turmoil in   that portfolio  This type of entrepreneur almost always sees things as better than they actually are, and I   do pay very close attention to the kind of data that we’re seeing  But interest rates don’t seem to be the   key issue, though obviously they kick in because of the way mortgages are priced     As far as the consumer is concerned—and Bill and I both talk to Wal-Mart in depth—they are   obviously more worried about gas prices than they are about interest rates  So I have a bit of   May 10, 2006 38 of 120    schizophrenia like David  David, schizophrenia beats dining alone  [Laughter]  We can always talk to   ourselves, when we can’t talk to anybody else  The net feeling is that growth is stronger than we’re   forecasting, and inflation—I agree with President Lacker and the others—is making me feel   uncomfortable    Well, I think Bill Poole has summarized a lot of what I would have said  I   forecasted that in the memo that was sent around  I would advocate tightening 50 basis points  I would   dispute only one comment of President Poole’s  Getting ahead of the markets is less important than   getting ahead of the economy  I do take note of your FOMC surprise chart  The question really is, If we   undertake an action, will it lead to a market reaction that might affect the economy negatively?  It’s not   so much that we have a market surprise  We’re going to have market surprises at any time, and I can   walk you through, after thirty years of operating a hedge fund, a four-year cycle of market surprises  A   market surprise is going to hit us at some point, but the question is, Is it a trip wire?  There is a risk that   the trip wire would be the housing market  We’ve discussed that to a great degree, although you, Mr   Chairman, I think gave us some good data on the offset   I think it’s important for us to get ahead of what I view—not just because of the anecdotal   evidence we have but also because of the work done by our staff—as a significant expansion in capital   expenditures with growth shifting to very strong business investment, excess liquidity that is going to   fuel that investment, and as we all discussed, significant indications that inflation is stronger than we   would like to see it  We see that analytically, as I said earlier, with the way we calculate inflation in   Dallas, but also from the anecdotal evidence   May 10, 2006 82 of 120    Having said that, I think the wording that is now in alternative B is more attractive  I know there   are some who would like to provide what I call a full frontal view of what we look like and what we   discussed  But as I like to say, Mr Chairman, in romancing the market sometimes a little modesty   might be more effective in achieving the ultimate goal  I think we’ve achieved that to an extent  I do   not like the language that we see growth as likely to moderate because I don’t have confidence in that   statement and I’m not sure it’s necessary  I’d prefer the wording that President Poole sent around in   terms of its brevity  However, in the interest of perhaps more exposure, or a more-revealing   presentation, I would like to add one word, which is the word “global” before “resource utilization”    [Laughter]  Thank you very much    I never used the word “nudity” now  [Laughter]    Mr Chairman, in the subsequent sentence we have “the potential to add to inflation   pressures,” and then in the first sentence in paragraph 4 we say that “further policy firming may be needed   May 10, 2006 101 of 120    to address inflation risks”  So you want to be careful you do not have overkill here, even though I am very   worried about inflation    This is slight heresy, but after the word “information” in row 4, I would just put “in   support of the attainment of our objectives” or “its objectives”  Take out the black stuff  It is a slight   change  That achieves what Cathy wants    That is what I mean  "
7940,2006-06-28,"  Mr Chairman, I want to thank the staff for the global presentation,   particularly for the beginning of this analysis on resource utilization, which as you know I find   useful  It is noteworthy that we’re beginning a process or, maybe, continuing a process and have   not enough information yet to understand or to analyze it in terms of Chinese capacity  Your   striking figure in exhibit 12 about steel production and steel capacity—China now has 31 percent   of the world’s capacity  I would imagine that you’re going to see that in shipbuilding and several   other sectors as we go through time  So I want to thank you for the analysis  Thank you, Karen,   as well    The question I have is this  If you go to exhibit 11 and look at your forecast for the   second half of 2006 and for 2007 for the emerging economies, what’s striking about these   numbers at the bottom right-hand side of the table is that they are occurring as we forecast a   slowing in the US economy  I wonder if you might comment on the linkages between the two   or on what other work we have to do on that front  One would think that either emerging-market   GDP would slow by virtue of our slowing or that they would build up their own domestic   consumption  And I’m wondering about the interrelationship we build into our models between   the two  Again, thank you for the analysis       If I could just rephrase the question—is it reasonable to assume that the   emerging economies that you list would maintain these rates were we to slow down   significantly?     Right   June 28-29, 2006 28 of 177      Well, Mr Chairman, last time I described the economy from our perspective   as a BMW Z4 roadster that just couldn’t keep itself from exceeding the speed limit  Based on the   series of calls we made in preparation for this meeting and the Beige Book and what we are seeing   in our own District, I would say that the real economy has downshifted—but as President Moskow   said and as I understood President Lacker and certainly President Stern to have said—not to the   degree that is projected in the Greenbook  I would also say that, just to kill the analogy, the inflation   pressure gauge needle is moving upward    I do talk to the CEOs of two of the largest homebuilding companies, and the way I would   describe their perspective is that they have migrated from amnesia to déjà vu  Clearly, the kinds of   numbers that you are projecting seem to be confirmed in terms of the default rates still running   above 40 percent  Yet some markets within the country have great strength—Texas, the Carolinas,   the Pacific Northwest—which is offsetting the weakness in the Northeast, the desert area,   California, and so on   June 28-29, 2006 48 of 177    Acknowledging that, I would like just to turn to what we are picking up from the other,   nonhousing sectors  I would summarize their views by quoting the CEO of Cadbury Schweppes    He said that he has heard a great deal about stagflation “The ‘stag’ is definitely not there; the   ‘flation’ is increasing”  The CEO of EDS, who has as his clients GM and Delphi, said, “You hear a   lot about quarter-to-quarter slowdown  I’m not seeing it in the general economy”   My shipping contacts report that the rate for Panamax ships, which I talked about earlier   because Panamax is the most liquid of the bulk carriers and perhaps the best indicator, rose from   $16,500 at the last meeting to $22,000 last week  All the shippers to whom I spoke are revising   upward the volume that they expect to ship as well as the revenue they expect to generate   The rails report that they expect the rise in second-quarter GDP to be around 4 percent in   terms of their activity level, up from the first quarter  One indicator is that Burlington Northern   Santa Fe reports having shipped 200,000 units a week only one time in 2004, nine times in 2005,   and sixteen times this year to date, with an acceleration in April, May, and June   I think all of us saw FedEx’s numbers that were reported  I spoke at length with the CFO of   UPS, who reports that sales were up 6 percent in the first quarter  As of last week they are   forecasting closer to 5 percent for the second quarter  The CFO said that “there is no dramatic   slowdown that we can observe”  The chairman of an airline that moves 80 million passengers, who   last time worried aloud about a slowdown that they were seeing in California, says that in terms of   realistic bookings, across the nation it is strong without exception and confirms President Moskow’s   point about being able to have some pricing power  Yet because of capacity constraints in the   industry as a whole, this firm is still seeing strong demand and strong growth potential   The retailers, I would say, are divided into two groups  The higher price points continue to   do well  To quote the CEO of JCPenney “What I am seeing through my business is not what I am   June 28-29, 2006 49 of 177    hearing on CNBC or hearing from the Wall Street analysts”  On the other hand, those at the lower   price points—and I have two extremes here, 7-Eleven and Wal-Mart, in terms of their average sale   and size—are clearly coming under pressure due to gasoline prices  But one thing that I heard in   talking with the CEO of the world largest retailer was that “there is a lot of pricing pressure”; and   for the first time I heard the following “We have pricing power, and we are passing it through”     You see this statement confirmed in terms of the anecdotal evidence we’re receiving from those that   supply retailers, companies like Cadbury Schweppes, Frito-Lay, and Kimberly-Clark  The CEO of   Kimberly-Clark reports that, again, demand is good on the demand side, but the cost front continues   to worry them  Regarding electronics, Texas Instruments is expecting a better second quarter than a   first quarter  In cell phones, the most significant price increases they have been able to pass through   in several years are now being put into the marketplace   One ray of sunshine on the price front is in the health care sector  According to Hewitt’s   new reports—as you know, Mr Chairman, this is the time of year in which they are negotiating the   settlements for the price of health care to companies for next year—there has been a constant   wrenching or ratcheting down of the increase in those prices, from 113 percent in ’05 to 82 percent   in ’06, and they expect to go another percentage point downward this year   In summary, we, like the previous reporters, have a little dissonance with the Greenbook in   terms of growth  We don’t see as sharp a correction in the second quarter and looking forward     We are, however, concerned about inflation  As you know, we look at the trimmed mean PCE   deflator in Dallas—it has been running at a rate of about 24 percent  But no matter how you   measure it, inflation is running above 2 percent  We’ve asked ourselves, and done some analysis,   about where the inflation pressure is coming from  The fraction of prices weighted by expenditure   increasing at annual rates of zero to 3 percent has been squeezed, whereas the fraction of prices   June 28-29, 2006 50 of 177    increasing at annual rates above 3 percent has grown  Compared with December 2005, according to   our analysis, Mr Chairman, the fraction of price increases above 3 percent has risen from   33 percent to 57 percent  The fraction with price increases above 2 percent has risen from 47 to   68 percent, and small price increases have become the exception   When you ask where the pressures are coming from—it’s a little like Agatha Christie’s   Murder on the Orient Express  They all did it  All of these prices seem to be moving, and we do   seem to be seeing, for the first time, a confirmation from our private-sector contacts that price   expectations are rolling into pricing behavior   One last comment  I spoke earlier and others have spoken about liquidity in the   marketplace, and I reported about the desire of one utility to put together a $10 billion project that   will entail 12 million manhours  They raised $11 billion for the project  The money is now in the   bank, nonrecourse financing at 225 basis points over Libor  Also, you may have seen that   Anadarko is effecting a merger or, rather, an acquisition of two separate companies  The CEO of   Anadarko is on our Board  He reported that they raised $22 billion “at breathtaking speed”  Indeed,   in both transactions, three houses chose to do the entire transaction in-house  That is my report, Mr   Chairman    For health care?    Well, actually we have that on our website, Mr Chairman  I’d be happy to   give you the report  These are the breakdowns of all the different expenditure components within   the PCE    I’d be happy to provide that analysis    Mr Chairman, I’d like to build on the comments by President Lacker,   President Poole, and President Yellen  I want to address the language first and the move second    Following President Lacker’s lead of referring to last night’s dinner, I want to go back to a   statement that Governor King made last week—that the Bank of England’s approach is to keep   June 28-29, 2006 106 of 177    things as simple as possible  They don’t say where interest rates will go next for the simple   reason that they don’t know and it would be quite misleading to pretend otherwise  Listening to   my colleagues at the table and addressing President Poole’s point and my own concerns, I don’t   know where we’ll go in August  I do think we should keep it simple      In terms of the wording—and I’ll get to the move in just a minute—it strikes me that the   first sentence in alternative B as to the rationale is correct and in keeping with what we’ve heard   at this table  I would then move on—I agree with President Lacker—to say what we set out to   do  But “ongoing productivity gains” and “contained inflation expectations should restrain   inflation going forward” is the wording from alternative C, the second paragraph of the rationale    I don’t like the word “readings” because—and President Yellen has made a very good point—we   don’t want to be viewed as reactive  I’d prefer the word “pressures”  “However, recent   pressures on core inflation have been elevated, which the Committee views as unwelcome”    Then I agree with President Lacker—to clarify our intention, I would not use in alternative B the   paragraph 4 that we have  I wouldn’t use any of it, and I’ll come to the reason in a second  I   would just say that “in order to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth, the   Committee seeks a medium-term decline in core inflation from its current elevated levels”    By the way, I don’t like the second sentence of paragraph 4 in the current alternative B   because, as a former market operator, I take from it that we intend to raise rates again  The   slippage in there revolves around the words “any additional firming” and the word “may”   Again, given my background, I read from those words that we’re biased toward raising rates   again, and I don’t think that’s where we are  At least that’s not where I am  I would also make a   plea, which I think I do at almost every meeting, to eliminate from row 5 the words “in any   event” and just say, “The Committee will respond to changes”     June 28-29, 2006 107 of 177     As to the move itself, the real epiphany I had last night was after dinner driving home    I’m about to go on vacation, and I was thinking about golf—besides the wisdom that I garnered   at dinner  In thinking about golf, I was thinking about the US Open  What happened at the   US Open was that the fellow who was in the lead, Phil Mickelson, went for broke  The fact is   that this is a team sport  (By the way, Mr Chairman, I want to congratulate you for the way you   conduct these meetings, because I really do feel—and I think all of us feel—as part of a team)    But the sequence of events here is that we’re going to release a statement after we announce our   move, you’re going to testify on monetary policy, and then the minutes are going to be released,   if I understand the time sequence correctly  The markets look to the Chairman  Even though   this is a team sport, you can go back in history, and you can think of various analogies  Just to   kill my golfing analogy here, we might consider Paul Volcker as Bobby Jones and Alan   Greenspan as an octogenarian Tiger Woods, and so on  Your words will be carefully weighed    In arguing for a sparse statement, I think the market will be focused on what you say, and then it   will look at the minutes, and that’s where we amplify, if we wish to amplify or respond to   incoming data  Just to finish the golf analogy, I think our job in terms of the amount that we   move is to put the ball back onto the fairway so you can approach the green  I think 25 basis   points is the best alternative, so I support the 25 basis point move, and I would urge you to   consider the wording changes that have been put forth by President Lacker and by President   Poole  Thank you, Mr Chairman     I don’t know where we’re going to go next  I do believe we should move    I also believe, by the way, that the economy is stronger than the Greenbook says  I made that   clear in my statement  I was tempted to suggest adding “somewhat” after the word   “moderating,” but moderating is moderating  I’m not sure where we go next, and I’m not sure   that we should signal because I think we don’t know  This gets partially at President Yellen’s   point and certainly to President Poole’s point  The wording as it is, Tim, is too directive  Like   President Lacker, I would prefer to clarify our intention as it appears in column C here in the   fourth box  I don’t think we need to say much more and should leave amplification to the   testimony and to the minutes  That’s my point  Does that answer your question?     First of all, we announce a ¼ point move  Second, we say that we are   worried—we use the word “unwelcome”  The inflationary pressures, the core inflation   pressures, are unwelcome  We state very clearly what our intention is, and we state that we’re   going to respond to changes   I think our action is then addressed in a very straightforward way   by the words that we use without indicating that we’re likely to move still further, because I   don’t have the confidence that we will move still further  But we’re making it very clear we’re   June 28-29, 2006 109 of 177    not going to tolerate obviously extreme or harsh inflationary pressures that we’re seeing in the   core     No, I don’t want to indicate that we’re going to move when we’re not sure   we’re going to move     Well, Mr Chairman, I disagree with the reading  We come from different   perspectives  However, we do need to bear in mind that we have this statement, we have your   testimony, we have the release of the minutes, and all of those are tools that we should use  Let   me just leave it at that     The wording in alternative C—which says that, in order to foster price   stability, we seek a medium-term decline in core inflation from its recent elevated levels—puts   into context, President Lacker, how we’re likely to deal with intermeeting data  That’s our   intention     What is wrong with Monday or Tuesday in that sense?  What makes it   inconvenient—because Thursday is a crunch, particularly if you’re going to travel a distance  "
7967,2006-08-08,"  Just a quick question for Karen  Karen, looking at the global economy as a   whole, would you say that capacity utilization has increased since we last met, since the end of the   last quarter, or since the beginning of the year and, if so, to a significant degree?    Is that net of our weakness or our declining? This is just guess work, but I   am curious    Thank you    Mr Chairman, at our last FOMC meeting in my now over one-year-long   attempt to stay away from any analogies referring to innings or baseball [laughter], I used the   analogy of Phil Mickelson at the US Open to suggest an opposite strategy  What I suggested   was that we use the minutes we are about to release and especially your testimony, if you recall,   to center the ball on the fairway so that we could approach the green from the point of this   meeting  It appears now that we have done that, you have done that, and the minutes have done   that, and we are basically at a point where we are confident of either a hawkish pause or one   more tightening of the screw in terms of raising the federal funds rate   The Greenbook and the Bluebook do a good job of presenting us with an analytical   framework for this meeting  I want to compliment them, with an “i,” but I also thought it might   be helpful to complement them, with an “e,” with some of the data and inputs from our business   contacts and the work of our own research staff on the issues we have been talking about    Let me start with housing  I regularly talk to CEOs of two of the five big builders  They   like using analogies In the words of the second largest builder in the country, “The pig is still in   the python” That is, he expects the decline from peak to trough in home sales to exceed that   forecast in the Greenbook  I think we had 17½ percent; he is talking about a correction of   25 percent To adhere to the convention of reporting on my District, which we are supposed to   do, I’m happy to say that only Texas, where our economy is on the verge of employing ten   million workers, is holding up in the books of these two homebuilders  Even the Carolinas are   August 8, 2006 28 of 158                   starting to fold over, and the weakest area is California  The Big Five builders and other   homebuilders are reacting as you might expect  They are cutting staff  They are renegotiating   their prices and getting concessions from their subcontractors  They are walking away from their   planned land deals, and they are renegotiating existing contracts  This is what a macroeconomist   would expect in reaction  In answer to Cathy’s and David’s questions, one CEO, who has been   in the business since 1973, reports that this correction is the roughest and most sudden he has   seen, with one exception That exception is that the industry is significantly consolidated, with   most of the big builders either supporting very strong balance sheets or having ready   accessibility to capital from a flush banking system and eager private equity groups  So the   reports I received from the Big Five are that, while they are wringing their hands, they’re also   licking their chops; they are plotting acquisitions of smaller, weaker builders when they reach the   depths of despair This situation may signal the prospect of a shorter turnaround time for a   correction, or it may not, but I just throw it out for your contemplation   Clearly, however, the housing downturn and the cumulative effect of energy and   electricity price increases are having an effect  One of my contacts is the CEO of a large “casual   dining” restaurant chain, which employs 110,000 out of the 48 million people employed in that   segment of the restaurant business  He reports that his utility costs this year have risen   30 percent and his materials costs have risen 15 percent  Although customers are moving   downscale in terms of the dining chain, guest counts for that segment of the market, which again   employs 48 million people, are down 5 percent in the last week, and he sees that trend   continuing   The CEO of a national middle price point retailer reported that furniture sales in July   were down 21 percent A low-end price point retailer—the low-end price point being Wal-Mart   August 8, 2006 29 of 158                   to 7-Eleven—reports slowing traffic In the words of the head of Wal-Mart USA, John Menzer,   “What we saw last month is getting worse”  So-called morning madness sales, which are   common in September, have been moved up to July and August   The railroads report a significant slowdown over the past four weeks in the shipment of   forest products So we do have a slowdown, although it is important to point out that the rails,   according to the companies themselves, expect to increase traffic 3 percent during the second   half because of industrial demand  UPS reports through its CFO that it is shipping 132 million   packages a day, which is down from about 135 in the first half but up from 127 in ’05    Incidentally, their report last quarter proved to be remarkably accurate in terms of their expected   growth for the second quarter, if it, in turn, is revised upward toward 3 percent  So I want to   stick with what I reported at the June FOMC meeting—that our “roadster” economy has   downshifted in growth   I also reported a sense that inflation pressure gauge needles were moving forward, and   my soundings this time indicate that they continue to do so  I thought that the briefing the staff   gave to the Board and circulated to us was very helpful, and I appreciate very much the   discussion we had earlier on inflation in answer to President Poole’s question  It is important to   point out that the monthly trimmed mean PCE inflation rate in June was 31 percent  On a   twelve-month basis, it picked up to 27 percent  But very importantly—if, as President Poole   suggested, you break down the PCE components, whether you trim it or you use it “fully garbed”   [laughter]—83 percent of the components are increasing in price  That is up from 73 percent in   April What that means is that only 17 percent of prices are falling compared with 27 percent   two months ago   August 8, 2006 30 of 158                               We know that inflationary pressures are building abroad  Karen, our work in Dallas is   very much in its infancy; but to the extent that it helps, our measurement of industrial capacity   utilization in all the large member states of the European Union is up  Recent revisions to the   United Kingdom’s national accounts indicate that the Brits are operating closer to capacity; and   if you look at the Tankan survey, for the first time in more than a decade, Japan is reporting   capacity constraints Like everybody else, we have no reliable data on China and India, but we   know that their economies are steaming along  As they grow, they cut into existing global   capacity available to US businesses  Let me give you an example  Our shipping CEOs report   that a portion of the international fleet of large bulk carriers, although they estimate that this   portion is only about 2 percent, has now been rerouted and is being used for intracoastal,   intra-Chinese trade  So at a time of the year when usually the rates cave for these Panamax   ships, which are the largest bulk carriers, the daily rate has stiffened another $1,000  It is up to   $23,000 from the $22,000 that I reported at our last meeting, even though this is usually the soft   time of the year  Just for a reference point, last year at this time it was one-half that price   At home our bankers report, in the words of the CEO of the largest bank in Texas, “more   talk about price increases and pass-throughs”  We are seeing the return in our District of the   term “air ball financing,” which is financing based on prospects not on hard reality  One   example that caught my interest, which is yet unreported in the public press, is that, according to   the CEO of a large corporation with a $30 billion market capitalization, they have been   approached by a single buyout group to take them private  So there is a lot of liquidity left in the   system   The CEO of Wal-Mart USA reports that they are building in a price increase of 1 percent   this year It is the first increase in a long, long time  Typically they built in minus 1 percent to   August 8, 2006 31 of 158                         minus 2 percent  The increase was confirmed by the CEO of one of Wal-Mart’s largest suppliers   of nongrocery goods, who quoted Lee Scott as telling him last week, “We are reaching the limits   of productivity enhancement and may have to take it out in price increases”  Kimberly-Clark’s   CEO reports that he started the year planning for an inflation factor in their cost of goods sold of   $150 million  It has been ratcheted up in two intervals and is now at $350 million  He reports   that they are covering increases in the cost of goods sold through price increases  This is in   sharp contrast to what he has been telling me before every previous meeting   Food processors report the same  It might be noteworthy that corn prices—even though   we don’t include them in the core PCE—are, because of ethanol production, up significantly    That’s very unusual at this time of the year  Frito-Lay’s CEO reports an overall inflation shift—   in his own words, “the ability to pass through price increases and make them stick”    Finally, Mr Chairman, at a recent meeting you asked about my reports from Hewitt, the   consulting company, regarding the prospects for health care costs  According to one of my   sources, several of the largest insurers are focusing on a settlement range of roughly 7 percent to   8½ percent growth for next year It is a little more than they had expected; it is roughly what it   was last year I might point out that those companies cover a large number of people   To supplement this input, I touched base with three people I consider to be the best   long-term practitioners in the fund-management business  Each one has been in the business for   more than thirty years  Besides reporting continued high appetites for risk and continued   elevated liquidity in the marketplace, these gnarly old-timers report a shift in the attitude of   businesses that they cover in investing To quote one, “Before, the operators we deal with were   worried about getting their heads handed to them if they tried to pass through price increases;   now they’re trying to see what they can get away with”  In summary, the CEO of Cadbury   August 8, 2006 32 of 158                            Schweppes—to kill the serpentine analogy—says that “we’re just not through the snake yet on   inflation”    Mr Chairman, this is a long and faithful report  For all the inherent risks, I pay close   attention to what I hear from my CEO contacts  According to them, in addition to the data that   we are seeing, the economy is slowing from its torrid pace of growth and downshifting to a more   normal range  Global capacity and utilization are not slowing apace from what we can see, or if   they are slowing, overall global capacity utilization is staying at an even level  It is also clear   that the business community has its finger poised on the trigger of price increases  It may well   be that the lagged effect of our de-accommodation has yet to temper the price equation  It may   be that energy prices and other cost-push factors are at a point of tapering off  It may be that   moderation in the domestic economy’s growth rate will remove demand-pull potential, and it   may be that tightening measures of our counterparts abroad will tamp down input prices for our   producers here, although it could have a counter-effect in terms of the exchange rate effect on the   costs of imports  But I do want to ask us to remember that inflation is—as stated in a paper that   was circulated previously—an inertial process  (The paper may have been from you, Bill)  We   must be very careful in word and in deed that we do not encourage impulses that will spur that   inertia and that will prove harder and more costly to rein in further down the road  Thank you   Mr Chairman, I think it was in March that I referred to Pascal’s famous   wager about the existence of God Pascal’s view was basically that if you look far out in the   future from a risk-management standpoint, the answer was in the affirmative  [Laughter] I   happen to accept the existence of inflation, and I admire President Lacker, President Minehan,   and others who have made very strong arguments    I take note of one thing that is very different at this meeting from what I have heard in my   year-plus at this table  This is the first time that many people have said—and I certainly have   heard this from the people I have talked to in the field—that they are moving on prices instead of   being tamped down in terms of their desire  In other words, they have pricing power, and it is   being realized This is the first time we’ve heard that in the discussion, and it worries me   It’s very, very important that we signal our anti-inflationary resolve  I generally always   agree with President Poole  I happen to be a minimalist as far as the statement is concerned  But   if we pause here, it is very important that we use the kind of language that Governor Kohn   suggested and that we make it very clear that this may not be the end of the process  Even more   important, Mr Chairman, is that we agree at this table that we’ll be fearless in moving if we have   to   August 8, 2006 100 of 158                         As to the market, I think President Minehan made a very good comment  Having been a   market operator for thirty years of my career, I have found that markets are usually wrong  Our   job is not to satisfy the markets Our job is to get the economy right—that’s our mission   So I would accept a pause, Mr Chairman, under the conditions I just mentioned  I like   Governor Kohn’s suggestion on language although, like a broken record, I would put the word   “global” in front of “resource utilization” because I think that reflects reality  Having said what I   just said, I would also say that, if the group decides to raise the rate 25 basis points, I won’t   dissent because I don’t have a vote [Laughter]   If we were to keep productivity gains in, I would suggest striking the   word “ongoing”   Well, Mr Chairman, we do have responsibility for a fiat currency, and my   straightforward and undiplomatic way of describing what we do for a living is that we are   performing a great confidence game  I think that’s important to bear in mind  As President Yellen   said, this is apple pie and motherhood  The answer is “yes” to the first questions, but there are   questions about which agents we are talking about and, when we talk about generating well-  informed expectations, how we do so   I mentioned earlier, to Governor Kohn’s embarrassment, “full frontal exposure,” and I think   that’s not an unimportant point  To maintain the confidence game that we have to maintain and—if   you’ll permit me to say this having experienced the other side—to maintain the last bastion of   integrity in Washington—and I feel very strongly about that—we have to be very careful that we   preserve a bit of modesty and mystery to accomplish our goals  The really tough part is how far we   go, and that’s what we’re going to have to talk about going down the path  For example, I’m   somewhat uncomfortable, even though I have great respect for President Moskow, about making   long-term forecasts  The further out you forecast, the more probable error is  I am wary of   August 8, 2006 135 of 158                                                    exposing our vulnerabilities, and I think we should be mindful of that as we go through time  That’s   just one thought   Another thought is about the statement  I may have forgotten my logic here, but I think we   should be as straight as Occam’s razor—that is, we should take as few variables as possible to   explain what we decide to do  I do think the minutes are very important for illumination  I don’t   want to manipulate the minutes, but I think we can use them quite effectively  In my statement   earlier in the meeting, when we were discussing our view of the economy, I said that I think we did   that very effectively the last time around   Then a third point—I’m a strong believer in partnerships  I mentioned this at a dinner with   the Presidents last night I’m also a very strong believer in a strong managing-partner model,   having worked all my life in the private sector in partnerships  But I do think it’s very, very   important to have a diversity of views, and so I second what has been said at the table on that front   as well  Those are my three comments, Mr Chairman  "
7990,2006-09-20," First, I want to congratulate David on the excellent memo on inflation   dynamics, and I hope that we can circulate it more broadly to the academic community so we can   enrich that debate It was a superb paper  Karen, you know how much I appreciate your   comments on the inflation dynamics that you’re seeing in other countries  I have a question on   that front—really two questions   September 20, 2006 18 of 132                     First, in listening to the people that we talk to in the energy business, whether it’s Lee   Raymond or all the operators of the various companies from Exxon down to the smaller ones, I   still hear the issue of how much of this price reversal—just as there was an issue of how much of   the price increase—derives from speculative activity, nonphysical demand  To summarize what   I heard over the past week or so, my contacts assert that the speculators have shifted to the short   side of the boat—so that we have seen this tilt  I’m wondering how much influence you ascribe   to speculative activity as opposed to physical demand and supply activity  I know we’ve had this   discussion before, but has speculation accelerated the downturn, or is there something else at   play?   Maybe Dino can add something?   Well, again, it’s just something I’m interested in  It’s not unimportant,   but I have a more important question  Karen, I noticed last week that the International Monetary   Fund forecasts global economic growth, non-US growth, of around 5 percent  Our number is   3¼ percent What is the difference between us?  If we’re underestimating, what would be the   policy implications?    Mr Chairman, the Eleventh District economy remains strong and continues   to grow at a stronger pace than the rest of the country, with employment growth continuing at   roughly twice the nation’s pace  Incidentally, home sales have not turned down in our District, so   we haven’t been singing yet what we call the “coastal blues” as far as the homebuilding market is   concerned I think that’s enough said about Texas and the Eleventh District     I would like to talk about what I have learned this time from my usual soundings of some   two dozen CEOs and CFOs  I have added a new one, by the way—the largest truck dealer in the   country, which does $28 billion in sales of heavy trucks  Just as a footnote, what is driving some of   what President Poole reported are the changes in emission standards that are being enforced as of   January; other than that, they do not see much turndown in volume   To summarize the reports of these interlocutors, I am going to borrow from Mark Twain’s   great quip about the music of Wagner  According to these business contacts, the outlook for   economic growth is better than it sounds, whereas the dynamic of inflation is worse than it sounds   September 20, 2006 37 of 132                               Just a few anecdotes here for, if not similitude, verisimilitude  By the way, all the   interlocutors are fully aware of the shape of the yield curve—these individuals are sophisticated—   and they are especially aware of what is happening in the housing market  As one CEO told me, the   only subject that has been more analyzed than the housing situation is the birth of Brad Pitt’s baby    [Laughter]  According to this view, if we have not discounted what has been happening in the   housing market, we have been living on Mars, and I think that is an important point to take into   account  If you remember, Dave, I have been more pessimistic than the staff in terms of the depth   of the housing downturn     Well, very quickly, according to the CFO of Frito-Lay, he and his counterpart CFOs in   consumer goods companies do not see an appreciable slowing of growth from the second quarter to   the third quarter  The CFO of UPS reports that, while business is tougher, third-quarter growth is   running at a rate of 3 percent, the same as the second quarter, and their business projections indicate   GDP growth “in the high 2 percent or low 3 percent area” for the rest of the year  The CEO of   Burlington Northern Santa Fe reports that, despite a 17 percent year-over-year falloff in lumber   shipments through last week, business overall “has actually firmed since the second quarter”  From   my usual report on the Panamax shipping charter rates, it is noteworthy that since our last meeting,   when the round-trip booking rate was $23,000 a day, the rate has soared to $31,000 a day  By the   way, the rates for carrying back finished products like steel from China, in the so-called handymax   fleet, has risen to $27,300 from $23,000 a day, where it was at our last meeting   All the retailers I talked to—from 7-Eleven to JCPenney to Costco to Home Depot—report   that they feel that they have bottomed out and that things are picking up, with one exception  That   exception is Wal-Mart, and I think some of that situation relates to the internal dynamics of the way   Wal-Mart is positioning itself in the market  I think Bill’s report was very accurate on Wal-Mart   September 20, 2006 38 of 132                                 There are some tempering contra-indicators  The book-to-bill ratio for Texas Instruments   and other semiconductor firms has fallen to 1 or slightly below, and advanced bookings for airlines   are somewhat weaker  Herb Kelleher of Southwest Airlines, who has to be the most entertaining   interlocutor I talk to, tempered that by saying when we met last time the advanced booking curve   “index” was, say, 100  It has now eased to somewhere around 95—a noticeable but not dramatic   drop   The CEO of EDS summarized the growth side of the economy much as did the majority of   the CEOs I spoke to for this go-round when he said, “We were all expecting things to be worse    They haven’t gotten worse”   They were all expecting things to get tougher, and they haven’t gotten   tougher, except for one area—the procurement of labor  There is a shortage of bank tellers and   mechanics By the way, a wrench bender, as they call the job in California now—a simple   mechanic without the completion of a high-school diploma—gets $100,000 a year  There is a   shortage of truck drivers, of oil field hands, of chemical engineers, and even of unskilled workers   such as retail store cashiers in Houston; and for the first time I have heard from the major hoteliers   of a shortage of hotel maids  To illustrate the point, one CEO mentioned that, whereas his company   regularly used to get 300 applications for 100 truck driver jobs, they now get 3  So the bottom line   is that our contacts are feeling more optimistic than the economists’ forecasts  They are worried   about some constraints on domestic labor  As one contact said, the economy feels like a full   employment economy   I want to spend just a minute on the inflation picture  I’m not going to go through anecdotes   from the CEOs, though it pains me greatly as the son of an Australian to note that Anheuser-Busch   has told its retailers that it is going to raise the price of beer 3 percent starting in January 2007  But I   do want to explain why our board voted 7 to 1 to raise the discount rate  As you know, we measure   September 20, 2006 39 of 132                         inflation at the Dallas Fed by the trimmed mean  Our numbers show trimmed mean inflation   running at 31 percent in July and a twelve-month rate of 27 percent and, not unimportantly, with   57 percent of the component elements increased at a rate of 3 percent or more  Now, of course, we   cannot update those numbers until the next PCE number comes out, so you might argue that they   are very stale  But the recent CPI release was not comforting  Dave, you mentioned 02 percent    Taking that at face value, you can say that consumer inflation is unchanged from July  But if you   really look at those numbers, the rate for July was 019 percent, and the rate for August was 024   percent  If you annualize those numbers, that is a difference between 236 percent and 29 percent   So we need to keep in mind that the August CPI reading is about midway between July’s   low reading and the elevated readings over the previous four months  At an annual rate of roughly   3 percent, it is better than earlier this year, but it is still uncomfortable  I take President Moskow’s   point about our credibility, particularly against the background of the trimmed mean, Cleveland’s   median rate of 34 percent, and then our six-month trimmed mean rate running at about 29 percent,   I believe  I mention this simply to urge the Committee that—not only in our deeds, to take   President Moskow’s point, but also in our words—we need to continue engendering confidence   about inflation expectations and be very careful in the way we state ourselves  We cannot take it for   granted that inflation has been completely conquered  Thank you, Mr Chairman    That was the UPS estimate, yes, sir    Mr Chairman, if I may, again, this is just one source of data  They happen   to be in a business that is, I think, particularly interesting  In preparation for the last meeting, they   were talking about a number closer to 3 percent than the original estimate before the revision, and   they proved to be quite accurate  But I want to make sure I was clear  The CFO was saying that   their third quarter is running at a 3 percent growth rate—the same as the second quarter in their   business—and their estimate for GDP growth in the fourth quarter is in the high twos or low threes    Well, Mr Chairman, I am somewhere between Mr Moskow and our   distinguished president from Minneapolis, but I am biased toward B+  My board, as I indicated   earlier, was in favor of ratcheting up the discount rate  One of their concerns that I did not voice in   our discussion previously was about how permanent or, rather, how temporary this reduction in   energy price is likely to be, and as you know, we have a heavy weight of significant oil operators on   our board  The only statement one can make with assurance—and Karen referred to this during the   analysis period—is that we are likely to have volatility  We cannot take or assume great confidence   in terms of continued direction   In alternative B, section 3, the words that I find most objectionable are “reflecting reduced   impetus from energy prices”  It is a little too soon to tell, and the language sends a mixed signal   because we spent, under our previous leadership, a tremendous amount of time emphasizing core   PCE, which excludes energy  I take your point, which is absolutely appropriate in my view, that we   need to be aware that the rest of the world looks at the CPI and does not necessarily think about core   PCE ex-food and ex-energy because they have to eat and they have to drive  I would be in favor of   the B+ column, Mr Chairman  I would consider striking the words “policy is more likely to firm   than ease going forward,” but Vince makes a good point  There is some value to the force of   repetition What I worry about most is expectations creep, and I do agree that what I am hearing   from outside and what I heard not just at Jackson Hole but elsewhere is that we are too willing to   accept an inflation target that ranges up to 3 percent  I would be adamantly against accepting that   kind of inflation  So I think it is important to reiterate our bias and to do it with a deft hand  We   should not do it in such a way that tilts us into the risk that you pointed out in your charts of   triggering recession, but we nonetheless should indicate that we are firm  So I am a B+ man, even   at this table of A+ students   September 20, 2006 98 of 132                                 "
8016,2006-10-24,"  I have just an informational question, David and Karen  If my memory is   correct, the September CPI numbers excluding food and energy were not substantially different   from those in August  What I’m curious about, if you could just quickly comment, are the   dynamics of owners’ equivalent rent (OER)  That was you, Dave    So, in summary, we are looking at high threes, upward    Karen, the most arresting figure, as you pointed out, is reported Chinese   growth in the third quarter  What does that stem from?  Is it their faux monetary policy or moral   suasion or what we call, negotiating with the Chinese, “immoral suasion?”  Or do you sense that   some capacity constraints are at work here?    Thank you, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, at our last meeting I engaged in a little Texas brag  I   mentioned that the employment growth rate in our District was twice that of the national average    Then I read in the pre-briefing for the Board last night the penultimate sentence, which had a   wonderful three-word phrase—“Humility is required”  So let me report that economic growth in   our District has slowed somewhat, and I want to put the “somewhat” in perspective  We redid the   October 24-25, 2006 39 of 203    numbers of our first-quarter real GDP growth  Growth of the state real gross product for the first   quarter was 9 percent for the Eleventh District  So it’s not a great wonder that it is slowing—it is   slowing down from too torrid a pace  But our housing sector is still sweet—perhaps the only spot   left in the country—particularly in the Houston area  We actually are building a new auto plant,   President Moskow, a Toyota plant in San Antonio, which is getting an inordinate amount of   attention  The exports from our state are growing at a monthly rate annualized at 45 percent, and   Texas is now the largest exporting state in the nation  So from the standpoint of economic growth,   even as I am trying to be humble, the District is doing exceedingly well   The only consistently sour note that we hear is what you have heard around this table—and   just now from First Vice President Barron—that we have continued reports of shortages of skilled   and unskilled labor, from chemical engineers to school teachers to bank tellers and even to hotel   housekeeping staff  So we have a significant problem in terms of labor shortages—skilled, semi-  skilled, and now, increasingly, unskilled  To put some numbers on this, we have a contact who has   surveyed fifty plants on the Gulf Coast for the price of welders  In eight months, the price for a   welder has gone from $19 an hour to $25 an hour  You have to pay them a bonus of $100 when   they show up, and you have to pay them a completion bonus as well  The bottom line is that in the   Eleventh District we’re behaving as though we were a full-employment economy     In the rest of my comments, I’d like to emphasize not my District but our views on the US   and the global economies, particularly the US economy  I want to go back to your concluding   remarks, Mr Chairman, at the last meeting, when you reminded us that, if we believe we need to   have output below potential to help address inflation pressures, it’s a delicate operation, and we may   have a very narrow channel to navigate as we go forward—just to keep with your naval analogy of a   few seconds ago  This summer I sailed the Corinth Canal, which is so narrow that at times you feel   October 24-25, 2006 40 of 203    you can reach out and touch both sides  Even though I was on vacation, I was actually thinking of   one side as the shoals of slow economic growth—almost recessionary growth, which seems to be   what the Greenbook is forecasting at least for the third quarter, and the risk that seems to be out   there—and of the other side as the shoals of inflation   From the 27 or 28 CEOs and CFOs to whom I spoke in preparing for this meeting, as I   always do, I do hear reports of a slowdown  I talked to two of the Big Five housebuilders this time    They are cutting back significantly  Let me give you some numbers  For example, Centex owns   109,000 lots outright and has 54,000 lots under hard option and 80,000 lots under soft option, as   they call it  They’ve canceled 25 percent of their hard options  That is $85 million worth of   properties  Hovnanian is walking away from $100 million worth of hard option properties  The   effort there is to cut back so that what was a two-month leading supply has now become a three-  month leading supply  You can see how the dynamics are beginning to work  They’re moving on   price, but they are also trying to shut down their inventory and are taking very quick action  That is   a depressing factor  One of the truck dealers I talked with, Rush Enterprises, has about $27 billion   a year in sales  I believe they are the largest in the country; they are nationwide  They are reporting   that Christmas retail activity seems to be backing up; in other words, it is slower than it was in   previous years  This is an operator with 41 years of experience  They are also building their   inventory, particularly in the coastal areas, with the heavy trucks that are going to be used for home   construction  The book-to-bill ratio for Texas Instruments has fallen below 1; it is the lowest since   2000  And if you read the newspapers, you will see that the airlines are offering very deep   discounts and for longer periods than before  So there seems to be a slowdown in activity   With that said, when you talk to the rails, there is a diminution of growth, perhaps 1 percent   third quarter over second quarter, and if you talk to UPS, as I reported last time, you’re still seeing   October 24-25, 2006 41 of 203    some rather robust reports of economic growth of 2 to 3 percent  I think the best way to summarize   the economy is, as President Moskow said earlier, that although there are weak signs, the economy   is still robust  The chairman and CEO of Cadbury-Schweppes said, “I keep looking and listening,   but I’m just not seeing what everybody tells me is going to happen”  Again, as I reported last time,   the CEO of EDS, who is an experienced businessman, said, “It’s a funny period  Everybody is   prepared to be bearish, but it’s simply not materializing”  So, David, from an economic standpoint,   both from the anecdotal evidence and our own economic modeling, we don’t quite accept the   Greenbook’s forecast of the kind of slowdown that you’re expecting for the third quarter or for the   second half   There are positive benefits, and the benefits are, of course, with price pressure abatement    My favorite anecdotal example, by the way, comes from globalization at work, Karen    Interestingly, the CEO of Fluor, who is one of my contacts, reports that when they bid for the Bay   Bridge construction, their bid on US steel prices was rejected as being too expensive  They went   back and bid based on what they could buy steel from China for, and the bid was accepted    Canadian steel now sells for 25 percent less than US steel, and Chinese steel is being dumped into   this market at a price 40 percent lower than Canadian steel  From the standpoint of raw materials   and energy, you have seen price pressure abatement  But from businessperson after businessperson,   we still hear the same reports, Mr Chairman, that we hear in our District and that you’ve heard   around this table, which is of significant price pressures stemming from labor  As I mentioned   earlier, it is not just skilled labor; it is now semi-skilled labor such as truck drivers and welders    Increasingly shortages are being reported, throughout our District and the rest of the country   So I would summarize by agreeing with President Moskow in that we in the Eleventh   District find the Greenbook’s projection of economic growth to be too pessimistic  Although price   October 24-25, 2006 42 of 203    pressures have abated somewhat, we know by our measure—the trimmed-mean PCE, off of which   we key our view of the economy—that the three-month rate is still running at 29 percent and the   twelve-month rate is running at 27 percent  I would argue as we navigate this narrow channel, Mr   Chairman, whether it’s the channel you describe or the Corinth Canal, that I would be more careful   of the inflationary shoals than of the risk of excessive slowdown of growth  Thank you    The question that I put to each contact was to compare the third quarter with   the second quarter  I was trying to get a feel because I’m quite concerned about our staff analysis   and the Greenbook’s analysis of the dramatic slowdown to 1 percent in third-quarter growth  So the   answer is, yes, there is a slowdown, but it is not now of the severity that our staff projection seems   to indicate  But I do want to note that there is some slowdown taking place    Part of that, by the way, is in the average fleet of, say, Class A trucks, which   are the big ones  The average fleet age is now fourteen months; the normal fleet age is twenty-two   months  Part of that has to do with all of these Environmental Protection Agency changes that keep   being mandated  So you have to sort out that distortion from economic activity  But the point I was   October 24-25, 2006 43 of 203    reporting is that the utilization of those trucks in terms of carrying Christmas inventory appears to   have slowed and is not running at the pace that it was in previous years    Mr Chairman, very quickly—I asked two of the big homebuilders to whom   I spoke about that very phenomenon  Their answer was very interesting  They have strong balance   sheets  One of them said, “I can feel the private equity shark swimming around my feet”  In fact,   there is rumor of one sizable deal that has been proposed—I haven’t been able to figure out what it   is—to take one of them entirely private  So some of the buttressing, President Minehan, is coming   from significant amounts of liquidity in the system    Then we’ll be waiting for a completion bonus  [Laughter]    I was just listening to Bill, and I consider us neither hawks nor sparrows   nor doves  I hope that we’re being owlish, and that was a very owlish approach  But I’d like to   come around to what Bill said, maybe in a different way  It struck me, Mr Chairman, when I   reflected last night on what I heard at the table yesterday, that on balance we sustained a barrage   of attacks on the inflationary front  They came from energy  They came from commodity   prices  They also came from potential shifts in the pricing behavior among business producers    And we’ve come out whole  I attribute this to our actions and our comportment and to the   continued ability of the private sector to adapt and of private-sector producers and consumers to   mine resources worldwide and through cyberspace as they’ve done so effectively  I know we’re   doing a lot of work on that  It struck me particularly yesterday that we are not hearing anything   about pricing power at this table  That was our preoccupation for a while  Not one person at the   table mentioned it in the way it had been mentioned in the past several conversations  We are,   however, continuing to hear about the availability and the cost of labor, and some of those costs,   incidentally—such as the welders and Governor Kroszner’s show-up premium—are not going to   be reflected in the data   The bottom line is that I think we’ve made substantial progress  But I think we have to   be very mindful, Mr Chairman, about perception if we’re to influence what really counts, which   October 24-25, 2006 90 of 203    is inflationary expectations, and about whether those expectations are measured accurately by   TIPS spreads, which I personally doubt  One need look no further than this morning’s Financial   Times editorial or Bill Gross’s recent client letter—I’ve known Gross for twenty years, and I   know he’s an oddball  Actually, I’d like that word struck from the record [Laughter]    He’s increasingly addled, but his words do carry weight  In his recent   client letter, he says, “Inflation is leveling off at admittedly unacceptable levels”  Hence my   careful reference to the word “comportment”  I think first about the immediate statement, and I   want to come to that   I also think, by the way, of one thing we’ll get to this afternoon, which is the centennial    The transcripts of these meetings will be released as we approach the centennial, and I think we   have to make very clear that this FOMC, like previous ones, is extremely vigilant with regard to   the greatest threat to our society, which is inflation—at least to our economic society  We need   to issue a statement that makes it clear that we’re mindful of and remain vigilant about   inflationary risk  In Vince’s table, something between B and B+, as you laid it out yesterday   afternoon, would do the trick  By the way, I would tack on “to the upside” at the end of the first   sentence in that right-hand column B—it’s sort of a mix between B and B+—because we do   view inflationary risk as being to the upside  That’s an asymmetry   I want to make one other comment  Governor Warsh gave a very impressive briefing   yesterday on the financial market’s perspective, and we’ve heard from others that the equity   market’s robustness has given us something of a cushion with regard to the weakness in housing    Although many at the table do not seem to share the staff’s estimation of third-quarter growth—   we’ll find out on Friday—and to my mind, HSBC is the only securities house I’ve found that has   October 24-25, 2006 91 of 203    an analysis similar to yours, we have to be very careful in stating our views on growth  And this   comes around to Bill’s statement, I think, on the first rationale box of alternative B, because we   say that economic growth appears to have slowed further in Q3  I can accept that  But then we   say “going forward”—implying going forward from Q3—the economy seems likely to expand at   a moderate pace  So are we saying “moderate” from a very slow third quarter?  That’s not even   what the staff seems to be saying  That phraseology might spook the equity markets, which are   being driven, by the way, as I think any analyst would find out, not by top-line growth but by   earnings, by continued efficiencies in the cost of goods sold, and the management of cost of   goods sold and inventories  Again, we take comfort from the fact that we have a strong equities   market  So I’d like to suggest replacing the word “moderate” in section 2 of alternative B with   “improved”  I think it’s a small word change  “Going forward”—that’s going forward from the   third quarter—“the economy seems likely to expand at an improved pace”  That’s what we’re   saying, that’s what the staff is saying, that’s what we’re hearing around the table, and I think we   should say so  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Like you, I feel that we have some moderate but still substantial   inflationary impulses  What I’m concerned about is expectations    October 24-25, 2006 92 of 203     Do you want me to answer the question?     Yes, I do think we’ve had a moderation of inflation; however, I don’t   think it has come down to a level that we should be proud of    I do worry that, if we don’t get it down to a level that we should be proud   of, we will feed expectations that we don’t have the backbone to deal with what the market   expects us to deal with, which should, in my view, be our single purpose    Moderately?  [Laughter]    Mr Chairman, I’d like to just go back and endorse Governor Kohn’s   recommendation  I was worried about the numerator/denominator relationship  If the reference to   October 24-25, 2006 120 of 203    “moderate” as defined and clarified by Vince keys off the third quarter, then I’m concerned  If,   however, we take the phraseology that Governor Kohn suggested, I think it would be acceptable    Well, I don’t have any written material prepared, Mr Chairman—just   notes I’ve taken, in part because I confess that before this conversation I was somewhat   nonplussed about this issue  That is, I’m a little perplexed about why we’re talking about it now,   given what many commentators have said about where we are presently  We have achieved   significant credibility with the previous two Chairmen of the Committee and you and with the   actions of the Committee  I have been asking my own staff in Dallas to give me the compelling   reason to do this now   I’ve heard four compelling arguments, or arguments that at least purport to be   compelling, during this discussion  One is that it will improve the policymaking process and   focus, although I think President Minehan properly expressed some skepticism as to whether it   would actually change the focus, intensity, and process that we have had  The second is that it   would coordinate and better anchor public expectations  Governor Mishkin, with great   enthusiasm by the way, made that argument  His remarks were not only insightful, but they were   also charming  [Laughter]  The third is that it would plant our current legacy; I think Governor   October 24-25, 2006 179 of 203    Kohn touched on one of those sensitive nerves  The fourth is a subset of the third point  the   political risk of loss of a Chairman with willpower   I won’t go into all the aspects of this that I have concerns about  But I don’t want to bat   away President Moskow like a mosquito here  I think he made an important point, which was   summarized by President Pianalto, who drew on her ancestry with the term “festina lente,” which   means “make haste slowly”  That’s why I would like to suggest in one dimension only—rather   than discuss what everybody else has already talked about  the political dimension of what we   are discussing  I see an explicit numerical target as extremely risky politically unless we manage   it carefully, and I would just ask all of us to bear in mind what those political risks are   We do have a dual mandate  I agree with those who have said that we do not want to run   the risk of changing our current charge from the Congress  As I listened to Governor Mishkin—  again, I found his arguments remarkably brilliant and persuasive—I was thinking to myself that I   would love to be in a room with you and hear you use those brilliant arguments with, say, a   Senate Majority Leader like Harry Reid, or a Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee like   Charlie Rangel, or a Chairman of the Financial Services Committee like Barney Frank  We have   to be careful of the risk that either you then have them say, “That’s fine, but tell me what your   employment target is because you have a dual mandate” or you end up negotiating an inflation   target higher than you want it to be  I happen to know those three men very well  I have   appeared before them—I think President Moskow and I along with President Yellen have   probably appeared before the Congress more than anybody else at this table, individually and   certainly collectively, and I can imagine that conversation taking place     So I would proceed slowly, or hasten slowly, not just in the analytical aspect of this but   also in explaining why we want to tie ourselves to this mast  Is it that we are afraid of the siren   October 24-25, 2006 180 of 203    call of the lack of discipline because we don’t think we can bring about the discipline that’s   required?  We need to consider that there are political aspects of this in light of which we may   not even want to open that Pandora’s Box  That’s the only advice I would give or comment I   would make at this juncture, Mr Chairman  Thank you   Oh, let me make one other comment  I keep hearing about Larry Meyer’s poll  We have   a dean of a business school; I’m an MBA; and we have other MBAs around the table    Uncertainty is the enemy of decisionmaking  Of course they want more frequent forecasts    Governor Kohn and I talked about this before  They want a full frontal view  I find a full frontal   view most unbecoming  [Laughter] Thank you, Mr Chairman    "
8039,2006-12-12,"  Dino, you mentioned last year’s rise in the euro—the soft dollar against   the euro and other currencies  Is there a December effect, and if there is, what causes it?     Thank you     David, with all the problems that labor indicators provide us, one striking   thing in the recent report is that the service sector is what pulled the fat out of the fire  If my   memory is correct, 83 percent of our employment is now in the service sector, over 70 percent of   our output, and perhaps a greater percentage of value added  If you look at the numbers, there are,   for example, more health care workers than manufacturing workers  There are perhaps as many in   the entertainment/restaurant sector as in the manufacturing sector  So here’s the question  Have we   been able to identify any service sector subsectors that can be useful as indicators of turning points   in the business cycle, as we often point to autos and durable goods?  As we move up the value-  added ladder through the service-sector-driven economy, the numbers are so big  It does concern   me that we constantly refer to the old cyclical indicators, which are no doubt very important, but   I’m wondering if we have been able to identify some subsectors in the service area that indicate   turning points in the business cycle    Could I ask just a quick second question, which is totally different?  I think I   read a statement that we were getting diminishing returns on the previous tightening initiatives we   took, but I may have read that incorrectly  Is that correct—now that we have a sense of the lag that   we talked about before?  Are we running the course of our previous tightening measures, which are   having less effect on the economy?    So they are still having effect  Thank you    Mr Chairman, at the last meeting I provided anecdotal evidence, as I always   do after my survey of CEOs and CFOs, of a slowdown for some sectors  I spoke of housing, which   I’ve been a bit more concerned about to date than even our models have indicated  I referred to   slowing trucking activity for the Christmas season, and I reported that the book-to-bill ratio for   semiconductors, although that is highly volatile, slipped below 1 for the first time in quite some   time  I also cited the aggressive consumer-product advertising as we approach year-end, which is   occurring rather early  I concluded that, in netting those reports against the activity of the rails, the   shipping companies, and other service-sector activity, growth in the third quarter seemed to have   proceeded at a pace slightly north of 2 percent, or at least at a run rate about in that region  Then   inflation measured by the trimmed mean, which as you know is how we like to look at things at the   Dallas Federal Reserve Bank, though dipping in September was still hovering in the high 2s as   measured over the three-month and twelve-month intervals  I expressed that, going forward, the   balance seemed to be skewed more toward the inflation side than toward substandard growth   I would agree with President Yellen and President Moskow, if I heard them correctly, that   basically the tails have gotten a little fatter—that is, we’re concerned that there might be slightly less   growth, but at the same time we still have concerns about inflation  So I’d like to address the two   very briefly  On the inflation front, in October the trimmed mean bounced back to 26 percent from   the 16 percent that we had in September, driven upward, as David mentioned, by accelerating   medical care prices and a pickup in owners’ equivalent rent, although that was somewhat slight    The median PCE inflation rate was 4 percent  Of concern to me is that, although the percentage of   goods with rising prices fell, the percentage with more-rapid increases rose and components with a   December 12, 2006 30 of 134         rise of over 5 percent have gone from 16 percent to 30 percent of the components measured overall   in October   With regard to economic activity, I think there are some continued negatives and some   positives  I’d like to pick up on the negatives that I mentioned at the last meeting  The airlines that   I discussed are reporting even more aggressive discounting  One of my contacts, who I think is the   longest serving and most successful CEO in the airline industry, said this is the most aggressive   discounting that he remembers  Of course, we’ve all seen Wal-Mart’s numbers  There is difficulty   in sorting through what is of their own making in terms of their branding and what is the overall   slowdown in activity  But the truckers to whom I have been talking are still not noticing the pickup   in the Christmas activity that they expected, Mr Chairman  Other retailers, too, are reporting some   softness  There is some discussion of whether or not it makes a difference that we have one extra   day in the retailing season for Christmas this year  The Thanksgiving surge that they expected in   sales clearly did not occur in almost every category of income except for the very highest  The   semiconductor producers are reporting a “grim” outlook in terms of their book-to-bill ratios and   what they’re selling forward  I have just one other comment on energy  Perhaps the largest   operator for the OPEC countries points out that they have realized 60 percent of their announced   cuts—that’s a typical ratio  Al-Naimi, who is the Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources of   Saudi Arabia, is pressing for another million barrel cut, presumably to bring the total cut up to the   12 million barrels that were being targeted  So the negatives seem to still be in place   As far as the positives are concerned, at least at the margin, I’d like to report on a few of   them  One is that convenience store operators are reporting a little turn-up in volume and finally   seeing the effect of lower gas prices at the pump, and retailers in the past week have noticed a slight   pickup from what they were reporting at the end of the November holiday season  With regard to   December 12, 2006 31 of 134         housing, as you know, I speak to two of the five largest builders, and I’ve added a third to that   sample  David, they are reporting what they call a sense of a turn, but this may be their perpetual   optimism  But cancellation rates have improved from 40 percent to 32 percent according to the   reports, and actually in November there was a gross pickup in unit sales of about 3 percent   according to these reports  So they are feeling that some pent-up demand is building  The   interesting thing about that industry in particular is that they are all walking away from their options    One of the largest said that they expect to end up with only 20 percent of their land options, and yet   land prices have not yet fallen  So I think that’s the next shoe that will likely drop   Other than housing, in surveying the twenty-six CEOs and three CFOs to whom I speak, I   hear no report of consumer or client payment problems or lagging payments, which is often an   indicator, on a serial basis, that there is weakness ensuing  Again, going back to one of my favorite   indicators, which is a large express shipper, my contact said, “I don’t feel any real changes from   what we saw in the last four to five months”  That large express shipper is looking at GDP growth   of about 2 percent or slightly north of 2 percent  Also, I like to look at restaurants because they   employ perhaps up to 14 million people, so it’s not an unimportant sector  For the twenty-five   companies in the casual dining sector, sales have declined  At the same time, their guest count has   gone down even further, which indicates what we expected before—if you’ll forgive the pun—a   move down the food chain from restaurants like Chili’s to McDonald’s and so on  This is what you   would expect in terms of continued tightness, and yet they are beginning to sense a slight turn   because gas prices at the pump may be kicking in   Finally, I want to touch on some negatives disguised as positives  The first is the ready   availability of capital  I think Dino was very good in his presentation this morning, as he always is    One CEO of a company in the service sector, largely in the entertainment business, does not see   December 12, 2006 32 of 134         much slowing taking place  He said that the availability of capital is like “dog droppings in Central   Park”—no matter where you step, capital is readily available  To an old pension fund manager like   me that indicates a potential trip wire, which is what Dino said  So I think risk is certainly there    Another negative disguised as a positive would be the robust activity we’re still seeing in the energy   sector, although I would summarize it by saying that the foot has been taken off the accelerator  We   haven’t stopped  There’s a bit less rig count in the mix, and yet there’s still a great deal of   construction activity, as we find that the petrochemicals are improving their refining capacity and   meeting modern standards, and there are huge numbers of coal gasification projects, not just in   Texas utilities but also elsewhere in the country   Mr Chairman, the labor shortage in the Gulf—the Golden Coast, as we call it—is   significant  One oil company alone estimates that, for petrochemical purposes, they are at least   20,000 workers short  The mayor of Texas City, which has the highest concentration of   petrochemical plants in the country in his district, called a meeting of all the labor unions last   month  The mayor, who sits on our board, said that the unions report that they cannot find workers    If TXU proceeds with the coal gasification plants, they’re looking at 5 million manhours per project,   and they have ten projects on the board, assuming that they’re approved  The point is that we do   still see a significant shortage of skilled and semi-skilled labor  So as you depart for China, Mr   Chairman, having spoken about the two fat tails, I would urge you to be careful of any Fu dogs with   two tails  [Laughter]    Mr Chairman, I spoke of my concern about the fattening of the tail in   economic weakness and my continuing concern about the already fat tail of inflationary pressure    However, if I come around to the view of the staff and the view that seems to be expressed by   many at this table—that growth is likely to return to its long-term potential in the forecast period,   December 12, 2006 92 of 134         inflation risks remain either at elevated levels or at less-elevated levels, and liquidity is   somewhere in the range between healthy and ubiquitous [laughter]—then the first thing I do is   decide that I wouldn’t want to increase rates but I also wouldn’t want to decrease them    The question is how we express ourselves  Like President Hoenig—I don’t want to take   words out of his mouth—I’d be happy if we just included the opening policy decision and then   the assessment-of-risk statement and took out much of the verbiage we have as a sort of   Christmas surprise to the market, since they don’t expect a whole lot  But I know that’s not a   serious proposal  Therefore, I come down on the side of alternative B, as amended by the   Christmas colors  I’d take out the words “than anticipated”—I think President Minehan has a   very good point—and the duplication of the word “pace” that you pointed out  I worry, because   I cannot make an argument for decreasing the rate, about being careful that we don’t signal to the   market that we might be tending in that direction  Although I think alternative A not   inaccurately expresses what’s been said at this table, I worry that it may be sending the wrong   signal  Therefore, I come down on the side, as President Hoenig does, of alternative B as   amended by Cathy and the suggestion in the Christmas colors, even though I think the verbiage   is excessive  I know that sounds odd coming from a Texan      Just very quickly, I think what’s clear from this discussion is that, in dealing   with the issue of inflation targeting, there’s no need to be on the offensive  The issue is how we   handle the defensive—and I think Vice Chairman Geithner’s point is correct—if we talk about the   ends and desires of monetary policy rather than getting into the means  As you know, Mr   Chairman, after the last discussion I was very worried about what was sent around in the first draft   of the minutes—I think President Minehan was as well—even about what we ended up saying in   the minutes  So, again, my view is that the less said, the better  If we are on the defensive, I would   urge everybody just to stress the fact that the topic is under discussion and no decision has been   made and try to make it as simple and as quick as possible  "
8066,2007-01-30,"  You have to put your head down, Bill  [Laughter]     Bill, if you talk to the producers and the refiners—you’ll find out that I   like to do that kind of thing—there has been some concern, although one can’t measure it with   any precision, that the so-called city refiners in London or on Wall Street, meaning the   speculators, do affect prices  We have had some discussions with your predecessor, but I’m   curious as to what your views on that phenomenon are     But we’re still working on it     Just to follow up on your point and go to exhibit 12, about foreign GDP   growth rates, which Joe talked about  In terms of any pressures on unit labor costs that you see   developing, I didn’t quite catch your statement, or I may have misinterpreted it, but basically I   thought I heard that these growth rates are not likely to lead the inflationary pressures     So I would be curious as to what your observation is in terms of trend unit   labor costs in our important trading partners   January 30-31, 2007 23 of 255      So it’s a gap analysis     Thank you       Well, Mr Chairman, first on our cheaper, more affordable, and perhaps   luckier Eleventh District economy, we estimate that employment growth ran at a rate slightly   January 30-31, 2007 45 of 255    greater than 32 percent last year and our output growth exceeded 4 percent  We do see some   possible slowing, but there is still very strong momentum in the Texas economy and to an extent in   the New Mexican economy, despite a lower rig count   What I’m about to talk about is not based on the buoyancy of the Eleventh District economy   but on my talking with CEOs as well as the economic projections of our own staff  I’ve talked with   twenty-five CEOs for today’s discussion  I’ve added two, and just for the record they are the CEO   of Disney and the CEO of MasterCard   First, my retail contacts, with one exception, report a pickup in dollar volume and foot   traffic that began with the second half of December and has continued  As a result, the Wal-Mart   CEO for the United States is much more optimistic and is now forecasting volume expansion of   about 2 to 3 percent  My contact from JCPenney, which is in an income range that is double that of   Wal-Mart, reports a similar pattern of behavior that started the Friday before Christmas and has   carried forward and says that the consumers “feel good about the economy”  The one exception,   incidentally, is 7-Eleven, and I would be upset, too  Tobacco constitutes 30 percent of their sales,   and Texas just levied a $10 tax on a $30 carton of cigarettes  Otherwise, the retailers seem to be   much more optimistic than they were when I last reported  A not unimportant factor in this report   has to do with the phenomenon of gift cards  In the public release of Safeway is an interesting piece   of data  Their gift card business, which is called Blackhawk, grew 100 percent last year and   dropped $100 million to the pretax bottom line  Wal-Mart reports—and this is not yet public   information—a peak gift-card balance for this season of $12 billion  Now, mind you, 70 percent of   the card use occurs before February 1  So this business has extended the retail season, and it may   well have affected the buoyancy that I’m hearing from retailers in terms of their current activity    MasterCard confirms the pickup in consumer activity, particularly that it began late in the Christmas   January 30-31, 2007 46 of 255    season, and its CEO reports from his contacts certainly much less “noise” about a possible recession   and sees that risk abating  Just to jump forward, we forecast, based on economic research,   economic growth in our District of 27 percent for 2007, which is what MasterCard happens to be   projecting—so I found that CEO to be instantly credible  Disney reports extremely strong   advertising growth  They expect the year-over-year growth to be 20 percent in terms of their first-  quarter network advertising, with strength in every sector except for autos, according to the CEO    They also report record foot traffic at their parks over the holidays  In contrast, UPS reports a weak   start to December but a strong finish in the last seven days of the year, with year-over-year numbers   for January not as robust as expected—running around 1 percent  The rails also report a bit slower   volume, as the CEO of one of the large rail companies said  There are clearly shifts taking place    For example, lumber shipments of Union Pacific and Burlington Northern are down 25 percent year   over year, reflecting the falloff in the construction of homes  Both CEOs caution that company   year-over-year numbers are like comparing apples and oranges, given the robust growth in the first   quarter of 2006  I did talk to two of the top five housing CEOs and a third one, a smaller company    They seem to confirm the sense of the staff in that they feel that the housing situation is bottoming   out, but they continue to caution that any reading of the housing industry between Thanksgiving and   the Super Bowl is of questionable value    Yes  But here are some data to put this statement in perspective  The   contact from the largest company reports that cancellation rates, which were running at 50 percent   in their most stressed markets, particularly in California and Florida, have come back to 20 to   25 percent—relatively good news  One aspect worth noting is that they are getting relief from their   subcontractors—they estimate, on average across the industry, about 10 percent cost relief  Another   January 30-31, 2007 47 of 255    predictable behavior pattern becoming manifest is that the large contractors with very strong   balance sheets are looking to buy the distressed smaller contractors  David, I agree with you that we   haven’t seen all the downturn in housing yet in terms of its effect on the economy, but we may well   come out of it with an even more tightly consolidated industry  The bottom line on growth from the   Eleventh District perspective is a Wagnerian summation—that is, the economy’s growth dynamic is   not as bad as we thought it was sounding when we last read the score  I would summarize it by   saying that the tail in terms of the risk of recession has become much slimmer     However, my conclusion is the opposite with regard to inflation—that is, on reflection and   working with our staff and listening to CEOs, I think the tail in terms of risk of higher inflation has   fattened, and this is reflected in several reports  Just very quickly—because of my Australian   DNA—Anheuser-Busch decided to raise beer prices 2 to 3 percent at year-end  That doesn’t bother   me  What bothers me is the price of skilled workers who drink that good beer in terms of what’s   happening for wages and total compensation of skilled and unskilled labor  You know that I have   talked about the massive projects that Texas Utility plans for coal to gas conversion and whether   they get the so-called Dirty Dozen that they’re planning or just a handful  I did go over with the   CEO the studies that McKinsey, BCG, and Bechtel have provided for them, and some interesting   data points came out that I want to summarize  In the summer of ’05, they estimated that all-in   labor costs for these plants, which they estimated per plant, would take 46 million worker hours at   $3625 an hour  Today they don’t believe they can get the job done for less than $44 an hour; and   because of worker quality issues, they now believe it will take 52 million worker hours for each   plant  So if you have a 21 percent per hour increase and a 13 percent increase in hours, one   wonders about the ability to see a short-term reduction in skilled and unskilled labor costs  These   numbers, by the way, take into account the recent slippage in oil rig activity, which is down for the   January 30-31, 2007 48 of 255    fifth straight week, and also the slowdown in housing and some initial slowdown in commercial   construction  It dovetails with reports like that of BP’s to us that they decided to pay all their   salaried operators, to whom only two years ago they were offering incentive packages to leave,   $25,000 bonuses per year for the next two years to stay  Fluor’s CEO reports that they are having   the largest year in their history of hiring college graduates, and the 900 mechanics who work for a   large truck dealer with which I regularly talk are now fetching $35 an hour   Another piece of data comes from a study by McKinsey and BCG, and I want to talk about   it very briefly in terms of the intermodal transportation system of our country  The shippers tell me   that port congestion is very high  The fleet utilization rate is running at about 95 percent  You   know that I like to talk about Panamax ship rates because of their size and liquidity  Prices have not   eased since we last met, and the interesting factoid is that the ten-year-old fleet is available for   purchase at the same price as the fleet expected to be delivered two and a half years from now    These ships run $39 million apiece before their add-ons, which tells you that there’s a short-term   tightness  If you talk to the rails and the effective two operators—there’s really a duopoly in this   country between Burlington Northern and Union Pacific—their pricing is based on opportunity   costs because they do not foresee the ability to expand their networks  This may well facilitate an   upward price spiral as all the infrastructure projects currently on the drawing boards begin, whether   TXU’s or some other liquefied natural gas companies’ projects that we have heard about   A couple of other points with regard to inflation that I think bear watching  These inputs are   anecdotal, but I think we have a pretty good survey in terms of the oil and gas operators  Most of   the major oil and gas operators would not be surprised to see $40 oil and to see a range between $40   and $60 oil—that fits with the Brown-Yücel model that we developed in Dallas—and for natural   gas prices to ease to a level of about $5 in the spring  That’s the good news   January 30-31, 2007 49 of 255    I want to mention two other negative news items  One was referred to earlier, and that   regards corn prices  The price for corn was $230 a bushel last year, if you looked on the graph that   Bill, I think, presented earlier  Corn is now running $400 a bushel, and the food production   companies we talked to project the price to be $500 by the end of the year  Now, this is good for   farmers  It’s good for John Deere  It’s not good if you raise a chicken, a cow, or a pig, and it’s   certainly not good if you’re a human who eats at Whataburger, one of my other new contacts  I   won’t use the language that the CEO used, but he reports that his margins are coming under   pressure   The second development may be a bit more disturbing; it concerns the cost of imported   goods from China into Wal-Mart’s network  According to Wal-Mart’s CEO for international   operations and their vice chairman, Chinese import prices into Wal-Mart’s network were   depreciating at an annual rate of between 2 and 5 percent  Recently, however, the rise in China’s   labor costs for their suppliers net of the increase in productivity is leading to import price costs that   are increasing at a rate of approximately 1 percent  To me this development raises an issue that I   think President Moskow touched on regarding our views on inflation and perhaps rates going   forward, which we’ll talk about tomorrow  At home, we’re seeing unacceptably high and sustained   wage developments for certain critical components of labor, which I mentioned earlier  Abroad   from Germany to China, we’re seeing economic growth rates that are well above sustainable trends,   which is why I asked the question about your gap analysis earlier  My own staff calculates that, if   you do a gap analysis—that is, if you compare current growth to what they estimate trend growth to   be—there is no significant inflationary pressure  However, if you analyze capacity utilization rates   in the G7 countries and in the BRICs, we are getting closer, given the economic growth that has   been experienced, to more heavily used capacity and to igniting inflationary pressures   The bottom   January 30-31, 2007 50 of 255    line for inflation from our perspective is that what was once a tailwind generated by globalization   may be closer to becoming a headwind than our models indicate and our limited understanding of   the effect of globalization otherwise leads us to understand  Thank you, Mr Chairman    It appears to be slowing in certain areas and in our District but is nonetheless   running at a stout rate  It seems to have come off somewhat but, given the large projects that are   planned, the numbers work out to show increasing pressure on the labor that’s available to construct   those projects    Mr Chairman, I was a bit loquacious yesterday and apparently, for some,   too anecdotally explicit, if not excessive  [Laughter]  So I’ll be less frisky this morning, shorter,   and more to the point  I support alternative B  I don’t want to wordsmith it  The only word I   would want to add, which I won’t get, is “worldwide,” which I would insert after “resource   utilization”  That’s a reality, and that’s my recommendation, Mr Chairman  Thank you  I’m   sorry if I took too much time       Mr Chairman, I think we have to do this against the background of what we   said the last time  If you go back to section 2 from December, we were cautious about growth  In   section 2 under alternative B now, we’re basically saying that we are seeing firmer economic   growth  I don’t want to overdo this, and I think Vice Chairman Geithner’s point is absolutely   correct here  Let’s think of where we’re coming from and indicate the reality of what we’ve talked   about  We are concerned about inflation  Using the word “predominant” excessively emphasizes   our concern  At some point we may need to tighten, but let’s think of this as the migration from   where we were in December  I think the migration is adequately captured in the language that we   have in alternative B    May I ask one question of Brian?    Brian, on your exhibit 4, you point out that there’s no econometric evidence   that publishing forecasts—these improved methodologies—has actually had an effect from an   econometric standpoint  But you make the statement that observers agree that forecasts have   improved communications and accountability, which is a more subjective statement  Who are the   observers?    How do we measure “improved communications and accountability”?  It   seems to be very subjective    Finally, I am just not as familiar as the rest of the FOMC is, but do any of   these banks have a dual mandate stated like our dual mandate?    But currently it’s the Norges Bank    Thank you    Always charming    Mr Chairman, we talked briefly about the Norges Bank and Norway, which   is a country of 46 million people, a constitutional monarchy, and my mother’s homeland  My   mother taught me a wonderful phrase, which I want to repeat here as an antecedent to this   discussion  It’s actually a quote from Santayana  Skepticism, like chastity, should not be   relinquished too readily  [Laughter]  I admit to being quite skeptical about this exercise, and I will   reveal my cards up front in terms of being sensitive to the arguments that President Minehan and   President Poole have made as to the predicate question, which is, Is there a compelling reason to do   this?  Not only is the discussion charming, but I am almost overwhelmed by the encyclopedic   knowledge of some of my colleagues  I don’t possess that knowledge, and I listen to it very, very   carefully  But I have not yet heard a satisfactory answer  Yes, we have had an evolutionary process   over thirty years, but is there a compelling reason to change the way we do our business?   If you go back to David’s exhibit 1, it says that we presumably would undertake this effort   with an eye toward “advancing the goals of economic performance, public discourse, internal   discourse, and efficient operations”  I think of this in a broader context, which is maintaining and   building or, using President Lacker’s word, enhancing the public’s faith and confidence in the   January 30-31, 2007 170 of 255    Federal Reserve, and I think the faith and confidence in the Federal Reserve right now is pretty   high  Now, two words are being thrown around constantly in this discussion  One is the “public,”   and the other is the “markets”  By the way, I’m not going to get to the eight questions—I want you   to be relieved right up front  [Laughter]  I can’t get there yet because I haven’t answered the   predicate question  But I would ask the Committee to consider what “the public” is and what “the   markets” are  Governor Kohn said something during our discussion of policy with regard to the   market operators—I actually spent three-quarters of my life being one of them—that I thought was   quite complimentary and summarized the current state  He said that nothing we have been saying is   getting in the way of the stabilizing properties of the market  I really like that  So my question is,   What is wrong with the way we’re doing things if we’re not getting in the way of the stabilizing   properties of the market?  I agree with Cathy’s point that, with regard to the market, our actions   speak louder than our words  Day to day there may be variance, but in the long term that’s what   counts  I believe that the markets may have had a difference of view, they may have been testing   us, but they’ve come around, and our actions have spoken much louder than our words   If the definition of “public” is the academic community, I understand their insatiable   appetites in the pursuit of knowledge  I respect that, but I think there may be other ways of assisting   that pursuit of knowledge than by increasing the frequency of our forecasts or the complexity of our   forecasts  I want to apologize to my friend from Philadelphia in advance, but are we talking about   those who operate the economy—the women and men who run the businesses that create the   microeconomy (and many micros make the macro), whether they are $2 million businesses or big   businesses?  I went back and counted  Since I had the good fortune of coming on this Committee, I   have spoken on 236 occasions to managers of big and small operations—CEOs mostly, some   CFOs  Not once have I been asked by them for more-frequent forecasts or for all the variables that   January 30-31, 2007 171 of 255    we consider or anything that projects the kind of complexity that we’ve been talking about today at   this table  I’m a former Rotarian  I may be one of the few here  I speak to Rotary Clubs all the   time  The only question they want to know is where rates are going to go  [Laughter]  I don’t think   they care one whit about the complexity of our forecast models   But that’s not the group I’m worried about in terms of the public  President Poole raised an   excellent point, which is that we do have to be mindful of the elected representatives of the people   who created our charter and who in the end we all serve, and that’s the politicians  I would just ask   you to consider the argument that we’re having against that background and the risks that it poses    This is a one-way street  We see this from the excellent work that the staff did  There’s no going   back once you go down this path  Vince mentioned our semiannual schedule set by the Congress    Need we do more?  Have they asked us to do more?  Should we do more before they ask us to do   more?  Shouldn’t we think of this in terms of negotiating with the political class rather than giving   them something for which they may not even be asking  If we give it to them, it may lead to still   more questions that we cannot satisfactorily answer  So I would beg the Committee to consider   what we’re talking about when we’re talking about the public and the markets and whether this is a   compelling thing that needs to be done now   I’d like to emphasize a second thing  Obviously, being a Bank president, I do not wish to be   party to anything that emasculates the Banks  Indeed, whatever we do and however we do it, if we   do it—and I’m not convinced that we should—we need to respect the Banks not only for their   research capacity and the diversity of views and, what Governor Mishkin and President Yellen   correctly mentioned, their geographic diversity but also as vital links to the public, whether the   public is the elected leaders, the Rotarians, the economic operators, the financial markets, or even   the academics   January 30-31, 2007 172 of 255    A third point, and then I’ll stop, is that I ask that we be practical in the way that we do this    President Minehan mentioned that we do a lot  I have no doubt that we could do more, but we have   constraints on our time  In being practical, we also have to be wary of what other questions we raise   by providing more information  Some elements may not be interested in our preserving our   independence or may be a threat to our independence—I won’t mention who those might be since I   don’t want that on the record  Mr Chairman, those are my three concerns, and I’ll spare you my   answers to the eight questions, which I hope I’ll have a chance to give at a later date    Mr Chairman, I thank you, and my mother thanks you, for addressing the   skepticism issue  May I just add one other thing?  You were very polite at the beginning of this   conversation, but I’d like to reinforce what I interpret you as having said  The article from the   New York Times a couple of days ago really bothered me  Since we’re talking about proceeding   slowly and deliberately and several people have used the term “dry run”—which is very, very   important and I fully endorse—I hope that no one forms or advances the discussion by having a   public revelation of what took place at this table  May I suggest, since you constantly see certain   people who are not on this Committee referred to, that we be very careful in what we share with   those people because they are reference points  Some of them are friends of many people at this   table, but it appears to me that this does nothing but truncate the discussion or risks doing so and   has outsiders raising questions that we really don’t want to answer right now  Thank you, Mr   Chairman   "
8092,2007-03-20,"  Bill, you talked about subprime mortgages in some detail but not about alt-A   mortgages in great detail  My understanding is, and I just want to check to see whether I’m correct,   that 20 percent of the 2006 purchase-dollar originations were alt-A, roughly the same percentage as   subprime  It’s my further understanding that 81 percent of the alt-A originations were no-  March 20-21, 2007 7 of 196    documentation or low-documentation loans  How much confidence do you have—and I can tell by   your reaction that there’s a question—that alt-A mortgages are not as perilous as subprimes?  If you   don’t have confidence or if they are perilous, what consequences might ensue?    May I ask of Bill, Mr Chairman, that we continue the analysis on this front   and keep probing?    Thank you    Just for clarification, David, from peak to trough in terms of housing   starts, what percent change in construction do you forecast?    So 21 million, is that right?     Mr Chairman, I was reminded the other day that the original story of   Goldilocks was not quite as we later came to learn it  The first version that was drafted was   actually called Silver Hair  When the three bears came back to the house, the elderly lady, not   the little girl, jumped out the window  That was the beginning of the Goldilocks story, which   was later adapted to a more palatable commercial story  [Laughter]  I’m not ready to jump out   the window yet, but I do have some concerns, and I’d like to talk about three areas—the   international side, where the porridge seems to be hot; the domestic economy, where it seems to   be cooling; and in my District, where it seems to be just about right   So, first, on the international side, just to complement some of Karen’s points, our   research and anecdotal findings show that global capacity utilization has moved to the higher end   of its range  World unemployment rates have been falling  Capacity expansion seems to be   underpaced, even though there is some structural change in utilization, and it seems insufficient   to meet demand or quell inflation  Prices for imported US goods have clearly moved away   from deflationary trends to neutral or slightly inflationary, as I reported before—and, by the way,   across nearly all product categories  The growing tightness in the market for skilled foreign   labor may be the contributing factor  A very large foreign retailer operating in China reports that   they are seeing wage price inflation for the first time in the stores that they are opening and   operating  As one of the high-tech CEOs mentioned to me earlier, even the Indians that they   now import, not by bringing them physically across but by fiber optic cable, are being priced   much more expensively  If you add turnover, these workers have become increasingly   March 20-21, 2007 36 of 196    expensive  We see pressure from the shippers, noting that there are continued upward pressures   on fleet utilization, spot prices, and port congestion  Airlines are reporting stronger international   loads and price traction than in the United States  Express shippers and logistic companies are   reporting double-digit growth in the year to date in Europe and still higher rates of growth in   Asia  So, on balance, our view from the Dallas Fed from the international perspective is that   international data and anecdotal evidence point to some excess demand outside the United States   with concomitant increases in price pressures   Turning to the domestic scene, we appear to be sailing between the Charybdis of a   slowdown in the economy and the Scylla of higher inflation  I want to talk about both  We’re   both measuring and hearing of greater fragility in the domestic economy relating to economic   growth and the kind of excess that is leading to the financial turbulence that Janet spoke about    I’ll turn to that in a second  Also, we’re not encouraged, despite our wishful thinking, on the   inflationary front  Let me just give you some points other than those that have already been   mentioned, particularly other than capital spending, which we see slowing across the nation    Express shippers, logistic companies, report 02 percent growth year over year for domestic   ground operations and weaker-than-expected overall growth, between 0 and 05 percent on   balance in the year to date—substantially less than they expected  Rail car loadings are flat to   down, reflecting the decline in demand for materials for housing and a decline in durable goods   orders  Truck tonnage is off, and orders for replacement of fleets seem to be reflecting more   than the effect of these new engine regulations that are going into place  I’ll give you one data   point mentioned  Peterbilt’s order book is one-third of what it was last year  Airlines report   weaker domestic booking and slackening demand relative to last year  With regard to the   retailers, I have been urged to be cautious in analyzing the data, first because last year was in   March 20-21, 2007 37 of 196    essence a fifty-three-week year because of the late holiday or a thirteen-month year due to gift   cards  Our contacts report continued strength for high-end retailers, 3 to 6 percent unit growth in   the first quarter for middle retailers like Kohl’s and JCPenney, and significantly lower growth   rates with companies like Wal-Mart praying that the advancement of daylight savings time will   lift them from flat growth to 1 to 2 percent comps  Finally, restaurants report continued   movement down the food chain—no pun intended—[laughter] from the middle-income eateries   to the McDonald’s of the world  If you notice McDonald’s reports, they are quite stout, whereas   the middle-income eateries are suffering  In short, we expect slower top-line growth across the   board     I want to talk for a minute about housing  One of my contacts at Wal-Mart mentioned   that, when they recently surveyed their customers, concerns about housing did not even rank in   the top ten of consumers’ concerns  Despite that, a large housebuilder, whom I mentioned in   previous conversations around this table, says that they have gone from monsoons to scattered   thunderstorms, and another reports a decline in the need to grant concessions  Yet both are   concerned about subprime and alt-A “infection,” as one called it  Going back to our previous   conversation, one of the builders, whose average home price exceeds $300,000, has through   thorough analysis just discovered that 40 percent of last year’s builds were financed by alt-A   mortgages  If you look at the security analysis for that particular company, the best guesstimate   is 20 percent  So, being from the Clinton Administration, I’m a bit worried; I’m getting to the   point where “don’t ask, don’t tell” may be the best approach to interviewing some of these   homebuilders  Clearly, they are concerned  They have an overstock of inventory, and they’re   beginning to cut back significantly on activity  If you remember, David, originally I did talk   March 20-21, 2007 38 of 196    about a 25 percent peak-to-trough correction when you were not quite at that number  Now I’ve   caught up with you  I’m at 40 percent at a minimum and quite concerned about it   I’m also concerned about what President Yellen referred to as a possibility for a   retrenchment in the credit markets  I point, as others have done, to the significant oversupply of   private-equity capital  To give you a specific example, in the case of Texas Utilities, between a   Friday and a Wednesday, the two principal investors lined up $25 billion apiece, another billion   from five other equity investors, and in the end over $50 billion of committed capital from the   banks in a two-day lineup period, only half of which was used  So, Mr Chairman, in short, in   the domestic economy, I’m concerned that the tail in terms of a recession has not become   slimmer as I mentioned last time  I would redact those words  I believe it has become fatter, and   I believe that financial market turbulence has a potential to become greater   As to the Scylla of inflation, I keep telling myself, David, that with the passage of time   we’ll see improvement, that one month’s set of numbers such as we had in December does not a   trend make  I tell myself that two months’ numbers, like those we saw in December and   January, do not a trend make  But the numbers are less than comforting  On a six-month basis   through January, both our trimmed mean at the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank and your PCE   excluding food and energy are stuck at 21 percent  On a twelve-month basis, the trimmed mean   was stuck at 25 percent, and your PCE excluding food and energy was 23 percent  The recent   CPI report was hardly encouraging  Sixty-eight percent of the components rose 3 percent or   more  To be sure, there are tamer OER readings, but they’re being offset by a pickup in core   goods inflation  I continue to worry about the political effect of this kind of inflationary run  I   note yesterday’s headline in the Christian Science Monitor stating that “inflation is eating up   US wage gains”   March 20-21, 2007 39 of 196    On the regional side, what I’ve reported above is reflected to some extent in the Eleventh   District  Growth has slowed, but housing prices are stable, and housing inventories are thus far   healthy  Yet we continue to experience significant wage price pressures  Our dynamics are   much stronger than those of the rest of the nation  One of the credit card companies reports that   sales using their cards in our region were up 105 percent year over year through February,   versus 1 to 4 percent on the eastern and western seaboards     In short, Mr Chairman, I see geographic dispersion in the growth patterns—strong   growth overseas, relatively strong growth in our District, and a developing worrisome growth   scenario for the rest of the United States  We see less abatement of inflation than we had hoped   for  With regard to preparing for tomorrow’s discussion about what to do about it, I find myself   on the horns of a dilemma  I would say that the risks are more evenly balanced, and yet the tail   of less growth and the risk of recession and the other tail of awfully stubborn inflation have   fattened and not trimmed  Thank you    Well, Mr Chairman, yesterday I indicated concern for the downside, even   though I come from a District that is running a pretty warm economy  My soundings with   business leaders and my interpretation of what I heard around the table yesterday lead me to   conclude that we are perhaps one revision or one shock, including possibly a financial market   shock or a credit crunch shock, away from a recession  I’m in favor of alternative B  I’m still   concerned about inflationary pressures  I’m impressed by Tom Hoenig’s arguments on how   powerful ethanol and other forces are in our society, but I think that’s adequately reflected in the   last section  That is, if things changed and we had stronger economic data and, in my case,   stronger verisimilitude, if not similitude, from the private sector, then it leaves the space to   tighten because the last section is a balanced statement   I want to comment on what President Moskow and President Minehan pointed out about   the second section  That’s the key point I’d like to dwell on—I think it’s wise to make a full stop   after the word “quarters”  “Still favorable” implies doubt, and I don’t think that’s a wise thing   for us to imply  Second, we do repeat ourselves on housing  Third, we can’t say with certainty   March 20-21, 2007 93 of 196    that there is a gradual waning of the correction in the housing market; we don’t know  So, again,   I would strongly recommend that you have a full stop after the word “quarters”  Finally, I will   play my role of a broken record to suggest once again that we insert the word “global” before   “resource utilization” so that we don’t continue to further the belief that we are oriented toward a   closed economy  Those would be my recommendations, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman    I feel very strongly about this issue  I’d like to underscore the arguments   that have been made—I think we have unanimity around this table  Our job is to get the real   economy right  We’re opening a door here that entails significant risk  Governor Warsh made a   very good comment  What is our exit strategy once we open that door?  So the question is whether   opening that door is necessary  I don’t believe it’s necessary at this juncture    Well, Mr Chairman, I’ve given this a lot of thought  If you remember, in   the last round I asked for a compelling argument for adopting a stated specific inflation target  I   noted that it was not at all obvious that the countries that have adopted a specific inflation target   have done better than we have in terms of economic performance over the past decade or, for   that matter, better than countries that have not adopted a target  One could make the   counterargument that it’s not at all obvious that countries that have adopted numerical definitions   have done worse than we have  I understand and respect tremendously the theoretical arguments   that can be made to validate adoption of a numerical inflation objective  However, to my mind   our vulnerability is not with economists or even with what we used to call the “quant jocks” on   Wall Street  Our vulnerability is with those to whom we are accountable—the people and the   March 20-21, 2007 113 of 196    representatives of the people  Also, I’m not convinced that a numerical target is necessary at this   stage   I do note that others have done this  I raised four children  One of my first instructions   to my children was, “Just because everybody else is doing it doesn’t mean you have to do it”    I’m mindful of that today  [Laughter]  I’m mindful of the fact that other countries have adopted   this for different reasons  We know about the UK’s “Great Moderation”  I understand the use   of a numerical target in terms of the ECB, given the complexity of many countries, non-uniform   data, and a population base that keeps changing  I understand that the Bank of Japan had been so   totally discredited that it was necessary to adopt such a target  I understand that the New   Zealand government was so grossly incompetent that they had no choice but to adopt a target  I   consider other countries a bit too small to be persuasive  We talked about one of them last time    So my real issue is that I can’t find a compelling case for or against, but I’m not of the nature that   I like to join the crowd for the sake of joining the crowd     I don’t think it is a sufficient reason—and I can say this because I am the least   academically prepared at this table—to do so at this time for the purity of what are very   respectable theoretical arguments  I’m mindful of the politics  You and I have talked about this   personally, Mr Chairman  I am grateful for the comments that you made at the beginning of this   discussion  Let me just state parenthetically that Barney Frank is one of the smartest men I   know  He would actually understand that the word “stochastic” derives from the Greek   “stochasticus,” which means “skillful in aiming,” and he probably knows more than any other   congressman about this subject, even though he has drawn what appears to be a line in the sand    But that’s not what I’m worried about  I am worried about whether or not we’ve accumulated   sufficient political capital to sell this to the rest of the Congress and to the representatives of the   March 20-21, 2007 114 of 196    people, and I’m a little concerned about the timing of our doing so  We spent the past two days   talking about downside risk to the economy  Some of us feel, as I stated in our earlier   discussion, that we may be just a revision away or perhaps a shock away from some economic   turbulence, some economic weakness, and perhaps a recession  I wonder about the optics, Mr   Chairman, of our dwelling on this subject at this time, given that there doesn’t seem to be a   compelling need because we don’t have the same conditions that the United Kingdom, the ECB,   the Bank of Japan, New Zealand, and others faced   Having said that—and I’m going to just shoot everything at once and then I’ll be done—I   think it is implicit in question number 1 that we are going to adopt this, which I am not in favor   of  But if I had a gun put to my head and someone said, “You must adopt this  What is your   preferred index?” I would say, being someone who has an MBA and not a PhD, that, first, it   is important that we adopt whatever target we adopt such that businessmen, businesswomen,   financiers, and other economic agents do not need to take inflation into consideration in their   decisionmaking  Second, it must be politically palatable and credible and easy to understand    Ordinarily I would argue, if it weren’t for those two conditions, for what we love in Dallas,   which is the trimmed mean; but that is way too complicated to explain to the public  But I would   also argue against the PCE excluding energy and food  I would argue for adopting the CPI  I   would argue for a 1 percent target over a three-year to five-year period  Over time they all   converge at any rate  By the way, as far as I’m concerned, if my math is still correct, 1 percent   means that prices double every 72 years, which is a reasonable lifetime, and given the   ½ percentage point measurement bias, that might actually mean they double every 140 years,   which is about as much as I would like to see  So I would argue for a 1 percent target based on   the CPI—if you put a gun to my head, which I hope you don’t—over a longer time frame     March 20-21, 2007 115 of 196    As far as Committee participants arriving at a consensus view on this goal, I don’t think   consensus is essential  In fact, you could have the Committee report a central tendency or some   range  I’m not going to get into questions 5, 6, and 7  I want to go to the forecast narrative,   which concerns me  As we’ve talked about before, I’m not in favor of full frontal views  I took   note of Governor Kroszner’s comment about “kabuki” earlier; I think it’s good to preserve a   little kabuki  If we are going to communicate with the public, we need to communicate in   understandable language  I don’t wish to give offense, but I know I will—I would not be in   favor of the staff drafting that statement  I would be in favor of writing it in the simplest possible   language  I suggest, Mr Chairman, that it would be more appropriate for, say, our   communications staff or Michelle or somebody like that to draft this statement so that we   communicate to the public in a way that is comprehensible  I was taken aback at even the use of   the word “stochastic” at the end  We know what that means  The people have no idea what   “stochastic” means  Again, I return to my root question  With whom are we trying to   communicate?  We talk about the markets  The markets are what—economists, theoretical   economists, econometricians, ourselves, people on Wall Street, sophisticated operators of   financial markets, businesswomen and businessmen, or the public in general?  My greatest fear is   doing anything that would impugn the integrity or threaten the preservation of this institution,   and so I want to plead with you and with the rest of the people around this table  (1) to consider   whether we really need to adopt an inflation target at this time and (2) should we do so, to make   it as simple and comprehensible and easily communicated as possible and to do so in the same   way with the forecast that we are discussing the possibility of issuing  Thank you, Mr   Chairman  "
8114,2007-05-09,"  I have two questions  On page 2, when you talk about subprime paper, do   we have any data that can tell us anything about the stress in the alt-A markets specifically?    My second question regards S&P earnings  Is there a way to split out   what comes from the rest of the world and what comes from the United States?  I know it would   be analytically difficult, but I’m just wondering if there is a disparity between the two in what   drops to the bottom line    Thanks, Bill   May 9, 2007 6 of 130     Mr Chairman, last time I reported a sense that the international economy   was hot, that our domestic economy was cold, and that the regional economy of the Eleventh   District was just about right  I concluded my comments by saying that we were in treacherous   waters in terms of the US economy, navigating between the Scylla of inflation and the Charybdis   of a slowdown in growth  Like President Yellen, I don’t have much change to report, but I do want   to comment in very brief order on a couple of aspects that my two predecessors commented on   As far as the international economy is concerned, we see continued expectations for higher   growth and a different mindset beginning to set in  You saw that, I believe, in the French elections    Even Italian consumer and business confidence is at a ten-year high, or six-year high depending on   which measurement you use  You also see it reflected in various measures of port congestion,   charter rates for ships, and profit contributions to US multinationals  By the way, the contacts that   we talk to, Bill, are making a real effort to ferret it out and have a sense that there should be more   push or oomph from abroad than they are getting domestically  You still have to prune those   reports carefully  You see it in commodity prices  The bottom line from the standpoint of the   Dallas Fed is that we’re seeing a tightening of capacity utilization in the rest of the world, which is   somewhat vexing for US operators because it limits our firms’ abilities to cut costs by shipping   production abroad  Nonetheless, the rest of the world economy remains hot     May 9, 2007 28 of 130    I have just a couple of comments about the United States  When I talk to the rails, the   airlines, the express delivery logistic companies, the middle-income consumption sectors such as   retailers, or those that sell into those sectors, I am hearing increasing reports of weaker demand and   lower expectations than I was hearing at the last meeting in all but one sector, which is the   entertainment sector  Advertising revenues for the networks continue to stay high, and by the way,   visits to theme parks are at a record high, driven largely by wealthy foreigners who are finding them   to be a tremendous bargain  On the housing front, I have been bearish—more bearish than anybody   at this table  I remain so, and like President Yellen and, I believe, President Moskow, I am more   concerned than I was before  We can go through the numbers, but I think it is best expressed by the   CEO of one of the five big builders, who said that in March he was arguing internally with his board   that the headlines were worse than reality and now reality is worse than the headlines  There is   significant inventory, and the qualification of buyers is becoming a very vexing issue  I suspect that   this situation has yet to run its course  I am also hearing continued reports, despite layoffs and a   slowing economy, of continued tightness of highly skilled labor and continued price pressure on that   front  Finally in terms of the domestic economy, we are benefiting from a weaker dollar in terms of   tourism flows and also the high-end retailers, most of which are in President Geithner’s District and   one—Neiman Marcus—in my own District  Other than that, I have nothing to add on the US   economy     I want to talk about inflation for a minute  The data—whether core PCE or overall, core   CPI, or even the trimmed mean, which we focus on in Dallas—seem to be indicating a tempering of   pressures  So we have some meat on the bones of our expectation, or I should say our hope, that   some deceleration of inflation pressures would manifest itself  But in talking to my business   contacts, I would say—if you will forgive a terrible reversal of biblical scripture—that, though the   May 9, 2007 29 of 130    flesh may be willing, the spirit is weak  What I mean is that even though they would like to believe   the numbers, in terms of their own behavioral patterns and the way they are positioning their   management, they feel enormous threats to their margins coming from slow volume growth and   coming from increasing cost pressures in that they allocate tasks globally  And their first reaction is   to see how they could change the pricing structure domestically  Chemicals are reporting that a 3 to   5 percent price action that was taken at the beginning of the year is sticking  My contact from a   large producer of food products said that they are shifting their overall model away from focusing   on unit-volume expansion to pricing, and even a ubiquitous brand like Starbucks is moving away   from the number of transactions to figure out how to price more aggressively or to restructure the   size of their containers, as are many food product producers  The large consumer paper products   reported that they were budgeting zero percent price inflation at the beginning of the year and have   redone their budget to price at 3 to 4 percent  If I had to pick a word, Mr Chairman, in terms of the   mood of our companies regarding the US economy, I would say that it’s somewhat dyspeptic  It’s   not a very pleasant mood  They feel a little indigestion because of the margin pressure that they’re   getting and limited relief in terms of what they’re able to pull out in volume expansion   I am in an unusual position of coming from what I believe, reading the Beige Book and   looking at the data, is a District that continues to significantly outperform the rest of the economy,   although we have slowed somewhat; yet when you look at the histograms, I have the lowest forecast   for GDP for this year  So I am the most pessimistic at the table in terms of short-term economic   growth, and on the inflation front I would just resort to a Ronald Reaganism, which is that we need   to trust but verify  In short, I would not be surprised to see disappointing growth in the second   quarter, much more disappointing than in the Greenbook’s forecast, nor would I be surprised to see   May 9, 2007 30 of 130    higher core PCE inflation sustaining itself than I am hearing from some of my colleagues and from   the staff  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, may I ask a question?    Are you advocating that, if we use the text as written in section 3 of   alternative B, we would still keep the full wording from section 4 from last time?    That may mitigate some of those concerns you have    No, sir  I just want to comment    Well, again, I am probably the most bearish in terms of a short-term forecast   on GDP growth and have very asymmetric confidence bands, which take into account even slower   growth than that  Having listened to the conversation at the table and keying off the word   “hawkish” that Vince used, I want to be owlish on growth in terms of listening to President Stern’s   admonition, and I don’t want to be a pigeon on inflation—just to kill the aviary context here    [Laughter]  So I would advocate alternative B  I don’t believe that we should change the rate  I like   very much the suggestion that President Stern just made about inflation   The only thing in your summary list, Mr Chairman, that I did not hear and that I think is an   issue is the behavioral pattern of private-sector leaders who were trying to figure out how to   preserve their margins; therefore, I think we will have more sustained price “instincts” than I would   otherwise see from the current data  I think the second sentence in alternative C captures that   uncertainty, and I agree with President Stern  Finally, as always, I would suggest that we add the   word “global” before “resource utilization”  Thank you, Mr Chairman    May I make an intervention, Mr Chairman?    If you do use that sentence, then you might be able to get rid of the first   sentence in section 4 that you used previously    “In these circumstances, the Committee’s predominant … concern   ”   SEVERAL  No    I am not arguing that you include both but that you could trade one off   against the other   May 9, 2007 84 of 130   "
8135,2007-06-27,"  Mr Chairman, I would argue that there are similarities in that, with   Long-Term Capital, most of the stress-testing had been just computer-model driven  Then   when actual market prices began to be quoted, you saw the deterioration  That is clearly the   case here  The ABX is a technical index  For a lot of the CDO-squared market, nobody   knows what the values, as opposed to the prices, really are  There is a difference between   June 27-28, 2007 10 of 261    price and value  Price is what you pay; value is what you get  I suppose one charitable   interpretation of this, Bill, would be that the good thing about this situation is that we   actually may be creating a real market to determine value on these things or at least price   relative to value  But I think the phenomena are similar, and I would argue—having been in   the business, although the business wasn’t as sophisticated when I used to be in it—that this   has broader dimensions than those we had before  If you look at the growth rate of these   instruments—again, without any underlying sense of what you ultimately can cash in if   you’re pressed—it has been a straight upcurve  The numbers are quite huge   Again, I was once a hedge fund manager—I know all the tricks that are played there,   including, by the way, the valuation of underlying securities—in a day when the business   was less sophisticated than it is now  I don’t feel I understand this issue  I don’t know about   my other colleagues around the table, but you did kindly send someone down to brief our   staff on this  They came out with more questions than they did answers, but it was very   helpful  I am worried that we will be asked publicly at different intervals and perhaps   starting now what our opinions and perspectives are  I’m also worried about giving the   wrong answer  I wonder if there is not a way—not during this meeting but at some point—  that all the principals at this table can be briefed so that we can understand and have a   common approach to this issue  I don’t think the issue is contained  I do think there is   enormous risk  I hope that something good comes out of this, but speaking personally, I   would like to understand this better, and I hope that we all understand it very well in case a   negative scenario obtains  That’s just a request   June 27-28, 2007 11 of 261     Maybe we could just have a common briefing  I think it would be   very helpful, Mr Chairman    Well, again, Tim, I would suggest that we not comment on this    None of us should comment on it  But (1) it would be good to have an understanding, and   (2) if it gets worse, more intense, or troublesome, the Committee will have to respond in   some way, and it would be nice to at least have a common understanding as we go down   this path  That’s my suggestion or request    Mr Chairman  I just wanted to thank Mike, in particular, for that   excellent presentation on the international dimension of this  It was sterling, or euro, or   whatever the expression would be in terms of its excellence  I have a tutorial question   about the export figures  I assume services are not included in core exports  Is that   correct?    Are our service exports increasing more rapidly than our non-  service exports?  Do you know?  Would they be a possible source of explanation for the   improved trade balance?    June 27-28, 2007 28 of 261     Well, thank you  That was an excellent presentation    Mr Chairman, for the sake of consistency, I will refer to my   report at the last two meetings on what I call the Goldilocks porridge classification   system  I reported last that the international economy was hot, and it remains so as we   saw in the excellent slide presentation  I reported that the domestic economy was cold  I   believe it remains so, in contrast I think to the previous two interventions, at least from a   growth perspective  I also reported that the Eleventh District, home of the NBA   champions, vanquishers of the—shall I say “more cavalier”?—Fourth District, [laughter]   was just right  It remained so in relative terms  I would say that it has weakened   somewhat and cooled somewhat in absolute terms   I just want to comment quickly on the international side of the domestic economy,   with the hopes of adding on the margin to the staff’s excellent work in the Greenbook,   the Bluebook, and the presentations we had earlier  On the international side, I was   pleased that for the first time, at least since I have been a member of this august body, the   last minutes reported that the participants expressed “some concern that the strength of   June 27-28, 2007 44 of 261    global demand could contribute to price pressures at home” and noted “heightened levels   of capacity utilization in those countries”  We didn’t talk about capacity utilization in   your excellent report  I just wanted to add that our work in Dallas and my CEO contacts   continue to validate the phenomenon that we are getting closer to capacity constraints   abroad  Research by the Dallas staff, imperfect as it is, confirmed continued growth   overseas, resulting in a tightening of capacity around the world, as does the work of   JPMorgan, one of the few places in the private sector that we find has spent a good deal   of time contemplating this issue   Anecdotal reports from CEOs and CFOs confirm this trend  The rest of the world   is reported to be offering more fertile soil for growth and investment, as I think President   Moskow pointed out  Shippers tell me that tonnage demand for dry bulk is running at a   rate significantly higher than last year, driven by underlying demand outside the United   States and despite slower rates of growth of shipments to the United States  You also see   this in ship charter rates remaining high  Freight rates, which don’t have a spot market   and are much more difficult to measure, appear to be rising in terms of their volume   expansion and in shipments to Europe from the Pacific—certainly at a faster rate than   those shipments from the Pacific to the United States   One of the largest engineering logistics firms in the world reports that, with the   exception of downstream oil and gas investments, power, and an as yet unannounced   nuclear power plant that will be built in the United States, their bookings and substantial   backlog are “all driven by non-US demand, with cost escalation not only of commodity   inputs but of the building blocks and their materials, such as compressors and pumps, and   so on, despite the leveling-off of the price of steel”  On the cost side, the head of the   June 27-28, 2007 45 of 261    United States’ largest importer of consumer goods—without mentioning the name of the   retail company—[laughter] reports that cost pressures, as you indicated before in your   presentation, coming from China are leading them to “aggressively seek to shift imports   to other country sources; in certain sectors, China is becoming too pricey”   At home, business operators to whom I talked are more equivocal about growth   prospects for the economy, Mr Chairman, than I expected  The CEO of one of the   largest rails describes the economy as “lethargic”  The CEO of one of the largest IT   firms “doesn’t see much sequential growth”  The CEO of an airline, which is not   Southwest Airlines, says that “domestically, the seasonally adjusted revenue for the   industry line is flat”  A usually ebullient CEO of one of the nation’s largest broadcasters   said that “while Q2 is always the slowest quarter, this one is slower than normal”  The   CFO of one of the flagship express shippers reports that B2C is growing at 3 to 4 percent   rates of volume expansion after several years of 7 to 8 percent rates of growth  But there   has been no pickup in the second quarter over the first quarter seasonally adjusted, and “it   just seems to be as flat as it can be across the board in all segments”  A leading   restaurateur with thirty years in the business notes that he is experiencing a combination   of soft top line and rising costs for the first time in his history of operating  For added   measure, the CEO of a very large retailer describes demand as “flatter than a pancake”    He and retailers at the higher price points report that shoppers are moving away from the   malls to closer-to-home retailers because of transportation costs and financial insecurity    They make fewer trips, and they buy larger volumes per trip   President Yellen, I won’t depress you with the soundings from the two largest   public homebuilders  I only half jokingly recommended that they take all sharp objects   June 27-28, 2007 46 of 261    off their desks and seal their windows  [Laughter]  Their situation is reported to have   gone from bad to worse  One of the interesting data points is that they represent   27 percent of the homebuilders  The remainder is in private developers’ hands  They   suggest that the rapidity with which those private developers report their stress is   certainly much less than the publicly held companies, in part because they are afraid of   their lenders  Therefore, those shoes have yet to drop, which is not an encouraging sign   On the price front, I hear two common complaints across the board  First, labor   remains tight and pricey except in the homebuilding sector, where there has been some   relief for obvious reasons  Second—and I think very importantly—food prices driven by   corn oil are creating significant cost pressures for all crops, including substitute crops    One of the most astute contacts I have—a leading banker, not a restaurateur or a food   person—says that adding ethanol to what he called a tectonic shift in demand for corn,   wheat, and other food stuffs stemming from the addition of two billion people—new   consumers moving up the food chain (no pun intended)—may place corn at the center of   the inflation paradigm in the new century   One commonly voiced concern might influence business investment in capital   expenditures  I keep hearing from each CEO, “What are we going to do with our   capital?”  Reports are increasing of competition from rates on the longer end of the yield   curve, above 5 percent  Boards of directors are reluctant to embrace the concept that   eighteen months out the US economy’s sun will shine more brightly than it is shining   currently, and concerns linger about the costs and the availability of labor for domestic   cap-ex purposes   June 27-28, 2007 47 of 261    In summary, Mr Chairman, statistically we may have a second-quarter snapback   driven by inventory adjustment as predicted by the Board staff and by my own staff  But   my soundings with business leaders—again, no doubt imperfect—provide some cognitive   dissonance  I didn’t hear a single one of twenty-six interlocutors who would agree with   the baseline case as stated in the Greenbook  Most would agree with the alternative cases   that were presented, which were quite thoughtful  I used the term “dyspeptic” in   describing the mood of corporate leaders the last time we met  I would say the mood,   Mr Chairman, remains sour, and perhaps it has become more sour  I remain relatively   pessimistic on growth and skeptical about inflation and the utility of reliance on the core   measurement in guiding our deliberations  Thank you, Mr Chairman     If this were the Australian Reserve Bank, it would be okay    [Laughter]     Only rhetorical inflation    Mr Chairman, I agree with Governor Kohn  I am in favor of   alternative B, of holding the rate where it is  The point that he just made may cover a   suggestion I had because I was thinking about what I heard yesterday at the table  I heard   two things  One, in our discussion of inflation, I heard some concern about core inflation   June 27-28, 2007 101 of 261    qua core inflation  I was going to suggest that the first sentence be modified slightly to   say that “readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months, but   measures of overall inflation have remained stubbornly high”  Then, I would strike   “however” and just say “a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be   convincingly demonstrated”  I believe that is what I heard yesterday  The other music to   my ears, but I think it also reflects reality—and I hear it more at the table—would be   amending slightly the last sentence in that section 3 to read, “Moreover, the high level of   global and domestic resource utilization has the potential to sustain inflation pressures”    [Laughter]  That is what we said  That is what we discussed  We acknowledge that  I   think it would show that we’re tuned in to what’s going on, and that would be my   recommendation  Otherwise, I would leave the rest of alternative B unchanged  Thank   you, Mr Chairman    Excuse me, but the histograms we’re talking about are the individual   differences?    So you would have the central tendency analysis that we have and   then further amplification, which would show individual differences of the nineteen   members of the Committee    I’m just trying to understand what we’re going to talk about    Mr Chairman, may I ask—was that the draft that Ms Danker sent   around?     June 27-28, 2007 163 of 261     Mr Chairman, you spoke of the road to Damascus  I was thinking   about the movie “What About Bob?”—not because of my own neuroses about this   exercise but because I think it is important to proceed with baby steps, step by step    President Minehan’s point is cardinal  It’s very hard to go back once you move forward    As I wrote in my memo of June 4, I believe it was, I think that you have summarized one   of the most important things that we can do as a Committee, and that is to get a useful   and credible inflation metric  Not only do I applaud the overall outline that you started us   off with—and, again, thank you for bringing that outline to the table because it organized   the conversation—but also I am a big believer in the need for us to come up with an   inflation metric that is credible  Tim’s point on the PCE versus the CPI is very important   to consider  As I have said before, I am more in favor of the CPI, but I do think we need   to think that decision through in terms of the different instruments that are out there in the   market and the precedent that has been set   Now, I just want to make a couple of points  On the road to Damascus, we have   to think of what the milestones are going to be  I want to be careful that we don’t labor   under a conceit of false precision  I worry sometimes that, when we look at these   June 27-28, 2007 176 of 261    histograms—and I want to come back to the histograms in a second—the reality is that   only 20 basis points separate these things  The further we go out in the time horizon—  you know the old saying that you only put something three points to the right of the   decimal point to show that you have a sense of humor—we have to be very, very careful   not to imply that we have ultra precision  We don’t have ultra precision; this is a   judgmental business  So that is one point I would like to make    I have very mixed feelings about the histograms  After listening to this   conversation, I would suggest that we start with the central tendency analysis—the table   that was put together  The problem with histograms, besides giving us a sense of false   precision, is something that a couple of the Presidents and Governors pointed out or   hinted at and Governor Kroszner just pointed to but I thought that he didn’t go far   enough  Even if we do it anonymously, if we were to publish these, the press is going to   poke and poke and poke—the red meat argument that President Minehan gave—and ask,   “Who are the outliers, and why?”  Once the press starts doing this, it is just a matter of   time before a Congresswoman or a Congressman does the same thing  We row as a crew,   as a team, and I want to be very careful that we don’t take any risk to undermine the   unique aspect of this body  We sit around this table  We have differences of opinion  I   noticed Governor Kroszner pointed to me when he said, “This guy is wrong”  It was just   the way you were pointing  [Laughter]  I realize that sometimes I am a total outlier here,   but that is in the spirit of the comradeship that exists at this table  You put this out for the   public, and I think you run certain risks of undermining the authority of this Committee,   the authority of the Chairman, and the integrity of the process  The federalist process that   June 27-28, 2007 177 of 261    we have is of value  Let’s be careful that we preserve it and don’t make this like every   other Washington institution, because we are unique in the nature of our integrity   Just a couple of other comments  I’m very wary, as I outlined in my letter, of   being open about the fed funds rate path we envision  This is our central policymaking   instrument  If we were to forecast it, I worry that we are going down a slippery slope    We would be under pressure to validate our forecasts by our actions, and I think we need   to preserve some of the mystery that surrounds them  I remind you that FF does stand for   “full frontal,” so I want to be careful, again, not to give the markets a full frontal view but   to preserve some of our power    With regard to the frequency with which we do this exercise—again, if we do it   baby step by baby step, I would like the Governors to be mindful of the fact that the   Presidents run businesses  We have other things to do  I think Vice Chairman Geithner   pointed to that indirectly  This is not the only thing we do  We don’t have our own   models  If Governor Kohn and the Bank Affairs Committee are willing to give us a few   billion dollars more to build our own models, then we are happy to take the money    [Laughter]  But the realism is that we key off the staff and off the FRB/US model  If you   really look at all these numbers that were given out, not a whole lot of variation is there    We need to acknowledge the fact that we don’t have the wherewithal and that a lot of this   is guesswork  The further we go out, the more it is guesswork     One last point  I like your suggestion, Mr Chairman, of the three to five years    As I have made clear, I have the opposite fear of President Lacker’s  I think that what   President Lacker suggests puts us right into an argument with the political authorities   about what our employment target is  This is a nice way to skirt the issue of formal   June 27-28, 2007 178 of 261    inflation targeting and, in my view, inevitably being forced by the Congress into   employment targeting  I support your suggestion that we use a three-to-five-year range    It is a nice, elegant way to get us out of a possible box  Yet if we decide to go down that   road in the future—again, in this “What About Bob?” baby-step approach—we can do   that later  I wouldn’t start out there  I think there are too many risks  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    Mr Chairman, I think the statement should be a statement of the   Committee  I don’t have any problem with the current governance structure, although I   think it does make sense for everybody to vote on it since we hammer it out anyway  I   wouldn’t change the language  We do have one sentence that we always repeat, which to   me is a given—that our future policy actions will depend on the evolution of the outlook, et   cetera, et cetera  I guess we should say that every time, but I’m not sure we have to say that   June 27-28, 2007 210 of 261    every time  It’s a given  Otherwise, I’d keep it the same, although I promise to continue to   lobby for the word “global” from here to infinity  [Laughter]  Thank you  "
8161,2007-08-07,"  Let’s go back to your previous comment on the second question of   President Poole  Another standard reaction is to sell things that are more liquid when you can’t   unload things that are less liquid  One thing I am curious about—and I don’t know if we have   the data, but this is the question—in terms of CDO/CLO issuance, do we know how much is held   by non-US investors?  For example, I have been told—and I don’t know if this is correct—by a   senior partner at Goldman that, since ’03, most of the mezzanine CDOs were issued or sold to   Asians or to Europeans  I’m wondering if we are aware of any tripwires by which we might   have overseas the kind of reaction I just described, which is selling assets that might be more   liquid to cover the illiquidity of something they’re stuck with  I would be interested to do a little   work, if we can, on CDO issuance and how much is held here  It seems to me to be common   sense that, given that surplus liquidity has come from abroad—and we have talked about the   August 7, 2007 12 of 136    surplus of saving a great deal and the Chairman has talked about it a great deal—that may well   be where a lot of this risk resides, and we should be aware of it  I would posit that probably the   same is true for asset-backed commercial paper  It is really the CDO market not asset-backed   commercial paper that I am most concerned about    It might be interesting to look at the issuance dates of those, if we were   able somehow to analyze the issuance dates     August 7, 2007 13 of 136     I have one other quick question, and that is that I want to make sure I   understand what you’re saying  It seems to me from this presentation that this is not just a matter   of price; it is also a matter of structure and covenants  Is that correct?    Thank you for an excellent presentation    I noted Karen’s comments about the globalized interlinkages with financial   markets, and I have a simple question for maybe Karen  In terms of the alternative scenario that   August 7, 2007 25 of 136    was sketched for greater housing correction to spill over to confidence in financial markets, in that   discussion and in that model or simulation, when you talk about equity prices, stresses in the debt   markets, and further weakness in aggregate spending, are you talking about the United States only?    Thank you    Mr Chairman, at the past few meetings I have spoken about my District   as having strong growth  I have asked questions about the strength of the growth in the national   economy, and I have described the global economy from the standpoint of the way the staff here   writes about it and the way we do our own work as “hotter than a $2 pistol”  Nothing has really   changed since my last intervention  I would note that, unlike President Moskow’s District, our   District is unusual on the other side  We are not experiencing the kind of decline in home prices   that is being experienced elsewhere  We’re suffering from widespread labor shortages, for both   unskilled and skilled labor  We believe that we are seeing significant labor hoarding in our   District  Unemployment is strikingly and historically low in the two major cities of Dallas and   Houston at 41 percent, in Austin at 35 percent, and along the border areas unprecedentedly in   the low single digits  Salaries for accountants in our District are up 5 to 8 percent  Law firms—I   note that there are 12 million lawyers in America and 11 million people who work in the auto   industry from parts to final assembly, which is a statement on our society—[laughter] are raising   first- and second-year annual compensation by double digits for their new lawyers  So there is   still price inflation in the service sector  We perceive, through our discussions with CEOs   around the country, that while there has been a net downward movement in the more-robust   measurements of price inflation—the trimmed mean—there still are some threats on the inflation   August 7, 2007 34 of 136    front  For example, the CEO of Wal-Mart USA told me yesterday that, internally, when they   evaluate their comparable store measurements, the comps are being driven by inflation, not by   volume  As for the demand for ships—if you read the Wall Street Journal yesterday or from the   interviews I have had with large shippers, the bulk carriers are trading at record highs  The   Baltic index is at a record high, driven by exports of iron ore, pulp, and other products to   voracious Chinese demand and by the return of exports from China to a voracious European   demand  Container shipments are up 20 percent year over year in terms of European imports    The price pressures being exerted there seem to be invading other areas  One of the more   interesting observations was what has happened recently in terms of the pricing of paper   products being led by SCA, which is a European corporation  Kimberly-Clark and the others   have fallen in line  They are asking for double-digit increases  So although we are seeing some   mitigation of price pressures, I am nonetheless concerned that, given the international dynamics,   we still have the potential for price increases and a bit of resistance to what I would like to see   In terms of economic growth nationally, I just want to comment on some things that the   staff presented  I thought the Greenbook was excellent  I did speak to two of the five largest   publicly held builders  They report that all-in, with incentives, their prices have been marked   down an average of 25 to 35 percent from a year ago  Those are significant numbers  For   example, in the Imperial Valley of California, homes selling for $550,000 to $600,000 have been   now marked down to $400,000 to $450,000  The builder with the most experience—forty years   of experience—who has lived through all kinds of cycles is of the strong belief that we are in the   second year of a five-year correction  Like the point that you made, President Yellen, this is of   great concern  So net from the Dallas Fed standpoint, we have lowered our expectation for   second-half growth to 2 percent  We are still concerned, despite the encouragement of marginal   August 7, 2007 35 of 136    movement, on the inflation front  I’d like to leave the discussion of the economy there and just   turn to the previous discussion we had and the references made by President Moskow and   President Yellen   This may be a bit harsh, but if you look at the front page of the Wall Street Journal from   this morning, I see what I call the “Churchillian maxim” at play, which is, “I shall fare well in   history because I shall rewrite that history”  Whether you use Greg Ip to rewrite the history or   you rewrite it yourself, no amount of rewriting of history will exonerate us if we are not prepared   for the more-dire scenarios that were presented by the staff  I would ask that we do some   scenario preparation in terms of, should we encounter increased financial market turbulence,   what actions we might take to deal with it  For example, it is not clear to me that a widespread   opening of the discount window solves the problem given the structure of what I call “ersatz   credit” that is then spread throughout the system  It’s not clear to me that even dealing, for   purposes of the present meeting, with the fed funds rate is the issue because it is not an issue of   just pricing in the marketplace  It’s a structure issue, and it’s a covenant issue  It’s an   availability issue   I started my career, Mr Chairman, with Herstatt  [Laughter]  That was not an auspicious   beginning  I lived through the corrections of the S&L market, portfolio insurance, the crashes of   ’87, ’97, and so on  When you sort through them, all of them have a common basis, and that is a   search for greater yields or greater return, leverage in order to achieve that return, and some   assumption of risk mitigation leading to what I call “rational complacency”  I believe that’s at   play presently  I agree fully with President Yellen that it presents a significant risk  However, I   want to exercise great caution in interpreting these signals  I think we have to be extremely   careful about what we do and what we say  Just to show my hand, I would not be in favor of   August 7, 2007 36 of 136    cutting the federal funds rate at this juncture  I think we have to analyze the language carefully    But my request is that, in addition to our exercise on communication, we take a serious look at   the various scenarios that might obtain, so that no one could ever accuse us of being unprepared   in case the worst obtains  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman    Well, Mr Chairman, against this background of skittishness, my best   advice would be to recognize, to an extent, in our statement what is going on in the marketplace,   what ails the marketplace  The best guidance would be that we must not ourselves become a   tripwire  I think we have to show a steady hand  I rather liked the reference to the Hippocratic   oath earlier, “Do no harm”  I think we can best accomplish this by acknowledging market   turbulence and yet not implying that we are given to a reaction that might create a moral hazard    I’m particularly mindful of the discussion in the press and by security analysts of a so-called   Bernanke put, and I want to make sure that we do not take any action or say anything that might   give rise to an expectation that such is to occur  Therefore, I would suggest that alternative B   offers the best policy response  That is, I am in favor of keeping the rate where it is  The   wording in the second paragraph acknowledges that there has been volatility in the markets  I   think it addresses the points Governor Kohn made about growth in employment, incomes, and a   robust global economy  I’ve waited a long time to see the word “global” in these statements    [Laughter]  Whether it gets left in or not, it does reflect reality  I’m mindful of President   Geithner’s point of softening a little, and yet that is where I worry that we might become a bit of   a tripwire  I would under normal circumstances be somewhat inclined toward the last paragraph   in alternative A, and yet I didn’t hear around the table, nor do I fully believe myself, that things   are exactly roughly balanced  I take the point that was made just now in the presentation that, by   saying “downside risks to growth have increased somewhat,” we are opening the door   The only refinement that I might suggest is that we soften a little the word before “policy   concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected”  By taking out the word   “predominant,” I would leave that up for consideration  I actually talked to somebody about this   earlier; I want to acknowledge that  But otherwise I would stick with alternative B, again,   August 7, 2007 89 of 136    mindful that we are dealing with a skittish market situation and yet acknowledging the fact that a   sense around this table is that there are risks to growth, that we are making progress on inflation,   and yet there is no convincing evidence that we have completely turned the corner on the latter   front  Thank you, Mr Chairman    I would agree with that  Now, that doesn’t say that pricing has changed  Let   me give you an example  Kimberly-Clark last week went to market on $2 billion in debt  They   couldn’t move it unless they had a change-of-control provision  No price impact  So it is part of the   risk premiums, but we’re not seeing pricing per se  I like the wording that President Geithner has   suggested  "
8184,2007-08-10,"  Mr Chairman, do we know if our European colleagues have insisted on any   discipline in return for their actions?  That’s also my question with regard to our own procedures   here  I like the particular reference to the discount window  What concerns me is that we’re issuing   a statement  I like the statement, but what are we getting in return?  In other words, how does this   action help us rein in what has been reckless and irresponsible behavior by creditors?  We’re putting   our finger in the dike here, but what are we getting in return?  I’d also like to know what our   thoughts are about that as we proceed down this path  (a) Have we heard from your counterparts,   Mr Chairman, as to the kind of discussions they’re having with their creditors, and (b) do we expect   that, say, New York, San Francisco, and Richmond are going to sit down with some of these   bankers, if necessary, to provide a little moral suasion, or is that just not in the picture right now?    You are well aware, based on our conversation at the FOMC meeting, what   the risks that I’m worried about here are  At the same time, I think we’re doing the correct thing  I   just want to keep bearing in mind the risk that we don’t send any signal that we’re just going to be,   and obviously we wouldn’t be, indiscriminate  But there has to be something in return for our   providing liquidity in the markets if we continue to do so  I wanted to make that point    No, don’t amend the statement  I just want to have that mindset  That’s my   point, and I won’t say anything more    I’ve got it, Mr Chairman  Thank you    Thank you, President Lacker  "
8195,2007-08-16,"  Bill, is there any evidence of a credit crunch in households?  Are we seeing   or are you hearing about any lagging of receivables on credit card payables or any other evidence   that households with good credit are having trouble?    Thank you  Thank you, Mr Chairman   August 16, 2007 6 of 37     Mr Chairman, I have a question and then I want to address the proposal    The question I have is, In the penultimate sentence of the statement on the temporary changes to   primary credit that Governor Kohn was discussing, what exactly do we mean by “related assets”?    Do they include CDOs?    It is just a very open term, and that’s the only question I have, if you want to   state it as that  I fully support this initiative  It seems to me that there are the Countrywides, but the   real issue is that banks are not too sick to lend  They’re too scared to lend, whether it’s the stigma   that Vice Chairman Geithner mentioned or whatever the pressures might be  What we’re doing is   giving them an incentive to lend  I like it because it’s a two-party decision—private banks willing   to accept risk and us willing to facilitate the acceptance of that risk  If people show up at the   window, it sends a signal that they view this opportunity as profitable  I like that aspect of it  In   summary, to me this is a nice, surgical procedure, and the banks get to choose the patients  I prefer   that rather than using the very blunt instrument, Mr Chairman, as you referred to it—not the blunt   instrument, but I would phrase it that way—a cut in the fed funds rate, which is for broader   August 16, 2007 19 of 37    macroeconomic purposes  I like the 50 basis point proposal  I like the proposal as it is stated, and I   fully support it  As to whatever background work Vice Chairman Geithner has done, I applaud that   because I want to make sure this works   On the statement, I have just two suggestions for your consideration  I’m a bit worried   about using the word “appreciably” because we’re judging that the downside risks to growth have   increased  Putting in the word “appreciably” may go a little too far because we are shifting and   we’re acknowledging that there are downside risks to growth  I think that “increased appreciably”   runs the risk of frightening people a little, and I’d ask you to consider that  The second suggestion is   minor, but I think not unimportant  When you say that the Committee is monitoring the situation   and is prepared to act as needed, perhaps you might want to say “if” needed  Those are my   suggestions, for what they’re worth  I think this is a good decision, a good move, and it leaves the   fed funds rate decision, as President Yellen said, for our normal meeting  It doesn’t look as though   we are operating macroeconomic policy under stress in response to markets, and I applaud it    Thank you, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, may I come back to a point that Jeff Lacker raised?  It goes   back to my point about “related assets”  Governor Kohn, if we have a “no questions asked” facility   and we are approached at our discount window, don’t we need a better definition of “related   assets”?  I’m a little worried about what might be pledged, and we know there’s some flotsam and   jetsam out there that we don’t want to accept    I just want to restate my support for this  There is a risk that it will not work,   but it is a step better taken, in my opinion, than cutting the fed funds rate and using that blunter   instrument  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Again, I apologize, but if we take “going   forward,” which I think is a good suggestion, I do want you to consider the word “appreciably” as   maybe a little too strong  We’re saying about going forward  We could say “increased further”    “Appreciably” is a very strong word, and the way I interpret it from a market perspective—and this   is maybe what you want to convey—is that it’s a done deal that we are going to cut rates  That’s the   way I interpret it  I think the word “further” is a little softer  I worry about “appreciably”  We are   acknowledging that we’re looking forward  I think it is a very good suggestion of Governor   Kroszner’s  I just wanted to make that point, Mr Chairman  Thank you  "
8216,2007-09-18,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Bill, I just want to make sure that I understand   what you said in your excellent presentation  I think I heard you say that, as time passes, investors   in the markets will become more discriminating  Already we’re seeing signs of returning stability    I’m trying to differentiate between what we had earlier—serious counterparty risk and phobias—  and what we have now—which seems to be concerns about balance sheet risk  I want to understand   better the distinction between the two  I read Egon’s briefing last night, which by the way was very,   very solid  What I read was that the largest banks are well positioned to absorb even larger   exposures than they currently anticipate, and the number in that document was $1 trillion—a   significant number for five banks to absorb  Given what you just presented to us—I think I   interpreted you correctly—the concern about counterparty risk is diminishing, but it is still there    The balance sheet risk issue is somewhat defined, although there are uncertainties—you mentioned   them yourself  There’s headline risk, which cuts two ways, by the way, and I want to talk about that   during my other intervention  There is also a surprise loss that might occur  Could you distinguish   for us whether or not we’ve seen a reduction in counterparty risk, and if so, could you define it   somewhat?  How serious is the balance sheet risk from your perspective against the background of   the briefing we received last night, which indicated that it appears to be manageable?   September 18, 2007 10 of 188     We talked about the conduit question somewhat on the calls  Again, I   assume we’ve done sensitivity analysis to the degree that we can in terms of the potential for having   to absorb some of that risk and bring it onto the balance sheet  Is that correct?    Of course, of course    May I ask one more question, Mr Chairman?  At the last meeting I asked   about commercial paper risk in Europe and got nods of not a great risk  Is there anything that you   see or that you can think of that we don’t know or that hasn’t been in this presentation that would   indicate significant potential for risk?    Thank you, Mr Chairman    We still love Bill, by the way    Previously Newcastle, should have been called Sandcastle  [Laughter]    I won’t ask a silly question like the one I asked before  I just have two   quick questions, one for Dave, and the other for Karen  When we look at the labor situation,   from an analytical standpoint, it seems to me that there is cognitive dissonance between that and   what we are hearing anecdotally  What I’m hearing anecdotally—and I will talk a bit about that   in a minute, but I’d like your viewpoint—are still complaints about labor shortages, from bank   September 18, 2007 34 of 188    tellers to chemical workers to hotel maids, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera  You see it in the Beige   Book  You hear it from the CEOs with whom I’ve talked  You see it District by District  How   do you square these two corners, Dave?  That’s my question for you   Then, for Karen, my question is this  You talked about the non-industrial country   growth  I would submit, by the way, that those are the industrial countries now in terms of how   they are fueling their growth; what we call “industrial” countries are service-driven economies    Setting that aside, you talked about the impact on growth, and you mentioned oil in particular  I   would like to get your views on the potential inflationary impact from the kind of demand   growth that we are seeing and the growth that you are projecting elsewhere in the world    Thank you    Thank you  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Well, Mr Chairman, with regard to our District, we continue to grow   apparently faster than the rest of the country  There are signs of overbuilding, particularly in the   multiresidential and some commercial sector areas  I will give you one data point that focuses the   mind, and then I’d like to go on to a broader discussion  In the city of Austin, Texas, between 2000   and 2007, fifty condominium units priced at $1 million or more came on the market  Over that   seven-year period, forty of them sold  There are now more than 560 coming onto the market  We   have seen a significant boom in construction in all the major cities of our District, and that does give   me pause  Nonetheless, we continue to speed along, driven not so much by energy as by medicine   and the service sector  So I continue to expect that we will outpace the rest of the country  We are   September 18, 2007 38 of 188    seeing some decline in terms of advanced airline bookings as they affect our District, but they’re not   that different from the rest of the United States   What I’d like to address is the broader issue  Mr Chairman, I am a little confused as to why   we are talking about the economic situation and then skipping a beat before we talk about the   proposed discount window facility  I do see the two going hand in hand  I’d like to suggest that   we’re navigating a very narrow passage here in something of a fog  David, I think, was honest   about that  On the one side is a serious risk of overcompensating in our navigational course and   incurring a moral hazard or overcompensating for what is a perceived risk in uncharted waters  On   the other side, I think we run the risk of biting off our employment growth responsibility to save our   inflation-fighting face  So on the starboard shore we hear a siren called “Very Large Financial   Institutions,” which infer that a reduction in the fed funds rate will rescue them from peril, however   self-inflicted that peril may have been and despite the fact that they’re well capitalized according to   the reports that we have put together  On the other shore, we are relying on navigational charts or   uncertain landmarks or—as you said, David—rudimentary tools that are giving us mixed readings    I’m going to argue today that we should ease by 25 basis points, Mr Chairman—I’m just showing   my hand early—and indicate through our words that we might tilt the rudder a bit further if needed    Further, I am going to argue that we should defer discussion of the new discount window, and we   can get to that later  My concern is that if we fail to ease, we risk steering into a recession, but if we   shift the tiller too radically on the fed funds side, I believe that we risk tacking onto that siren call   that I mentioned earlier and that we will indulge rather than discipline risky financial behavior   What I’m about to talk about I base on a rather in-depth sounding, just to kill the naval   analogy once and for all in this discussion  [Laughter]  I sent you and the Vice Chairman a list of   the people I consulted  It is also based on what we’re hearing from our economists in the District   September 18, 2007 39 of 188    and in our Bank and, very importantly, on what the Greenbook and the Bluebook have said  There   is no question that our contacts report a slowing in the pace that occurs through the third quarter,   and they do detect a pulling in of the horns in terms of cost controls; budgetary planning; and US   capital expenditures as opposed to foreign cap-ex, which they’re still planning to expand   significantly—all in light of the press given to the subprime debacle, financial turmoil, and just a   general sense of caution   However, there are some very bright spots, and I’m going to go through these at a bit of   length because I think they’re important to recognize  AT&T, for example, a local but significant   company says, “We’ve had the best quarter we’ve had on the consumer side, and on the business   side it’s the hottest August in history”  Their average revenue per user has risen for the past two   quarters after declining for the past two and a quarter years  Texas Instruments, an international   company, reports “continued growth on the consumer side, robust industrial growth”—I’m quoting   their CFO—and “strong industrial demand” and is struggling to meet demand  Just to go to the   other extreme, Brinker International is a middle-income restaurant chain that employs 120,000 and   operates throughout the country  Other than weakness in Southern California and Florida, traffic   increases in July and August, seasonally adjusted, were “the best in twelve months”  Wal-Mart   reports, according to their CEO for US operations, that August was “a perfect retail month”    They’re experiencing no problems with suppliers and no shortage of supply inventory  They are   feeling cost pressures from China, which I’ll turn to in just a minute  Disney reports record   attendance in their theme parks, very high advanced bookings through next spring, and very strong   broadcasting revenues  We are hearing the same from the other broadcasters and companies like   Time-Warner, and needless to say, Exxon is a happy place right now  The law firms that we have   begun to survey rather thoroughly, reminding ourselves that there are more lawyers than there are   September 18, 2007 40 of 188    auto workers in America, are experiencing a boom in business  In short, if you take the summary   offered by the CEO of  Time-Warner, who also sits on a significant bank board, as many people   know, he says, “I see softness but not precipitous change, whereas the bank board I sit on keeps   yelling ‘Incoming’”  From a real Main Street perspective, he said that the changes are marginal   Now, to be sure, there are some weaknesses being reported  The one utility I talked to at   length is TXU  The housing market has left a bit of a slowdown in demand  Hookups by big   industrials, however—steel, aluminum, et cetera—are running very good loads according to their   CEO  UPS reports that the package line has been flat to slightly up, with a pickup occurring in July   and August  The volume declined 02 percent in the first and second quarters, yet that’s against a   “gee whiz” first quarter of 2006  July and August have picked up 08 percent  According to their   CFO, “We have not seen an impact from the credit crunch”  The CEO of MasterCard reports a   softening, but nothing falling off the cliff  Then JCPenney, which is a middle-third retailer, sees   retrenchment in discretionary spending, the so-called appointment shopping  Their back-to-school   season was one of the strongest they have seen recently  If you dissect, say, Cisco’s and EDS’s   data, you see a significant cutback in IT expenditures by financial institutions, which you would   expect—what they call the “big box” financial houses, Citi, Morgan, et cetera—and yet, according   to John Chambers, rock solid growth in commercial and service-provider categories  In summary,   underlying economic growth, from the standpoint of anecdotal evidence from the contacts I’ve   talked to, is stronger than it would appear from the press or from most prognosticators  I think   that’s one important point to take into consideration   It is also very important, Mr Chairman, to think of how people react to what they’re seeing    There’s no doubt an effort, if you’re worried about the future, to tighten up on cost of goods sold   and to reduce your head count  Yet everybody is complaining that there’s a massive shortage of   September 18, 2007 41 of 188    labor in every one of the companies I spoke of but one  The other thing is that you change your   strategic approach  One relief that’s been provided here is that the private equity firms have been   taken out so that bids of, say, seventeen times EBITDA, which is an actual case, with no due   diligence, are no longer the case  Four of the companies I spoke with are now able to make strategic   acquisitions, and they plan to proceed  The point is that the economy is not grinding to a halt  I   won’t mention lawyers again in this discussion except here, but see how they’re being hired now    Akin Gump, very large firms—they are working on strategic acquisitions, and you can see a ramp-  up in the volume that’s occurring there  So I think that’s an important thing to consider   Another very important point to consider is that price pressures have not disappeared  I   believe they are being maintained by global demand  I’m going to give you just a couple of   reference points, and then I’ll stop  As you know, I like to quote the Panamax shipping rates  When   we last met, the spot daily rate for a Panamax ship—again, the dry bulk carriers—was $59,000 a   day  Yesterday, it was $70,000  Port utilization is running at a record high  Why?  Asian demand    After ten years of deflation, the major retail sources from China, according to Wal-Mart and other   interlocutors, report cost increases running at 2 to 4 percent  After ten years of deflation, they’re   now inflating slightly  (Although I said I wouldn’t mention lawyers, but just so you know, for the   first time in history in Los Angeles, New York, and Dallas, all beginning lawyers start at $160,000    I think they are raising it to $180,000 in all markets)  Sara Lee—from an agflation standpoint I   think this is important and I think we have to be aware of the public perception—just announced a   5 percent increase in the cost of bread, and they announced that they “may hike another 5 percent at   the end of the month”  The spread between wheat and corn, Mr Chairman, is the widest it has   been  It is usually $200 to $250; it is now $600  Cooking oil prices, milk prices—even the   Italians went on a one-day strike to protest the price of pasta  It wasn’t successful, but that’s what   September 18, 2007 42 of 188    they did  The firms respond by “weighting out” the increased prices by putting less in the package   here in the United States  I want to mention again that we’re hearing widespread reports of labor   shortages, and I do worry, Dave, that it somehow just doesn’t square  I think your report certainly   was elucidating, but it does have implications for how fast consumption can fall off, if indeed we’re   suffering from a labor shortage  Finally, there are price pressures that ensue from the booming   construction markets in China  Chinese demand for skilled labor last year, year over year, was up   100 percent  They’re building a huge shipbuilding market and so on   So, Mr Chairman, I am concerned, first, that while we have made progress by any   measurement, including our beloved trimmed mean measure of the PCE in Dallas, that we’re just   beginning to make such progress and that there are risks out there and we need to acknowledge   them  They stem largely from global demand  Second, I’m very concerned that we’re leaning the   tiller too far to the side to compensate risk-takers when we should be disciplining them  So I’m   going to conclude not with a sailing analogy but with a football analogy  I don’t think it’s time to   throw a “Hail Mary” pass  I think it’s time just to continue to move up the field, running the ball as   we’ve been doing, and I would strongly recommend a rate cut of only 25 basis points and no more    If, indeed, we accompany it with a change in the primary credit facility, then I think we have to have   a very serious discussion of how far we’re willing to go on the fed funds rate  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    It didn’t work    Well, thank you, Mr Chairman  I look forward to that discussion  I didn’t   know that  If they are, indeed, tied together, then I would be making a very strong argument against   a 50 basis point cut if it were tied at the same time to this facility  So thank you very much for that   clarity    Well, Mr Chairman, I already presented my position  Like President Evans,   I came into this room expecting to argue for a 25 basis point cut  Unlike President Evans, I’m still   there [Laughter]  I just want to record, since I’ve already lost the battle, two points  I think Vice   Chairman Geithner said it right  Governor Kohn is absolutely correct  We should be guided by   what we think is going to happen in the economy and not be pushed around by the markets  That’s   one reason I’m in favor of 25 basis points and not 50, with an eye open to possibly moving further   later  But the point that Vice Chairman Geithner made that I think is relevant here is that we should   September 18, 2007 114 of 188    direct policy not to insulate but to facilitate  I think that’s a key point  Another is that we need to   demonstrate credibility that we have a feel for what’s happening in the markets  On that basis, we   need to at least be mindful that this is the first decision to move under the new FOMC  I’m a little   worried, despite my enormous admiration for President Yellen, about her interpretation of what is   reactive  Indeed, we might be viewed as being reactive by moving 50 basis points  I think that’s a   real risk  What we say, therefore, is very important—not just in the statement but also in our   subsequent minutes and speeches, as President Plosser said  I’m, therefore, a little sensitive to two   references to developments in financial markets  Yes, that’s what we talked about, but getting   ahead of the curve, we can state it too strongly and look as though we’re just way too reactive,   particularly given that this is the first decision to cut  As President Rosengren said, there’s no   question that we’re going to ease; the question is how much  The only suggestion I would have on   the wording is to refer to the financial markets once rather than twice  The other thing I would ask   to be reassured on, Mr Chairman, is that, if we’re going to go to 50 basis points, it is not a lock that   we will put forward the new credit facility because I think doing that simultaneously with 50 basis   points would basically confirm that we are reactive and that we’re overreacting to the markets    Thank you, Mr Chairman    Just so I understand this, let’s say Paribas shows up at our auction   window  Can they also show up at the European window, or are we going to make sure that   there’s no duplication?  How do you make sure there’s no duplication so that foreign banks   might get an advantage or vice versa?    That’s why I said vice versa  So for certain banks, holding companies, or   organizations, there is really more than the stated limit, right?    I understand that  I just wanted to make sure that that was the case    Thank you    But again, for Paribas, for example, which can come to our discount   window, the total sum would be 20 percent for any single credit across the System, even though   it might be pieced out by Bank    Thank you    I have two questions  The degree to which this new Lombard facility’s   bidding process would avoid the stigma issue is unclear  Could you repeat to me how this deals   with the stigma issue?  That’s my first question, and then I have another one after this    I mean, aren’t they still saying that they are distressed?    I’m sure the small banks will  That’s what I mean  That’s why they’re   not going to like it  In other words, this is a big institutional facility    Well, you have to have $63 million, if you’re using the ratios you’re   using, in collateral  So there is that aspect  I understand that’s what it was meant to address     My second question derives from the first, and that is, could you give us a little   background on the staff’s discussion on having tighter standards?  I gather there was some   discussion of that in terms of coming to the ACF and being well capitalized but also well   managed  Why the distinction, and what is the state of play of that argument as opposed to the   regular requirements for going to the discount window?    Thank you    Well, they’ll figure it out    Mr Chairman, a lot of what I have thought about this since I realized we   weren’t going to do this immediately has been addressed by the previous individuals who have   spoken  I’d just like to touch on a few points  First, like everyone else, I want to congratulate the   staff for excellent work  It is creative  It’s also very well balanced in the way that the pros and the   cons are argued  Bagehot and the Lombard facility not withstanding, it seems to me that, if we   proceed down this path, we have to position it so that it’s a refinement of what we did in August   rather than a confession of failure or insufficiency  That would be point number 1     Still, President Lacker made some very good points, and part of this gets to what President   Poole just mentioned, and that is that some political risk, in addition to the risk of failure, is there   and we have to acknowledge that it may not work  I have some concerns about the value of   collateral and the automaticity, as it were, in this kind of new facility and our ability to value   complicated collateral     My biggest concerns are the ideas, as President Lacker put it, that we’re subsidizing foreign   banks without really doing anything to mitigate hazard  I think that roughly translates what he said,   which gets me to the point of President Poole’s comment  We have to be mindful of the risk of   being perceived as (1) helping a limited number of very large money center banks and (2) bailing   out the Europeans  Now, we understand that  I don’t think the public understands that  If you look   at my discount window, there are five banks that could meet these collateral requirements, the   $63 million minimum  Some Districts have less; some Districts have more  Our backbone at the   Federal Reserve in terms of our political support is the community banking system  To be sure, we   all understand that we have systemic responsibilities, but the idea that we might be facilitating these   huge institutions or “bailing out” the Europeans is just a risk I think we need to be aware of, and if   we proceed, we’re going to have to figure out how to manage that   September 18, 2007 154 of 188    I’m not against a swap line, another point that President Lacker made  Usually I would   expect President Lacker to be against a swap line, but he’s not against the swap line  I’m not   against the swap line  It does beg the question of whether we couldn’t do a swap line and work with   the existing facility but for the fact that we think that the existing facility is insufficient  Again, I   would present this, if we proceed, as a refinement   Mr Chairman, I would like more time to think about this  I’m grateful that you’re giving us   more time to think about it, and I, again, would like to consider the governance aspects of it  But   those are the questions that I have at this juncture  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8239,2007-10-30,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Like the global economy, the Eleventh   District is slowing, but relative to the other Districts it remains very strong  Our retail sales   improved in September  Nonresidential and commercial construction remains elevated  Service-  sector job growth strengthened significantly in September, and our staff estimates that   182 percent of the jobs created in the country year to date were created in the State of Texas  I   just wanted to mention that  [Laughter]  Needless to say, wages are rising because of labor   shortages, a decline in immigration, and the increase in minimum wage  I will stop with the   Texas brag and now go on to the national economy   October 30-31, 2007 30 of 162    I think President Rosengren just gave an excellent summary of the financial markets  I   would add only the following—that with regard to credit markets, the hardening of the arteries or   the blockage of the aorta or whatever cardiovascular analogy we want to choose to describe what   happened is no longer as severe and life-threatening as it appeared to be in August  As   mentioned by the staff, whether it is net bond issuance of investment-grade securities or C&I   loans et cetera, the markets are moving toward pricing assets according to what they will sell for   rather than what their hypothetical mathematical modeling value might posit  There was a   startling statement in the Financial Times on Friday morning  Somebody, otherwise forgettable,   said, “Corporate treasurers are no longer buying things they don’t understand”  [Laughter]    Imagine that  Investors are coming home from lala land  To be sure, we’re not out of the woods   quite yet, as President Plosser and President Rosengren mentioned  The situation remains real,   but we’ve gone beyond suspended reality  If you will forgive me, you might say we have gone   from the ridiculous to the subprime      By that I mean, by the way, that the subprime market is a focus of angst,   which it should be, but the ridiculous practice of the suspension of reason in valuing all asset   classes, if not over, is in remission  We have a long way to go before full recovery and must   acknowledge that shocks regarding access might occur  I am confident, as I have said in   previous meetings, that—just to be polite—some cow patties might show up in the punchbowls   of some portfolios, perhaps especially in Europe and Asia  But I would submit, Mr Chairman,   that we are on our way back to markets priced by reason rather than by fantasy  So, while we   must remain ready to act as needed, I think it is appropriate to focus our discussion today and   tomorrow foursquare on the economy, and I want to turn to that now   October 30-31, 2007 31 of 162    The wealth effect of the severe markdown in housing is as yet incalculable and   worrisome  As the Greenbook states and my sounding with CEOs confirms, there are as yet no   appreciable, let alone debilitating, signs of spillover into the rest of the economy  The economy   has been weakened  You see it in the rails and trucking and retail  It has not shown signs of   succumbing as much as one might have expected to the full-blown virus that is afflicting   housing  As Dave mentioned, going back to July, banks in our District and everywhere else have   reported tightening terms and standards on loans to businesses and households  The overall   sentiment or mood of the country, as reported by the press and the surveys, is sour  Yet we   haven’t seen sharp increases in initial claims, low PMI (purchasing managers index) readings, or   sharply falling durable goods orders  Households are still reasonably optimistic about their job   prospects  Consumer spending continues to grow, albeit at a slower pace  The CEO of Disney   started his discussion with me this time by saying, “I hate to be the bearer of good news,” and   went on to cite an internal survey they recently completed that shows that families plan to spend   liberally on vacations, despite setbacks in presumed housing prices, as well as strong ad statistics   for their broadcasting network   There remain widespread reports of labor shortages, not just in our District but also   elsewhere  The bottom line, Mr Chairman, is that, there is clearly a fat left tail on growth—the   economy is growing slower  But the economy is growing at a positive pace  Some might say   that it has slowed to a sustainable pace  In part, this is due to infrastructure investment, spending   on nondefense capital goods that is better than expected, decent if not robust E&S demand, fiscal   stimulus, and strong export performance that we talked about earlier, assisted by superior   demand growth abroad, facilitated by a progressively weaker dollar  I note that we meet the day   October 30-31, 2007 32 of 162    after the trade-weighted dollar celebrated a post–Bretton Woods low—not an easy thing for a   strong dollar man to note   Certainly, there is a risk that downward economic momentum will emerge  I worry about   the plight of the big, populous states like Florida and California under the crush of the housing   implosion  I take note of the reports from UPS, the rails, and the truckers as to the deceleration   in year-over-year trends in pre-holiday shipments  I realize that Wal-Mart same-store growth has   slowed, that mall traffic is down, and so on  But not a single one of my thirty-five CEO   interlocutors, except for the homebuilders, felt that the economy was at risk of falling off the   table  Fluor and the other big builders—or logistics organizers, as I like to call them—report a   booming domestic infrastructure business, especially in the petrochemical sector  The   technology folks, as manifested by the earnings reports of Microsoft, Apple, and others, continue   to find that demand is brisk  Cisco’s CEO confirms that business with all but the financial   institutions “has begun to flow again” after being laid low by the uncertainty of August  The   airlines report volume conditions as “less bad” than they were in the third quarter  UPS’s CFO,   about to become CEO, who serves on President Lockhart’s board, is concerned, like the rails,   about consumer holiday demand, and notes that trans-Pacific shipments into the United States   have slowed  Yet when he digs deep into the data, he will tell you that the tech side looks good    So the net effect is that, while nowhere near robust, “domestically, conditions have not   materially worsened”   Except for housing and Bill’s two law firms, we are not hearing of significant lagging of   receivables or collectibles  Many of my interlocutors, however, worry about prices, as do our   staff members in Dallas  We differ significantly, Mr Chairman, from the central assumption of   the Greenbook in our views on headline inflation looking forward  I noticed you cocking an eye   October 30-31, 2007 33 of 162    in my direction, Brian, when you were talking about the outliers  The Greenbook has a 3 percent   number for PCE inflation for this year, followed by a deceleration, to a pace of 18 percent in   2008 and 17 in 2009  We in Dallas are not as confident that we will continue to experience a   disinflation of the momentum of the PCE  Partly this stems from concerns expressed anecdotally   by big importers like Wal-Mart, who report stiffening Chinese prices, by the CEO of JCPenney,   who is planning for cost increases of goods imported from China on the order of 3 to 4 percent   next year, and by the users of pulp and recycled waste paper that are set to announce a 5 percent   increase in essential paper products effective in February, having just announced a double-digit   increase not too long ago     Our concern at the Dallas Fed stems from two more-pervasive sources than that anecdotal   evidence I just cited, and those are food and energy, for which we anticipate a more pernicious   pass-through effect from recent rapid price increases of underlying commodities  The concern   we have for food is encapsulated in the eye-popping chart on page II-30 of Part 2 of the   Greenbook  You have to have a hawk’s eye to see this chart from that end of the table, but it   shows an incredible divergence between food prices and the core PCE  Now this pattern has a   historical precedent  A spread of this magnitude between food prices and core indexes occurred   on several occasions between 1951 and 1980  In 1973, the gap was 20 percent  In 1974, the gap   was closed when the CPI rose up accordingly  But we have not seen a gap of this nature in over   a quarter-century  Wholesale food prices are up 63 percent for the year to date  Through   September, the CPI for food is up 57 percent  As mentioned by one of the previous   interlocutors, milk and green grocery prices are rising at double-digit paces  This goes beyond   ethanol, Mr Chairman, as a driver of shifts in crop rotation and production  It is occurring   against a ramping up of the caloric intake of a few billion new eaters in China, India, and   October 30-31, 2007 34 of 162    elsewhere  This is hardly encouraging, and it injects a modicum of doubt in predicting a   significant decline in PCE inflation   We spoke about energy price dynamics earlier  They further cloud the picture  If you   talk to Exxon or Independence, they will tell you that there is no problem in finding oil, in   refining it, or in delivering the final product  They will, however, note that there are two key   impulses at work  First, there is no evident slowdown in demand growth according to them—  that is, domestically—and the appetite in the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) and in the   developing countries was described as voracious  An enormous amount of infrastructure in   chemical plant capacity is being constructed everywhere, from the Gulf Coast of the United   States to the Middle East to China and Singapore, in order to be nearer to either feedstock or   growing final demand  Any analysis of the income elasticity of demand for oil in low but rising   income nations like China and India points to demand for oil that will grow even faster than their   slightly slower but still rapidly growing income levels  Second, price pressures on crude at the   margin are compounded by noncommercial activity, which we did not talk about earlier    Noncommercial contracts, the busywork of what are called “city refiners” in the industry—that   is, the city of London and the financial exchanges—have of late been running at triple their   traditional volume according to Exxon’s CEO, driving oil through $90  Thus far, gasoline and   distillates, which is where the pass-through rubber hits the consumer price road, have been tame   in response  Bill discussed the low crack spread, for example  Yet our models at the Dallas Fed   for retail gasoline prices envision increases above $3 a gallon next year if crude stays above $85,   which we consider a reasonable probability  Similarly, price pressures for distillates are   increasingly probable  Finally, while currently high inventories continue, it is noteworthy that   natural gas prices have reversed their summer slide downward to $550 per million Btu and are   October 30-31, 2007 35 of 162    now quoted at $7 at the Henry Hub  All this gives me, Mr Chairman, a sense of discomfort, like   that expressed by President Hoenig and President Plosser, on the headline inflation front and is a   reminder that the balance of risk is not necessarily skewed only toward slower growth  Thank   you, Mr Chairman     No  But I am talking about a spread being maintained between the two,   and I am concerned about it, depending on where we are going to go in terms of our   communication exercise, which we will talk about tomorrow  But we don’t show as much relief   on PCE inflation as the Greenbook indicates nor as the central tendency indicates, and I wanted   to explain why    Or California    Mr Chairman, I just wanted to ask—and this is a question based on   ignorance—you’ve talked about nonresidential structures, and you mentioned drilling and   mining  One thing that has impressed me in talking to some of the bigger logistics companies—  Fluor, Bechtel, Zachry—are the enormous numbers in what I mentioned earlier—the   infrastructure developments in the Gulf Coast area and somewhat in the heartland, I think all the   way up to President Hoenig’s District  The numbers are quite large, and they continue to surge    Would that be part of this nonresidential structure investment number?   October 30-31, 2007 79 of 162     And the weight of construction and mining is what?      Yes, that’s what I thought    I think the two combined are something like that    Thank you    I have two questions  One just came to mind  We are talking about very   recent futures expectations  In light of what you just discussed, what has been the range in the   intermeeting period in terms of the odds of a 25 basis point cut?   October 30-31, 2007 86 of 162     So it has been all over the lot  My question really is maybe not so much   of Brian but just to inform a decision here, or at least to inform an input  There was some   discussion yesterday of strong hints about the need to have insurance—that is, insuring against   the risk of downside economic growth that might be more dramatic than we would like  We did   cut rates 50 basis points at the last meeting  David, when do you assume that kicks in—other   than the psychological effect?  I infer from the numbers in the Greenbook that you see it begin to   have an effect on the kind of economic growth we were supposing sometime in the second half   or at the end of the second quarter of next year  Or what is the lag?  We have already bought an   insurance policy  The question is, Is it enough?  So I’m curious as to what your assumption is as   to when that actually takes grip in the economy    Did it bump up your estimate for the second half of next year in terms of   economic growth from where it would have been had we not cut rates 50 basis points?    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Flying home last time I thought it would have   been nice to have been at the Bank of China and cut 37½ basis points  [Laughter]  I don’t want to   repeat what has already been said at the table because so much has been said  But it is important to   note that, since we last met, the data on the economy are stronger  Some of us have expressed   concerns about inflation  Credit markets, as I said yesterday, are at least in remission, if they   haven’t fully recovered, and are in better shape than they were  Listening to the arguments, I took   particular note of President Poole’s comment that he’s not sure that he wants to find out what the   market reaction would be if we did not cut rates 25 basis points  I lived through three market   corrections as a market operator, 1974-75, 1987, and 2001  I lived through a dollar crisis as a public   servant in the US Treasury  And I haven’t heard a person yet talk about some of the risk  The   Riksbank, by the way, last night and the Mexicans raised rates; but more important, the Europeans   are talking tough because of their concerns about inflation  I am worried about the pernicious   October 30-31, 2007 113 of 162    effects of inflation  I think President Hoenig hit the nail on the head when he said it’s easier to   lower than to raise   I would simply counsel, since I don’t have a vote, that we should consider the value of   keeping our powder dry  It’s very dangerous in my opinion for policymakers to be driven into a   cul-de-sac by futures markets  In response to the question I asked earlier, the markets have been all   over the lot  I am worried that we have too much of a discussion about what markets expect of us   since the fed funds rate is designed—as you have made very clear in your speeches, Mr   Chairman—to affect the economy and should be so driven  So were I to have a vote today, I would   be thinking along the lines of Presidents Hoenig, Plosser, and Rosengren in terms of their   expression  Everybody has been grappling with this issue  We would make a great wrestling team    We are thinking very hard about these matters  But in the balance of risks that I see, given the   improvement in the data, I’m tempted to consider the value of another cut as insurance against   weakness  Yet we took a huge step last time—we took out a double-barreled shotgun—and it   seems to be reflected in the data that the staff projected  I’m a little worried not so much of being   accused of being asleep at the wheel but of having our foot too heavily on the accelerator if we cut   25 basis points  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, I appreciate your answer  The one worry I have had about   this exercise, which is much better the way it is now expressed and presented—I think it is ready for   prime time—is that we might be divided as to our individual instincts  We do operate as a   Committee  We have said this a million times, but I’d like to reiterate it  To me it’s the last bastion   of integrity here in Washington  To go down a path of who is saying what just threatens to tear us   apart, and I would urge your response on everybody else as well  Thank you for the spirit in which   you answered that    We’re releasing this with the minutes?

8263,2007-12-06,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have a couple of questions, but first I want   to preface them with thanking the staff, you, and others who have improved this proposal  I was   a skeptic the last time around and was worried about certain issues and appreciate very much   being heard  Like President Lockhart, I am in favor of both the swap and the proposal for the   TAF  I do have some questions about the TAF, but I would like to preface them with just a   statement to put my questions in perspective   As you know, in my District we went through a period of enormous turmoil—bank   failures  You haven’t seen the person, Bob Hankins, seated on my left—I guess your right—  before  He is a battle-scarred veteran  He is one of the few people who had to sit down and   close and call a loan to two of the major banks in our system  The reason I mention it is that we   have had a tremendous period of tranquility over the past fifteen or so years, and one reason I am   in favor of this facility is that we are presented with very different circumstances currently  The   markets are different, the pressures on us are different, and I believe the threats to the system that   are posed by the mistakes that have been made are significant, and we need to figure out new   tools to utilize  The improvement in this tool from when it was first crafted and the architecture   that was suggested is significant, and I want to applaud and support the effort   I think a couple of things are very important against the background of what I just told   you  This is really a question for the staff  Having just gone through as we did with Sandy the   auction parameters—on the prepayment row there, it says, “Each Reserve Bank might be   provided discretion”  Given our experience, I would say that the words have to be “will be   December 6, 2007 19 of 51    provided discretion”  To me, that is critical  We have been through it before here, and I think   the banks have to have the option to make a loan callable   On the minimum-bid rate, I am a little worried about using the OIS, and I wonder if we   would consider using the T-bill or something simpler  The reason is that we have to go through   a huge educative effort if we use the OIS  I understand that at a recent meeting of the SCRM   (Subcommittee on Credit and Risk Management) nobody within our own SCRM knew what the   OIS was or they at least had to stretch to think about what it was  If we don’t know what it is—  and this is a sophisticated group of people—how do we explain it to the banks, to our own staff,   et cetera?  I just wonder if we couldn’t use something other than OIS or if there is a compelling   logic to using the OIS   I want to come back to Tom Hoenig’s point on the noncompetitive tenders  As you   know, I am very sensitive to that issue  I think we are subject to public criticism unless we get   down to the smaller banks  I would imagine that we will hear a lot during any comment period   after we initiate this project, and we have to be ready with an answer there  I want to make sure   that we do take care of the smaller banks   I would like to mention one other issue, and that is with regard to eligible depositories    This is a new facility  We are getting into the business of term lending  We are doing so under   unusual circumstances  I wonder whether we shouldn’t have some constraints, at least as this   institution evolves  Even if we are calling it temporary, I would be in favor of making it as   permanent as possible, once we get the kinks ironed out, by limiting those that can come to us at   the beginning and then broadening it out  I am not talking about big banks versus little banks    But I am wondering if we shouldn’t limit this thing just to those with CAMELS ratings of 1 or 2   rather than all comers  I think that might take some of the stigma out of the system, by the way   December 6, 2007 20 of 51    So those are really the points that I wish to make at this juncture  I support the initiative    I would like to get answers to those questions  I guess I am satisfied by the answer that was   given to Bill Poole’s question on the need for this in addition to current ECB capacity  Thank   you, Mr Chairman    And on the callable issue?    Thank you very much  On the OIS thing, again, I would just ask you to   consider if there is not another metric we might use    December 6, 2007 21 of 51     Do we know how many banks are eligible, what the number is?  We talk   about education  I’m just curious  What’s the universe?  "
8287,2007-12-11,"  Bill, we talked a bit about this on the phone yesterday, but on the four   relatively optimistic points that you mentioned, the fourth point, which is what I call the   substitutability of capital, we are seeing new sources  One of them is measurable, which is the   GIC in Singapore  But do we have any sense of the dimension that is available for substitution,   and is there a way to get a better sense of measurement?  I just want to preface this by saying that   we went through the petrodollar issue in 1974  Some of us were very involved in that exercise    It is a much more sophisticated business right now, and we have much more sophisticated   investors  What we don’t know—or I don’t know and I would be curious whether we know at   the New York Desk—is how big this money is and how much is available to be tapped    Nonetheless, they can restore tier 1 capital, as we saw in the case of UBS    I mean, that is how markets work    Well, I wanted to thank you for at least raising four rays of dim sunlight    Actually, Mr Chairman, I have a statement disguised as a question    [Laughter]  I am glad on the international side that we raised the issue of food price inflation, not   because it is on the cover of The Economist but because we discussed it at our last meeting    What is curious to me, David, is that there is only one line on page 13 of the Greenbook  It says,   “At the same time, agricultural producers are expected to step up output of farm products, and   that should help bring consumer food price inflation more in line with core inflation”  My   statement is that, given our communication exercise, we are drawing more attention to headline   PCE  My question is, Do I understand it correctly that the food weight in the PCE is twice that   of energy and in the CPI is 1½ times that of energy?  Therefore, why are we not talking about   food price inflation as it affects headline inflation numbers, and why do we spend so much time   on energy relative to food?  That is my question  Or are we just not worried about food?  The   second question—by the way, on the international side, as well as the domestic side—is, What is   the basis for our optimism that food prices will come down against the background of the   demand that you have described on the international side?  Thank you    Thank you    Thank you for your thorough answer    Well, Mr Chairman, having listened to various views starting with President   Yellen, on the one end, and President Plosser, on the other, and President Hoenig on inflation, I was   December 11, 2007 60 of 138    thinking that Edward R Murrow said that anybody who isn’t confused really doesn’t understand the   situation  [Laughter]  I’m confused, and I don’t understand the situation  I would like to report   what I see, however  First, in terms of my District—in sharp contrast to the Twelfth District,   because I think they are two extremes, or, say, Florida, in President Lockhart’s District—  employment growth has slowed  I mention this because last time I mentioned a data point, which is   that within our District—actually in one state—year to date we may have created up to one-fifth of   the jobs in this country  We were growing our employment base at 39 percent in the first quarter    We expected it to slow to 31 in the third quarter and then to slow down to the high 2s as we   approached the end of the year  Housing prices in our District are appreciating, and we’re   benefiting from what we call the California diaspora—that is, particularly the techies and others,   who are pushing up prices in Dallas and Austin  Finally, one point to bear in mind is wage pressure    Oil and gas extraction represents only 2 percent of the employment of Texas, despite how   everybody stereotypes our state  Yet the wage index in that industry and the labor shortage are   putting enormous pressure on skilled labor in other areas, and the overall wage index for our District   is rising at the highest rate since January  Unemployment is down to 41 percent for our District    So like President Plosser, we are enjoying a relatively strong situation   However, my views on policy are not governed by the outlier District that I inhabit, and I’d   like just to give some anecdotal evidence, for what it is worth, since most of the information I was   going to impart has been given by other thoughtful people at this table  First of all, on the growth   side, my conversations with the CEO of MasterCard were quite detailed this month because I was   following up on what I was hearing from retailers at different price points  He said that retail sales   through November were up 6 percent year over year; taking out gasoline, 4 percent  He reported   that most banks are expressing some concern about receivables growth in California, Florida,   December 11, 2007 61 of 138    Nevada, and Arizona  But elsewhere and at the largest issuers, as he put it, he does not see   consumers running up their lines  I think this is in keeping with chart 4, the middle panel, in the   Bluebook, which shows consumer credit fairly steady as you go through time and not significantly   increasing  Second, the CEO of Wal-Mart USA—since you didn’t mention Wal-Mart—feels a shift   in view in that consumers, as he said with a terrible pun, have driven through $300 gas—that is,   they accept $300 gas  The CEO of JCPenney, who reported before our last meeting that he felt that   “the wheels were coming off the economy,” has sales 10 percent year over year to date through last   Monday  As to Black Friday, yes, there was discounting on Black Friday  For JCPenney, their total   volume was up almost 30 percent over their previous record year, and there is a sense in the retail   industry that there may be a calming down between the two periods—the prolonged shopping   period that you mentioned  Nonetheless, most of the retailers I speak to at different price points on   the gross side are happier than they expected to be  Another phenomenon that seems to be   occurring is an increase in confidence with regard to inventory management  That was best   expressed by the CEO of Texas Instruments, who reported that, when we last met and actually   during the summer, there was almost a freeze in terms of the willingness to build inventory and that   their customers were not willing to think beyond thirty days  Now, having looked through the   clouds that are presented on the financial front, which I’ll address very briefly in a second, they see   more willingness for ninety-day commitments     On almost every other front, with the exception of the homebuilders, I haven’t heard from   my CEO contacts the negativism that, again, is reflected on the Wall Street side of the equation,   with three exceptions  In terms of the airline industry, Southwest Airlines’ overall volume is down   36 percent in the third quarter  It’s pretty uniform across all Districts, including my own  We   talked about trucks earlier  One of my contacts is the largest truck dealer in the country  He   December 11, 2007 62 of 138    estimates according to what he calls, if you’ll forgive the expression, SWAG—which is   “sophisticated, wild-assed guess”  I ask for the transcript to put the third letter in the third word as   in a snake rather than the posterior  [Laughter]  But the estimate of Class A truck sales, whether   they’re going to Russia or not, was 350,000 in ’07  The original forecast for ’08 was 280,000, and   they now estimate 200,000  So there is a significant slackening on that front   Finally, with regard to the housing market, you obviously don’t want to talk to anybody in   the homebuilding industry currently  But those with the strong balance sheets are taking advantage   of weaknesses in certain areas, and I’ll give you one data point that was startling  In the   Sacramento, California, area, one of the large house builders just bought a fully developed set of   lots that were priced at $175,000 a lot and the going price was $35,000 a lot  Significant deflation   clearly is occurring in that sector—but also significant opportunity   I’d like to address the inflation situation more thoroughly, Mr Chairman  The CEO of   Wal-Mart USA said that, for the first time in his career at that firm, they have approved a plan in   which purchase costs will increase 3 percent in ’08  He hadn’t seen that before in his experience   and said, “I’m totally used to deflation  Deflation is finished”  In terms of the suppliers to   Wal-Mart, this was verified  I think on food prices we have to be extremely careful  Frito-Lay is   seeking a 5½ percent price increase for next year  Wal-Mart has acquiesced  According to the CFO   of that company, that’s the highest rate in fifteen years  Kimberly-Clark and other paper producers,   as I reported before, pushed through price increases  Procter & Gamble and others have followed    In terms of the energy situation—whether it is, as I mentioned before, Exxon or the large   independents—they don’t see much price relief other than what is the variable factor presented by   the so-called city refiners   December 11, 2007 63 of 138    Our own data at the Dallas Federal Reserve indicate on the international side that there has   been some slackening as indicated in the Bluebook, but our work with JPMorgan and the index   we’re developing indicate that capacity remains very tight and that the tight capacity has added to   fuel and food prices and may well explain why inflation in the euro zone, the United Kingdom,   Japan, and other areas, including Canada, is higher than the benign trends they’ve been experiencing   or are targeting in countries like Mexico  So on net, Mr Chairman, from our perspective, I can’t   say I much agree with the Greenbook because I have different views about business investment—  I’m hearing reports of significant cap-ex expansion—and, on the inflation front, I believe that we   are understating inflationary pressures   Now, very quickly on the comment that was made about conditions in financial markets   having worsened  We hear this repeatedly  President Plosser mentioned price discovery  I think   we have to be very, very careful to not overreact to what we see developing on Wall Street and to   realize that there are benefits to price discovery  It is because of that price discovery that we’re   seeing a substitution effect, which I referenced in my questions earlier  It may be equity for debt,   but it is restoring balance sheets, and reasonable prices obtain  I would argue that it is a healthier   condition than, as I said earlier, living in the fantasy world where we were pricing things at   ridiculous levels rather than realistic levels   We’ll come to the policy discussion shortly, but I would like to ask when we have that   discussion what we are really buying with a fed funds rate cut—given the other mechanism that   we’re going to be putting forward and, very, very important, remembering as President Hoenig,   President Plosser, and others have mentioned that we still have significant price pressures baked   into the cake  Thank you, Mr Chairman   December 11, 2007 64 of 138     Mr Chairman, I don’t think I could have said it better than Governor   Kohn said it  I am on his wavelength  I would just add a couple of things that I would suggest   we consider  First of all, with regard to the financial situation, which is obviously driving this   conversation, I appreciate the medical pathology that the Vice Chairman suggested  We have   gone now from cardiology, which is my thing, to this fever and the fever breaking, and so on  I   combine it with a bit of the strawman that Governor Warsh raised  No one has suggested a   panacea  No one has suggested that the existing pool of ersatz money, outside money, or shadow   money is fully sufficient to relieve the stress the system is under  What has changed, however,   since the August crisis is the process of price discovery  We are beginning to actually get   realistic pricing  I spent twenty-one years buying distressed assets on Wall Street  I think I   understand the process  It is a patient process, and it takes time  But I think that is the only   difference  We have begun the process; it has a long way to go  We have enormous risks, and I   fully agree with Vice Chairman Geithner that there is significant risk that might stem from this    But let’s not also understate the fact that some adjustment has begun and that is good news   I would suggest 25 basis points, Mr Chairman, because I think we have to be very wary   of shooting an entire bolt here  If we do 50 basis points plus the TAF plus the swap lines—this   is all very subjective—my opinion is that we would scare the hell out of the markets  There is a   significant risk if we send a signal, as was previously said—I think Brian may have said this—  that we have information that other people do not have  President Lockhart referred to delicate   psychology  From a risk-management standpoint, I think the psychology is the opposite of what   he stated, which is that we are at risk of interfering with the beginning of the adjustment process   that I just described  If people feel that we know more than they do, that we have greater fear of   the downside, you are going to see a delay in that adjustment  They are wanting to step up and   December 11, 2007 109 of 138    cherry-pick a little before you start going through the whole orchard  So those would be the two   factors that I would suggest  I want to come back to the last point  Our job is to keep inflation at   bay  The nominal anchor you mentioned is critical  I heard more people speak around this table   about being worried about inflation than did not so speak     And a second-to-the-last point  I agree with President Poole and the suggestion of, I   think, Charlie Plosser  I would like to be like the Reserve Bank of Australia and raise the rates   despite the political election, if we had to  But I think the scrutiny of this institution will be   intense, and my preferred mode is just to stay out of the way  I think it is politically very brave   and possibly foolish to say that, well, if we do too much here, we can always pull it back  There   will be a lot different circumstances next year, and I worry that we may do too much  I would be   against 50 basis points  I would be in favor of 25 basis points, and I would be in favor of   alternative B as stated, if I had a vote  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Mr Chairman, I just want to make sure that I heard you clearly earlier    We have kept this contained, including the swap ranges, which is very impressive  Everybody   should pat themselves on the back  [Laughter]  We’re broadening the circle tonight or this   afternoon, and I’m not quite sure what your message is  I assume that we are announcing it   tomorrow morning because of the international complexities  Nobody seems to know about this   yet that I am aware of  Do you want us to inform our full boards, or do you want us just to   inform our chairmen, or do it late tonight, or is it up to our discretion?  I just worry about   leakage   December 11, 2007 124 of 138     I just wanted to make sure there wasn’t a subtext to the message, but I’ve   got it  Thank you  "
8308,2008-01-09,"  Bill, on the five-year, five-year-forward, doesn’t the Markets Group also   have its own measurement, and is it as low as the Board measurement?      I agree that we shouldn’t place a whole lot of weight on this thing  We   have been talking about this, Mr Chairman, on the morning call  There may be some anomalies   here, but I wouldn’t place a whole lot of weight on that  I just wanted to get a sense of how the   Board’s measurement was different  It looks to me to be more range-bound, just to use your   term, Bill, but that’s not a point worth spending much time on  Thank you    Thank you    Dave, you very eloquently summarized in your statement that downside   risks are more palpable  Certainly they seem to be more palpable  But the bigger adjustments I   see in your numbers, at least for the first quarter of 2008 and for the year 2008—even larger than   the adjustments you made on economic growth—are those on inflation  I’m wondering if you   could just comment on that, please, and give us a sense of that palpability, as it were     Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Like you, I am increasingly concerned about   the downside on the economic growth side of the equation  I would very much appreciate—  perhaps all of us would appreciate—getting sort of a transcript of the numbers you gave us and   perhaps some of the BIS data between now and the time we meet because it might be most   helpful in our analyzing the situation  I just have a couple of comments     First, I agree with President Stern and President Lacker—this is not the time to make a   decision that is of this import  I think it would frighten the markets, and it would perhaps add to   the urgency of concern that you are concerned about  In other words, it would compound our   problems rather than solve our problems  I am not sure where I stand as far as the upcoming   meeting is concerned  I would like to get some more data  I think we will have a little more   inflation data by that time  We will have a better sense other than just the employment numbers   and, again, if we are able to study what you learned at the BIS, will be better informed  I don’t   like the idea of making a decision of this nature outside normal channels  In fact, I think the   impression that you, sir, have given directly to the markets is that you don’t feel comfortable   either making a fed funds decision outside the normal channels     I am always concerned when we talk about what market expectations are because in this   recent cycle, and the mood that the market is in, as one of my friends put it, we give the market a   January 9, 2008 25 of 60    gift of a rate cut and then they burst into tears and run outside the room after they have   unwrapped the package  I think we have to be very careful here about thinking that we are going   to satisfy markets somehow  I don’t think the market is in that kind of mood, and my experience   as a market operator indicates that, almost in any context, we are not going to get it just right   with markets  I think we have to do what is right for the economy   The other point I would make is in terms of the 1990-93 experience and the 2001   experience  This is something that we need to think through a bit further, at least here in Dallas    There is a difference in the sense that a lot of the inflationary pressures we are feeling are   demand-pull inflationary forces that are coming from newly emergent economies that are at a   point in their growth cycle where they are kicking in to caloric and BTU intake at a much faster   rate than the rate that they are growing  If we were a closed economy, of course, the issue of   labor prices and so on would bear an enormous amount of weight, and the concerns that have   been expressed would be most consequential  They are still consequential, but I am not   convinced at this point in the evolution of the global economy that we are likely to see as much   mitigation as the staff is forecasting  It is just a question mark, but I think we should be aware of   it  So, in summary, I don’t think we should decide at this meeting  I think it would be the wrong   signal to send  It goes outside the norm, including the norm that I believe you yourself have   expressed     On the questions you asked about signaling, we just received a memo from the   representative from Nashville—that is, Governor Kohn—about being very careful what we   signal in our speeches  I think that is a very delicate thing to do, Mr Chairman, in terms of   building expectations that may or may not be fulfilled or may be misinterpreted  So I have the   same concerns that President Lacker expressed on being proactive   January 9, 2008 26 of 60    One last comment  No matter what you say, and in terms of representing our views and   your views, it is very, very important to remind everyone that we have a dual mandate  The   mandate is, of course, about employment growth, but we also have a mandate on the inflationary   front  I still have concerns that we might be planting some seeds that could later germinate more   rapidly than we would like to see them germinate if indeed we don’t have the kind of weakness   that we are all afraid of currently  So I think it is constantly helpful, especially coming from you   as our leader, to make sure that we reinforce the dual mandate without scaring the markets that   we are not aware of the potential tail risk of severe economic weakness  Thank you, Mr   Chairman   "
8329,2008-01-21,"  There are some pros to moving now, and there are some cons  Clearly,   one of the pros is that we would have the element of surprise  It is a holiday  We have the   benefit of some knowledge of new data and what has happened in the market starting in Asia and   rolling through Europe, which Bill walked us through  I do have some concerns, however, Mr   Chairman  I know you know what they are  I articulated them in a speech in Philadelphia, and   we discussed these a bit  I have basically the same concerns that President Poole, President   Hoenig, and President Lacker have  The question is, What do we get for this?  What   expectations do we build in for future decisionmaking?  My biggest concern, however, is that I   have yet to see convincing evidence that we are seeing movement on the inflation front  If we   were to cut rates to this level today, as of now, in terms of the headline CPI and PCE numbers,   we would have a negative real rate of interest, and I don’t understand quite fully what the   consequence of that would be  The projections in the Greenbook are just that—they are   projections  They can be right, and they can be wrong, as thoughtfully as they are constructed     Unlike President Rosengren, although I am only about 30 percent of my way through my   CEO calls in preparing for the meeting, I don’t hear a widespread expectation of recession  I do   hear a concern about slowing down, and we have seen that in all of the indexes that I like to talk   about in the meetings from the credit card payables, delinquencies in payments, the Baltic index,   et cetera, et cetera  But the words “severe recession” I have yet to hear from the lips of anybody   but those in the housing business, and for them, it gets more severe with each passing moment    So I am not convinced of the economic case, and yet I can see where there are some   benefits to moving now  The real question is, What do we do next?  If the markets react by   blowing us off, does that mean that we will be expected to move aggressively at the next meeting   and then the next meeting after that?  Or as President Poole has mentioned, does that mean that   January 21, 2008 17 of 32    we will have to have some more interim meetings?  I am a little worried about being trapped by   this concept of being behind the curve  There is a fine line between being behind the curve and   what may be an overreaction  But, Mr Chairman, I don’t have a vote at this meeting, and I   would just ask you to consider the arguments that have been put forward by Mr Poole, Mr   Hoenig, and Mr Lacker and the ones that I have just given  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8348,2008-01-29,"  The questions that President Lacker asked covered one of the questions I   wanted to ask  But as we go down in terms of the number of bidders as we proceed, is the portion   that is foreign increasing, relatively speaking?  Do we know?    Thank you, President Lacker    First, I, too, wanted to thank you all for the paper on forward inflation   compensation  I agree with the conclusion that it is difficult  Especially in times of strained   trading conditions, I think that is the conclusion—whether you interpret the outcome the way it   was interpreted in the paper or the way I do it more cynically, I think that is the key underlying   point  I thought that was a very valuable, useful paper, and I want to thank you, Governor   Mishkin, for commissioning it   My question is to Nathan on your inflation projections  Reading through the   Greenbook—even though the section on the international side is very thin—with the exception   of China, where I think we can sell a lot of “Whip Inflation Now” buttons, and of Argentina,   where the numbers are rigged, but even in those countries, what I took home was that everybody   was surprised on the upside in every country ranging from the advanced countries, as we call   them, to Turkey  Then, if you look at the exhibit 15 that you just presented to us, those numbers   are confirmed in the fourth quarter, and then there is a sharp falloff proceeding from there  You   gave us a good analysis of the risk to the foreign outlook in growth, and then you concluded your   comment on inflation by saying that we have been wrong before, that there is some upside risk    So my question is, What are the risks on the inflation side?  Could you elaborate on them, just as   you elaborated on the risks to growth in the foreign outlook?    But I am very serious about this  Suddenly there is a falloff  Would you   give us a sense of the risk?  It can’t be all one-sided    Thank you    First, Mr Chairman, I want to say a good word about President Poole  I   have sat next to him since I got here  I would give him hyperbolic praise if he hadn’t handed me   the IT Oversight Committee; otherwise, I think he is a wonderful human being  [Laughter]    Much of what I was going to say has been said  I think President Plosser, President Lacker, and   others have summarized what I would have said about my own District  We continue to grow,   but at a decelerated pace, and our current forecast is for employment growth of 2 percent for our   District for 2008  That is relatively healthy, and I really am not going to take more time on that   subject   I am delighted to hear all this anecdotal evidence  We were talking, Governor Mishkin   and I, about Woody Allen earlier  If I remember correctly, he had a wonderful quip—that he   cheated on his metaphysics exam by looking into another boy’s soul  [Laughter]  Basically,   what we are doing at this time of transition is almost cheating on the data by looking at the   January 29–30, 2008 70 of 249    anecdotal evidence  My broader CEO soundings indicate pretty much the same as what we are   seeing in our District and what others have mentioned—shipping, rail, express delivery,   manufacturing, and other activities are much slower  Retail sales are soft  As President Poole   and others pointed out, truckers are suffering  Receivables are being stretched out    Delinquencies are rising  I could bore you with specifics company by company, as I am tempted   to do, but I will not unless you wish me to  The point is that, while there are tales of woe, none   of the 30 CEOs to whom I talked, outside of housing, see the economy trending into negative   territory  They see slower growth  Some of them see much slower growth  None of them at this   juncture—the cover of Newsweek notwithstanding, a great contra-indicator, which by the way   shows “the road to recession” on the issue that is about to come out—see us going into recession    I will just give you two indicators there  If you look at MasterCard and dig into their data, their   December retail sales ex-auto, ex-gas, were up 5 percent and in January to date were up 4   percent  President Poole mentioned UPS, and President Lockhart has the incoming CEO of UPS   on his board  Year over year to January, they are up 2 percent  So it is anemic  It is not   negative  The expectation is not to be negative  My CEO soundings indicate pretty much what   we have forecast as a group—much slower growth, not necessarily a recession     Where the difference comes, Mr Chairman, is on the inflation front  Others have spoken   eloquently about inflation  I just want to make a couple of comments here  It is uncanny in the   charts that we show in exhibit 5, for example, that we have food PCE prices and energy PCE   prices peaking almost as we speak  That may be true in the spot markets  That is not the way it   works in reality  AT&T has 100,000 trucks  Southwest Airlines has I don’t know how many   airplanes  They contract and hedge out forward their energy costs, and the kick-in of any   turndown does not occur immediately but rather is stretched out over a time period  I would ask   January 29–30, 2008 71 of 249    our staff, as we go forward, to try to get a better feeling for that  We are certainly struggling   with that in Dallas  As far as food prices are concerned, which again I remind you are twice the   weight of energy prices in the headline PCE and the CPI, I heard some very disturbing news    Frito-Lay, for example, which when we last met I reported was going to increase prices   3 percent, has inched them up another 3 percent, to 6 percent, and that is their planning for the   year  This is the first time in memory, according to my contacts, that grocery prices are rising   faster than restaurant food  Yet it is not simply food where we are seeing this kind of pressure,   and I want to come back to the lag effect that occurs  This morning the CEO of Burlington   Northern told me that the so-called rail adjustment factor, which captures fuel, labor, supply, and   other costs from the previous quarter and is contractually input into contracts for the coming   quarter, rose at the highest rate in history—11 percent  That means that even if you are shipping   lumber, even if you are shipping whatever goes into housing, by contract—of course, that can be   negotiated, I am sure—for the coming quarter the price rise from the shippers, the railers, will be   11 percent  Finally, going back to food and other items bought by consumers—when you drill   down deep into Wal-Mart, which has 127 million customers, and you talk about the specifics of   their sales, their expansion is not coming from unit sales, it is coming from price inflation  A   senior official there tells me that they are budgeting a 2 to 3 percent increase for nonfood items   for ’08, 6 to 7 percent for food items  It is the first time in his fifteen-year history at the   company that they are going to use their price leadership strategy on the plus side of the inflation   ledger  So I do worry about inflation expectations, Mr Chairman  I will summarize with the   statement that was in today’s New York Times by the CEO of Tyson Foods, who said, “Because   of the unanticipated high corn and soybean meal costs, we have no choice but to raise prices   January 29–30, 2008 72 of 249    substantially”  That is my major concern besides the additional weakness we are seeing in the   economy  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Well, Mr Chairman, I’ve seen the discount rate tally  I’ve listened carefully   to all my fellow Presidents and to Governor Kohn  I suspect I know what your fellow Governors   are going to recommend  I’m in a distinct minority at this table  This weekend, by the way, I   searched the newspapers for something to read that didn’t have anything to do with either a rogue   French trader or market volatility or what the great second guessers were blabbing forth at the chat   show in Davos; and in doing so I happened upon a delightful article  I hope you saw it in the   Saturday New York Times on the search for a motto that captures the essence of Britain  My   favorite was nemo ne inclune lacet, which very loosely translated, I think, means “never sit on a   thistle”  [Laughter]  Well, that’s where I am  I’m going to risk sitting on the thistle of opprobrium   January 29–30, 2008 137 of 249    for my respective colleagues by making the recommendation that we not change the funds rate and   that we stay right where we are   Now, for the record, I would have supported last week’s 75 basis point cut for the reasons   that it would put us ahead of the curve and bought adequate insurance against a recession  I told   you that directly, Mr Chairman, and I mentioned it to Governor Kohn as well  Judging by the   policy rules on page 21 of the Bluebook, as well as by the adjusted rule that our economist Evan   Koenig has developed in Dallas, we are, indeed, ahead of the curve from the Taylor rule standpoint   as we meet today with the rate of 350  As was mentioned earlier, we have not been docile  We   have cut rates 175 basis points in a matter of months, and we’ve taken some new initiatives that I   think are constructive and useful  I’d like to see more along the lines of the TAF  To be sure, in the   discussion that we had in that emergency meeting, I had the same concerns that President Hoenig   expressed in the call, but with the wording change that was put forward by Governor Kroszner I   ended up where President Hoenig did  I regret not voicing my discomfort with the penultimate   sentence in the statement—the one dealing with appreciable downside risk after the move we   took—as I felt that it undercut the potential effect of our decision  During that call, you may recall   that I pointed out the pros and cons  I began my intervention on that call by saying that there’s a   very fine line between getting ahead of the curve and creating a sense of panic  I also expressed   concern of the need to be mindful of inflation, as many have at this table today  There are some   critics who say we panicked in response to the market sell-off of that Monday  I do not believe   that’s the case, and I don’t believe it’s the case because I find it impossible to believe  As I’ve said   repeatedly in this room, other than in theory, markets are not efficient, and on the banks of the   Hudson or the Thames or the Yangtze River, you cannot in practice satisfy the stock market or most   other markets, including the fed funds futures market, in the middle of a mood swing  When the   January 29–30, 2008 138 of 249    market is in the depressive phase of what President Lockhart referred to as a bipolar disorder,   crafting policy to satisfy it is like feeding Jabba the Hutt—doing so is fruitless, if not dangerous,   because it simply will insist upon more  But attempting to address the pathology of the underlying   economy is necessary and righteous, and that’s what we do for a living, and I think we are best   sticking with it  We’re talking about the fed funds rate  I liken the fed funds rate to a good single   malt whiskey—it takes time to have its ameliorative or stimulative effect  [Laughter]   But I’m also mindful of psychology, and that’s what I want to devote the remainder of my   comment to, and then I’ll shut up  My CEO contacts tell me that we’re very close to the “creating   panic” line  They wonder if we know something that they do not know, and the result is, in the   words of the CEO of AT&T, Randall Stephenson, “You guys are talking us into a recession”  To   hedge against that risk is something to them unforeseen, even after they avail themselves of the   most sophisticated analysis that money can buy  CEOs are, indeed, doing what one might expect    They are tightening the ship  They’re cutting head counts to lower levels  They’re paring back cap-  ex where they can beyond the levels they would otherwise consider appropriate after imputing dire   assumptions of the effects of housing  I’m going to quote Tim Eller, whom I consider the most   experienced and erudite of the big homebuilders, which is Centex, who told me, “We had just begun   to feel that we were getting somewhat close to at least a sandy bottom  Then you cut 75 basis points   and add ‘appreciable downside risks to economic growth remain’ in your statement, and it scares   the ‘beep’ out of us”  He didn’t use the word “beep”  These are his words, not mine  Imagine   scaring a homebuilder already living in hell  The CEOs and CFOs I speak to from Disney to   Wal-Mart, to UPS, to Texas Instruments, Cisco, Burlington Northern, Southwest Airlines,   Comerica, Frost Bank, even the CEO of the felicitously named Happy State Bank in Texas,   repeated this refrain, “You must see something that we simply do not see through our own business   January 29–30, 2008 139 of 249    eyes”  They do see a slowdown  They are worried about the pratfall, as I like to call it, of housing    They’re well aware of California’s and Florida’s economic implosion and broader hits to consumer   welfare across the national map  I recited some data points from those calls yesterday  But they do   not see us falling off the table  They worry aloud that by our words and deeds we are inciting the   very economic outcome we seek to cut off at the pass by inducing them to further cut costs, defer   cap-ex, and take other actions to hedge against risk  They can’t fathom it but assume that we can   Our Beige Book contacts and the respondents to the business outlook survey in Dallas say   pretty much the same thing  One of those actions is to fatten margins by passing on input costs    Now, I mentioned the rail adjustment factor yesterday, and I’m troubled by the comment that I   quoted yesterday from the CEO of Tyson Foods  “We have no choice but to raise prices   substantially”  I mentioned that Frito-Lay has upped its price increase target for ’08 to 7 percent   from 3 percent  Kimberly-Clark notes that it is finding no resistance at all to increasing prices in   both its retail and institutional markets, and I mentioned that Wal-Mart’s leaders confirm that, after   years of using their price leadership power to deflate or disinflate the price of basic necessities—  think about this—from food to shoes to diapers, they plan in 2008 to apply that price leadership to   accommodate price increases for 127 million weekly customers  This can’t help but influence   inflation expectations among consumers     I experienced a different kind of price shock two weekends ago, when I went to buy a   television so I could watch President Rosengren’s football team demolish President Yellen’s    [Laughter]  I was told that they had doubled their delivery and installation fees because of a “fuel   surcharge”  Well, I reminded the store clerk that I had been there about the time of the Army-Navy   game, around Thanksgiving, and that gas prices had not doubled since the Army-Navy game, and   he said, “Mr Fisher, we’re selling less, and we will take what we can get away with however we   January 29–30, 2008 140 of 249    can get away with it”  With one-year-forward consumer expectations, according to the Michigan   survey, already above 3 percent, everyone from Exxon to Valero to Hunt Oil and our own   economists in the Greenbook telling me that oil is likely to stay above $80, and the national average   price therefore above $3, this mindset really worries me  I’m going to add one more very troubling   little personal anecdote  Driving home from work last week I heard a commercial for Steinway   pianos  The essence of the advertisement was that manufacturing costs had increased and that you   could buy a piano out of their current inventory at the “old price” that was in place in 2007; but   come February 1, there would be sizable price increases, so you’d better purchase your piano   quickly  It has been thirty years since I have seen advertisements to go out and buy now before the   big expected price increases go into effect  Now, this is an isolated, little bitty incident, but I fear   this may be just the beginning of the more pervasive use of this tactic   Everyone in this room knows how agnostic I am about the predictive value of TIPS and the   futures instruments comparing TIPS with nominals, like the five-year, five-year-forward  I’ve sent   around an eye popping chart that shows the predictive deficiencies of the professional forecasters   that were tracked by the Philadelphia Fed  I know that dealers are telling us that inflation is   contained, but I have spent many years in the canyons of Wall Street, and I would caution against   their disinterest in the predictions that they offer  When I see that every measure of inflation has   turned up, learn from studying the entrails of the last PCE that 83 percent of the items therein   experienced a price upswing, consider the shortcomings of the few tools we have for evaluating   expectations of future inflation, and then hear from microeconomic operators of the economy that,   by golly, we’re going to take what we can while the getting is good, I can’t help but feel that we   cannot afford to let our guard down by becoming more accommodative than we have already   become with our latest move   January 29–30, 2008 141 of 249    Mr Chairman, you know because we’ve talked about this that I’ve anguished over this  In   fact, to be politically incorrect in a government institution, I have prayed over it  It is not easy to go   against the will of the people you have enormous respect for, but I have an honest difference of   opinion  I truly believe we have it right at 3½ percent right now  I think that, even with some   important language changes, we risk too much by cutting 50 basis points at this juncture and driving   the real rate further into what I perceive, even on an expectations-adjusted basis, is getting very   close to negative territory  Mr Chairman, I think we’ve gone as far as is prudent for now, and that   3½ percent, together with the other initiatives we’ve taken to restore liquidity, is sufficient  So I ask   for your forbearance in letting me sit on the thistle of recommending no change   I do want to say as far as the language is concerned, since obviously we’re going to go with   alternative B despite my vote against it, that I strongly recommend you consider the changes that   were given by Presidents Plosser, Yellen, and Poole, and I would strongly advocate particularly at   the end adding that we will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth    I thank you for paring back alternative B, paragraph 3, in terms of getting away from discussing   only energy, commodity, and other import prices  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Going back to exhibit 5, the second panel, your point that we have no   evidence of conflicts of interest having an effect on ratings, I am thinking about the investor-  practices presentation  There is an inherent conflict of interest because the issuers pay the raters    By one account, Moody’s earned 44 percent of their revenue in 2006 from rating structured   products  I have always wondered—and by the way, I have been on the side of the table that has   worked a rating agency and have gotten what I wanted—what about just a common sense   solution, which is that the investors rather than the issuers pay the rating agencies?    I am well aware of that  But is there an inherent conflict of interest in the   process?   January 29–30, 2008 171 of 249     Again, remember how costly it has proven to investors to have that built-  in conflict of interest  That’s all  That’s my say    Arthur Andersen    May I just suggest that you reexamine that proposition?  They usually   evaluate performance principally after going through initial screening devices  They almost never,   that I’m aware of, provide the kind of analysis that you’re assuming  So I would reexamine that   proposition  "
8380,2008-03-10,"  Mr Chairman, you wanted to have a go-round, but I do have some   questions    Well, Bill, you used the term “presumably prudential regulation,” I think   it was  We are talking about broker–dealers  This gets to a broader concern that I have, which is   March 10, 2008 10 of 39    the stick part of this  I can understand the carrot side of this thing, and we are doing it for the   reasons that you stated, and I am very sympathetic to the argument  The question is, What do we   get in return, and how do we make sure that, since we are not the regulator of these dealers, there   is indeed discipline?  I would like to know what your answer is  Do we have an arrangement   with the SEC, or how do we work with the other regulators to make sure that discipline is   applied here?  In essence, as I understand this in my simple fashion, obviously we are taking   lesser-quality paper in return for high-quality paper over the defined time frame that you stated   and under the conditions that you stated  But I am just a little worried about being taken   advantage of here  So the question is specifically about the “prudential regulation” of those   people that we’re dealing with  Then, I have other questions to follow    Again, I think it would be helpful, Mr Chairman—you and I talked about   this a little last night—to have a full understanding of that strong support because it is critical   input  Just to move on, on the question of the haircut, as I understand it from the paper, on the   non-OMO eligible collateral, we are talking about an 8 percent haircut—is that correct?    The only thing I would caution about is the sentence in the paper that said   “conservative relative to pre-crisis levels”  Those were fantastically low spreads that were out of   touch with reality, which we now know  Obviously, you are going to be prudent about this, but   it seems to me that 8 percent is not much more than what we have on the TAF now  Is it   7 percent that we apply as a discount?    Well, I had some other questions, Mr Chairman, but I don’t want to bore   the group  I would like to listen to the conversation  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Yes, sir  I want to come back to President Rosengren’s question, just so I   understand this  Bill, let’s take an example  What I think Eric is referring to is footnote 6 on   page 9 of 10  “The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reserves the right to restrict individual   primary dealer use of the program, even at the outset”  Do we have the capacity, for example,   going back to your introductory comments on what happened in the markets, to evaluate Bear   Stearns as a participant in this program and to say, “No, you can’t participate”?  If we did that,   what would that do to Bear Stearns?    I guess my concern is that the safety-and-soundness disciplines that we   apply don’t appear to be applied to these broker–dealers  I guess the real question is that we can   fly blind for a little time and we can try something—and I am for trying something—but if this   doesn’t lead to some broader regulatory authority or some change in the nature of the regulatory   authorities, if we are indeed going to have counterparties in this sense that are outside our realm   of regulation, I just wonder what the end game here is  Mr Chairman, I am saying that I think   we need to really think that through  We can react to what we are seeing going on in the   marketplace, but I would feel much more comfortable as we go through time if we could   understand what the end game is and what we want to get in return long term for providing this   hopefully short-term solution to the liquidity crisis—that is the point I am trying to make   March 10, 2008 16 of 39     Just a comment, Tim, if I may  You are right, and we can’t stuff this ugly   genie back in the bottle  But I think we should be thinking longer term as much as we can as to   how we can reshape things, taking advantage of our franchise  I am not arguing against the   program  But we are taking a risk here, and we want to mitigate the risk as much as possible  I   am just saying that (a) we need to use this as leverage somehow over the longer term, as we   become more comfortable with this, to exert our authority, and (b) in the way you just explained   this, we need to have a good way of explaining it to the public because we are going to get   severe criticism  I can see the criticism of almost lending blind, taking substandard collateral    That kind of cogent explanation is going to be very, very important, Mr Chairman  We need to   be prepared to explain this to our critics because we are going to have a lot of criticism on this   front  So I thank you, Tim, for your response    Well, Mr Chairman, extraordinary circumstances require extraordinary   responses  I am very worried about this vicious cycle or, as Governor Kohn put it, vicious spiral of   liquidity constriction  I have a lot of questions about the program, and I have, like President Plosser,   a sort of end game concern, but I would vote in favor of this program  I think it is something we   have to take a risk with  I would like very much for us to think through collectively or under your   leadership, again, how we can use this to strengthen our franchise and at least influence this odd   regulatory structure we have, which I think is insufficient  I have the same concerns that President   March 10, 2008 27 of 39    Rosengren has, which I expressed about having counterparties over which we don’t have great   influence, even though we have communication with other regulators  I also think it would be   worthwhile, once we have set up this thing and are moving forward, to have some kind of decision   tree on all the risk parameters that were outlined in the memo  If we inappropriately affect the   pricing of financing credit or if the scale is too small or all the other risks that we’re concerned   about occur, what do we do under those circumstances?  Where do we go next?  What are the cutoff   points?   This is a fine piece of work that took an awful lot to put together, but it would be helpful at   least to me and I think it would be helpful to the Committee if we knew where these different   branches would go under different circumstances and what our responses are likely to be so that we   can be prepared to go forward  Having said that, I support the program with the different concerns   that I have, and I would vote for it  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8398,2008-03-18,"  More mundane questions, but by the way, Bill, thank you for your service    Everybody agrees with what the Vice Chairman said, and I hope you took note of it  Now that I’ve   made you feel better, I have just a very simple question  On the TAF, has the portion of foreign   participation gone down?    So it’s still pretty much where it was   March 18, 2008 11 of 127     Then the second question, Bill, which I raised on the phone  I don’t   remember an answer  Is it correct that German bunds have now traded through Treasuries in terms   of default risk, and is that meaningful at all?    That’s my question  Does it mean anything?    Thank you    Second    If I put the two comments together, one of the messages I receive is that   we are less confident in the linkage between US slowing growth and rest-of-world slowing   growth than we or conventional wisdom was before  You mentioned, in the discussion of the   international side, the downside and upside on growth  There is also a downside and an upside   on inflation  I just want to ask about our thoughts on this from a staff standpoint  Clearly, the   March 18, 2008 20 of 127    downside price pressures come from our housing crisis and all of the other related issues and, I   presume, from the building of slack and rising unemployment and, therefore, restrained wage   demands  That is the domestic side  At the same time, I think I hear you saying that on the   global side it is not happening in that fashion elsewhere  The emerging countries, particularly   China, are still growing at a rapid pace  However, it may become somewhat slower  My   question is, Do we feel that there is as much an offset to our domestic disinflationary/   deflationary forces as we thought before?  Are these global demand-pull inflationary forces   basically mitigating our expectations of the contractionary domestic forces?  How has your   opinion—the two of you—changed in the intermeeting period?  I hope that is a clear question,   but I think you get the point that I am making    Thank you very much  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Mr Chairman, today is my 59th birthday, and   I can’t think of a better group of people to spend it with—or a less happy time to do it      Well, listen, I know we are suffering because our Deputy Secretary here   sitting to your right, Mr Chairman, just gave me a candle and had me blow it out with no cake   March 18, 2008 52 of 127    attached  [Laughter]  I want to use very quickly just four examples of what I think is going on   with the economy  The first is that 21 miles of boxcars that are 89 feet in measurement each and   usually carry lumber are laid up on railroads  The second is that there’s a labor shortage in the   Yangtze River Basin, according to one of my interlocutors  The third is that Exxon is rolling $39   billion in cash in overnight deposits  The fourth is, just to keep you listening, that I am going to   come back to my ninth birthday in conclusion   As to the 21 miles of boxcars, the average length of a flatbed car that carries lumber is   89 feet  Burlington Northern has 21 miles of it laid up  I mention that because, according to my   contacts at the happy housing group that I talk to that builds a significant portion of homes in this   country, this housing setback, as they put it, is worse than ’75, ’81, and ’91 combined  I have   been a bear on housing from the first time I came to this table, and I agree with everything that   has been said about the downside pressure that is being exerted by housing  I would add a   couple of points just to underscore that  One is the 21 miles of flatbed cars that are laid end to   end  The other is a concern I have from my interlocutors at UPS in that the past six weeks they   have seen a downturn in their volume of 2 percent  The CEO describes that as a very unusual   swing from an up 3 percent in January and something that he has not seen before, and I want to   remind you that he was a CFO for many years  The third point is on the growth side, something   that perhaps we can monitor going forward  Wal-Mart now polls one million customers  They   started doing so last April  There are some imperfections in their polling  They find that 67   percent are concerned about the economic situation, particularly about their financial matters,   driven largely by perceptions of their decreasing wealth in their homes but also, more   importantly, by cost-of-living factors such as gas prices and the cost of money   March 18, 2008 53 of 127    With regard to the comment on China, at a conference in Paris recently, Governor Kohn,   Presidents Evans and Yellen, and I had the pleasure of listening to Mr Yi, who is the Deputy   Governor of the People’s Bank of China  He made the comment that there is a shortage of labor   in the Yangtze River Basin, which I found quite startling  I followed up with him on that   conversation more in depth, and because of that, I am not surprised to hear about the inflationary   forces that were spoken about at this table  It goes beyond energy, Mr Chairman, and it goes   beyond food, although I want to make some comments on food  I talked to several food   producers, and they are all intending to pass through price increases of somewhere between   5 and 15 percent  Most distressing to me was Anheuser-Busch, since I am a beer lover  The cost   of input of hops and barley has gone up 3½ percent  When you add aluminum, transportation   charges, and other things, it totals almost 15 percent, and they expect at the retail level for the   price of beer to be passed through at about 57 percent  So, say, 5 to 6 percent  Combine that   with the largest producer of pizza crusts, who is expecting a 20 percent increase in the price   sought for their product, then you get a sense of a broader issue at hand on food  Let me   summarize that broader issue  I want to come back to Wal-Mart  They sell 10,000 food items    They expect an average price increase across those 10,000 items that they are budgeting for this   year of a little over 5 percent  According to a senior official, “We will be aggressive about   pricing  We are lagging in terms of our price increases as price leader, and now we are working   aggressively to catch up”  That leads to concern on my part  I am well aware of the fact that we   have not seen increasing demands from labor, but I don’t consider labor to be a domestic   phenomenon  I consider it to be a global phenomenon, and I am concerned that you are hearing   such reports in areas where our producers have offlaid certain manufacturing processes and   sourcing of inventory, including in China  I, therefore, would suggest that they bear watching   March 18, 2008 54 of 127    With regard to the comment about Exxon’s rolling cash, to me this gets to the heart of the   issue, and that is that I don’t believe, as Mr Evans said, that monetary policy is addressing the   root problem  The root problem is a problem of liquidity, solvency, and trust  When you have a   sophisticated operation like that rolling cash in overnight bank deposits, it raises significant   alarms to me because it indicates a lack of trust in the system through which you might otherwise   conduct your cash and liquidity operations  I liken the situation, Mr Chairman, to the   following—and forgive my simplicity  I’ll use a hydraulic rather than a medical example, which   I am often wont to do  We are the water main, and yet the grass is turning brown  The water is   not getting to the grass because the piping is clogged with all the hair and residue and all of the   ugly stuff that has been building up in this Rube Goldberg piping device that we allowed to   happen over a long period of time  I don’t believe that cutting the fed funds rate addresses the   issue  I do believe that the measures we have undertaken recently to enhance liquidity, to   improve the functioning of the system, and to address the solvency issues are of significant   import  Earlier you mentioned the Duke survey of CFOs  Seventy-five percent of those CFOs   said fed funds rate cuts were not helping their business operations  I would have expected   otherwise  After the last meeting, praying against my own vote, I hoped that everything that we   had hoped would go up would go up and everything we had hoped would go down would go   down—spreads et cetera  Yet if you look to the chart book—the Bluebook, for example, or the   presentation earlier this morning—almost every single graph of what we had hoped would go   down went up and vice versa; and I think that indicates that there are limits to the efficacy of   cutting the fed funds rate   I said I would conclude with my ninth birthday  When I was nine years old, three-month   Treasury bills were trading where they are today  Thank you, Mr Chairman   March 18, 2008 55 of 127     I believe that the efficacy of the cuts that we have undertaken has been   diminished by virtue of the liquidity–solvency crisis    I think it is pretty clear that I am not going to vote for further cuts    At this juncture  Look, Tim, we cut rates 50 basis points last time  I was   in a minority of one, and I respect the group around this table more than I respect myself  Here   is the point  Everything that we wanted to go down went up, and everything that we wanted to   go up went down  So I just wonder about the efficacy of the cuts as opposed to the measures that   we have undertaken    Mr Chairman, may I answer?    Just very quickly, I said that the liquidity situation we’re in diminishes the   efficacy of fed funds policy; I’m not saying it’s not a worthwhile tool  Second, I was fully   March 18, 2008 73 of 127    supportive until we got to 35  Then we went from 35 to 3 percent  Everything we wanted to go   one way then went the opposite way  So I just made the observation that it didn’t seem to be   effective  Third, I think I spent even more time in Japan than President Geithner, who is an expert   on Japan, and you cannot compare the two economies  They are geared totally differently, with   totally different efficiency  I’d be happy to debate that at a later point  I think it’s a very poor   analogy  Now, having said that, I respect the enormous macroeconomic downside risk that we   have—and I have one of the most pessimistic forecasts—but there’s a price to be paid for what   we’re doing unless it is efficient, and that price is reflected in inflation expectations  That’s my   point, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, Vice Chairman Geithner is asking in an elegant way about   the issue of efficacy, which I was trying to touch on and did so in a less sophisticated way  I just   want to make sure that I understand your answer  If we were to achieve the degree of success that   Tim roughly estimated, we would lessen that pressure  From a staff standpoint, what degree of   easing would you advocate?  Would it be a lesser degree than what is imputed into the—    Well, Mr Chairman, I don’t like being obtuse and, being a people person, I   don’t like being unpopular  But I—    I just can’t bring myself to go that far, Mr Chairman  I listened very   carefully to what was said at the table, and implicit in Tim’s question to me was, Would you be   March 18, 2008 95 of 127    willing to do something?  The answer is “yes,” but not as much as you’re suggesting  I try as hard   as possible, even though I’ve made my living in financial markets, to ignore the reports that we   were just given as we started this conversation because what we’re paid to do and what I believe is   our duty and obligation to do is what’s right for the long-term interests of the economy   I am more bearish now than before, and I was an outlier on the bearish side of economic   growth  I’ve been at the lower end of the range, but I also believe that we have significant   inflationary concerns  I have a further point to add to President Hoenig’s—I agree with his   intervention  I think that, by being accommodative, we are encouraging others who have a role to   play here—you mentioned them yourself, Mr Chairman—to sit back and let us do the job  To me   the combination of inflationary pressures, which I consider to be real, imputing into a much weaker   economic growth scenario, which I have thought for a long time, means that we cannot do this job   alone  The fact of the matter is that we have undertaken significant liquidity enhancement   initiatives, and I think we’re going to have to do more, and I’ve been fully supportive of them, but I   think 75 basis points, Mr Chairman, is way too much  My thought is that it encourages the   financial markets  They’re not going to be satisfied  I said this last time  It’s Jabba the Hutt  They   will keep asking for more and more  We have to quit feeding them  I’m in a pizza mode, by the   way, in this conversation  I do have a suggestion, however    Pizza the Hutt, that’s right  Vice Chairman Geithner made a very interesting   point, and that was that we have to be very careful about how we talk about inflation and even   saying what we think  What worries me about going down alternative A’s path, if that’s the   wisdom of the Committee, is that the second paragraph says a little too much of what we think  It   really says that we’re not done  If you want to say that, that’s fine; but it keeps hammering on, even   March 18, 2008 96 of 127    after 75 basis points, that things are soft, things are soft, things are soft  You may disagree with me   on that, but I would suggest that we take out the justification reflecting, in paragraph 3, “a projected   leveling out of energy and other commodities”  To me that’s a wing and a prayer, and you   suggested that you might be willing to take it out  Were I you, advocating 75 basis points, acting as   I think you are about to act, with one dissent, I would take that wing and a prayer language out of   there   Then I would suggest one other thing—in fact, I would ask for one other thing  In the very   last sentence—“The Committee will act in a timely matter as needed to promote sustainable   economic growth without sacrificing long-term price stability”—that’s really what we’re talking   about on the upside and on the downside  So I would ask for that change because that’s really what   we’re saying  You’re saying that we’re worried about the downside  We’re all worried about that,   but we’re going to promote sustainable economic growth without sacrificing long-term price   stability  Those are my suggestions, Mr Chairman, and thank you for putting up with me  "
8423,2008-04-29,"  Along those lines, Mr Chairman, I viewed these facilities as a liquidity   bridge, an aqueduct, to getting over this credit crunch that we have had  I am not as concerned   about having this facility accept the same collateral as the other facilities  I do have a question   April 29–30, 2008 18 of 266    about the permanence, and it is a different kind of question, which is whether or not the Congress   will encourage us to make these permanent  I think that is a risk, and we need to think about it  I   don’t have an answer  I have been on the receiving end, as you may know, of enormous pressure   from the Texas delegation on the student loan business, and we have talked about it with the staff   quite a bit  I quoted you in my response, by the way, in your first series of letters  It doesn’t   bother me to have egg on my face if we are doing the right thing—again, having the same   collateral regime as we have for our other facilities  I am more worried, however, about whether   it encourages them in interfering with the temporary nature of these facilities  That is just one   point to think about  I have a question about the TAF—just to make sure that I understand  We   are talking about taking it to $150 billion in outstandings—is that correct?    So $75 billion auctions  Okay  The third point, which is about optics, is a   little different  I don’t know what we’re going to come out with in terms of policy  I know what   my preferences are, and I sense what some other people’s preferences are  I’m a little concerned   that we have to be able to express this in a way that doesn’t look as though we see something that   no one else sees  So we need to think about that and the way we articulate it  The last time we   had a disconnect between an action on the fed funds rate and agreeing to something and   announcing it internationally, it didn’t really work well  They read more into it than was there    We all understood why we were having that time disconnect—it was because we needed to line   up our ducks with our foreign counterparts  Maybe we should think about that as well—whether   we should move it up to the same time that we announce the action of this Committee on the fed   funds rate  I don’t know if that is physically possible  But I wouldn’t want in any way to convey   that we see something that other people don’t see, that there is a problem in these particular   April 29–30, 2008 19 of 266    markets  Everybody knows that GE is trying to sell a $40 billion credit card portfolio and they   are not getting any bidders  So I can see the devious minds, or the minds of those who don’t   necessarily think well of us, linking all these little pieces together and saying that we’re reacting   or overreacting to something that may not be there  I just wanted to put that on the table for you   to think about  I am not against the concept, since we have already gone down this path, of   making this subject to the same collateral regime  But I do think—and I am glad you raised the   subject—that, though I have interpreted it differently, we have to be concerned about the optics   here    Mr Chairman, may I just raise one other point?  I think President Lacker   touched on this  I am concerned, in terms of the eventual optics, about the fact that the TAF is   being drawn on predominately by foreign banks  My numbers here are that the last one was   78 percent foreign bank participation and the previous one was 91 percent  I think there we may   have some political vulnerability  Again, I just put it on the table for us to consider  I am almost   more worried about a backlash on that eventually than what we are talking about currently   April 29–30, 2008 20 of 266     It has been well presented  It’s hard to explain to a politician  That’s my   point    Are you asking voters only or the entire table?     Nathan, both you and Dave expressed the frustration that I think all of us   have about relying on futures markets in terms of our forecast of lower prices  It just hasn’t been   very helpful  Do we know or have a sense of how OPEC itself forecasts?  Do they just look at   futures markets?  Second, to what degree do you impute into your own calculations the income   April 29–30, 2008 34 of 266    elasticity of demand for the rapidly growing countries such as China?  We know it is above 1 on oil    Third, linking the two, to what degree would, say, the Saudi royal family or the al-Sabahs of Kuwait   be thinking about those high income elasticities of demand with those high growth rates offsetting   what used to be their fear of a slowdown in their markets?  In 1978, for example, they had only   three markets to sell into really  the United States, Japan, and what we used to call Western Europe    Now they have hedges against the weaknesses in those markets  So I’m wondering as we think   about alternative ways to wrap our arms around this—and it is a very difficult thing as the current   indicator we have has been shifting all over the place and has not been very useful—have we tried   to learn how the swing producers look at this and how they calculate and think about where prices   are likely to go or whether they just look at the futures markets as well?    Thank you for that long and thoughtful answer    Mr Chairman, I want to focus my comments today on what I have heard   from my CEO contacts  With regard to my District, it continues to do well relative to the rest of the   country, but it is not immune to the pathology that is afflicting the overall economy  Although still   positive, economic growth and employment creation are slowing, and our manufacturers in the   survey we just took are experiencing substantial price pressures  Seventy-one percent of our   manufacturers in the survey report higher prices, and 65 percent are expecting input prices to be   even higher six months from now     Setting aside the 11th District, I spoke in depth to 31 CEOs nationwide  You have that list,   Mr Chairman, and I would like to speak to what I deduced from triangulating those conversations   with what I read in the Bluebook and the Greenbook  Let me note that the focus of my   conversations with these CEOs and CFOs was not what they have seen or what they are seeing now   but how their behavior is likely to be affected going forward and how they are budgeting going   forward  Distilling the inputs to their essence, it’s clear that activity is likely to weaken further    Those 21 miles of 89-foot flat cars that haul lumber, Mr Chairman, are now up to 226 miles    Inventories of unsold homes are clearly building, and that is important against the background that   March is almost always a good month in the housing or home sales business  The CEO of Centex   reports that this is the first down March he has seen, and he has been in the business since 1974  It   April 29–30, 2008 50 of 266    came down hard—20 percent  Consumer confidence is weak  Job insecurity is spreading    Companies are tightening their head counts  Banks are tightening credit standards, as we have   discussed  According to the CEO of MasterCard, year-over-year retail sales to date in April—that   is, ex-autos and ex-gas—were 22 percent, the lowest he has ever seen   Citibank, Chase, Bank of America, and the other credit card purveyors are experiencing   high delinquency rates and a significant slowdown in their revenues from credit cards, and   Wal-Mart reports the “cascading” use of credit as a form of payment, as their CEO for US   operations put it  In short, the consumer-driven corrective credit cycle is prolonging the economic   slowdown and vice versa  Consistent with this sustained headwind, we have revised downward the   Dallas forecast and continued for longer our projection of economic “anemia” (we are not among   the four that included the word “recession”) not only for ’08 but also for ’09, and we have revised   upward, to the upper end, our sense of projected unemployment  Thus, from what I am hearing,   from what I am reading, and from what we are getting from our analysis, I acknowledge the thesis   of the presence of a negative feedback loop among GDP growth, employment growth, and credit   market conditions   I find more worrisome the reports I am receiving on expected price developments and   behavior, and I see a feedback loop of another kind at work  Page 30 of the Bluebook notes, as I   think President Plosser pointed out and President Evans referred to, that core PCE inflation has   averaged more than 2 percent in every year since 2004 and is forecasted, as per David’s earlier   comments, as doing so again in 2008  What concerns me more is the left-hand panel in chart 1 on   page 4 of the Bluebook that indicates that the staff’s index of inflation expectations and uncertainty   is now at the top of its range over the last decade  This is confirmed by my corporate contacts    April 29–30, 2008 51 of 266    Something persistent and pernicious, Mr Chairman, has been occurring on the inflation front and   calling into question the credibility of our continued reliance on core measures     Here is what I am hearing from my corporate contacts  I’m going to just mention a few   because it is fairly consistent across the board  From the CEO of the largest retailer in the country,   not to be named but located in Arkansas, [laughter] I reported last time that they are budgeting price   increases on 10,000 items of a little over 5 percent in 2008  Yet his comment to me was, “Inflation   is our number 1 concern, and it’s escalating significantly”  He added, “All the information we have   points to an intermediate- and longer-term supply–demand problem, especially for food and any   energy-dependent articles”  By the way, that was verified by the CEO of Frito-Lay, who tells me   that they are offsetting their input price escalation of 11 percent in 2008 by raising prices 9 percent   effective last Sunday  He added that—and this is interesting in terms of the mindset—“We have   to—otherwise we’ll disappoint the Street, and in these markets no one can afford at this fragile time   to do so”   The price pressures are less for clothing and nonfood items, but they are still there  I would   like to use the example of JCPenney  JCPenney sells clothing to one-half of all the families in   America, and 60 percent of their sales are apparel  The average price point for an apparel sale at   that retailer is $15  The leading source of apparel is China  According to Penney’s CEO, increases   in China’s labor costs, changes in their labor rules, and the cost of fuel and of cotton fibers have led   to significantly escalating price pressures  He says that they can eat some of those costs and drive   them down through other offsets and tighter controls, but they are planning a 4 percent increase in   apparel costs in 2009  Here is his punch line, and it is not funny—this is a first-rate CEO, one of the   best in the country  “We think the customer can take a little more price  After all, what’s 40 to 60   cents on $15?  It won’t even be noticed”   April 29–30, 2008 52 of 266    This is the essence of the accommodation of inflationary expectations, and you are   beginning to see this mentality set in in several industries  For example, the airlines  We talked   about the increase in the price of crude  If you take what is called the crack spread and figure out   what has happened in terms of jet fuel, year over year through mid-April jet fuel was up 70 percent    That’s an industry average, mitigated somewhat by the hedging of Southwest Airlines, which has   been successful  According to the CEO of American Airlines, “This oil is a tsunami  We will have   to get some pricing power, or we’ll be left with only one airline, Southwest”  Kimberly-Clark, a   paper producer, notices that the weaker dollar and oil are driving realized costs increasingly up   from, in their case, $250 million in ’07 to an estimated $600 million in ’08  They have raised   prices, as I have previously mentioned, but the CEO feels that—and this is a winner—“We are   having to learn how to run a business in an inflationary environment  We got used to productivity   as the driver, but we can’t drive productivity any harder than we can  We will need more pricing”   It even affects semiconductor producers  Texas Instruments reports that the weakness of the   dollar and the prices of energy, gold, and copper offset by their hedges added 2½ percent non-  annualized to their costs in the first quarter  Asked what he envisions going forward, the CFO said,   “Well, that just means we can’t spend it elsewhere  We have to take it out of our employees’ backs   or out of cap-ex”  One CEO of a company that is expecting soon to lay off between 12,000 and   15,000 people and is, therefore, carefully surveying the attitudes of their employees because they   have a morale problem, is finding out that employees are tapping into their 401(k) plans or not   funding them  In their surveys they find the leading complaint is that “the price of gasoline and   food is eating into my living standards  I can’t afford them”  Last but not least, just to bring this   home, the Eagle Scout who mows my lawn in Dallas sent me a very nice, beautiful letter  It is clear   that he and his mother had prepared it on a printer and put a fancy title on it, but the rest of the letter   April 29–30, 2008 53 of 266    was, “Dear Mr Fisher, I have to levy a 7 percent fuel surcharge”  [Laughter]  We gave into it—he   is a nice boy   In summary, Mr Chairman, while there are many who have voiced concern with the   adverse feedback loop that runs from the economy to tighter credit conditions and back to the   economy, I am very troubled by a different adverse feedback loop—namely, the inflation dynamic   whereby reductions in fed funds rates lead to a weaker dollar and upward pressures on global   commodity prices, which feed through to higher US inflation  That higher US inflation not only   has a price impact but also leads to cutbacks by consumers and by employers so as to offset the   effects of inflation  I am worried that, if we do not respond to higher inflation, the whole cycle will   intensify  When economic growth and activity return to normal, inflation is likely to have notched   up considerably, according to our sense  I know my respected colleagues say that we are willing to   be equally aggressive in raising rates once the outlook for real activity improves, but the   practicability of that notion I find in talking to my interlocutors is met with some skepticism and   doubt   With that, Mr Chairman, I see a tail risk on the downside of growth  I acknowledge the   argument of President Yellen and others  I think I’m sympathetic, but I see a fatter tail, perhaps an   otter’s tail, on inflation  I am hearing this loud and clear from my corporate contacts  I believe that   the risk posed by inflation is more significant than the extension of further anemia in the economy,   especially now that we have put in place innovative liquidity bridging mechanisms, which we are   amplifying upon today  Mr Chairman, the other day Governor Kohn reminded me that reasonable   people can disagree, and he quipped that he hoped that we could agree on the following—that we   are at least reasonable people  [Laughter]  I’m doing my very best, I hope, to provide reasonable   alternative perspectives, and I hope you will judge me on that basis  Thank you, Mr Chairman   April 29–30, 2008 54 of 266     Mr Chairman?    You emphasized the phrase “reflecting a projected leveling-out of energy   and other commodity prices and an easing of pressures on resource utilization”  Can you just   refresh my memory?  For how long have we been using that phrase—just in the March   statement, or have we used it before?    So not in January—it was just in March that we used that  Second, let’s   say we were to have a rally in the dollar  If we voted for no change, might that positively affect   equity prices or the credit markets in the United States?  Is it possible?    For how long?  This is a personal view, but it’s not clear to me that things   are that clear-cut on a sustainable basis  One of the things that seems to be undercutting   April 29–30, 2008 98 of 266    confidence is the weakness in the dollar, even though in the past few days the dollar has rallied    I’m just wondering if it’s clear-cut that we would necessarily have a sustained selloff  I can see   an immediate reaction, particularly on the announcement  But it’s conceivable, is it not, that if   we had a dollar rally that we could have a positive effect on equity prices or on the credit   markets?    Yes  I just wanted to ask a question    Well, this just illustrates the point  It’s not as clear-cut as one might   guess  Thank you    Well, Mr Chairman, I was listening very carefully to Governor Kohn, as   I do the rest of my colleagues  I noted your comment that it doesn’t buy us much  I’m worried   that it may cost us much  Had I gone first, I would have made arguments similar to those of   April 29–30, 2008 118 of 266    President Plosser and President Evans  I am in favor of a pause  I think that is pretty clear  I   want to stress a couple of things I mentioned yesterday because I think they’re important  I am   concerned about our costs regarding what I call a different kind of adverse feedback loop, which   is the inflation dynamic whereby reductions in the fed funds rate lead to a weaker dollar and   upward pressure on global commodity prices, which feed through to higher US inflation and to   cutbacks in consumption by consumers and actions by employers to offset the effects of   inflation  I quoted a CEO, whom I consider to be very highly regarded, regarding his company’s   behavioral patterns  This is someone, by the way, who was in the business in the 1970s  He   said, “We’re learning to run a business, once again, in an inflationary environment”  That quote   bothers me because it shows a behavioral response  This goes beyond the issue, but I thought   that comment you made yesterday about relative prices, Mr Chairman, was very interesting  But   it shows a behavioral response, and behaviors eventually become habits, and habits become   trends, and I’m worried about that   There was a period when I felt that we were at risk of a repetition of the 1930s  I think   the liquidity measures that we have taken—which I have fully supported, and I applaud you, Mr   Chairman, and the New York group for thinking these through with the staff—have provided the   bridge that we spoke of yesterday  Don, you mentioned the 1970s  I am no longer worried about   the 1930s, although I think there are tripwires out there that are very, very serious  You pointed   to them in your intervention  You are right; under Bill Martin these pressures were put in place    But somebody mentioned yesterday—it may have been Vice Chairman Geithner—that he wasn’t   around in the 1970s  I actually sat by President Carter’s side when he got lectures from a left-  wing socialist named Helmut Schmidt and by a right winger named Margaret Thatcher  Their   points were that you cannot risk appearing to be complacent about inflation  I worry that we risk   April 29–30, 2008 119 of 266    appearing to be complacent about inflation  I am speaking within the family here, but I sense   that we are giving that appearance on the outside  The question really is, Is it worth ¼ point?    What is the risk–return tradeoff here?  I don’t think it’s worth cutting ¼ point  I think it is worth   staying where we are     I know that the markets anticipate X or Y  We had a conversation about that yesterday  I   made my living in the markets  The markets come and go, and I am happy to hear Governor   Kohn say that we are not influenced by the markets  I don’t think we should be  Their reactions   are momentary  But I just don’t feel the risk–return tradeoff makes it worthwhile for a ¼ point   cut here unless we saw evidence of substantial downside slippage beyond what we are all   discounting for housing, which is very negative  I have spoken about a price correction of   35 percent from peak to trough, and we’re not there yet  It would have to be more negative than   that to convince me to cut rates further  So, Mr Chairman, I respectfully submit that we should   pause, and that’s how I plan to vote  Thank you, Mr Chairman      A very short question having nothing to do with what everybody else has   asked about—but going back to page 33, what are the governance issues, and how do you resolve   them, in 30 seconds or less?  [Laughter]    Mr Chairman, we have been in favor of paying interest on reserves for   some time  This is an excellent paper  Like everybody else, I learned a great deal from all the   papers that were sent and this superb summary that was just presented  I personally tend toward   option 2, but I think it is worthwhile considering options 4 and 5 as well in terms of vetting this   under the timetable  I think that Charlie asked a good question about how this relates to the other   April 29–30, 2008 184 of 266    facilities, but generally, the optics on this are favorable  Again, we are moving forward  The   public doesn’t really understand the background of this—where the Congress has stood and what   we have achieved so far  I think it would be just one other good thing for us to be modernizing   the Federal Reserve   I asked the question on governance just because I understand that the current plan calls   for rates to adjust automatically to changes in target set by the FOMC  I would want to make   sure that was the case  In other words, I don’t like the potential for vesting all the power in the   Board; and, of course, that potential is there  I think it is worth preserving the federal system of   the Federal Reserve  That is the only reservation I have  Those are my comments  Thank you,   Mr Chairman  "
8449,2008-06-24,"  Bill, by inference, talking about the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, two of   the limited number of borrowers have been the two institutions you mentioned  Have there been   many more or just one or two?    Thank you for discreetly answering the question      If I may, I would like to ask Nathan, Mr Chairman, about exhibit 4 and   exhibit 5  Particularly noteworthy is that exhibit 4 is the forecast period showing a significant   decline in inflation in the emerging market economies  I am wondering what that is based on    Do we have a sense of capacity utilization or slack, if it is all reliable, or is it based on a sense of   commodity prices?  What is that noticeable down-swoop?    Yes, sir  In the top left-hand panel   June 24–25, 2008 24 of 253     You don’t know how happy I am to see global things come first  But are   you saying that a great deal of uncertainty is attached to that forecast?    Then, in exhibit 5 on core import prices, I guess it is pretty much the same   answer  One would expect that these would fall of their own weight after a while    Mr Chairman, if I could ask just one other question—of Larry, I think it   was—on the housing exhibits  I am wondering if we are not in the eye of the storm here  We   June 24–25, 2008 25 of 253    have had the first wave of buckling at the knees—or worse, cascading  If you talk to the   homebuilders, they are, of course, the most depressed group imaginable  But they are waiting   for another shoe to drop, which is the foreclosures on alt-As  I’m wondering what our opinion is   on that  Things have calmed down a bit, but we still have another phase of the storm coming   through, which is what I just described  What are our assumptions about that?    Thank you    Just a quick follow-up, Mr Chairman  To what extent do you impute the   kind of insecurity that comes from competition and broader outsourcing?  If you impute anything   there in terms of wage behavior here, to what extent are you assuming going forward that the   increase in wages being paid elsewhere might bleed into our wage behavior here?    Thank you    Mr Chairman, you are going to get a contrapuntal tune here  That is the   beauty of this table and the different perspectives around it  I am going to take a different   approach today than I have in the past  I am going to talk a bit about the Eleventh District first,   which I don’t often do  The reason for that is, because of its nature and size, because of its being   the leading exporting state in the country now, and because of its job creation, it is in a slightly   different position—or significantly different position, depending on which District it is compared   with—from the rest of the country   June 24–25, 2008 39 of 253    Our job growth through March is running about 38 percent  Unemployment in April was   41 percent, despite a sizable influx of immigrants, which we see from new license plate   registrations from California and particularly from Florida as well as from people still coming   across the border  Sales of existing homes rose in May, while inventories and prices held steady    Apartment demand is robust, and rents in the major cities, such as Dallas and Houston, are rising    The real export growth of Texas was 72 percent in April after 39 percent in the first quarter    That is telling you that our chemicals are now being priced aggressively but also that everything   else is being priced aggressively worldwide  That’s a significant export sector for us    Importantly, on the price front, the Dallas Fed’s own Texas manufacturing outlook survey and   the regional CPI data indicate continuing price increases and substantial evidence of pass-  through to higher final goods prices  Thirty-nine percent of the respondents report the ability to   realize higher prices of finished goods currently; another 45 percent expect to be able to realize   higher prices in the next six months  Despite these strong numbers, our soundings and our   instinct project a slowdown in the future  We have been projecting a slowdown—we haven’t   seen it  Discretionary income has been bolstered by employment, but squeezed by rising food   and energy prices and credit constriction  So we are looking for the District to slow and yet to   continue to outperform relatively speaking   I would like to devote the rest of my comments to the US economy and to the global   economy, particularly to the contrapuntal insights I have gained from my soundings  First, on   the global economy, Nathan, our own research at our little globalization institute in Dallas   indicates that the projections of real economic growth of most of the advanced countries are   being revised downward whereas expected inflation is being revised upward  For the major   emerging market economies, growth realization, at least as it appears in their forecasts, for the   June 24–25, 2008 40 of 253    most part holds up, but inflation expectations are being steadily revised upward  In other words,   the two types of economies share on the inflation front, whereas there is disparity and a little   cacophony as far as growth is concerned  We are working on it, but we have yet to develop a   reliable measure of global slack  JPMorgan, with whom we have been working, has a slack   index that purports to be global  But as you pointed out, Nathan, it excludes China  Minor   oversight  It also excludes India     One would think that the growing slack in the advanced countries would be mitigating   price pressures  Yet those countries with numerical price objectives or inflation targets—from   Mexico to Turkey to New Zealand to the European Central Bank to the Brits—are now   contending with inflation in excess of their target or comfort range     I was thinking the other day of Mervyn King’s comment that, once they had to write to   the Chancellor of the Exchequer, it would lead to a lot of letter-writing  It took 15 years for the   first letter to be written after inflation targeting was embraced  Of course, two years ago this was   resurrected, and now they seem to be doing so with a great deal more frequency  Now there is a   risk of acquiring writer’s cramp  I would say that, if we were under the same strictures as the   Bank of England, we might be subject to the same concerns  In our last meeting, I posited that   something persistent and pernicious was occurring on the inflation front  Mr Chairman, the one   thing that is even clearer now—particularly after my soundings, which I’ll report in just a   second—than it was in May is that inflationary pressures, inflation expectations, and anticipatory   behavioral responses among consumers and businesses have intensified, whereas our confidence   about economic growth has improved   I don’t believe that we are out of the woods yet on the risk of a credit-induced slowdown,   though I believe our liquidity initiatives are a proper and good palliative, as you know  But if   June 24–25, 2008 41 of 253    Robert Frost will forgive me, the woods are not lovely, and they are indeed deep and dark on the   price front  Although the tail risk of economic recession has diminished, I think it still exists;   certainly the anemia—just to use another word that you referred to—does  But the risk of   inflation, in my view, has assumed greater depth and breadth since we last met  Stated   differently, I don’t believe that inflation expectations are presently well anchored, here or   elsewhere  I believe they are being—just to kill the sea analogy, Don—torn from their moorings   and are at risk of going adrift   Now, I took a different approach this time with the 30-odd interlocutors with whom I   discussed the outlook  I simply asked them one question  What is different in this cycle from   what you have seen before?  Most of these people have been in business for 30 years plus  Here   are some sample testimonials as to what they are seeing  The CEO of Fluor, which has a $38   billion backlog currently, said, “When I started here in 1974, we put inflation contingencies into   every contract  In the 1990s, that had not only gone away, but we were confident we could   negotiate cost down to below what we were bidding  Now it is just the opposite”  The CFO of   Frito-Lay, which just pushed through a 9 percent price increase (which, parenthetically, Wal-  Mart accommodated at 7 percent), said, “Most of our executives are in their late 30s or early-to-   mid 40s  They have never seen these kinds of numbers  This is reminiscent of the aftershock to   Nixon’s wage and price controls, and we are currently having to hold seminars to teach   management how to manage inflation”  From the CEO of Wal-Mart USA  “We see   increased”—and this is his word—“pervasive price pressures  I am telling you that we have an   economy where the real people are being trampled by inflation, and for the first time in memory,   we are getting noise from employees about the cost of living”  Wal-Mart raised the pay of 60   percent of their associates between single and double digits in the last quarter, and my contact   June 24–25, 2008 42 of 253    said, “We are now contemplating a series of measures such as providing discounts to employees   to counter considerable employee angst about the cost of living”  From the CEO of Kimberly-  Clarke, who just notified the retailers of a 7 percent price increase to come in August after the 7   percent they pushed through in February, in addition to which they are going to add a shipping   surcharge  “Customers are no longer asking if, but when, we will increase prices, so they can   move in anticipation”   I can give you other testimonials, Mr Chairman  One of my favorites, by the way, has to   do with a very small operation, a three-store dry cleaning operation, Faulkner’s Fine Dry   Cleaning in Dallas  They approached me the other day to say that they would have to increase   the price of cleaning our shirts because the price of 18-inch white hangers, which are steel-based,   has increased 65 percent  They showed me the circular that had been sent around by the fabric   cleaning supply company that is the last remaining manufacturer of hangers in the United States    All of that manufacturing has gone to China  The circular that they are sending their customers,   the cleaners, says “What should cleaners do?  Raise your prices  You’re worth it”  Then—and   this strikes at the heart of every son of every Australian—Budweiser, which raised its prices 3½   percent in February, according to our local distributor, plans to raise 3½ percent again in   September  And the Bud distributor in North Texas, who has had that distributorship for 43   years, said that never before in his lifetime had he seen two price increases in one year  Finally,   the CEO of JCPenney’s just returned from an around-the-world buying trip  After 11 years of   apparel price deflation, Chinese manufacturers are seeking 8 to 9 percent price increases in ’09,   11 to 12 percent for footwear, and for small kitchen appliances in the mid-20s  The CFO of the   company told me that they are running at minimum staffing levels  If anybody begins to break   the wage barrier, then, “Katie, bar the door!”   June 24–25, 2008 43 of 253    So, Mr Chairman, I would say that currently our patient—the economy—is indeed a sick   puppy  Some of its vital organs—geographic regions such as the one I am fortunate to live in, or   a strong export sector of the United States, or entrepreneurs and business leaders who have   learned to wring unanticipated efficiency and profits out of globalization or from within   cyberspace—are very strong  Yet others—states like California and Florida, the housing sector,   and overall consumer confidence—are bleeding, if not hemorrhaging  This is not to mention the   still precarious state, despite the very good report that Bill gave, of our financial system as it   recovers, I hope with our help, from years of its recklessness and excess  I think we have, like   loyal practitioners and with the equivalent of the Hippocratic oath, done the job that we are   expected to do in terms of resuscitating the victim   That is the good news  The real bad news is that our patient appears to be acquiring a   staph infection in this hospital that we have created, and that staph infection is inflation  I   believe inflation is upon us  I believe expectations are discounting more inflation  Very   importantly—and this is tough to get from the models—I believe that behavioral changes are   beginning to manifest themselves  Now, some would argue that this infection is temporary and   may well go away  Others will argue that it will be stayed by strong rhetoric  Still others say   that it will require—I don’t know if it’s an antibiotic or an antidote—further tightening, lest the   infection spread and counteract the good that we have done with our liquidity facilities and by   previous policy decisions  That seems to me to be the problem that we will have to deal with at   this meeting, and I look forward to hearing my other colleagues’ opinions  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     Mr Chairman, I listened very carefully to what was said around the table   yesterday, and I especially listened very carefully to you  You made a very good and interesting   point about the differences from the 1970s  I would add that there are significant differences   from the 1970s  We didn’t have the Internet in the 1970s  We were not globalized in the 1970s    If you were selling oil into the market, you sold to three buyers—the ten countries known as   Western Europe, the United States, and Japan—whereas now you have several billion people   more to sell to  Another difference is that the transmission mechanisms were not as fluid, which   gets me to a question, really, with which I am wrestling constantly  Before, a cyclical slowdown   would lead to a lessening in price pressures  I am not so sure that’s correct if we are talking   about a cyclical slowdown in the United States  We already have wages going up significantly   in the largest factory in the world, which is China, where we source a great deal  So there is   wage–price inflation, but there are enormous demand-pull forces that are quite different from   what we had before   I am a little concerned—and I say this with not only respect but humility at having less   training—Governor Kohn, when you say that we might tolerate a “temporary increase in   inflation”  If you opened the New York Times this morning, you would have seen that Dow   Chemical raised prices 25 percent after just raising them 20 percent—in one month  By the way,   I notice that these little bottles of water have gotten smaller—this will be a Visine bottle at the   next meeting  [Laughter]  What goes into this—the plastic?  Here’s the point  Many micros   make a macro  Micro business operators are not going to tolerate temporary increases in   June 24–25, 2008 124 of 253    inflation  They are going to act on them  I worry about that enormously, particularly given the   fact that they are globalized and they sell to a globalized market  We can be victimized by that    Now, I may have over-analogized yesterday  You teased me after the meeting  Although I like   Janet’s analogy of the python—one of my tutors at St John’s had a python named Julius   Squeezer, by the way  [Laughter]  Just to kill that reference, I feel a bit squeezed here at the   table   You mentioned yesterday, Mr Chairman, three things that caught my ear  Obviously, we   need to strive to avoid bad outcomes  Second, we need to decide when we’re at the tipping   point  We need to pick our moment, as you said  Third, you also said that we need to lean and   not lurch  I listened very carefully just now to President Evans, who was most eloquent in his   presentation  I happen to agree with him in terms of where I think we should be     Yesterday I said I thought there were three ways to deal with our current predicament   now that the tail risks have shifted  One is to hope it will cure itself  I don’t believe that is going   to happen because of the way micro operators operate  The second is to treat it rhetorically, and   I think that the language in alternative B is quite good, if that is the way you wish to go  But I   don’t think it is going to get any easier, as was mentioned earlier at this table  I am not sure that   things will get easier by August  We then get into an election season, which I think still   conditions somewhat our thinking  I think it is important to take a shot across the bow  I think   we have to put some substance behind our words  As I said before, and I know you know, I like   to be liked  I don’t like to be alone  But I am going to vote for alternative C  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    Before the python gets it [Laughter]   June 24–25, 2008 130 of 253     I appreciate the adoption of the language  I think it is much better   June 24–25, 2008 135 of 253     I would support what Vice Chairman Geithner mentioned because I think   we may be faced with a situation of having to raise rates even though there is considerable risk in   the financial market  So I think showing sensitivity to that is very, very important  On a second   point, Mr Chairman, I do appreciate the change in the language  I also suggested some changes   to alternative C, but I won’t go into them  Thank you, Mr Chairman    I just wanted to get in on this point that Governor Kohn raised  I’m not   uncomfortable with our being parsimonious with the Primary Dealer Credit Facility  It is under   unusual and exigent circumstances, and I think we need to be sure that they are unusual and exigent   circumstances  That’s the reason it was created, and I think we have to respect that  I’m just   wondering, judging from the decline in the extent of the outstandings and given what you described,   can we assume that there’s a lessening of unusual and exigent circumstances?  That’s my question    That’s my point  That’s important    Mr Chairman, I am in favor of keeping these facilities open through year-  end as you have suggested  I think that just the existence of the PDCF is important, which we   talked about earlier, and your overall outline of an approach, the topography of that approach, is   attractive  The question I have is about—and you used the term—“supervisory expectations”  I   have a question for Scott, and then a thought to follow up on  Since, Scott, no one asked you a   question, I want to ask you a question    In working up this MOU, have you had any interaction with Chairman   Frank or any of his staff, getting a sense of how they might react or what it does in terms of their   own expectations?    Are you picking up any signals in return, in this interaction with the   Senate or elsewhere, about what they might be thinking?  Are we picking up any other signals   that might be of concern?    I am a little confused  You testify in July and then have a speech  You   said that you and Paulson will be speaking  I think that is a very important point  It is going to   be a tough act because you don’t want to take anything off the table, but you want to keep a lot   June 24–25, 2008 174 of 253    open and not show your hand  Well, we don’t know what our hand is yet  You may, but I don’t   think we have it as a group  So we can’t really show our hand  Anyway, I don’t know how this   is going to be prepared, but I’m sure there are lots of feelings around this table  This is the   substance that Vice Chairman Geithner referred to earlier—these very, very important questions    But you are going to have to show some leg during that speech  Obviously, this is a Board issue,   but with regard to the FOMC, I would just ask that it be fairly carefully vetted     Yes, sir  Just for some suggestions, for whatever they’re worth  Thank   you, Mr Chairman  "
8497,2008-08-05,"  Please, no baseball analogies  [Laughter]    David, in terms of the relatively benign outlook for core inflation now and   for headline inflation, I’m wondering what your assumptions are about margin compression and for   the ability of corporations to pass through price increases  By the way, I found the core revisions   somewhat alarming because they’re well above 2 percent, but less alarming than what I think I   heard you say about headline inflation projections  If my memory is correct, over the past two years   there has been a wider spread between core and headline, and part of that has been due to the ability   of firms at least to restrain or not to exploit any perceived pricing power  If you’re assuming that   core will be relatively well behaved over time, some assumptions must be in there about margins   and margin management, and I wonder what they are  Then I have a question for Steve on the   international side to follow up on that    Obviously the implication of this more dire outlook for economic growth is   that movement of the top line will be very, very difficult, so again, more pressure comes into the   margin side to see that one can satisfy shareholders that things aren’t as bad as they might be    That’s really the nature of my concern  I don’t know if we’re surveying or getting a sense as to the   pressures that people feel  I’m going to talk about some of that, but you may be doing this more   formally than I’m able to do to get a sense of what kinds of pressures are occurring on margins   On the international side, Mr Chairman, if I may—Steve, I’m curious about these Chinese   inflation numbers  As I understand from the Chinese Ministry of Human Resources, the average   wage of urban workers rose 18 percent year over year in the first half of ’08, and yet they report an   official inflation number that I believe you say is 4 or 5 percent of something  How do you square   that corner?    Thank you  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Very quickly, I want to come back to the housing issue  You know, I’ve   been more pessimistic than I think anybody around the table from the standpoint of peak-to-trough   correction, and I find the numbers you mentioned very benign relative to my expectations  One   issue that I’m trying to understand a little better in terms of its likely effect is that the real bulge in   resets comes in 2009 to 2012 because that’s when the alt-A resets kick in  We talked about this   many, many moons ago, the ultra-poor documentation on those types of loans, in particular, and I’m   wondering to what degree you’re factoring this into your outlook going forward, particularly for   those out-years    On that happy note, Mr Chairman, thank you   August 5, 2008 35 of 145     Mr Chairman, I may have to leave the lunch early  So before I start, I do   want to bid Rick adieu  Rick, I remember describing you as charming in one of our early meetings    You have charmed me by your intellect and devotion  Anyway, I’m going to miss you  So I   wanted to say that in case I do have to leave early   Mr Chairman, in the intermeeting period, I spent almost as much time in President   Rosengren’s District as I did in my own—part as vacation but the rest consulting with some   advisers and mentors in the People’s Republic of Cambridge at my alma mater  [Laughter]  I   mention this because I want to underscore that, in arguing a perspective, I tend to move away from   the rather felicitous circumstances that prevail in my District  Even though things are slowing, we   still expect employment growth to come in a little short of 2 percent a year, and our banking   situation thus far is holding up rather well   In terms of my national soundings, and you know the list and the group is familiar with it,   the anecdotal evidence from everyone—from the bankers to the credit card companies to retailers to   fuel producers, food producers, energy companies, shippers, equipment manufacturers,   August 5, 2008 42 of 145    homebuilders, and entertainment companies—confirms reports of progressively higher obstacles to   growing their top lines and continued efforts to drive down their cost of goods sold through   reducing their head counts, running very tight inventory cycles, tightening their operating expenses,   and reexamining and in many cases cutting back significantly on cap-ex  Nationally I expect   continued anemia on the growth side  We are, as you know, not at the extreme but at the low end of   expectations for economic growth  I would expect zero growth as we approach year-end  As I said   earlier, from our perspective we’re only about two-thirds through the peak-to-trough correction on   housing, and I view that as a continued weak influence  So the summary is that most of my contacts   are planning around expectations of a prolonged US and advanced-country slowdown and have a   rather woeful outlook as to the growth side   At the same time, there is also a woeful concern with regard to price pressures—intensifying   cost pressures affecting their margins at a time when the stock market is most unforgiving of people   who miss their mark  Even in the First District, I might note  I want to quote the Beige Book report   from Boston  “Almost all contacted manufacturers voiced concerns about elevated    costs      Respondents generally have raised their selling prices in recent months    Over one-half of   contacts expect to increase their selling prices further in the second half of 2008 and/or early 2009”    It went on to say that, while some contacts express worry that price increases have led or will lead to   loss of market shares, others indicate that—and these are the key operative words—“customers have   become more receptive to price increases because they see them as a consequence of generalized   cost pressures”  Mr Chairman, that passage captures the message that I’m receiving from my CEO   and CFO contacts around the country  By and large, we appear to be transitioning from vigilance   on the price front to acquiescence  Inflation expectations are, I think, becoming unmoored, and I   believe they are, if not already adrift, at risk of drifting   August 5, 2008 43 of 145    On the small business front, I do like to look at Bill Dunkelberg’s recent reports from the   National Federation of Independent Business  His most recent report indicates that the percentage   of small business owners citing inflation as “the number one problem they face,” rose to 20 percent   in June, the highest rating since 1982, and that 41 percent of his respondents report raising selling   prices  At the other extreme of size, to put this in perspective, Wal-Mart’s CEO for the United   States reported last week—and I quote this  “My biggest concern is inflation  This month we had   an experience that Wal-Mart has never ever”—that’s literally what he said—“had before, which is   that a major supplier told us we need a 9 percent increase or we will not supply you at all”  Now, he   did not mention the name of that supplier  It could have been Unilever, which saw the volume of   goods it ships slip 05 percent year over year in the second quarter  Yet according to our   conversations but also quoted in the Wall Street Journal on August 1, Unilever’s CEO reported that   he “raised average prices on his thousands of products 74 percent,” and then added that he “doesn’t   plan to reverse any price increases”  Or it could have been one of the largest snack food companies,   whose CFO has informed us that, after taking and having stick a 9 percent increase in price in   March—I reported this at our last meeting—they will effect another 9½ percent increase in October    Here’s the pithy quote he gave me  “Thus far we’ve been bleeding out price increases to our   customers  Now our strategy is to bludgeon them—to broadcast our increases in the expectation   that competitors will do the same”  I doubt the supplier to Wal-Mart was Kodak  Last week the   New York Times reported that “hurt by higher manufacturing and materials costs, the company said   it will combat these cost pressures by passing on to consumers and raising prices on some products   by as much as 20 percent”   I have lots of examples of similar responses  President Evans indicated similar pressures    President Lockhart did too  I’m not going to go through them  I will add, by the way, the one thing   August 5, 2008 44 of 145    that surprised me  Despite Disney’s brilliant annual report of record earnings, they, too, plan to   raise their single day prices by 5 percent, to $60, in the next quarter  There is also a growing   feeling, which I haven’t heard before, among semiconductor manufacturers that, after years and   years of constant price deflation, they expect that there may—and the operative word is “may”—be   a bottoming out because of the raw materials prices they face and the wage prices and pressures   they are receiving in China, which has become a major semiconductor manufacturer   One might take heart from the recent correction in commodity prices  I agree with Steve   that we have to be very careful about that  My smartest energy contacts have been expecting a   correction in prices  Markets were overshooting  Natural gas prices have reacted to recent   developments like the Barnett Shale and, even more important, the so-called Haynesville Play in   Louisiana  The “oilies” note that increased Saudi supply hit our shores with the normal six-week   lag  They were talking about production increases in May and June, and those have just hit our   shores recently  So they’re not surprised at the price reaction at the pump  But none feels that the   basic demand–supply situation has been dramatically altered—much as you argued, Steve—and   most expect structural prices to obtain at or near current levels  Now, what does “at or near current   levels” mean in terms of price impact?  I had a long conversation with the CEO of Burlington   Northern, and just for data purposes, in terms of what they call their RCAF—an automatic cost-  adjustment contract that covers 25 percent of the goods shipped by their rail—their third-quarter   RCAF is 17 percent  The 75 percent of products that are not covered by that automatic contract are   subject to a fuel surcharge  That fuel surcharge at $120 a barrel is a 30 percent increase for the third   quarter   One might also take comfort in the purported calmness in compensation growth seen so far,   along the lines of what I read in the Financial Times by Mark Gertler on July 29  I don’t hear   August 5, 2008 45 of 145    confirmation of that benign argument among business operators  First, as President Evans and Mr   Stockton pointed out in our last meeting, labor compensation is not a good predictor of inflation  I   remember Dave said that it’s not that labor costs, which are a significant chunk of business costs,   don’t matter but that you can’t necessarily take comfort from the well-behaved compensation thus   far that you are not going to confront some inflation problems going forward  Now, the last   anecdote I want to give you illustrates that point  Yesterday I had a lengthy visit with the CFO of   General Mills  Until their fiscal year ’08, which ended in May, they priced over many years an   average increase of 0 percent  They took 2½ percent as the year ended, and they’re taking another 5   percent this year  They are having to reexamine their elasticity models, he said  Here is what he   said that worried me the most  They are finding those models less predictive because (a)   “everybody is raising prices,” and (b) consumer perception is that inflation is back  So, again,   vigilance is giving way to acquiescence   Mr Chairman, I do want to comment very briefly on something I mentioned last time,   which regards calculating the cost of goods sold  I am hearing more and more from companies that   have shifted production to China a verification of the 18 percent number that the ministry gave us    Whether it’s a hospital producer whom I talked to in California or a Black & Decker tool assembler   in China, they’re complaining not only about cost increases of 15 to 20 percent, depending on   whether you’re operating in the north or south, but also about the employee contract law that was   just put into place, which in essence allows for almost an old-fashioned scala mobile Italian/French   model, which feeds a wage–price spiral, and it is beginning to infect their wage cost and inject   rigidities into their ability to operate in China   So overall, Mr Chairman, I am concerned, obviously, about economic growth  I think we,   as President Lockhart mentioned, are in a very difficult spot  We have three enormously worrisome   August 5, 2008 46 of 145    scenarios facing us  I think we have to be very careful how we word ourselves on inflation  Last   night at 600 National Public Radio opened their Marketplace report with this headline  “The Fed   Fuels Your Pain”  We have a perception issue that we must address, and there are two ways to do   it  One is by being strong in terms of how we argue the case of inflation  The other is to act by   raising rates  I’m going to listen very, very carefully because, frankly, I’m undecided here as to   what the right approach is  But I think we have to be careful when we state a balance of risks,   which are enormous, that we don’t understate the fact that inflation is now being accommodated in   the minds of the marketplace  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Well, I do see the CPI rising  The monthly report was not encouraging  The   last 12 months have not been encouraging, and I think what worries me is the spread between core   and headline  Core is rising as well, by the way  Even our own estimates indicate that  I do see it   in headline numbers  The numbers I saw that were just reported I thought were quite alarming    You are seeing the pass-through  You’re hearing evidence of this in the anecdotal reports  I do   believe, Mr Chairman, that it’s visible in the data  I’m just trying to report what I’m hearing from   the field against the background of much more sophisticated analysis, which I respect enormously    What I’m worried about is the perception     I do believe that the data are very imperfect on inflation expectations—I noticed that David   said that about the further-out expectations in the Michigan survey  If you look at the reliability of   the data, the one-year survey, which has risen significantly, has been quite reliable over time  The   August 5, 2008 47 of 145    five-to-ten-year—I don’t know if they’re talking about ten years, five years, or somewhere between   the two, and I don’t think statistically that’s been a very accurate indicator historically, but I’m not   sure about that  So we have very imperfect hard data on inflation expectations, and I think that’s   when anecdotal evidence may be helpful  All I’m trying to do, Mr Chairman, is report to you what   I’m hearing from the field, and not from my District, and I hope it is useful in the deliberations    Well, in terms of the weight, again, I’m just one of 17 or 18, and I would   weigh it accordingly  But I am worried that we’ve had a spread between headline and core for a   long period now  I am worried that we’re seeing core expectations pick up—modestly but they are   beginning to pick up  I am worried that core expectations are above 2 percent  And I am   particularly worried about developments on the global wage front in terms of how it affects the cost   of goods sold here in the United States   One last thing that I just started to detect—and again, it’s all just hearsay—but I’m   increasingly hearing reports of concerns of people who operate companies about the welfare of their   employees and about their ability to pay transportation costs, pay food costs, and maintain the value   of their 401(k) plans and, as President Lockhart reported, some way to try to manage, if not through   formal demands on wages, at least to try to cushion their welfare  These are marginal influences,   and I don’t disrespect the analytical side  I do worry that data capture history, and I’m trying to give   myself a sense for what is happening at the margin in terms of microeconomic behavior, and the   report is only what it’s worth  It’s just one input in the many  Thank you    In terms of the wording in paragraph 3, if we do not raise rates, I am   wondering why the second sentence that is now in alternative C wouldn’t be more appropriate   for alternative B, and I am wondering what your thinking is about that  In other words, if we   don’t take action, that seems to be a more emphatic statement than what you have currently,   assuming no change in rate—“The Committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and   next year,” et cetera—whereas if we are trying to send a signal that we are really concerned and   we do not change rates, why wouldn’t we have used, “Although the Committee expects inflation   to moderate    the possibility that inflation may fail to decline as anticipated is of significant   concern”?  Then, maybe take the word “also” out of the fourth paragraph  It just seems to me   odd that if we act and describe the risk after acting, the language is even stronger  Whereas if we   don’t act and we want to emphasize that we are remaining vigilant, why wouldn’t we use that   stronger language?  I am curious as to why you chose the two or what you feel the tradeoff is   there    Well, Mr Chairman, I’m already out of the closet in terms of my economic   proclivities  I realize it’s awkward for some folks, but I haven’t heard enough today that would   change my view that we are running an over-accommodative monetary policy  I agree with your   point very much that the rates and the terms being faced by those who drive the economy count  As   to Governor Kohn’s point that some of these key rates have not come down, I think that has more to   August 5, 2008 116 of 145    do with risk premiums, and I hate to see it migrate toward inflation premiums, which I believe is a   significant risk  I’m obviously driven by what I hear from my contacts, although I respect the   analytics you mentioned, Governor Mishkin  My long-run thinking is as conditioned by   globalization as it is by domestic policy, and I just still have a great concern about the wage–price   spiral that’s taking place in some of our manufacturing centers in the developing countries   I think it would be wise, just to shift my analogy here and think in canine terms, to take a   newspaper across the snout and call for a 25 basis point increase  We’re always talking about   tightening at some point  I think it just becomes increasingly difficult to take that first step  I grant   you that the economy is weak  The financial situation is brittle  That hasn’t changed in my view,   but the inflationary behavioral patterns that I’m beginning to hear about reinforce my concern about   an updrift in the core and the headline data  So I apologize, it perhaps is being a little too strong to   say that we’ve become unmoored or that maybe we are no longer anchored  I think that is   nonetheless a real perception  I’m going to vote against alternative B and for alternative C  I may   be a minority of one, but perhaps I’ll be a sea anchor, if you understand the sailing analogy here,   and assist the process of our commitment to be focused on inflation as a risk just as we focused on   downside risk to growth  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8523,2008-09-16,"  Mr Chairman, I was going to say that we had this discussion before  We   did approve the swap lines  I wonder if you could just summarize for us what you view as the   downside risk to our doing this    Second    Could I ask just one question, Mr Chairman?    Could you interpret for us the Bank of China’s cut in the bank lending rate?   September 16, 2008 23 of 108     Thank you    Could I ask for a little clarification here?  The indication of sentiment is   important, is it not, in terms of expectations from the population that you’re talking about?  The   signaling of our direction would be important here?    Mr Chairman, it may surprise you that President Yellen and I agree,   [laughter] at least with the recommendation, as I do with the majority  I also agree firmly with   President Hoenig  David wanted to know a little more about Houston, so I will start out with that,   and then I’ll quickly go to the policy matter   The storm devastated Galveston and Beaumont  Their combined population is 650,000    The population of the greater Houston area is 65 million  The damage to Houston was moderate    The overall effect on the Texas economy should be relatively mild  We still expect employment   growth this year of 1½ percent or so, plus or minus, even though the storm really hit hard an area   that accounts for 26 percent of our employment and 30 percent of our output  In terms of the   national impact, I think it’s important to understand that the energy infrastructure took minor losses    The short-term functioning of that infrastructure is hampered by power losses and water problems    Gasoline prices have gone up because 39 million barrels a day, or roughly 22 percent of the US   refining capacity, has been shut down  By the way, that affects the spot market—I think that’s some   of the reason you’ve seen this weakness recently—and maybe the near-term futures market  If you   look at the gasoline price market, the gasoline price went up another 13 cents yesterday, but the near   futures market is down 19 cents  I think it reflects expectations that, once power is restored, the   refineries will come back on line about a week later  So we will likely have a temporary bump-up   in inflation due to the gas prices  But I think it is important to realize that this, unlike Katrina, didn’t   shut down the Mississippi, and the effect on other commodity prices is likely not to be significant,   with one exception  If you look, you’ll see that prices of soybeans and soybean oil have spiked   recently  Clearly, the weather has an impact, but I think that’s more supply–demand imbalance—  something that I’m watching carefully   September 16, 2008 52 of 108    The silver lining, if there is a silver lining to human tragedy, is probably twofold  One is, if   you notice, that lumber prices are actually up this year, which is kind of odd in terms of lumber   trading  Of course, lumber producers are probably pretty happy with the devastation in our state    Second, Mexican laborers will be very happy if we let them into the country because the Hispanics   build most of our buildings in the United States  But I would say that the storm should not have any   effect on nor should it alter our preferred policy direction, and I would like to talk about that very   quickly   I have been affected in my thinking about economic growth and inflation by what I’m   seeing overseas  I’m globally oriented  I do expect that we’re going to have less impetus from   exports, which were significant in carrying our growth  Our numbers show that, and your numbers,   David, show that, and all of our conversations have revolved around that  We were surprised on the   upside by it  Now I think weakening economic growth elsewhere is likely to subdue that effect    We have also had an appreciation of the dollar  Oil prices have declined  I dove deep in my   anecdotal explorations with the majors and also with all supply companies  For whatever it’s worth,   they are convinced that OPEC now has $100 rather than $70 as their benchmark  Most of them   expect prices to slide down to somewhere in the $80 range  But over the longer term, whatever that   term may be, we’re going to talk about $100-plus oil  Then, of course, many commodity prices are   off their peaks  They have retraced significantly—some entirely   That said, in my anecdotal interchanges, I am still hearing about the likelihood, as I think   President Pianalto mentioned, that people are seeking to preserve their margins  They’ve been   stung for many years, and I’ll just give you one case because I think it tells us something  If you   talk to the CEO of Wal-Mart USA, what they are pricing to be on their shelf six to eight months   from now has an average price increase of 10 percent  Now, of course, you might have this   September 16, 2008 53 of 108    reversed as we go through time  My biggest disappointment, incidentally, was that the one bakery   that I’ve gone to for thirty years, Stein’s Bakery in Dallas, Texas, the best maker of not only bagels   but also anything that has Crisco in it, [laughter] has just announced a price increase due to cost   pressures  But I do think we have a mitigation of inflation, and we also have a mitigation of the   impetus to economic growth   As to the current financial predicament, I want to go back to a comment I made a long time   ago  This is not the first for me  I like to tease President Stern about his maturity—I don’t go back   to the Panic of 1890, but to Herstatt, 1974; New York City’s failure, 1975; 1987; and what   happened in Japan  Incidentally, you see the same pictures repeated in every newspaper  It’s   always the trader holding his head or looking up at the board  Now it’s in color; it used to be black   and white  I think it comes from the same archive, and it is repeated throughout time  [Laughter]   All of that reminds me—forgive me for quoting Bob Dylan—but money doesn’t talk; it   swears  When you swear, you get emotional  If you blaspheme, you lose control  I think the main   thing we must do in this policy decision today is not to lose control, to show a steady hand  I would   recommend, Mr Chairman, that we embrace unanimously—and I think it’s important for us to be   unanimous at this moment—alternative B  Thank you, Mr Chairman    I am sort of indifferent about this, but I don’t want to forget what   Governor Duke was talking about  It’s not just financial markets; it’s financial developments    We are also talking about the internal dynamics of what is happening in the banking system and   the credit contraction you spoke of  So we lead off with financial markets  I don’t want people   to think we are focusing only on markets—Governor Warsh, I would disagree on that point  It’s   a minor disagreement, but I think it is overkill    Unless you are from the south  [Laughter]  "
8544,2008-09-29,"  Someone has had a BlackBerry on during the last two or three sentences    Mr Chairman, this may be a conversation for another day, but it seems to   me that we’re ending up with more and more concentration—Bank of America, Citicorp, Morgan—  and I’m curious as to what we plan longer term so as not to displace the ability of other institutions   to play their role in the financial markets and grow their businesses—the super-regionals that are   healthy and so on  But I guess just philosophically what concerns me longer term is that, in   response to these actions, there are no other people to take these steps, but we’re creating larger and   larger concentrations and bigger and bigger situations where we have too big to fail  I’d just like at   some point to have a conversation on that matter  I’m not objecting to the move taken, obviously,   September 29, 2008 13 of 16    but it is going to present a bigger problem as we go down the path because we’re getting increasing   concentration in fewer and fewer institutions  Just a comment  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8556,2008-10-07,"  Mr Chairman, I just want to add to Nathan’s discussion but join it with the   credit road  I spent this afternoon with the National Retail Federation  These are CEOs of Home   Depot to JCPenney’s to Ann Taylor, et cetera  One thing that I’ve been concerned about has been   Chinese pressures in terms of their selling prices  As you know, these were being elevated—for   example, in women’s wear, 8 percent across the board  What is interesting is that, in the past two   weeks, it has completely changed  They will deal only with those they consider to be creditworthy   buyers, and they’ve now negotiated that price all the way back to last year’s levels, as long as you   are creditworthy  If you’re not creditworthy in their opinion, they won’t sell to you, period  So   these two things are beginning to join, and I think this adds to the points that Nathan made  It’s not   just a matter of slack  It’s a matter of unwillingness to deal with certain opposite parties—a   counterparty risk of its own kind, so to speak—and it at least mitigates the concern I’ve had about   the pass-through risk that we’ve talked about quite a bit  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, we enjoy visiting Third World countries  [Laughter]    Mr Chairman, I find especially attractive the global coordination that you   and others have engineered here  I think it’s important that we act in concert with our colleagues  I   don’t have any problem with the statement  I do worry about whether or not we have any bullets   left in our holster on this front, and I think we need to be mindful of that as we go forward  I’m   sympathetic to President Plosser’s comment about inflation, but I think in this case that the   inference is pretty clear—that is, we’re accepting the fact that this economic weakness that is driven   or exacerbated by the intensification of the financial market turmoil does reduce the risk to   inflation—and I think the implication is “for the foreseeable future”   I trust, however, going back to a point that Governor Mishkin made before his departure—it   may surprise you that I agree with Governor Mishkin—that we do have to be resolute in our   understanding that we will not repeat the mistakes that have been made in the past  Once this   condition is under control and the economy begins to repair—and I expect it will be quite a while   before that occurs—I hope that we will not be the least bit hesitant to tighten monetary policy if it’s   required and not make the mistake of the past of waiting too long  Incidentally, markets are rarely   October 7, 2008 22 of 30    satisfied even with an action such as the one that’s about to be taken, and they’ll ask for more, and   they’ll want to take more  But I support the cut, Mr Chairman  Thank you  "
8580,2008-10-28,"  Just to follow up on your note, Mr Chairman, I spent four years as the   senior trade negotiator with all four of these countries, and I’d just like to comment on their   importance to us  Mexico is obvious  It’s a national security risk  We’re interlinked   economically  They have a sophisticated central bank and a very good central bank governor,   and I think that would be number one on the list  Singapore is unique  I doubt that Singapore   would ever go to the IMF  It would be beneath Lee Kuan Yew’s dignity  It is a vital link in   terms of that sphere of the world  You made the case earlier, or at least Nathan made a case, as   to the uniqueness of Singapore  In terms of Brazil, I’d say that is the dodgiest of the lot    However, we should remember that 40 percent of the GDP of Latin America south of the   Yucatan is produced by that one country and roughly 60 percent of the population is represented   by that one country  It has made significant progress since Cardoso was president, and it is a   robust economy relatively speaking  Every economy in Latin America borders upon it  It does   have a unique negotiating history—and Tim knows this as well as I do, having spent a lot of time   negotiating with them—but I would say that it is a critical part of our hemisphere and that is the   justification for including them in the package  Finally, we have been trying to negotiate a free   trade agreement with Korea for some time  Korea is an underrepresented country in terms of   discussions about developments in that part of the globe, and yet it is inordinately successful  I   would argue that it is also a strong case to make  The only other country that I would include   under the rubric that we might ever consider is Chile  Even though it is tiny, its representation is   important and its nature unique  I think you could justify doing this by virtue of their immediate   impact on our economy, their unique role in our hemisphere, and the fact that I doubt that they   October 28–29, 2008 17 of 206    would want to go to the IMF in the first place  Therefore, it is complementary to the package   you announced earlier  My only discomfort in the discussion would be the idea of allocating to   the Foreign Currency Subcommittee the authority to approve additional countries  As to the   supplement for these four countries that has been proposed, I would be in favor of that  Thank   you, Mr Chairman    Just responding to President Lacker  I think it would be an insult to these   four parties, particularly given the fact that we appear to have negotiated, again, the ability to   attach other assets  I am, frankly, surprised that Singaporeans would go along with that  If we   got that, I’d use it and pocket it  But I would argue, especially for the case of Mexico, that I   don’t see any reason that we should differentiate between them and Canada, for example  It   would stigmatize them in a way, and it would be an insult to these people  At the same time, as I   think I understand the explanation from Vice Chairman Geithner and from Nathan, we do have   some ramped-up security here—so it’s a special arrangement  I think going further than that   would not be appropriate    Have we been approached by any other countries?    Let me ask Nathan a question to follow up, if I may  Obviously you’ve been   approached by the governor of the Central Bank of Mexico—Ortiz has been here to visit    So what’s his argument?  I would assume that you asked these questions    So inform us as to what his justification is    Any conditionality?    I’m in favor Mr Chairman, and I would also favor, in terms of the screening   device for future requests, that you come back to the full Committee  Thank you    I have a question and a statement disguised as a question    A quick question on fiscal policy, both domestic and international  Being   struck, Ms Kole, by your verbs “whacked” and “disintegrated”—very forceful language—what   are your assumptions about fiscal policy in terms of staff projections, first, for the domestic   economy and, second, for other economies?  That’s the question part   October 28–29, 2008 63 of 206     So it’s possible that we might have marginally higher rates of growth   than—    The second thing goes back to this business of the judgmental effects of   financial market turmoil  Do you have any concern that the financial turmoil may have reduced   the marginal effectiveness of changes in the funds rate?  In other words, if you think in my   simple way of a patient on the operating table, we have an IV tube into them, we titrate the fed   funds rate—we have been cutting rates—but the tube has been crimped  The flow, I would   suggest may not be as full as it would have been before  Is it possible that we haven’t felt the   full effects or, all things being equal, we haven’t felt the same effects that we would have felt if   the pipes hadn’t been crimped?  I’m curious as to your view on that    Mr Chairman, I think it is clear that inflation has been rolled over by the   steamroller of the credit crisis  I am not going to belabor what I have heard from the CEOs I   have spoken to  Basically, the best summary is that things have gone from interesting to   unbelievable  We have had an implosion of economic activity  Business women and men, not   having any pricing power, are doing what you would expect them to do  They are cutting their   costs of goods sold, which means they are shedding head count dramatically  They are   stretching out their ROI assumptions, and they are cutting back on cap-ex and, basically,   assuming pro-cyclical behavior on the downside  I doubt that any of us are going to report   anything different, particularly since I think I am in a District that, relatively speaking, is still   strong  I would hope that during our discussions today we would each take the time, or at least   ask, for some response  I would like some response from you in particular  The situation is dire    There is no question about that  We are in dire straits  There is no inflationary tail, or if there is,   October 28–29, 2008 67 of 206    it is completely flattened in terms of the foreseeable future  The risks are to the downside on   economic growth   A question I have is, What do we do next?  Actually, I should address the issue of what   we do first  I don’t think doing dribbles and drabs is an answer  I think we just do nothing—and   I could make that case because we’ve done an awful lot—or we do something that is a firm   statement  But in response to that statement, the question has to be, What do we do as next   steps?  I’m particularly curious about whether or not we address during this meeting, and tonight   and tomorrow, not only next steps but what the end game is  Where do we want to be?  How   long are we going to be there, and eventually, how do we exit?  But that is, of course, the   ultimate question that I think we can delay  So, Mr Chairman, I’d like to suggest that we not go   through our standard ritual of reading about our Districts and so on because I don’t think there is   going to be a whole lot of difference  The real question is, What do we do about it, and what’s   the cognitive road map from here?  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, I would like to ask Governor Duke a question  Do you   sense in this deep dive into the institutions that you talked to that they are benefiting from cuts in   the fed funds rate?  Are they enthusiastic or not about the prospect for a lower fed funds rate?    Mr Chairman, if I could just add one other thing  We are hearing more   and more about people switching to LIBOR, trying to shift their lending contracts to LIBOR   rather aggressively, obviously, because they are higher rates  But I’m wondering if you’re   picking that up as well   October 28–29, 2008 111 of 206     Mr Chairman, if you had kicked around in the streets of Hong Kong in   1997, then you would have wandered into elementary schools and seen what we called at that   time “Quotrons”—children trading stocks on the lunchroom floor  It was the surest indicator   that the market was out of control  This morning I opened the Wall Street Journal, and on the   front page they describe an exercise run by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets   Association, which you know is Wall Street’s biggest trade group, with a similar program in   American schools  It says that a 13-year old in Wilmington, Delaware—Michael Ashworth—is   slumped by his computer, weary from another rough day in the stock market with all his favorite   picks—Domino’s Pizza, the Hershey Company, and Gap—surprise!  [Laughter]  “I’ll be honest   with you,” he confided, “before all this I asked my Mom to give me stocks for Christmas  But   then, I told her not to do it  I asked for a parakeet instead”  [Laughter]  Now, this is not as   exotic or thoughtful a handout as the one from my colleague from St Louis, but here’s the point    He may not get that parakeet because the pet store may not have access to credit  This is, to me,   the fundamental issue that I think President Plosser—and I won’t repeat his arguments—and   President Hoenig were referring to  The concern I have is not about the price of money  In fact,   October 28–29, 2008 135 of 206    I think we are not seeing that kind of transmission mechanism—Governor Duke gave testimony   to that earlier  All of us are aware that it is not moving as quickly through the IV tube as we   would like it to because of the crimped nature of the tube   I have no problem with the language in alternative A, except for the first paragraph, and   the phrase “including today’s rate reduction”  I have an open mind  I do think the issue in terms   of restoring the system comes back to credibility and predictability  You cannot have a   functioning capitalist system if you have total uncertainty  These are the issues that I believe   President Plosser, President Hoenig, earlier President Lacker, and others were referring to in the   first intervention  I thank President Geithner in particular for addressing the questions I asked   yesterday, and there was reference to them earlier   We have done so much so quickly  We are in a quantitative easing period  The question   is whether it actually makes a difference if we cut rates or not and whether the price of money is   actually the issue or the fact that money is not flowing, that there are counterparty risks and   rollover risks, and all the things we have talked about at this table and each of us has articulated   in our public speeches  To be very honest with you, Mr Chairman, I am open-minded about this   because I could make that argument both ways  If it doesn’t matter, why not cut 50 basis points?    Or why not hold?  I am not convinced yet—and I’d like to listen to the rest of the arguments—  that alternative A, in terms of the action, is the right way to go  I do think it’s very important that   we be very clear and articulate in laying out how we see the world, and I do believe that the   language in alternative A does the best job of all the columns that have been presented     But I come back to the question I asked before  What are the next steps?  I’d like to   know  What is the end game?  I’d like to know before I cast my vote  I will conclude with   actually once again agreeing with President Yellen, as I think I have done twice in history    October 28–29, 2008 136 of 206    [Laughter]  The last time was at the last meeting  I think it’s very important that we have all   hands on deck, that we have a unanimous decision  But, still, I would like answers to my   questions  Thank you, Mr Chairman    First, I would like to thank you, Mr Chairman, for that very thorough and   clear elucidation  I meant to mention earlier that I actually agree with President Evans  It’s   worthwhile now and then evoking Ronald Reagan  What I mean by that is not his “Where’s the   pony?” comment, but more important, the reason he was so successful as a leader was that he had   clear objectives, they were limited, and they were well articulated  It doesn’t matter if you’re a   Democrat or a Republican  I think it’s very important for us to understand what our objectives are   in order for us to be fully supportive  By the way, Tim, as Mr Plosser has been, I have been fully   supportive of all of these initiatives  Again, I want to thank you, Mr Chairman, for helping us   understand better the cognitive road map because it is critical for all of us to do what Janet   October 28–29, 2008 155 of 206    suggested, which is have all hands on deck and make sure we’re all fully supportive  Against that   background I would support alternative A  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8609,2008-12-15,"  Bill, has the FDIC’s temporary liquidity guarantee program interfered with   or added to the confusion in the purchase and sales of fed funds, or has our excluding sales under   one month changed the picture?    Is that pretty well understood in the marketplace?    Then speaking of guarantees, I have just one more question, if I may, Mr   Chairman  In chart 14, are these net of credits that might have some kind of government guarantee?    Yes    So for 2009?   December 15–16, 2008 11 of 284     It’s not this total?    Thank you    Corporate grade became junk in the Great Depression      Yes, sir  I just want to ask a question—again acknowledging that I am   the least well educated on this subject matter and not as erudite in my understanding  So this is a   tutorial question  What we have been doing is implicitly acknowledging that standard monetary   tools are not as effective as they could be because of the financial frictions that we have   encountered in the marketplace  So we have been targeting dealing with those financial frictions    My question, President Lacker, is just from an educational standpoint  Do we know how much   monetary base or balance sheet expansion would be needed to bring credit spreads back into   normal order or to deal with these financial frictions?  If we are going to target the monetary   base, I worry about the operational consequences of doing so, since it seems to me that is an   open-ended question  That is my question    Mr Chairman, my colleague Harvey Rosenblum made an interesting point   the other day that we’re at risk of being perceived as migrating from the patron saints of Milton   Friedman and John Taylor to a new patron saint—Rube Goldberg  [Laughter]  By the way, I’m   going to give a speech on Rube Goldberg next Thursday—I do think that it is important not to make   it needlessly complicated  So I think it’s very important that we have this discussion  I welcome   the discussion and welcome the papers so that we can not only have a cognitive road map for   ourselves but also figure out how we’re going to clearly articulate a deliberate change in regimes to   the public  I want to underscore what you said at the beginning of this conversation, Mr Chairman    December 15–16, 2008 83 of 284    We should be guided by what’s best for the country—period—and not get into internecine concerns   about governance  It’s what’s best for our economy and what’s best for the world economy    I’d like to talk about three points  I want to talk about the current predicament in very   general terms  I want to touch on governance and then on communications  First, with regard to   our current situation, it’s pretty clear that purchases and sales of fed funds have been distorted by   risk aversion, distrust of counterparties, and fear of pending bank insolvencies  Quantitative easing   resulting in massive excess reserves, we’ve talked about that; complications arising from the   transition to paying interest on required and excess reserves—as you pointed out earlier, this is a   regime shift that we’re still trying to effect and perfect; the need for GSEs to invest overnight   money at any positive rate; bank capital shortages that prevent the GSE funds from being   arbitraged; and quite possibly the FDIC’s temporary liquidity guarantee, although that seems to be a   minor factor—in these circumstances, focusing on the fed funds target seems to me to be a   diversion of our focus and energy, and I sent around a memo to that effect  Moreover, the short-  term riskless rate, the T-bill rate, is virtually zero  Reductions in the targeted fed funds rate cannot   lower the riskless rate any further   Adding to our difficulties is the fact that we simply do not know how financial   intermediaries or money and capital markets will behave and function when interest rates get this   low  We do have the Japanese example  We are not Japan  I have worked and lived in Japan, and   we have learned from what they’ve done  But the fact is that we have no sustained experience in   the modern era in the United States with T-bill rates and the effective fed funds rate trading near   zero  We do know that money market funds will become unprofitable if rates get much lower  Let   me just say to those who sort of dismiss that, I think we might look a little foolish if we drove some   of them out of business, especially after creating two special facilities to support their continued   December 15–16, 2008 84 of 284    intermediation functions on the basis that they were critically needed for their roles in the   commercial paper market   Furthermore, I’ve spoken with several community bankers, and I subjected Governor Duke   to some of that during her visit to Dallas  Their unanimous response to a further reduction in the   targeted fed funds rate would be to set a floor for their prime rate at its current 4 percent level or   some of them are suggesting that they would switch to a lending rate based off LIBOR—again, with   a floor to protect their margins, which are being severely tested  To the extent that larger banks   depend on deposits as a source of funding, reductions in the fed funds target rate from current levels   could damage their profitability also, and this goes to one of the points made by President   Rosengren and First Vice President Cumming  We do have to bear in mind that it’s important to   have a vibrant and healthy banking system across the country   In this new and untested interest rate environment, it is, in my opinion, tenuous to assume   that the fed funds target rate is the marginal cost of funds to a bank and that all of the usual and   customary costs in pricing relationships will hold  If deposit rates approach zero, as they are likely   to do for all but the zombie banks, it’s probable that the demand for currency will increase, a   prospect that I would prefer to avoid  To sum up, we’re in an interest rate environment in which the   linear properties of our model are likely breaking down  So where does this leave us?   It leaves us with the critical need to refocus our strategy and communication efforts on what   we have been doing and will continue to do—namely, restore the public’s confidence and trust in   financial intermediaries and financial markets, reduce term liquidity and credit spreads to something   approaching more-normal levels, improve the flow of credit through financial intermediaries and   financial markets, and restore economic growth and reverse the spillover of inflationary pressures   from asset markets to the markets for goods and services  Operationally it seems to me that we need   December 15–16, 2008 85 of 284    to shift our focus away from the fed funds rate target—parenthetically, which we cannot control—to   something that we might better influence—namely, the reduction, or perhaps a better phrase, the   normalization of liquidity and credit spreads  The fact is that we have already entered this domain,   and by stating it that way—that is, approaching the normalization of liquidity and credit spreads—  we would have a clear exit strategy, and we could discontinue this focus when spreads return to   something approaching normal   This has the additional advantage that it is a conditional commitment  I would avoid any   reference to specific targeting for the monetary base or the size of our balance sheet  We simply do   not know in current circumstances how fast or how far, as I referenced earlier in my question to   President Lacker, we need to expand our balance sheet to restore normal spreads or normal credit   flows  Some of our facilities—for example, the MMIFF—have worked with almost no usage    Others have acquired extensive usage  In sum, it seems clear to me that focus on the target fed   funds rate is misplaced in the current environment  If we are to restore the functioning of the credit   markets, we need to address that objective explicitly   With regard to governance, in addition to reading the 21 papers that were sent out and the   Bluebook, this last week I read a novel called World without End written by Ken Follett  It should   have been called A Book without End because it goes on for 1,000 pages  [Laughter]  It’s about the   plague in the fourteenth century  One of the interesting lessons from reading that book is that the   monks in that period, who dominated society, reverted to the old orthodoxy learned from the   Greeks  They were the best educated  They were the Oxford-educated intelligentsia  But by   reverting to the old orthodoxy, they did not learn what the nuns learned, which is what you learn   from practice  The reason I mention this, Mr Chairman, is that I think there is great value, as we try   to figure out and articulate the new regime, to have these shared discussions at the table  I want to   December 15–16, 2008 86 of 284    thank you in that sense for your comments, not only about good faith but also about the need to   have this discussed broadly within the FOMC and not just adhere to the old orthodoxy  All of us   have different levels of experience and backgrounds, and we learn from those different levels of   experience and backgrounds   Finally, on the issue of communications, one of my colleagues often says that, if you’re   Elton John, you are expected to sing “Bennie and the Jets” every single time and at every single   concert  It seems to me that, once we get and hone our message, we must repeat it incessantly and   stay on message in order to have it penetrate  In Austin, you gave what I consider to be a hallmark   and—not trying to flatter you—for monetary policy a historic speech  What was Bloomberg’s first   reaction?  The Fed may cut rates further  The message was lost  We all need to stay on message    But I think it’s very important, whether we have press conferences or whether you give speeches,   that we need to hammer the theme of the new regime that we are about to embrace over and over   and over again  So I didn’t pick “Bennie and the Jets” just because of your name, Mr Chairman    [Laughter]  But I do hope you remember that we must have that constant refrain  If we’re going to   sell something, we have to sell it by repeating it, not asking the press to interpret it for us but to get   the message out in—excuse me, Governor Kohn—full frontal view  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Just a comment on the projections for China—these numbers seem to be   less than what they are saying officially  Am I correct?    That sort of jibes with the reports that I am hearing back from the CEOs   doing business in China  In fact, the cutback has been much more dramatic than they expected    Semiconductor firms, for example, have put ship-stop orders, meaning they are stopping for lack   of payment, and the retailers are seeing a noticeable drop in attendance at their stores  But I   think that our numbers are more fitting    But you are saying that we do expect further currency depreciation    I have three questions, Mr Chairman  One on the commercial paper   market  What is the spread between A1/P1 and A2/P2 right now?    So the incentive for A1/P1 borrowers is to do everything they can to keep   that status, obviously  It is a much more attractive proposition    I guess my point is that the way in which it works is that it gives people   incentives to be even more conservative in the financial management of their operations  On   household credit, do we have a sense of how much shift is taking place between credit card usage   and debit card usage?  Under these conditions of duress, has that been a noticeable change, or is   it just marginal?    It might be something to look at next time  Finally, on the inflation table   in exhibit 5—and you have talked about the numbers that were released this morning—do you   see additional monthly deflationary numbers on the headline CPI, or could you see this   happening for a prolonged period, say for a quarter?  We have a table here for 2008, 2009, and   2010  On the top line, the PCE price index, do we envision monthly or perhaps quarterly   extensions of deflationary headline numbers?   December 15–16, 2008 117 of 284     So December/January?    And what is the order of magnitude?    Thank you, Mr Chairman    Nathan, you would probably have been arrested for treason if you had said   that in Latvia—literally  The economist who gives a negative forecast is arrested for treason  Stay   here  [Laughter]    He just wanted you to know about it, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, thank you  President Rosengren talked about micro   behavior, and at the beginning, First Vice President Cumming talked about the hunkering-down   mentality  I have been focused on the microeconomic behavioral responses to our current   situation  As one of my CEO contacts outside my region said, we are basically all, in his words,   “chasing the anvil down the stairs,” and that is that the behavioral responses of both businesses   and consumers are driving us into a slow-growth cul-de-sac and a deflationary trap   One CEO I talked with was quite pleased that he could borrow $40 million over the   weekend for a total of $250  That is great from a commercial paper standpoint; he is an A1/P1   issuer  However, were he to go to the longer-term debt markets, it would cost him 7½ percent    So they can finance their daily operations easily  But in terms of their long-term planning, they   and others are responding—and I see this uniformly across my contacts—out of concern about   the high cost of debt and the spreads over Treasuries, by doing what any businesswoman or   December 15–16, 2008 146 of 284    businessman would do  They are planning on less cap-ex, and they are cutting back on their   plans for acquisitions of the weak, which they would like to take advantage of under the current   circumstances  They are also responding to the situation by cutting back on head count  So,   Chris, there is very much a hunkering-down mentality, not just in my District but across the   country  That leads to further economic weakness—that plus the fact that they are chary about   issuing and paying for things with shares in a very weak market  I am hearing more and more   worries about their pension liabilities and how they are going to be able to finance those    Obviously this is leading to the kind of economic behavior that none of us would like to see   On the consumer side, you see a similar behavioral pattern  It seems that after Black   Friday, according to my sources, there was weaker behavior than one had expected  The   spending pulse data that I get from one of the large credit card companies reflect what one would   expect under these circumstances—that is, a shift to nonbranded products, smaller purchases of   items, a rotation out of credit cards to debit cards and cash payments according to the pay cycle,   and overall an expectation, on both the business and the consumer side, that things will get   cheaper if they wait longer and they postpone either their cap-ex or their consumer purchases   The one ray of sunshine that I was able to find is that one large law firm, Cravath, has   announced that it is not increasing its billing rates in 2009, [laughter] and other law firms are   actually planning to respond by cutting their billing rates  One woman whom I know   summarized it this way  “This is the divorce from hell  My net worth has been cut in half, but I   am still stuck with my husband”  [Laughter]      May I ask two questions, please?  With regard to alternative A, I am   curious, Brian, as to how you think the bankers would respond to that in terms of their pricing   behavior and loans and prime  Second, our friend from the New York Desk, how do you think   the markets might respond to alternative A—not overnight, by the way, which I couldn’t care   less about, but over the longer term    Even though we are not stating a specific target, it would be implicit in   the change in the level of the discount rate    Thank you     Mr Chairman, before I get started, I do think that President Plosser has   raised good issues on the governance matter  I hope that we will continue to discuss this, bearing in   mind that there may be changes in the composition of the governors with a new President and given   the faith that we built up with the existing governors, so that we have to get at least our lines of   understanding clear as we go through time  As to the alternatives that we face, the problem with the   economy isn’t the interbank lending rate or even the riskless rate  The problem with the economy   and with the financial markets is that intermediation has broken down  I think our actions should   forcefully be directed toward the clearing of blockages in the financial plumbing and not just   fiddling with the faucet  It’s the availability and distribution of credit that is problematic     In that sense I like alternative A  In fact, President Stern, I like its ambiguity, and I’ll tell   you why  I am quite worried that stating zero to 25 basis points will bring down upon us the wrath   of bankers  I do think it’s important that community banks be profitable and that they be healthy    First Vice President Cumming pointed this out in her comments, and to me this alternative gives us   substantial wiggle room, as it were, in its ambiguity  Vice Chairman Kohn pointed out that   paragraph 5 is good for the bankers  Without stating a specific target fed funds rate, it allows them   to price their loans according to how they see fit  That appears to be taking place anyway  There is   a separation between the fed funds rate and the prime loan rate  So unless I’m missing something,   bankers should positively interpret both paragraph 1 and paragraph 5 in terms of their operating   leeway   December 15–16, 2008 195 of 284    I would suggest that this is an important step forward in making clear the way we’re going   to operate henceforth  It does indicate a regime change, and as President Bullard pointed out, I   think we have to be forceful in doing so  I could diddle with the language, but to be even more   forceful I would transpose paragraph 4 and paragraph 3  That is, the first two paragraphs strike me   as fine  At this juncture I would not put in an inflation target because I don’t think we’re prepared   for it as a Committee  I’m comfortable leaving in paragraph 2 that we see some risk that inflation   could decline below optimal rates for a time  After all, we just got the number that makes that very   clear—minus 17 on the headline rate  But then I would go immediately into what our focus is   going to be  I rather like President Plosser’s one edit to make clear that it’s the focus of the   FOMC’s policy  After we have laid that clear—and if, indeed, just parenthetically we are going to   make some Treasury purchases, we should include that in there; if we are not, we should not—then   in what would be paragraph 4, strike “in current circumstances” and say that “the Committee judged   that it was not useful to set a specific target for the fed funds rate”  You’re making it very clear that   we have a regime change  As to the content of paragraph 4, assuming we are going to be   purchasing longer-term Treasuries, I’d leave it as it is  Stay on message  Repeat it over and over   and over again  You started with your speech in Austin, and that makes it operative  I have no   problem with it, and I would urge it be included as written   So my suggestions, in summary, are that we embrace alternative A; we transpose paragraphs   4 and 3; we take out the wording “in current circumstances” because obviously we’re judging things   in current circumstances; and we not include an inflation target at this juncture but do include the   rest of the bracketed language in paragraph 2  I believe this is sellable to our bankers, and I believe   it’s a good way to proceed  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, I just want to come back to a point I suggested  Is there any   sense in transposing paragraphs 3 and 4 to emphasize the new regime?    Yes, sir    Mr Chairman, I can’t support that, and I’ll tell you why  I do feel that we   had an elegant solution in alternative A  I firmly believe that if we target 0 to 25 basis points—the   effective funds rate we all know is trading at 1/16—it is going to create enormous backlash  It is   unacceptable to me to say that the bankers will figure out how to deal with this  They can’t    Second, as far as money market funds are concerned, the expense load is usually 30 basis points  So   for whatever it is worth, I will be a minority of one, but I cannot support that  Alternative A was   elegant in that it made no statement  Then, and I think very important, by dwelling on this business   of what our target rate is, we diminish what we’re doing, and what we’re doing is changing things   fundamentally, which I fully support   December 15–16, 2008 210 of 284    So for whatever it’s worth, I understand all the counter-arguments  Janet and I have talked   about this  I know what people are going to say  I think (a) it is an unnecessary distraction, (b) it   creates a potential political backlash, and (c) it is counterproductive  So I just want to state it myself   straightforwardly and honestly—I may be the only person at this table, but I’ll vote against that  If   you give us alternative A, I’ll vote for it  I know I’m one of 17 at this table—there are more than 17   people at this table  I apologize, but I don’t think it’s necessary to make the funds rate clear  It’s   implied in what we’re doing, but alternative A gives people enough ambiguity to steer around it,   and that’s my opinion  I apologize    The key is paragraph 4 in alternative A—that is what we’re doing    Of course  They can always have their markup, but you can also reverse the   argument and say, so why do you want to cut rates?  Again, I think we’re pushing on a string here,   Mr Chairman  Forgive me for speaking, but the guts of what we’re doing and the importance of   what we’re doing, which I fully support, are in paragraph 4, and I believe we’re distracting from that   by focusing on the fed funds rate    But I asked you that during the question period      I heard eleven people argue the case for alternative A  I counted them    We’re bridging    For example, would you consider AAA industrial-grade credits?  "
8633,2009-01-16," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have two questions  You may remember   that, back when we first started down this path, we had a discussion—at least I raised the   subject—about a decision tree and about our assessing possible outcomes  I can say this in front   of the group; this is an inside question  After that discussion, President Geithner and I had           January 16, 2009 7 of 69  substantial phone conversations, and I was assured that there was a decision tree and that we   were thinking through all the different possible outcomes  My question is the following What   probability did we assign to this kind of problem arising from B of A, particularly when they   announced the merger with Merrill?  I am curious as to whether we envisioned this as a   possibility If so—and, of course, circumstances change over time, and nothing is perfect—what   reasonable probability did we assign when that merger was announced that we might have to   step up to the plate?  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have a follow-up question that is not related to   this about an outside response to a question that I anticipate   Thank you, Mr Chairman  This is a separate question  How do we   expect to counter concerns that we are basically underwriting greater concentration as we go   through time?  In essence, what we are doing here is providing emergency lending to underwrite   heavy concentration by virtue of a merger  So I would just appreciate your thoughts or perhaps   the thoughts of other members of the Committee on how we deflect that kind of concern if it   arises in the marketplace   Thank you, Mr Chairman  Again, I pray that we keep this in mind, as   obviously we are doing, as we go through time because our actions might counter our intentions   if we are not careful Thank you for addressing the issue  I appreciate it    Yes, and where you can see how creative destruction works over very   prolonged periods, Mr Chairman  I recommend it to anybody who would want to truly get away   from what we constantly worry about   Mr Chairman, you have heard a broad range of views, and that broad range of views   indicates the difficulty of reaching a decision in short order here  In terms of my own preferences,   from a theoretical standpoint rather than go through each particular aspect, I would basically ask   that I be recorded almost point by point as President Plosser early on articulated  We are in exact   agreement from the standpoint of what we might seek to achieve theoretically  I was taken by   President Evans’s comments, however, in terms of the validity of ultimately having a price   objective, but his concern that now is not a good time  I was particularly struck by his phrase that   this exercise may be orthogonal, as he put it, to the current financial crisis  The only disagreement I   have with President Plosser is that issue of timing, and I would probably say that, unlike President   Evans of Chicago, I am not open-minded on the subject  Let me explain   I do not believe the issue right now is the political environment We went through this   argument before in 2007  My views are clearly recorded  I was quite concerned about the politics   of this, given my background and given that I am neither an academic nor as intellectually potent as   the rest of the people around this table or on this video screen  I worry about those things  What I   worry about most, though, is the last time we discussed this we were basically fiddling while Rome                          January 16, 2009 49 of 69  was beginning to burn, and I worry about the market perception of our focusing on this issue at this   time  Let me be blunt from the standpoint of what we have been able to achieve   We basically are working our way out of a deep end zone, just to use a football analogy    Charlie will appreciate this since they decimated the Dallas Cowboys  We have fumbled   sometimes, and we have been sacked a few times, but I think we are beginning to build street   credibility, and that street credibility comes from the evolution of our understanding of these issues    As President Lacker and you said earlier in discussing the Bank of America transaction or the new   support program, we are learning more as we go on  I think we have more respect in the   marketplace I think the New York Desk is gaining—not that they did not have credibility before—   and we have achieved a great deal in terms of these new programs we are undertaking  We have a   financial crisis upon us  I do not believe that has been alleviated, and I think we are just at the   beginning of the game  We are deep in the end zone  We are beginning to work our way down the   field, and I worry that being viewed as engaging in a theoretical discussion, which has lots of   niceties to it and a lot of attraction to it ultimately, may just make it look as though we are not   keeping our eye on the ball or keeping to our game plan   So I would argue very strongly from my sense of those with whom I talk in the marketplace   that this is not a good time to proceed with this endeavor  We can think about it  I think the   discussion today has been very thorough  Again, I line up with President Plosser in terms of what I   would ultimately like to do  I do not have much of a difference of view there  But I do not think,   Mr Chairman, that this is a good time to proceed from a financial market perspective and the way   we are being perceived in the outside world, whatever the validities may be; and I do not think   anybody can doubt, certainly on the hawkish side, my credentials on this issue of inflation, even to   the point of standing all by myself against a much wiser majority  I am deeply concerned about the                                  January 16, 2009 50 of 69  deflationary gearing that we are encountering right now  But I do not think it is the time to talk   about this, and I think we should just keep our eye on the ball of what we have been doing and   basically running the business that we are running the way we are running it currently   I want to conclude with just underscoring another comment by President Plosser, which is   that words and communication are not enough  Our actions speak infinitely louder than our words,   and right now I think our actions should be devoted to getting ourselves out of the mess we find   ourselves in  I think we are making progress on that front, and I do not want to be distracted from it    Thank you, Mr Chairman    Well, very quickly, Mr Chairman, I think Governor Duke’s suggestion is   very good, both short and long term  I just want to thank you for the fairness of what you are   suggesting here I think it goes a long way to being inclusive and certainly to avoid   disenfranchising the Committee, which is no one’s intention  Like Gary, I’m stymied at trying to                    January 16, 2009 65 of 69  figure out a metric  But I think the important point is that we will at least be having a full-throated   discussion of the interactions and the monetary consequences of our initiatives, and I just want to   thank you for the proposal that you have made  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8652,2009-01-27," Not in quality   First, Mr Chairman, I think this may be the first time that a Wellesley   woman has had responsibility for the Trading Desk  I am married to a Wellesley woman  I am   used to being tutored by a Wellesley woman  [Laughter] So I have two questions that I would   like to ask, just out of ignorance  The first is about the 65-day rule, particularly—and I may not   understand this—but in paragraph 1(B) and then paragraph 4, the requirement to resell after   65 days or less, does that apply in the case of MBS or not?   Okay Then the second Is the limit on $25 billion of an open position in   all foreign currencies still current?  Is that appropriate under current circumstances?   Thank you   Well, actually, President Evans asked one of the questions that I was   going to ask Mine is a lot more generic, of Trish  To what degree do you sense that this credit   default swap market is helping or hindering efficient markets and the equilibration of these   distortions that we are seeing? Because there is some debate about this  I am talking about the   speculative CDS positions   So is it exacerbating?        January 27–28, 2009 32 of 267  That actually is the basis of my question  The point is whether we are   getting good information from the CDS spreads, not a distorted version   Thank you   I do want just to jump in  I thought your response was appropriate and   correct, and obviously ultimately we would like to put as much of this back to the Treasury as   possible The ultimate objective is to insulate ourselves as a central bank as much as possible   from political pressures, so we can do what central bankers do  I might also add as much as   possible from market pressures, but that is another matter  But I disagree with the point made—   and I agree with the staff conclusion—with regard to the purchase of Treasuries  It strikes me   that there is enormous fear in the marketplace about the potential for open-ended stimulus in   fiscal policy and there is great concern that we will acquiesce by monetizing fiscal policy  I am   very reluctant to go down that road  That strikes me as one of the strongest arguments that the   staff made  At any rate, at this point I don’t think it is necessary  Rates are quite low as they are    I disagree, Jeffrey, in ideal market situations, as the Vice Chairman just pointed out—whatever   you are of this Committee— [laughter]    As one of our many Vice Chairmen pointed out, this is a highly distorted   market, and I would suggest—I was listening to what you said—in fact, the effort may lower   Treasury rates at the price of raising other rates that you might crowd out perversely by   supporting the Treasury market at this juncture  So I would support the staff’s recommendations   Because we have so many things on the table, I did have a question with regard to Brian’s   point That is, when would we consider closing a facility?  As long as we have these different   facilities open—and we haven’t shoved everything over to the Treasury—might it not send a   good signal to the market—and I know President Plosser is probably going to talk about this a   little, too, because we talked about it at lunch, just to be open—to close down one of these   facilities that was not being utilized  For example, the AMLF or the MMIFF—all of these        January 27–28, 2009 48 of 267  “initialisms” are getting confusing—if they are not active, do we want to give to all of them the   same time extension?  That is my question  Now, you might respond that we don’t know yet but   they might be utilized  I haven’t read through the specifics of your language proposition, but   might we not at least make it clear that, if we feel that we have leeway, we could close down any   one of these facilities while we extend their ultimate maturity?  So the real question is, Can we   find something that we might actually close to demonstrate that we don’t just have an open-  ended book, until we reach the point that you wish to reach, Mr Chairman, as you articulated   and as President Lacker argued, where we shove this onto the Treasury?   Real quick, a domestic question and an international question  The   domestic question, which is just a data question  What do we expect the Treasury issuance to be   in fiscal year 2009?  The numbers I have seen go up to $2½ trillion   But my question is new issuance   Could you get it to me sometime?   On the international side—maybe this is a question for Nathan—I am   curious As I understand it, the Exchequer has given the Bank of England permission to   purchase outright high-quality corporate bonds  I presume that they have had the same kind of   discussion that we have had about moral hazard, how far they want to go, which securities they           January 27–28, 2009 110 of 267  wish to purchase, and so on I was thinking about that looking at this table in exhibit 11 and the   United Kingdom’s predicament, but do you know who has some insight into that decision and   how perverse or how wise it is?   Thank you, Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman, Mr Plosser said he would take a more optimistic view to   make the distribution complete  I was going to say that I am going to take the opposite tack, but   President Yellen pretty much summarized what I was about to say  I do want to comment on my   District, and second, I want to talk very briefly about microeconomic behavior based on my   discussions with various CEOs around the country—26 this time  Mr Chairman, you have the   list of who they are outside my District   First, with regard to our District, like President Hoenig’s, our two Districts, I believe, are   the only ones that had positive employment growth last year  In the Eleventh District, we              January 27–28, 2009 131 of 267  created 192,400 jobs, according to our adjusted data, all in the private sector  That machine has   stopped; in fact, we would have a straight line downward if we were to chart it  Manufacturing,   chemicals, commercial construction, energy, and transportation services have reported   significant drops in demand  Oil and gas prices have fallen, as I think we are all well aware    The rig count has come down accordingly  Just for clarification purposes, the oil and gas   industry accounts for 10 percent of our employment; nonetheless, it is a significant factor  Our   high-tech industry is under pressure I think anybody who read the newspaper saw Texas   Instruments’ recent numbers  They are reflective of what is going on in that sector  Exports,   which are important, have been particularly hit hard by declining growth in external markets    We are the largest exporting state Our exports have declined—interestingly, because of the   stronger dollar but also because of the weakness overseas that you mentioned, President Bullard    Our largest industry in terms of employment, our medical industry, is suffering in terms of   foreigners who come to be repaired in Houston, Dallas, and elsewhere So our District, like   President Hoenig’s District, has now fallen into recession, and we are like everybody else—for   the most part (we still are Texans)  [Laughter]   I will refrain this time around, Mr Chairman, from referring to Rube Goldberg, Bennie   and the Jets, and Elton John But I do want to recall what I consider to be a prescient insight of   James Madison, who said, “The circulation of confidence is better than the circulation of   money”  When I speak to CEOs around the country, I would say that confidence is not just   waning, it is in a freefall It is leading me to conclude that, obviously, their behavior is becoming   hard-over pro-cyclical, and the consequences are the kind of serious recessionary scenario that   President Yellen pointed out and significantly higher deflationary risks I think that negative   outlook, particularly the outlook for deflation, is the 800-pound gorilla or, my having just come     January 27–28, 2009 132 of 267  back from the Galapagos, the 800-pound blue-footed booby in the room  And I don’t think we   should be shy to talk about it   Businesses are doing what they should be doing—what you and I would do or what any   woman or any man who runs a business would do under the circumstances  They are   aggressively cutting head count One of the CEOs I talked to, who employs one of the largest   workforces in the country, said he had three drawers  In the one drawer he plans to cut 17,000   jobs, unannounced as yet; in a drawer to the right of that, a still higher number; and in a drawer   to the right of that, a still higher number  I asked about the drawers to the left, and he said,   “There are none” Even businesses that are well run and well capitalized are doing, again, what   any businesswoman or businessman would do under the circumstances  If they are in good   shape, which are few, they are using this as a chance to cull out the kind of legacy middle   management they have been waiting to get rid of for some time  Therefore, the bias is to lower   head counts We saw pretty dramatic numbers announced one day or two days ago, and I think   that is intensifying, not lessening They are implementing pay and merit freezes   They are stretching out their payables I don’t know if this is public or not, but GE has   gone around to their major suppliers and asked for forbearance on payables—GE, AAA-rated   credit, whom we are assisting at this time  They are aggressively pursuing their receivables,   particularly the law firms and other service-sector firms  They are running their plant and   equipment at the lowest levels in some time  TI is running its factories at 33½ percent of   capacity The Eastman chemical plant in Tennessee is running at the lowest capacity utilization   in over 100 years You see this, again, across the board  On the rails, there are 100,000 cars that   are unutilized And to go back to my favorite metric of the 70-foot-long lumber-carrying cars,   there are 285 miles of unutilized cars of that nature across the rail industry  Very critically, they     January 27–28, 2009 133 of 267  are cutting back dramatically on cap-ex  Not a single CEO I spoke to, from Disney to the large   manufacturers, is doing anything but  The least amount of cutback that I heard was 12 percent,   and the average, I would say, is up to a third   So, in my view, the Greenbook base case has understated the effect of this dynamic  My   outlook is probably the most pessimistic of all of the Banks  I am line number 8, for those of you   who are guessing We all know, by the way, who line number 18 is, because it says, “New York   says this; New York says that; New York says this”  [Laughter] Mr Chairman, basically my   conclusion is that the instrument panel we are using—and I say this with enormous respect for   the people who do this wonderful work for us—is almost inappropriate to the cockpit of the   airplane that we are flying You mentioned yesterday, Mr Chairman, that we are dealing with   these extraordinary circumstances  I believe that the only way we can proceed is to be as deft as   we possibly can be with the kind of programs that we put forward  As concerned as I am about   their long-term inflationary consequences, my concern right now is that we are underestimating   the potential deflationary consequence to microeconomic behavior and the macroeconomic   numbers that President Yellen mentioned   I would like to conclude with just a comment about the TARP  Every banker I speak to   who has taken money from the TARP regrets it  They are hyper-negative  They feel that they   have been taken, in the words of a borrower of almost $3 billion from the TARP  The rules are   shifting They are worried about government interference  It is conditioning them to take   actions that, again, are pro-cyclical in a perverse way—disincentivizing management and   demoralizing the people who work for those firms  I don’t know what we can do about that, but   I am deeply concerned about this drumbeat now of negativism about the TARP and regret for   having participated Mr Chairman, I will comment on policy later  I thank you for including     January 27–28, 2009 134 of 267  my suggestions in the reworded statements that we have, and I look forward to that debate    Thank you, Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman, I submitted my recommendations in writing  I am pleased   with the way they were included Basically, what I am hearing is that we should take   alternative A and append paragraph 4 of alternative B and most parties would seem to be   satisfied, at least those that are most worried and expressed themselves  I will use President   Yellen as an example, but as others did as well   With regard to that one sentence that is at the end of paragraph 3—“Moreover, the   Committee sees some of risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster   economic growth,” et cetera—I think we offset that by the reference to “help to preserve price   stability” at the very end The reason I wanted that included—and I thank you for its being           January 27–28, 2009 194 of 267  included—is that it speaks from both sides of this  We are not going to tolerate deflation, and we   are aware of the fact that there are concerns that we are setting the stage for an inflationary   backlash So my recommendation is to use those first three paragraphs in alternative A and the   last paragraph in alternative B  I agree with the majority of the sentiment at this table  I would   not have specific numbers  My colleague to my left refers to that as crude  I would say that it   just puts a target on our chest, meaning that it gives the markets something to shoot at  But if we   don’t deliver or somehow we are not interested in finally getting those numbers, we have   basically set ourselves up for disappointing the marketplace   I would also, in the interest of being provocative but at the same time sensible, take   President Bullard’s suggestion with a full heart  I would take that first sentence and change it    “The Federal Open Market Committee will keep its target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to   ¼ percent,” and I would put it as the second sentence in paragraph 4  The fact is that we are   focused on all of the rest So it would read, “The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools   to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability  The   FOMC will keep its target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent  The focus”—and   the operative word is “focus”—“of the Committee’s policies,” et cetera, et cetera, et cetera   So those are my recommendations there  I would like to add one other point, Mr   Chairman, and that is when we talk about waiting to see what happens  I think that is a very   good point We don’t know what is going to come out from the fiscal side  We don’t know what   is going to be proposed in terms of the Treasury  President Stern made what I thought a sensible   reference today not only to the aggregator bank but also perhaps to the need to close down some   operations I hope that we will bear that in mind     January 27–28, 2009 195 of 267  I would like to leave you with just a simple analogy  In the medical field, the greatest   costs are at the very end of life, the last year of life  That is, certain that the sting of death will   strike, we spend most of our medical expenses keeping someone alive, knowing that they are   going to die It seems to me that we are doing that with too many institutions  You made a   comment in our last conference call that you drew the line at the failure of Bank of America  I   think I understand you But I would not draw the line at letting somebody fail, and I think we   need to begin to work our way toward that in order to clear the air and deal with the issues in a   forthright manner That is a separate subject  I have strayed too far   In summary, alternative A, the first three paragraphs, with paragraph 4 from B, and   consider President Bullard’s grammatical change as sensible English  Thank you   Can’t we just say, “The Federal Reserve will be implementing”?   Mr Chairman, the action words are “prepared to purchase”  Are we   going to maintain those in there, or would we change it, keep “evolving,” and put “will consider   purchasing”?   I think it is the “prepared to purchase” that indicates a decision made, and   that is the phrase that bothers me   I just want to thank you, Mr Chairman, for the spirit in which we have   conducted these conversations in this meeting  As you know, at least of some of us felt that we   might be disenfranchised  You may be enfranchising us too much  [Laughter] But we   appreciate it  At least speaking for myself, I want to thank you  "
8677,2009-02-07," Thank you, Mr Chairman, and thank you for the briefing  On the   expansion of the TALF, is there a first-loss guarantee from the Treasury as we had before under   the $200 billion—the $20 billion for the $200 billion?   So it’s a moving thing  In other words, we don’t know whatever first-  loss guarantee we might require?  That’s an open door for us?  Or you do not think it is going to   be necessary?   Mr Chairman, I just have two other questions—these are data point   questions Internally, what kind of leverage do we expect to see realized on that $1 trillion?   That is, how much do we think the financial community will leverage that facility?   One last question, Mr Chairman  You mentioned, after spelling this out a   bit before, that we would provide some bridge-financing for the aggregator bank  What’s the   order of magnitude and what’s the dynamic of that bridge-financing that we contemplate   presently?   Thank you, Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman, I just wanted to underscore the questions that Governor   Duke has asked, because of the cumulative process here under the previous administration  I’m   not attacking that administration, but the way things were announced and delivered by the   Secretary of the Treasury and the whole process made for really a “ready, fire, aim” approach    And I’m very uncomfortable  I understand the pressure that everybody’s under and that   Secretary Geithner is under, but the vagueness here, which you mentioned at the beginning, will        February 7, 2009 31 of 65  in my opinion just feed upon what was almost a spastic methodology (that’s a gross word, but, in   effect, that’s what it was), because we’ve gone through this process before  So, in a sense, the   markets are conditioned to worry whenever something is announced, and I do think we all should   be—you should be, the Board should be, and the FOMC should be—prepared for a harsh   negative reaction The lack of specificity here is what they’ve seen before, and I realize that   that’s, in some people’s minds, politically wise—to see what the reaction is—but we plant the   seeds for a very harsh reaction by being vague  And I just wanted to add my concern to   Governor Duke’s At least we should be prepared for a very harsh reaction  My response to this   is, it’s just one more uncertain step being taken  I know how hard we’re working on this, and I   know how much thought has gone into that So we’re learning at every step  But be prepared   for a negative reaction that could be quite harsh, and at least we ought to have that in our   contingency planning Thank you, Mr Chairman   You’ve covered some of this in your response, Mr Chairman  Obviously,   we need to be aware that a CDS market will build around Federal Reserve bills  There are   perception issues here, and I’m sure that you’ve taken that into account, and the New York Desk   has taken that into account, in at least developing our thoughts on Federal Reserve bills and this   non-monetary paper that we’re going to issue  That market will be discounting us in some way,   shape, or form, and we’ll just have to monitor that as we go through time   I wanted to shift the subject only slightly, because one of the concerns I have, which I   sent a note around about, is with regard to Treasury issuance  From what I’ve heard in this   discussion, it’s not clear what new issuance will take place, because there’s so much lack of   definition But somebody used the number $500 billion before in terms of the aggregator bank   or the public-private partnership, and a portion of that will be Treasury  I’d just ask if we have   an updated sense of how much net new issuance is likely to take place under the $790 billion   stimulus package and with the addition of new Treasury commitments, so that we have a sense   of the impact that’s likely to occur on the yield curve  Do we have a more refined sense of that   presently?  Maybe Bill has an answer   This is net new issuance   We have talked about numbers here—we decided at the last meeting not   to be precise But in our discussions with the Treasury and so on, there’s no implicit or explicit   understanding on their part that we will intervene to a specific degree on the longer end of the   curve in the Treasury market—is that correct or incorrect,?   Thank you, Mr Chairman   May I just take this opportunity to welcome Governor Tarullo on board   and give him an option to leave if he decides to do so  [Laughter]  "
8696,2009-03-17," Mr Chairman, may I ask just one question on exhibit 17?   This is calendar year 2009?   If I can go back to the beginning, or almost the beginning, and ask some   questions about the TALF in terms of lessons learned—I understand that Barclays has put   together a pass-through certificate program that seems to have some acceptance, at least in the   hedge fund community Could you bring us up to date on that and what it means in terms of the   functioning of the TALF?  Does it facilitate it?  Does it make it more complicated?  Did you   expect it?  And is it something that’s going forward?        March 17–18, 2009 22 of 266  But just so I understand this, let’s assume that this proceeds  I perceive it   as having significant momentum in the investment community  The SPVs would be performing   basically a clearing function They create a CUSIP-identified tradable security  The people that   could buy those securities would not have to worry about all the ramifications of the TARP in   terms of the political ramifications that seem to be spooking the hedge fund and other   communities—is that correct?   Would you say that this search for new engineering is a function of the   discomfort of the hedge fund community and the investment community with the TALF, given   the TARP restrictions that are placed on top?  I’m just trying to understand where this came   from   But I can see where this could also certainly be suspicious politically    I’m just trying to understand how this TALF thing is going to unfold, because there seems to be   some momentum in this direction, at least from the standpoint of Simpson Thacher, who are the   lawyers behind it Forget about the dealer relationship to the Fed—it’s between the dealers and   the investment community where there’s still this odd linkage here  It’s becoming increasingly   complicated   One of the reasons I’m raising it is that I think we’ve got to be careful not   to get the cart before the horse here, and in the presentation, I realized, just looking down the   path, we’re talking about legacy assets  We’re going to have to get the first setup correct before   we go further down the path At least I would recommend that to the Committee   Mr Chairman?   I didn’t understand you there for a second  When you say “would not   take much stuff,” are you saying the bad bank would not take some of these assets?   Can I come back to the Treasury’s quid pro quo, particularly the third key   element, the public–private partnership?  You mentioned that there was discussion within the   Board—what are the concerns as the Board views it?   This may be for later discussion  Maybe I’m a little confused  If I go   back to our previous discussion and a comment that I think Mr Nelson made—did you say that   we were looking at this, the legacy assets into the TALF, as a way to take some bad assets off the   balance sheets of banks?   I’m a little confused  Could you clarify that please?   So we would use the public–private hedge fund, as you described it, as a   way to end up with some kind of pricing mechanism for legacy assets that trade on the market   It just seems to me we are going through—this is a comment, and it,   again, may be based on ignorance—a lot of jujitsu here to get around the issue of creating a good   bank–bad bank, taking the toxic assets in the bad bank and clearing it in that way  The TALF is   becoming inordinately complicated  And I guess, if you’ll forgive a horrible pun, I’m worried              March 17–18, 2009 70 of 266  TALF is getting too clever by HALF [Laughter]  We’re adding one segment on top of another,   just as we’re beginning to figure out how this thing is going to work   But you are talking about moving very quickly on this   Mr Chairman, I want to comment on the additional asset purchases,   principally I fully agree with Governor Warsh—in fact, I think he understated the case, and that   is that I don’t think it’s advisable to purchase Treasuries here I’ve sent a note around about that                    March 17–18, 2009 88 of 266  For the record, I just want to repeat some of the arguments in there  To my knowledge, there is   no liquidity problem in the Treasury market  There are no obvious signs of a breakdown in   arbitrage across maturities, unless Trish tells us differently  The spreads between high-grade   private issues and Treasuries do indicate that the markets are not functioning normally—I take   that for granted, and you can see it every day—but that doesn’t mean that lowering long-term   Treasury rates will affect private sector rates  I do worry about the perception—and it’s   palpable—that we will be succumbing to political pressure to monetize the exploding borrowing   needs of the Treasury Trish, you gave us some numbers today—if I add them correctly for the   fiscal year 2009, it’s around $2 trillion  It’s an inordinately large number  I’m preparing for a   trip I am about to make to Asia, and I do think that there’s a lot of sensitivity about this there    (I’m not sure if that is whom you were referring to in your reference, Governor Warsh)  If we   are viewed as the handmaiden of the Treasury here, I believe you might have a negative reaction,   not a positive reaction If the majority decides in favor of increased purchases, I support   respecting President Hoenig’s view  I would prefer that we purchase GSE securities—the   number is somewhat arbitrary, Bill, as you pointed out  I would do it by size, or at least   announce that we could go up to a size The one thing I would caution against is giving a   specific date, unless we are absolutely certain we can meet that date   I want to make a general point here  There is a lack of confidence in the marketplace    There was reference to that before; we see it with everybody we talk to  Confidence is a function   of competence, and I think we should exercise our muscle where we have proven ourselves quite   competent  We have proven ourselves quite competent, for example, in the commercial paper   market, and we are proving ourselves quite competent in the mortgage-backed securities market    There’s a question mark out there on the TALF—we’re not quite sure  And it’s not because the              March 17–18, 2009 89 of 266  staff isn’t making a great effort—we’re just going through this new process, and it has become   enormously complicated  I want to play to our comparative advantage  No question we could   buy Treasuries—I don’t think that’s the issue—but I disagree with that for other reasons  But I   would support an expanded program on mortgage-backed securities, because we are competent   in performing in that area   On the issue of the swap lines, I agree with the comment that this is procedural  I think   we have to be very clear in expressing this I do worry that it may become quite evident to some   that we’re doing this for one particular institution, and I think you could have retribution in terms   of price reaction vis-à-vis that institution and the rumors about others  But as long as we keep   that in mind and express it clearly, then, were I a voter, I would vote to proceed   On the issue of Fed bills and special Treasury issuance, initially I indicated that I would   be against the issuance of Fed bills  I’m somewhat more enlightened now that the maturity that   you described is in terms of one year or less  I have been worried that a CDS market would   develop around the Fed, which would be a negative development, particularly if there was a long   maturity  I still have doubts about the concept  I’m not as clear in my own mind, as President   Hoenig just expressed, as to the alternative, but I do worry about the eventual assumption that we   might grow that program rather than rein it back in  Therefore, if we were to proceed with   issuing Fed bills or an alternative, I would want to have a clear sense of provision  Otherwise, I   think the expectation would be that we would continue to expand the program, and, therefore,   give rise to these doubts about the further purchase of Treasuries  Thank you   Can I ask a question about that, Mr Chairman?   The 10-year rate has sort of altered between 270 and 300 percent  Is that   correct?   And when we talk about buying Treasuries to bring rates down, give me   an order of magnitude  Are we talking about going back to 270?  Are we talking about 250?   Let’s say we did something in size  What would your expectations be, just so we have a   reference point for this discussion?   But we would expect we’d still have a positive-shaped yield curve,   obviously   It would still be fairly steep   If my memory is correct, it does help bankers to have a positive   relationship Thank you   I was first going to say to Dave Stockton that our wives have an affinity   for T-shirts My wife, a smart Wellesley woman who spent most of her time at MIT, arrived at   Oxford noting that the ratio of women to men was 1 to 11  She had a T-shirt for other women   which she sold briskly, and it said, “Come to Oxford where the odds are good, but the goods are   odd” [Laughter]   Mr Chairman, I want to report on the microeconomic input I received from my corporate   contacts, which numbered some 29 CEOs around the country whom I talked to before this   meeting  Unfortunately, it confirms what Dave and Steve presented  In fact, one actually called   me and said, “Do you want some good news?” And I said, “Please”  He said, “Call somebody   else” [Laughter]   As to our District, we have fallen finally into recession  We created jobs last year  I   believe we are the only District that did create jobs last year, or had jobs created in the District    The cut is less severe—it will take fewer stitches to mend—but, nonetheless, we have been cut   As to the national economy, my favorite indicators are all negative  There are 175,000   railcars that are out of commission There has been some improvement in bulk shipping rates,   but that is a head fake according to shippers I have talked to, because of the extraordinary   purchase of iron ore that China undertook recently—in fact, record amounts  If you look at   containers and other shipping indicators, these are all flat to negative  Of the world’s large   aircraft fleet, 20 percent—that’s 2,800 airplanes—are now sitting unused in the desert  If you   look at Boeing’s numbers, it received only four orders for new aircraft versus several hundred   last February And I’m told by my contacts in the airline industry that the Chinese government   has ordered all of their carriers not to take the liberty of buying a single plane in 2009  That   from one of the largest net new buyers of aircraft in the world                 March 17–18, 2009 124 of 266  There is very little cap-ex taking place In fact, every corporate contact I spoke to, from   the large manufacturers to even Disney, is cutting back on cap-ex and displaying all kinds of   microeconomic behavioral patterns that indicate the kind of deflationary trap that my colleague   just spoke about We’ve talked about them before, but the essence is they are withholding   decisions They’re withholding decisions because they hope to get it done cheaper later    They’re also withholding decisions because they are confused  And you see this in some of the   data from those that touch many consumers in the country, as well  For example, according to   AT&T, its large enterprise business has just stopped; its small business demand is in decline; its   800 services are down And, very interestingly, overall minutes are declining significantly  One   of the indications of movement of people is roaming minutes  Roaming minutes domestically   and internationally, according to the CEO of AT&T, have come to a screeching halt   The picture is similar if you talk to people in the travel and entertainment business, which   I do like to look at If you aggregate it properly, not just airline travel, not just hotels, but sports   and entertainment and all that derives from it, it’s a significantly sized industry  According to   Disney’s CEO, travel and entertainment is down 46 percent year-over-year in February  That’s   confirmed by the number of credit card transactions, which are up, but the total amount is down    According to the CEO of JCPenney, whom I’m fortunate to have on my board, this is going to   manifest itself in further contraction, with particular risk in the commercial real estate area  The   chairman of the retail federation estimates that, of 1,100 major malls in the United States, a third   will fail over the course of the next three years  This is not happy news  Part of it has to do with   the lack of debtor-in-possession financing Without DIP financing, you accelerate the process    And I don’t know how we are ever going to deal with that situation        March 17–18, 2009 125 of 266  I couldn’t find any silver linings  There is, I suppose, a pewter lining, as I like to call it    And, Governor Tarullo, without any insult to your industry, one of the virtues is that the legal   industry is also contracting [laughter]; 6,000 people were laid off from major law firms year to   date There’s a website that actually tracks this  What’s interesting about it is that the   transaction business has dried up and is not being compensated for by the bankruptcy business  I   think the reason the bankruptcy business is not proceeding is because debtor-in-possession   financing is very hard to come by and remains a problem   There’s also another pewter lining in the Wal-Mart reports  Gas price declines have   added $120 to $130 per customer per month  The CEO, however, noted some inflation in   apparel prices thus far this year, but they believe that is also a head fake, because they can tell   from their own inventory that eventually those prices will have to come down   So overall, Mr Chairman, the situation is bleak  The key underlying weak factor that I   hear about from CEO after CEO, from microeconomic operator after microeconomic operator,   big or small, is a lack of confidence  When I first walked onto the training floors of Brown   Brothers 37 years ago, Robert Roosa gave me a quote that I haven’t forgotten, which came from   James Madison  “The circulation of confidence is better than the circulation of money”  There   is no confidence   I want to come back to a statement I made yesterday, and I’ll withhold my comments on   policy until the next round  In order to instill confidence, first, it takes time and, second, you   have to exhibit competence  And in order to exhibit competence, I think you have to keep things   simple  I came away from yesterday’s session deeply concerned about our conversation about   the TALF and the complexity with which we’re engaging in policy  And I hope we can figure   out a way to do what we do in the simplest, most communicative manner possible  I’m worried                 March 17–18, 2009 126 of 266  that we are turning to the shadow banking system to solve problems that they put us into in the   first place I’ll just conclude with an analogy as a teaser for what I expect to say in the next   round, and that’s the following We have to be very, very careful that we don’t give a steam   shovel and a case of Red Bull to the people who dug us into the hole we are in and who have   undermined confidence and have put us in a predicament that’s extremely difficult to get out of    Thank you, Mr Chairman   May I just ask, Mr Chairman, a question of Ms Mosser?  Every one of   these statements says that we’ve launched the term asset-backed securities loan facility  Could           March 17–18, 2009 173 of 266  you just give us a quick update of where we stand on that, because the wording here might be   questioned?   So we can’t say it has launched   All right   Thank you, Mr Chairman  First, to state the obvious  We’re at the zero   bound, we’re resorting to extraordinary tools to offset the deflationary and other consequences of   overly tight monetary policy, and we have to deploy that extraordinary tool kit effectively,   deliberately, and with clarity President Lockhart injected a little humor by congratulating you   on your having an interchange named after you and pointing out there is an off-ramp  There is   no off-ramp right now, unfortunately  And President Pianalto pointed to your 60 Minutes   performance, which I also wanted to applaud, except to point out there was one weakness  You   were opposite George Clooney in that time slot  [Laughter]   I mention these things because I’m sympathetic to what President Plosser mentioned, in   that, (a) there is no off-ramp, and (b) we have to think way ahead  I talked two years ago about   decision trees We at least have to think of where this highway is possibly going to take us  The   ad hocery of what we are doing is a bit of a concern to all of us at the table; but let’s   acknowledge the fact that we are in extraordinary circumstances, and we have to play ball   according to what’s on the field                 March 17–18, 2009 184 of 266  I do have a preference, as I stated yesterday, to focus on where we have demonstrated   extraordinarily well our capacity to play, which is in the mortgage-backed securities market  I’m   very sympathetic to President Rosengren’s argument, particularly as to timing   Although I don’t have a vote in this matter in this cycle, I would support alternative B  I   still have concerns about being viewed as monetizing deficits  I think there’s a possibility that   the political class—that is, the legislature—will ask for still more  But it’s not clear to me   whether buying Treasuries might be interpreted as our accommodating fiscal profligacy,   although I understand the circumstances of the moment, which are certainly trying  I think   Governor Tarullo offered a very sophisticated approach to this yesterday, which is to do things in   proportion; and I could live with the alternative that that has the lesser weighting on Treasuries    I do think it is important to exercise our muscle in the mortgage-backed securities market  My   contacts tell me that when you get to the 4½ percent level, you do have some effectiveness, and I   think that’s clearly an area where we want to have extraordinary effectiveness   As to the statement itself, Mr Chairman, I’m not sure why we’re emphasizing the job   losses and all of the things that, as I said in my note, you’re aware of even if you live on Mars  I   do worry about that, given the fact that we are the institution that everybody’s looking to—in   part because we did get out ahead of the rest of the world  We’re viewed as a precious institution   with, I think, superior credibility compared to all of the other institutions of government at   present I’m not sure it’s helpful to keep pounding on the negative  The economy is contracting,   and it continues to contract We needn’t say more  The important thing is that we say what   we’re going to do about it, and we do so with clarity           March 17–18, 2009 185 of 266  Let me add parenthetically that I appreciate your moving the fed funds decision down to   where it should be, which I believe both of us asked for last time—that is, moving it down in   terms of order of priority   I want to conclude with one last statement  My greatest concern is the TALF  I think I   made that obvious  I would caution you to be very careful on this public–private partnership  I   made my living doing extraordinarily complex transactions—taking distressed companies,   restructuring them, and taking the equity out—and I was confused yesterday by what was   described  But I’m more worried about the politics of it  I think we have to be very careful with   our precious franchise in dealing with an embattled opposite, particularly on the Administration   side, so that we don’t jeopardize our special standing in the community by appearing to   accommodate political necessity and exigency  I would urge you, and this Committee, to stay   away from the legacy assets for now  And I would urge you to be very careful about any   commitment to the public–private partnership concept  Thank you, Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman?   We did state it before  Therefore, why don’t we just say “continues to   contract” or “contract severely?”  Again, we’re hammering this point, and I believe we are   beginning to be scary Just for a moment, I want to go back to your 60 Minutes show I think   that was a positive  It was a lift, and we engendered some confidence  Here we are just pulling   the rug out again   What a nice way to celebrate my birthday  [Laughter] With people I   greatly respect, and I just want to say I hope I live to be as old as Don Kohn  [Laughter]  "
8725,2009-04-28," And this is independent of what happens in the Treasury market?   I want to come back to exhibit 14, about which President Rosengren   asked a question Are these the most up-to-date numbers, including the ones that were reported   in the press in the last two days, regarding the budget situation and the likely Treasury issuance?   Then I have a question on the last presentation  I may have missed   something, but you added that we would have a collateral gatekeeper   So this isn’t just for the CMBS market        April 28–29, 2009 18 of 201  Okay I was a little confused Thank you   I would like to go back to President Plosser’s first question, just to   understand the politics here  If we pursue getting approval for Fed bills, which committee do we   go through to do that?   For which there is also a lot on their plate   I mean, look at the Dodd–Shelby committee, for example  Having talked   with Governor Shirakawa about this just two weeks ago—there’s enormous political interference   in his operations, as you know—I share President Plosser’s concern—not that it’s not a good   idea, but again, this is enormously complicated, given the other things that are involved  From a   banker’s standpoint, I’m particularly sensitive given some of the language that’s in there  That,   too, is complicated—that is the point I want to make  I assume that we are aware of that and are   trying to maneuver our way through it   Mr Chairman, my question is on a different part of the credit markets,   and that’s the bond markets—private debt  If I recall correctly in the Bluebook, we have had an     April 28–29, 2009 46 of 201  impact—there has been a response or at least an action—and the spreads have narrowed   somewhat  Issuance is “robust” or such, relatively speaking  My question is, Where do we think   it’s going?  Obviously it’s not going to cap-ex  I presume this is the question  It’s going into   paying down bank debt or replacing short-term debt  Is that correct?  And if that’s correct, do we   have a sense whether this is significant in terms of the impact on the economy?   Short-term debt   Thanks Thank you, Mr Chairman           April 28–29, 2009 47 of 201  Mr Chairman, I want to start out talking about the Texas manufacturing   report As you know, I don’t often talk about my District  [Laughter] Because we do produce a   large share of total manufacturing goods in the United States, I want to point out that the report   we released yesterday indicated pretty much what I am hearing from CEOs around the country               April 28–29, 2009 53 of 201  That is, the indexes for production, capacity utilization, and volume of new orders and shipments   edged upward for the second consecutive month, but our firms are reporting that job cuts exceed   hires by a 10 to 1 margin, and 36 percent of the firms noted a decline in work hours  That said,   the six-month outlook turned positive for the first time since June 2008, reflecting either wishful   thinking or quite probably a sense that firms have battened down the hatches, have a better sense   of their vulnerabilities, and have a better sense of visibility vis-à-vis the budgeting that they have   now ratcheted down, and I think that may account for some of this optimism   So I would not point to a silver lining  It is what I call a pewter lining, slightly better than   it was before That is confirmed by the comments I received from the CEOs to whom I talked   after I got back from China—not very many, but hopefully indicative  But here are the   lukewarm responses that I got in talking to some of them  For example, the head of the National   Retail Federation, who sits on my board and runs JCPenney—I love this one  “I never thought   flat would look so good” was his comment  [Laughter]  “Still negative, but a slightly better   tone” From the CEO of Wal-Mart, seeing a little more discretionary spending, “It’s soft but not   accelerating”  Shifting over to an entirely different sector, the CEO of Disney  “Early signs that   deterioration is starting to slow” And from the CEO of Exxon looking, as I like to do, at the   chemicals, lubricants, asphalt, and other possible leading indicators—or at least indicators in   terms of where the stimulus package may be hitting the road  “There weren’t any places where   things got worse” The only place where I could find that things had gotten worse was in the   rails Shipments are down 19 percent year to date I think that reflects mainly coal and a shift to   natural gas at these cheap prices for electricity consumption  I do note, if you look at the Edison   Electric data through April 18, that weekly electricity output is still declining  So there may be        April 28–29, 2009 54 of 201  some green shoots, but I’d like to say that there are no sparks in terms of that kind of indicator   activity   I am going to focus the remainder of my remarks on the impressions gained from my trip   from April 6 to April 22 to Tokyo, Singapore, Beijing, Shanghai, and Seoul, with a focus on   China First, I would like to preface it by saying that here at home all of the Bank Presidents   have their views, but I’m not sure that’s understood by the public  We always say it, but abroad   nobody understands that distinction As I told you, Mr Chairman, before I left for the trip, I   stuck to the party line, remembering the old definition that a diplomat is someone who is sent   abroad to lie for their country [Laughter] I was just extremely diplomatic, faithfully toed the   line, and just basically listened very carefully  Here is what I heard   With regard to Japan, we have seen their latest projections for the fiscal year that has   started—down 31 percent following an equally awful year last year  In addition to visiting at   length with the Commissioner of the FSA and Governor Shirakawa, as I mentioned earlier, and   the staff, I met with several CEOs I have been going there since ’79  I would say that I had   never seen them this pessimistic, I think largely because 22 percent of the economy is   manufacturing and 40 percent of that is the auto industry in one form or another  And their   demographics are awful  Industrial production is down 30 percent  The last time that   happened—I think I may have mentioned this at the last meeting—was when Godzilla destroyed   Tokyo in a movie in 1954 So there is definitely a mood of extreme pessimism in Japan, and I   found that very discouraging   The situation in Singapore is different It is worse in terms of the short term  The first-  quarter performance is down 19 percent for GDP  Ports are inactive  But Lee Kuan Yew and his   successors are planning for tapping into China And quickly to skip over to Korea—that was the        April 28–29, 2009 55 of 201  one place in which I didn’t feel like a dartboard or receiver of spears in that the timeliness of our   foreign exchange swap really was helpful, and they are most grateful  Their own ship seems to   be floating a little better, and the economy seems to be stabilizing somewhat   I want to focus on China  I met with the requisite what they call “barbarian handlers,”   which includes Yi Gang and the CBRC Commissioner and the China Investment Corporation   people I also met with the nonbarbarian handlers, quite a few who are just purely internal, both   in politics and in business Here is the take-home  They reported 61 percent economic growth   for the first quarter I am always amazed at the alacrity with which they report their numbers    Kind of like Radar on MASH, they seem to know the number before the quarter is over    [Laughter] I did find out, Mr Chairman, where the 8 percent came from  That is that Deng   Xiaoping asked in 1980 what it would take to quadruple the economy by the year 2000, and the   answer was 8 percent compounded That is where the 8 percent comes from  It is reported all   the way up—from the governors on up  But as far as this 61 percent figure, Nathan, if you look   at their import–export activity for the first quarter, exports were down 18 percent, imports were   down 70 percent on an arithmetic measured basis  And their electrical output is continuing to   decline It declined 5 percent in the first quarter—our fourth quarter and through the first   quarter—and there just is no correlation currently, although it has been very high historically,   between GDP growth and electricity consumption and output  But currently their electricity   output is significantly lagging the numbers they are reporting for economic growth   Second, with regard to the People’s Bank of China and the CBRC, they reported that   lending has focused on squeezing out excess capacity  That seems to be their objective, and this   was repeated by several of the business leaders  They also feel that the budgeted amount they   had planned for this calendar year all has been lent out in January and February, with some           April 28–29, 2009 56 of 201  excess floating into the securities markets, particularly the equity market  The concern that we   picked up was, for the third quarter, fourth quarter, and into next year, that basically the thrust of   the fiscal package and the guidance they have given for lending, which is extending beyond the   formal banking system to the trust banks and these new private banks, is basically taking place   currently and might not have the kind of follow-through that they hope to see     The bottom line is that they cannot re-gear their economy very quickly  They are still   dependent on the United States—significantly—and on Europe  That is 42 percent of their   export activity  The bottom line of that is that their reserves will build more slowly  Still, they   have no choice but to focus on US dollars and Treasuries in terms of their investment and a   small amount of mortgage-backed securities  They are seeking a greater role for their currency   through their swap lines and through their trade invoicing in Hong Kong and some of the other   major cities  So it is unremarkable that (a) they have deep concerns about the value of their   Treasury debt and (b) fewer concerns about their agency holdings  I could have told them that   we decided to purchase $5 trillion in mortgage-backed securities  It didn’t seem that it would   have had much impact  But their concerns were constant  In every single meeting, in more than   40 meetings, they did not once fail to mention that they were concerned about our purchasing   Treasuries and that they were skeptical about our ability to pull off a successful withdrawal of   liquidity when the time comes   I want to conclude by reading from the April 20 issue of the China Daily The same   article appeared in the People’s Daily in Chinese The former Vice Premier Zeng Peiyan said,   “The US Federal Reserve’s recent purchase of its Treasury bonds, which effectively prints new   money, is likely to turn the budget deficit into inflation  That will lead to the depreciation of the   US dollar and cause a major loss in China’s foreign exchange reserves  And “the depreciation     April 28–29, 2009 57 of 201  of the dollar has become an inevitable historical trend”  So it is a frisky place, and they are   booming relative to everybody else  But I basically would put that message under a subtitle of   what I call “Malice in Wonderland”  [Laughter] They seem to be eager to underscore this   particular issue in order to protect the value of their investment  But I didn’t, frankly, find   anything different from the kind of concerns I hear expressed here at home and by others who   are invested in Treasuries I would say that basically China’s economy is not performing as well   as it is reported, that they still are dependent on us, and that they confirm, Nathan, what you   mentioned earlier, which is that the global economy may be picking up a bit but it still is in   basically bad shape Thank you, Mr Chairman   But not as much as my District   Part of the cliff nature is that we’ve stated specific end dates, originally   six months and now by autumn, and with regard to the mortgage-backed securities, we stated by   the end of the year I would just like some clarification on the comment you made, Trish, about   understanding the lumpy nature of the mortgage-backed securities market and whether or not the   agencies need more financing  What caught my ear was your comment about Treasuries and that   that is what the community expects  We’re going to even this out since there’s constant issuance              April 28–29, 2009 112 of 201  over the time frame that we articulated  In creating that cliff, we’re committed to that  But was   your comment that they expect us to do more when this is over?   It will continue to grow this over time after we have run the course of   what we previously stated   And to what extent?   And that larger number would be what percentage of the expected   issuance? I don’t have your charts from yesterday   In terms of the larger number that you gave?   Thank you   After the time frame is over or during the time frame, just for   clarification?   Mr Chairman, I’m going to argue for alternative B, with only two minor   editorial suggestions But first I want to turn to the papers and suggestions of Presidents Plosser   and Bullard and append what President Rosengren just said  I do think that Presidents Plosser   and Bullard have identified a real weakness in our current formulation of communication of   monetary policy, but I would respectfully submit that they failed to identify the solution   What the public had before when we operated in simpler times and is now missing seems   to me to be a sense of how we will adjust policy in response to shocks of various kinds  With the   transmission of monetary policy to the real economy disrupted by the disarray in financial   markets, the funds rate up against the zero bound, and our taking policy in new directions, I   sense that the public—whether it’s the public here, in China, or anywhere else that has invested   in our markets—is still confused about what has been driving our decisions and what our next   moves are likely to be, conditional on the evolution of the economy  The sense of confusion   isn’t so bad for our liquidity programs, as was implied by Presidents Plosser and Bullard  It has   often been noted that these are a natural extension of our discount window function, and I think   that’s understandable They are demand driven  They’ll tend to unwind themselves as financial              April 28–29, 2009 138 of 201  conditions improve or normalize  But things get messy with our purchase of mortgage-backed   securities and especially our purchase of longer-term Treasuries  I think that there is still a lack   of clarity in understanding our intent here Now, maybe it’s just that I’m the only one who   doesn’t understand the clarity I may be the only one confused, but I don’t think that’s the case    For example, what should the public expect?  Should the public expect that the purchases of   MBS will continue until the residential construction situation bottoms out, until home prices   bottom out, until foreclosures stop rising, or until one or another of these economic variables   actually turns around and starts moving in the other direction?  Or should the public be told to   expect that the purchases will continue until spreads between mortgage rates and Treasuries rates   normalize?   Vice Chairman Dudley just now raised the issue of how we want the market to respond    Well, with regard to large-scale purchases of longer-term Treasuries, the hope apparently is that   they will put some downward pressure on long-term private rates  That’s the way we’ve stated   what we’ve inferred But how do we judge whether our efforts have been helpful, given that   many other factors affect the rates we hope to influence?  What interest rate spread are we   supposed to be looking at?  In this case, that’s not clear to me  Do we just keep doing more and   more until there’s some unmistakable evidence that a recovery is under way?  Again, I respect   very much what Presidents Plosser and Bullard have put on the table, but it doesn’t say very   much to resolve the questions and the uncertainty that I’ve just raised  It is not clear to me what   difference it will make whether we say our intention is to buy X billion by the end of the year or   to purchase X billion per month or to increase our holdings at Y percent annual interest rate   The lesson of history is that it’s extraordinarily dangerous for a central bank to target any   measure of real activity in setting its policy  So we certainly ought not to say that we’re going to              April 28–29, 2009 139 of 201  pursue action A until home sales rebound, for example  It has also been proven dangerous for   central banks to try to target longer-term interest rates  At least that’s my reading of history  As   Milton Friedman pointed out a long time ago, such attempts can all too easily lead to inflation or   deflationary consequences So that leaves spreads and/or a price and/or a price times a quantity   and nominal values as an intermediate target  For MBS, as noted above, a spread might make   sense, but what about longer-term Treasuries?  It’s not clear to me  And the Reifschneider–   Roberts memo makes abundantly clear how little we understand the links between Fed purchases   of longer-term Treasuries and inflation  We still need a good deal of clarity in our ability to state   our exit strategy, and I know we’re going to be talking about that later   For the time being, given the questions I have, despite the good efforts of the Presidents   from Philadelphia and St Louis, I would strongly argue for alternative B  I think it would   confuse the markets if we took the course outlined in alternative A  One thing that was pretty   clear around the table yesterday, I counted eight people who mentioned the fact that, every time   we go out to speak, people are worried about the long-term inflationary consequences of what   we’re doing with our balance sheet—again, whether it’s in Beijing or someplace in Minnesota,   because I remember Gary mentioned it as well  If we were at the point to expand our purchase   of Treasuries, I think it would confirm suspicions that we’re just hell-bent on monetizing   government deficits  That is not our intention, but I think it would confirm those who have such   suspicions  Second, I don’t think it’s necessary  We’re only partially way through the program   that we’re trying to execute and we’ve agreed to execute now through autumn, previously over a   period of six months  So we’ve changed that wording slightly  I think it would be a mistake,   Mr Chairman, despite sensitivity to President Yellen’s arguments, to argue for alternative A     April 28–29, 2009 140 of 201  With regard to two minor editorial suggestions, first, Brian, I appreciate the changes that   were made  But just to be accurate and given what we’ve been hearing, I would add “and   staffing” to the end of the sentence that begins, “Weak sales prospects”  “Weak sales prospects   and difficulties in obtaining credit have led businesses to cut back on inventories, fixed   investment, and staffing”  Indeed, that is what they’ve been doing  Then with regard to   President Plosser’s concern—and I think the concern of all of us—about anchoring inflation   expectations and anchoring inflation, we could accomplish that by appending to the end of the   very last sentence of that first paragraph, because we’re talking about our policy actions, “will   contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth without sacrificing the   Committee’s long-term commitment to price stability”  (A) That’s true (B) It would provide   comfort to those who wonder if we are sacrificing our long-term commitment to price stability    The operative words in that sentence are that we continue to anticipate that our policy actions   will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth  I would add “without   sacrificing our longstanding commitment to price stability”  That would address the concerns   that I heard from many, many people, and I think, President Plosser, that would address your   concern as well Thank you, Mr Chairman   I think that is an improvement, but I still think—and I regret not   mentioning this myself—that Governor Warsh makes a key point  Given what Trish told us in   terms of expectations, even though I don’t like being driven because, as it was pointed out   earlier, the markets and the dealers are never satisfied  But even with softening language like   that, it is new, and you are opening up the door  I don’t think you should put it in here   I agree with your point because it does talk about fiscal and monetary   stimulus  I appreciate the fact that we at least make some reference to price stability, and I think   that is the important point   I am concerned about the releasing of names and Don’s point, that you   can’t renege on assumptions and promises made earlier  Tactically, I don’t know what you’re   planning to say next week, but I would rather be viewed as being forced to do this rather than   suggesting it terms of releasing names prospectively going forward because one of the great   concerns is—we’ve seen this with the TALF and with the PPIP and everything else—the rules   keep changing I don’t want to be viewed as one of the agents of changing the rules in a way that   upsets people who have banked on us to be a steady institution  I would just suggest that we be   very careful about that and think that through  Now, the Congress has its prerogatives  I’m not   sure we want to feed that one I would rather almost be in a responsive mode   I am a little worried that, if we don’t respond sufficiently, they could be extremely harsh,   and maybe—Don, you summarized an awful lot there  We were talking about feeding the   monsters of the market earlier  Feeding the monsters of the Congress is also saying that you can   never really satisfy them  I’m not calling them monsters for the record, but they have a   voracious appetite I would be really careful on this business of suggesting that we release   names  If we’re viewed as the one who suggested it, it might upset the people whom we serve   and who are important to our ability to function  So I’d just ask you to consider that   The other obvious trap—and I saw this on the visiting committee overseeing Harvard’s   investment debacle—whenever you talk about what you’re spending on something in the private   sector, it’s always going to be too much  So just get ready for that one because you can’t satisfy   people very easily on that It is always too big a dollar amount  But that’s obvious  "
8746,2009-06-03," Trish, I also want to add my appreciation for the good reports you have   been giving, particularly from someone who likes to eat the stuff up, as you know that I do  I   wanted to ask you—going back to Don’s question—we were talking about $2½ trillion for the   fiscal year, which gives another trillion or so to run in terms of net new debt issuance  You   mentioned that the Street estimates are going up  What are they talking about?   How far are we now into the Treasury purchase program of $300 billion?   Then, my last question is with regard to the TALF  You said the magic   words “exit strategy” when you were giving your monologue  A general question In your   opinion, has the TALF been effective or marginal in alleviating some of these market pressures?   Or has this just happened in conjunction with a general improvement in the marketplace?   Thank you And thanks again for your reports  "
8763,2009-06-23," Mr Chairman, thank you  I’d like to start with Brian First, in your   presentation, you did not mention—or maybe I missed it—that the pace of corporate bond   issuance picked up The spreads have come down—that was well covered—but tell us a little bit   about the tone and the pace of the market  Second, have rates themselves come down along with   the narrowing of spreads?   Trish, our stated objective was to lower private credit rates and to increase   credit availability, and further in your presentation you mentioned two specifics on that  One   was obviously mortgages and the other was corporate credits  So we might conclude that we   have been successful on the corporate credit front  Is that a fair assessment, or is it too early to   tell?  When you talk about lowering rates in your presentation, Trish, I’m a little confused  Our   objective as I understood it was never to seek to lower rates on Treasuries deliberately  It was to   have an effect on the private credit markets  Do I understand that correctly?   Mr Chairman, I don’t know if you want to stick to that subject with other   questions, or may I go ahead and ask the other?   If I could quickly ask Jim and Spence—on the demand side, am I missing   something here?  Wouldn’t the simplest solution be to seek an increase in reserve requirements?    What’s the drawback?  The paper outlines the pros, but it wasn’t clear to me what the cons are           June 23–24, 2009 29 of 261  So the answer is no Thank you  And then a question for Brian Madigan   When we talk about an increase in the primary credit spread—and I realize you’re not   recommending that currently—have you considered the effect it would have on smaller and   regional banks?  At least through our discount window, we see some increased activity there, and   we’re just a small part of the System  So I wonder if we’ve taken that into account in that   recommendation   I’m just wondering if we’ve thought about the politics of this, now when   they’re a little bit sensitive about a new consumer protection agency and so on   At the same time, we would be maintaining the TAF, but increasing the   rate so that there would more of a penalty associated with it  Did I understand that correctly?           June 23–24, 2009 31 of 261  And who are the most active users of the TAF?   That would be one of my concerns—the optics of having a facility, which   we, at least, have seen used by foreign branches, and maintaining it even though you might   make it a little bit more difficult, while at the same time phasing out something that helps smaller   and regional banks I just wonder if there isn’t a conflict there   If I may just ask one more question, Mr Chairman, of Brian, which is on   the FX swaps In your judgment, to what degree have the comparable ECB facilities and the   IMF lending program substituted for or buttressed or deterred the effectiveness of our program?    In other words, we see less demand currently  Is it because of those two facilities?  Maybe your   colleague to your right might have a view   Thank you, Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman, you’re going to hear some similarity to what you just   heard from Governor Warsh and President Plosser  I agree with most of the statements that were   made  I feel particularly strongly about the issue of the Treasuries  As Governor Warsh   mentioned, I’m beyond particularly uncomfortable, I am especially uncomfortable  I think   there’s no evidence that it has a positive impact  We can tell ourselves and we can tell the   marketplace that, indeed, the corporate debt market has improved  I’m rather pleased with that;   obviously, we all are I’m not sure there’s direct causality, but I do think the risk-return tradeoff   is way too negative Even if we figure out a cute way to say it, there still is a suspicion that   we’re monetizing deficits, although we’ve been much firmer in our public statements on that    And I realize that in chart 4 that’s just a somewhat important factor, but it is a factor, and I worry   about that        June 23–24, 2009 78 of 261  I want to come back to Brian’s recommendations  I think we have to be very careful that   we’re not perceived as basically providing facilities to prop up institutions that are too big to fail   at the expense of other institutions that desire to grow  In my earlier remarks, I used the wrong   term  I said “political,” and I meant “optical”—I think the optics are rather poor  If TAF is   being used, as was pointed out in the staff paper, principally or significantly by two institutions   that are too big to fail, I think we have to be careful about that  President Plosser made a   suggestion that we might limit it even more severely in terms of the amounts; I think he was   suggesting a pricing impact there  Obviously, classical central banking is to lend at a penalty   rate But that penalty rate is a gift compared to what we would be charging smaller and regional   banks Therefore, I would ask you to go through the list and think of which of these facilities are   really in place to prop up institutions that are too big to fail  And I would be curious as to which   of those facilities you consider as actually having an impact there and as helpful on that front and   which are not  But I reiterate my concerns about the optics of TAF and the primary credit   recommendations     On the issue of exiting, obviously the market is asking for it  Everybody’s asking for it   I do think the Monetary Policy Report, Mr Chairman, is the appropriate vehicle, and, perhaps,   your Humphrey-Hawkins testimony   Like President Plosser, I personally am uncomfortable with Fed bills  I don’t think it is   politically feasible The staff points that out I worry about the market that would be made in   those and the derivatives that would be written from them  I have spoken to that before, but I   don’t think that is a particularly wise recommendation to make              June 23–24, 2009 79 of 261  I will make one last recommendation, only half in jest, which is that we get rid of the   TALF program and we call that the Bill Nelson Relief Act  [Laughter] Thank you, Mr   Chairman   I was just reacting to the three points that were raised   I just have some questions of Nathan  You mentioned the Baltic Dry   Index in the context of Chinese iron ore imports  Chinese iron ore imports are far exceeding   steel production, as you know So my question is  How sustainable, in your opinion, is this   recovery?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I recently accompanied my wife to a board   meeting of the American Film Institute, of which she is a director, in President Yellen’s District   in Hollywood, and to prepare for that trip I read Evelyn Waugh’s wonderful novel The Loved   One An Anglo-American Tragedy The plot line is about a minor British poet who goes to write        June 23–24, 2009 141 of 261  the greatest movie of all time about the life of Percy Shelley and settles for employment at a pet   cemetery called The Happy Hunting Ground  There’s a precious scene in that novel where the   tough head of the film studio is surrounded by people around a table and in the back benches    The people around the table are described as “yes men” and those on the back benches as   “nodders” I find myself nodding and saying yes—[laughter]—to everything that has been said   by my predecessors at this table  There is a unanimity of view, it seems to me, that, as President   Yellen just pointed out, the economy is bottoming out, but it is a gradual and fragile recovery,   and it will take a long time to regain employment  I forecast an almost checkmark-shaped   recovery, which is a long recovery, as President Rosengren stated, with the unemployment rate   masking some of the problems we have with our workforce, and I do not foresee a very quick   recovery   What concerns me is that the people that I talk to, the CEO list that I give you, and even   the people we talked to in that part of the country, which is not known for being plugged into   reality, also have a unanimous view I want to touch on two aspects that were mentioned by my   predecessors here The first is with regard to President Rosengren’s point that unemployment   may be masking deeper problems  Even in your District, President Rosengren, I noticed that   Harvard Law School just sent out a letter recommending that their graduating class seek   employment in other fields—perhaps at pet cemeteries; I’m not quite sure  [Laughter] If you   look at Skadden, Arps or Cravath, Swaine, & Moore, people that I talk to, they have deferred an   entire class in terms of their hiring  So here’s the point  I think we also need to be cognizant of   the fact that the service sector is going to have a very slow recovery in the process  This was   underscored by the CEO of AT&T, who said, “If it isn’t life or death, we’re not hiring anybody               June 23–24, 2009 142 of 261  or investing in anything” And I think that’s pretty much a unanimous view around the table of   CEOs that I spoke to   Second, President Lockhart mentioned cap-ex Cap-ex is being postponed When you   have excess slack, you’re going to have less commitment to cap-ex  But here’s the point I want   to mention  Among the CEOs that I speak to, and even people that you would never expect to be   critical—I’ll drop a name, because it was absolutely shocking, Warren Beatty, for example—   there’s a unanimous worry that, “The plethora of programs coming out of Washington is creating   enormous uncertainty”  Uncertainty is the enemy of decisionmaking, the enemy of capitalism   We’ve talked about this before It’s not that changes are being proposed  It’s that no one knows   when they will stop, and I find that this has heightened uncertainty in the business sector and is   retarding cap-ex And that won’t change until there is resolution about the enormous changes   that have been proposed by the Congress, by the Administration, and so on  It’s not that the   business community and others are against the proposals, it’s that there are so many coming so   quickly that it’s creating enormous uncertainty  Thank you, Mr Chairman   Also Heaven Can Wait [Laughter]   Mr Chairman, I’m in favor of alternative B  I appreciate some of the   restructuring that was made from the previous draft  I agree with President Yellen that we ought   to change the wording in that last bracketed sentence, because I’m in favor of including that   sentence, and here’s why I think the market is asking us to at least clarify that we have thought   about an exit strategy With all due respect to Brian, whose work I admire enormously—both   Brians, by the way—I think we might actually get a negative market reaction unless we clarify,   at least in the very general terms in which this has been described  “The Committee will   continue to take careful account of the necessity of ensuring that policy accommodation,” as   Janet said, “is (or will be) ultimately withdrawn smoothly and at the appropriate time”  It           June 23–24, 2009 191 of 261  doesn’t say too much  I think it tees up your congressional testimony I agree in this sense with   President Evans and President Stern; I certainly am not opposed to including it, and, in fact, I   think we should include it If we did, and I would urge us to consider it, then I don’t think we   need to say “continues to anticipate”  That’s a little bit too conditional  Mr Vice Chairman, I   get your point—we are “continuing to,” but the fact is we do anticipate  Plus, we use the word   “continue” twice in one paragraph  So I would urge you to consider, Mr Chairman, including   that last sentence It is a truism  It is, indeed, a fact that we are taking account of the necessity   of ensuring that policy accommodation is or will be ultimately withdrawn smoothly and at an   appropriate time  I don’t see what it costs us, and I do think there is a general explicit and   implicit expectation that we do so   One other comment  I haven’t thought this through tremendously, but I don’t necessarily   disagree with President Rosengren’s suggestion, because I think the Desk ought to have some   leeway with regard to the mortgage-backed securities  As everybody in this room knows, I   thought the Treasury purchase program was a mistake  It was a very expensive mistake  I don’t   think it has helped I think has actually set us back a little bit, and obviously I wouldn’t be in   favor of extending it any further  But now that we’re there, we might continue the program until   it’s done But I think the Desk might have some discretion, and we might so instruct the Desk—   not in this statement—but they might work their way around the yield curve a bit for mortgage-  backed securities and into certain types of mortgage-backed securities  Thank you, Mr   Chairman  "
8791,2009-08-11," I have a question and then a point to make  The question is with regard to   the size of the population of ARMs that are available  You mentioned in your paper that we   would eliminate interest-only ARMs  Is it roughly $200 billion that are eligible here in terms of   the total population?  Is that correct?   No, of not interest-only ARMs  We would not pursue interest-only   ARMs   The point is actually based on the question because, if you look at the   Greenbook, Part 2, page III-12, there is a chart of delinquencies on prime mortgages, and the   delinquency rate on variable-rate mortgages is four times that of fixed  So here is the question   Do we want to be seen expanding our balance sheet and our asset purchases for poorly   performing mortgages such as these or encourage households to take out this kind of mortgage   now that they have a 12 percent past-due rate, or is there a chicken-and-egg issue here?  I’m   curious as to what your opinion is because that is one of the cons you did not mention—that is,        August 11–12, 2009 13 of 165  that ARMs have a much higher delinquency rate  Do we want to be perceived as assisting that   weak market, or will our assistance lead to an improved market?  What’s your opinion?   Just so I understand—again, out of, say, a population of $200 billion,   what percentage of that is GSE and what is non-GSE?  Do we know?   We’re talking only about GSE-sponsored ARMs   At least half are not interest only   Thank you   Thank you I think that is a very important point  Thank you for   addressing it   Thank you, Mr Chairman  Just to clarify your statement in terms of the   Board’s decision suspending consideration of additional asset classes, I want to follow up on a            August 11–12, 2009 46 of 165  point you just made, Bill  We are talking only in terms of high-grade CMBS, is that correct?    We are not going to extend that category to lower-grade CMBS?   Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would like to ask a question of Nathan  At   our last meeting and in previous meetings in talking about China, the issue was whether or not   they might be able to convert their economy to be more domestic demand driven  Clearly, the   stimulus package, in addition to leaking into the securities markets and all of the corruption that   has ensued, has affected infrastructure, and that is where I think you see some of this boom   coming in the rest of Asia  For what it is worth, my Chinese contacts and the ones in Singapore   suggest that there still is a long-term dependency on US and European demand, to the point that   they assert that this boom or boomlet might go on for another two years or so  But unless we        August 11–12, 2009 58 of 165  pick up demand and unless Europe picks up demand, it is unlikely to continue  I wonder if that   is an assessment that you might share   Thank you   Mr Chairman, if I may, before I make my comment, I do want to thank   Gary for his service I have a friend who turned 107 and who died the other day  When he   turned 100, [laughter]—he ran Kidder Peabody in 1931—being a great stock picker, he said it   would split two for one Gary, even if you split two for one, you would still have the shortest   interventions of anybody at this table and probably the pithiest  You will be seriously missed   I would like to start out by talking a little about what we see in the data, and then I would   like to provide a summary of what I gleaned from my corporate contacts  Then given the     August 11–12, 2009 63 of 165  taxonomy that Mr Wessel has imposed on this table, I am going to conclude with a comment   about balls   First, on the data in terms of our District, we are seeing significantly better signs about   stabilization Our initial claims for unemployment insurance are declining  Our housing   industry, which wasn’t suffering as much as others, has experienced an uplift  Our single-family   permits were up 13 percent year over year in June; existing home sales were up 3½ percent  And   other than President Pianalto’s District, we had the best Case–Shiller performance, I think from a   slightly higher base, in the recent numbers that were reported  As the leading exporting state, we   are taking some succor in the data that are coming out  Our exporting activity is getting less bad,   but it is still not positive  And from our own calculation of leading indicators at the Dallas Fed,   we have seen three months of increase after nine months of decrease  So from the narrow   perspective of our District, we are encouraged to see some stabilization     I think the national picture has been well covered by the presentations that were made,   with one exception We don’t quite share your relative pessimism about the bounceback in   economic growth  We can expect, over the next few quarters perhaps, a little more aggressive   activity  It is really when we deemphasize the negatives and accentuate the positives, as I like to   say, and get a boost from inventory investment and government purchase  Nonetheless, both of   those will be assuredly temporary  It is what happens after that that we are concerned about  So   I would say from the standpoint of my District and from what we are seeing in the data   nationally, if you will forgive a bad joke, it is a slightly brighter shade of beige—not   tremendously exciting but nonetheless improved from what we saw before   In terms of CEO contacts—and the Chairman has my list—just to comment, Brian, on   your presentation, particularly your slide number 2 with regard to corporate earnings  By my     August 11–12, 2009 64 of 165  calculations, so far 443 of the S&P 500 have reported  Of the 419 nonfinancials that reported,   revenues—I am not talking about earnings but revenues—are down 191 percent versus   46 percent for the 24 financials that have reported  This is the third double-digit quarterly   decline in sales, and the previous quarter was the second back to back that we have seen since   1965 It seems to me, if I were to summarize the one theme I am hearing from my CEO   contacts, that it would be that there is too much of everything relative to demand for the   foreseeable future There are too many ships at sea  And speaking of the Chinese, as you know   they are becoming a building power  I talked about this many, many months, if not a couple of   years ago, at this table They expect, according to some shippers I talked to, to deliver up to   40 percent of the existing global fleet in 2010, 2011, and 2012   There are too many railroad cars  There are 507 miles, Mr Chairman, of unused   mothballed railroad cars now in the United States, 5,280 feet in a mile, and each car is 90 feet   long I will let you do the math  But the point is we are not going to build a railroad car in this   country for years There are too many airplanes; there are too many homes; there are too many   hotels, too many office buildings, and too many retail stores and malls  There are   145,000 convenience stores in this country, and the operators of those companies all expect to   rationalize significantly   There is too much oil And to give you a number that comes from Rex Tillerson, the   CEO of Exxon, there are 120 million barrels of floating inventory  That is the highest he can   recall in his experience There are 3 trillion square feet of natural gas on the ground  We have   not before, to anybody’s knowledge that I have been able to find out, had this high an inventory   count this early in the year And the resource wells and these narrow wells—that is, like the   Barnett Shale—have to be counted as reserves as well              August 11–12, 2009 65 of 165  There is too much corn There is even too much polyester  [Laughter]  As Governor   Tarullo points out—and he and I watch the same television shows; we were raised on “Saturday   Night Live”—there has always been too much polyester  But the Chinese are now bidding down   their prices 5 to 6 percent for the fashion year that starts at the end of this year   So capacity is vast Cap-ex will remain subdued  As to head count—and the point that   President Evans was making earlier about employment—many, many business people I talk with   report that they have cut to the bone But they also report that, not surprisingly, their workforce   is much more productive than it was before, perhaps driven by fear of losing their jobs and   benefits They realize that, at least for the immediate term, these business operators can drive   their businesses with fewer workers than they had assumed  So most remain in a defensive   crouch Most are focused on cost containment  They are driving their margins, but they are   struggling to grow their top line   I would just conclude with my earlier reference to balls  We seem to have to stay on the   balls of our feet because—I am sure you are relieved about that reference—[laughter] as I   believe you said earlier, Larry, the risks, like the children of Lake Wobegon, are all above   average here  We are eliminating the negative  We are accentuating the positive of inventory   replacement, a slight pickup here and there  But it is pretty clear to me, if you will again forgive   a terrible pun, that business operators in this country are suffering from post-traumatic slack   syndrome  They see it in the abundance of supply They see it in labor Their plans to step up   to the plate in terms of cap-ex and head count are, it appears to me, constantly being postponed,   and therein lies the difficult issue of how we are going to deal with unemployment  So that is my   report, Mr Chairman  Thank you   I am thinking about what President Plosser just said  I haven’t changed   my hawkish feathers, but I don’t want to be anybody’s pigeon  I think we have to be cognizant   of what is actually happening in the microeconomic sector  Yesterday I spoke of post-traumatic   slack syndrome, and I want to expand slightly upon that to explain why I am in favor of   alternative B On the run-up side, which was only a year ago, what business women and men did     August 11–12, 2009 125 of 165  was to tighten the cost of goods sold They were ferociously driven by the fact that everything   under their control was accelerating in price Now that they cannot grow their top lines, they are   continuing that process  I will give you an example  If you look at the spending pulse data that   is compiled by MasterCard—and this is not yet public to my knowledge, because it goes until the   end of July—and you look at the airline industry, the spending pulse data will tell you that   revenues for airlines were up 16 percent year over year in July  Airfares were down 14 percent   What accounts for the difference?  A 48 percent increase in transactions  They are nickel and   diming everybody on baggage, what you pay for food, et cetera, et cetera, and that is how they   have made up the shortfall  You can see this also roll over into the way small business suppliers   are being treated In my conversations with the CEO of AT&T, he told me that he listens in to   their small business call center  Fifty percent of the current calls are women and men in small   businesses begging to have their phone bills reduced by at least half  Bad debts are rising, and   they have other pressures operating upon them   My point is this We are likely to have significant slack for some time  We are unlikely   to see cap-ex grow, as I mentioned earlier, for some time  And, yes, Mr Chairman, we have to   be careful not to make assumptions that are somehow different from those in previous   recoveries But I think that, on a microeconomic level, the shock that business women and men   have gone through does condition their response and is likely to lead to an additional lag in   cap-ex and give pause to hiring new workers for a longer period than we would like, particularly   in the globalized environment in which we live and which in previous recessions didn’t exist to   the extent we have today  So we know that in the short term, for several quarters at least, slack   does have an effect on price movements and inflation  Long term, we know from Milton   Friedman and others that sustained inflation is always a monetary phenomenon        August 11–12, 2009 126 of 165  Therefore, I think it is important that we recognize reality  We are likely to have a   snapback here It may be somewhat frisky in the short term, assisted by inventory corrections, as   you mentioned, and more-felicitous market conditions, such as have been described at the table    The longer-term outlook is still somewhat tenuous, so we have to take account of that  We also   have to take account of the still-palpable concern that we may or may not be willing to pull the   trigger Mind you, I come from a state where even the former Vice President of the United   States did not hesitate to pull the trigger    I think all of us have made an effort—in addition to the tools laid out—to make it clear   that we are not going to be hesitant  Therefore, I think it is very important that we signal clearly   that we are not going to buy Treasuries beyond the number that we mentioned  I was against it   in the beginning I am still against it  I am happy to see it die  I think it shows that we have   resolve That, combined with the statement that, if I understood correctly, you will issue on   Thursday at the Board, that we will—and I am quoting you, Mr Chairman—“suspend   consideration of additional asset classes” while we extend the timeline to March 31  To me that   is sufficient to indicate that, indeed, we have the resolve to do what we are going to do  At the   same time, it doesn’t cut off the salutary effects of what I think we are doing to offset the forces   that I just described   So I would favor alternative B  I do not favor alternative B′ or B (revised) To me, those   are like St Augustine’s prayer, “O Lord, help me to be pure, but not yet”  I think we should   proceed to show our resolve  Alternative B does it, and it also reflects the reality of the current   economic circumstances  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8818,2009-09-22," Well, if you want to continue on the mortgage-backed securities, mine is   on another subject, so perhaps President Lacker would like to go     Mr Chairman, this is sort of a statement disguised as a question, but I   would still like to get your reaction, Brian It has nothing to do with mortgage-backed securities,   which I realize is the focus of a lot of this meeting  It goes back to your first graph on equity     September 22–23, 2009 17 of 212  prices We have had—going back to 1923, 1924—15 recessions before the current one    According to the data, if my memory serves correctly, from the trough of the equity market as   measured by the S&P 500 or its equivalent, to when we emerge from recession, the average rally   has been about 22 percent  Looking at chart 1, if you assume that we exited the recession in   July, roughly, we have had the most significant equity market rally in history; this even   outperforms 1929 to 1933   I am continually troubled by the issue of top-line versus margin enhancement and   bottom-line growth  I ask this question because I think it is very important  We make almost a   linear assumption in our baseline case of pretty positive equity market numbers going forward,   after having had what is, historically speaking, the greatest stock market rally coming out of a   recession in history That is around 48 percent  Now, from your standpoint as a market   operator, or as someone who is more attuned to the markets than certainly I am, and I think the   rest of us are, can you continue this process without top-line growth?  I’m just curious as to what   your concerns are, if you have them, because, again, the baseline growth model that we have   factors in some pretty healthy equity market numbers going forward  So I’m just curious from a   Desk standpoint what your feelings are about this  And I realize this is guesswork—but still   First, Mr Chairman, I agree with President Plosser’s question about TAF versus   the penalty rate on the discount window, but we talked about that a long, long time ago  I think it’s a   good point to take into account   My question is for Bill  We had four institutions in this little sample  They account for 35   percent of the excess reserves  How many institutions would you have to take into account, say, to get to   75 percent of excess reserves or 50 percent?  In other words, are they concentrated in the top ten?  Five?   Twenty?  Guess?   I guess what concerns me is that these monies are languishing in the system    They’re unlent and they’re unmultiplied  And, again, here we have differentiation in the market  We   have been worried about when—just to use an ugly analogy—this giant fur ball finally gets released from   this big pipe  We’re worried about a way to neutralize it  But meanwhile it’s lying fallow in a sense,   from the standpoint of people that want to borrow, assuming there’s loan demand  If you go through each   one of your boxes, we don’t know how much buffer people want over regulatory norms— no increase in   lending  Mr Lacker pointed out no change in lending terms and standards  I guess, again, like President   Plosser, I may be a dunce on this one  I’m not saying you’re a dunce, Charles  [Laughter]    I’ll share the dunce cap with you  I’m concerned that this money is unlent and   unmultiplied and represses velocity  I realize that the suspenders that President Dudley talked about go to   what we’re trying to treat, but that’s not an issue presently  I just worry about the distortions it creates in   the system, and I wondered if you had any comments on that, or maybe I just need a basic tutorial from   you also    It concerns me that we’ve ramped up reserve balances to $12 trillion, money that   we’re almost incentivizing not to go out into the marketplace and paying a rate of interest, right?  It’s   small but it does concern me that it’s not being put into the system  We have an unlent, unmultiplied   buildup in reserves Now, we worry that it could expand too quickly and come back in the system and   that’s all of these treatments that you went through in your second presentation was all about  But in the   meantime, it’s like they’re sitting in the system lying fallow  Am I missing something here?    As I said, this is what happens in quantitative easing   Anyway, your chart number 1 shows a very rapid rundown  I’m just questioning,   I guess, that rapid rundown, given the unwillingness of people to lend and the incentives we’re providing   for reserve retention  But if it’s a dumb question, let’s take it off the table, Mr Chairman   I guess what I’ve gotten out of this conversation is a better understanding of why   safe, short- and intermediate-term securities have been priced as they’ve been priced and are yielding   what they’re yielding, but I remain concerned that these monies remain unlent and unmultiplied in the   short term   Mr Chairman, if I can, I just want to compliment the presenters  Over   the last five years the quality of these presentations gets better and better  I particularly want to   tip my hat—no offense Dave—to Nathan, because the understanding of these global   interlinkages—without taking anything away from your predecessors—is far more erudite than it   was before I much appreciate it   My question is about productivity I would expect that globalization would have an   impact on enhancing the productivity of our own economy here at home, and I deduce from   listening to my corporate interlocutors that, indeed, they have been driving to achieve greater   productivity as they have worked their way through this recession  I infer from the numbers I get   from my staff that, indeed, productivity has held up rather well throughout this recession and, in   fact, perhaps better than it has in previous US recessions  So my question is  How does this   affect your outlook for the pace of recovery and for inflation, if my assumption is correct?     September 22–23, 2009 71 of 212  Thank you   Mr Chairman, in the Eleventh District, retail sales remain anemic    Weakness in energy due to lower natural gas prices continues to be a drag on the Texas, New   Mexico, and Louisiana economies, and commercial real estate remains mired in significant   distress  But there are some positive numbers that have been reported  Private-sector jobs grew   in July, and then pulled back a little bit in August  Initial unemployment claims continued to   decline There are signs of improvement in the temporary staffing market  Reflecting the   activity that Nathan reported, exports—and Texas is the largest exporting state—rose in July for   the second consecutive month; they’re up slightly in Q2  Existing home sales are up through   July There’s actually a slight pickup in home construction as new home inventory levels   stabilize And we have a leading index that was up on all components, making positive   contributions at the last measurement           September 22–23, 2009 86 of 212  Now, realizing that it may not be the case that “as goes Texas, so goes the galaxy” or “so   goes the globe,” still, there are some glimpses of sunlight that come through from our anecdotal   soundings and from the CEOs that I have talked to—the list of which I provide you before every   meeting, Mr Chairman  Distillate consumption, which is strongly correlated with industrial   activity, has picked up at least slightly  And I note that electricity generation is also up slightly,   which is a positive  On the consumer side, Mastercard’s internal data were positive in terms of   sales activity for the week of September 7, for the first time since October 30, 2008  The   broadcasters report that advertising is creeping back up  In part, this is Ed Whitacre’s ego   There’s also political advertising on health care, but, more generally, it’s getting away from the   trial lawyers and the lesser advertisers that we have seen and moving toward more general,   normal, economic activity  The semiconductors report a pickup in demand, which I find quite   interesting According to Texas Instruments, for example, in the first quarter customers actually   reduced their original orders by 7 percent  In the second quarter, they shipped 31 percent over   their original order base, which indicates a rush to cover either inventory shortfalls or perhaps   demand—they’re not sure which  And, as of last night, their shipments in the third quarter are   exceeding the original orders by 29 percent  And, lastly, an odd positive to the recession, is that   Wal-Mart reports that pilferage or internal theft is down 20 percent for fear of people losing their   jobs   Despite those positive indicators and the aggregate data which we have heard presented   by others and at this table, I would summarize the mood of my interlocutors as being wary of the   purported recovery They see some improvement in the statistics that they read about elsewhere,   but, based on their own experience, they doubt them  Some cotton to our outlook at the Dallas   Fed, which is for a checkmark-shaped recovery, with less growth, as President Lockhart pointed        September 22–23, 2009 87 of 212  out, in 2010 and 2011 than the staff are forecasting here at the Board  But I heard from more   than I hoped that they’re managing for what I would call a W-shaped recovery  And if they’re   wrong, they’ll be relieved More than once I heard what I consider a new management bias   described as being based on “process improvement” or “cost take-out” or “margin repair”  This   is the kind of nomenclature that now is ubiquitous amongst McKinsey and Bain consultants, who   up until last summer were flogging techniques to enhance top-line improvement through pricing   power   Our own measure at the Dallas Fed of global capacity utilization shows record lows  It   indicates that for some time incremental demand will be met by utilizing a greater share of   existing capital rather than investing in new equipment or buildings  And I can’t find a single   sector where a leading CEO is budgeting to do anything other than to contain costs and only   commit to vital and minimal cap ex in 2010   So, Mr Chairman, that’s how it looks from a microeconomic perch  It’s undoubtedly   imperfect, but I think it’s illustrative  There’s a disconnect between the way that the women and   men who are managing the businesses of the United States view the economy and the aggregate   data And I don’t know how we will join that disconnect, but it’s clearly there  Thank you, Mr   Chairman   The slope of the right side, from my perspective     It’s a Nike swoosh [Laughter]  This actually goes to the point that   President Plosser made, and I’m going to take advantage of your question  Of course Thank        September 22–23, 2009 88 of 212  you for asking We are eliminating a lot of negatives, as President Plosser said  We’re   beginning to accentuate some positives  We do have a snapback  We had a very sharp decline    The question is the rate of growth going forward  And given the way businesses are managing   and structuring their budgets going forward, the way they are wringing productivity—I think   those are your words, Dave —out of their workers, I expect that final demand will be somewhat   anemic  So it’s not a sharp V And going further out, after you come through the check on the   checkmark, I expect a slower rate of growth   I have been informed it’s something that I fear  Actually, Mr Chairman,   I think this is a problem  Our tail risks are almost undefinable  We could have that  We could   also have the kind of explosive growth that Dave was talking about earlier  And I would like to   hear, as you know, more decision tree analysis as to how we would respond from a policy   perspective under all three scenarios  Thank you, Mr Chairman   That’s a more eloquent way of stating what I was referring to earlier—or,   at least, if not stating it, understanding internally how we would respond under different   circumstances     September 22–23, 2009 92 of 212  I’ve gone drinking with Janet  She’s no Yeltsin  [Laughter]   Mr Chairman, I submitted comments on September 16  Many of them   were incorporated in the statement  I don’t want to repeat myself  I assume, Brian, they are   somewhere in the record   Someone at the end of the table mentioned Hamlet and the Prince earlier, and it brought   to mind the debate over the B-2 bomber, which was B-2 or not B-2, that is the question                 September 22–23, 2009 162 of 212  [Laughter] It seems to me that what this discussion is all about is “up to” or not “up to,” that is   the question By my count, we have had four in favor of keeping “up to” and four in favor of   striking or deleting “up to”  I’m in favor of keeping “up to,” because I think it gives us   maximum flexibility  I’m in favor of incorporating the phrase “these purchases,” and I would   favor President Yellen’s “executed by the end of the first quarter”  I would strike the word   “wide,” because a range is a range  I don’t think “wide” adds much  It does probably raise some   questions of what other ideas we might have up our sleeves, and it might raise questions that we   are not able to answer  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8844,2009-11-03," Brian, there has been an enormous amount of chatter and some articles   written about the carry trade, and I wonder from a Desk perspective, being more market-  oriented, and less from a theoretical standpoint, if you could give us your views on the arguments   put forward by Roubini and others  Is this a problem, or is it a non-issue?   Thank you    On the TALF, as we go through more auctions, more subscriptions, is there   any incidence of refinancing previous TALF loans?  And if so, how much and what does it tell us?                                November 3–4, 2009 29 of 201   Do you think it is significant?  Can we find out?    It may just be that rates are increasingly attractive  I don’t know, but I   would be curious as to how much recycling is taking place    No, that’s true in the aggregate  So I’m just asking the question    That’s true in the aggregate    Right      Thanks    Thank you   Well, on the subject of Mexico, I think it is a difficult subject when you   include Canada in the equation Clearly, Canada is a higher-grade economy and would have a   higher investment grade  But, again, we think of them all as North America  I have no problem   with the four If we think through this NAFA issue, there are delicate politics when you deal   with Mexico because you are also dealing with Canada simultaneously  So I would just ask you   to bear that in mind  I think Vice Chair Dudley’s proposal may be a way to slice that, but the   answer may be to leave it untouched, the $3 billion and the $2 billion  Right now we have $3   billion to Mexico and $2 billion to Canada  And I would just point that out   Like Tom Hoenig, I would like to have time to think about the other questions  But I just   wanted to point that out  It is a very delicate issue, not because I am a Texan but just because of   the nature of the agreement that we forged with these two countries as trading partners  So   maybe the answer there is to leave it alone  But you can’t treat one without offending the other   Mr Chairman, at our last meeting I portrayed our economic outlook from   the Dallas perspective for the nation  It resembled a checkmark, as you may remember, with a   snapback in the third and fourth quarters, in the 3-plus percent range, before settling into a lower-  shaped grade on the elongated side of the checkmark  And you asked, I presume at the time only   partially tongue in cheek, whether I was talking about that or a square root sign  So I have given   that a great deal of thought in the interim  [Laughter] And I have explored with my colleagues   and our business contacts the dynamics surrounding 2010, and that is what I want to talk about   this afternoon   Now, the near-term outlook seems to have improved measurably because of the   stabilization of inventory investment and a leveling-out of consumer demand; the effects of the   fiscal initiative, like “cash-for-clunkers” and the tax initiatives surrounding housing; and the   strengthening of demand for US exports  Certainly, the securities markets are healthier  The   cost of money for those who have access to the securities markets—large businesses, not small   businesses—has declined; levels have declined to very palatable levels   Despite these short-term improvements, we are, in my view, very far from being out of   the woods I am going to reflect some of the comments that have been made by others, starting   with President Lockhart  Wage and salary increases have fallen sharply  Household finances are   still under severe strain  The deteriorating performance of consumer and CRE loans are still   exerting new pressures on the financial system  And the plethora of new economic and   regulatory initiatives is creating uncertainty among business decision makers as referred to by   President Lockhart—uncertainty that appears to be retarding commitments to expansions of the   workforce and to a commitment to cap-ex in the United States  I think that the Greenbook   baseline forecast underestimates the continuing drag on the economy from damage to the     November 3–4, 2009 77 of 201  financial sector, deterioration and weakness in household cashflows, and uncertainty created by   the new government initiatives  It also assumes, in my view, a too-rapid response of the   unemployment rate through a reduction in the output gap when these reductions finally do begin   to take hold My survey of CEOs confirms some of this drag   I do think it is important to footnote our research and that of the St Louis Fed in   publications from a couple of years ago that look at the last nine recessions and recoveries since   1954 They show that there is a strong correlation between the lengthy expansion before the   recession and the degree of what we in Dallas call “jobfulness” of the ensuing recovery  That is,   there is a lot of talk about a jobless recovery  That is really not the issue  The issue is how many   jobs are generated by an ensuing recovery Inefficiencies in the use of labor and other factors   accumulate with time  The longer the time since the last recession, the greater the wave of   reorganizations that follow Reorganizations lead to a shedding of jobs within firms for an   extended period of time during the correction or the recovery, and thus they create and contribute   to the degree of jobfulness of that recovery   This is confirmed by the behavioral patterns that I am hearing from my corporate   contacts These contacts continue to be pessimistic about the prospects for top-line growth for   2010, though they generally feel that revenues have bottomed out  They still plan to operate in a   cost-containment mode  They report little—actually no—enthusiasm for expanding payrolls and   cap-ex This is very evident if you look at the large what I call logistics companies—Fluor;   Bechtel; Kellogg, Brown & Root; and others—are actually beginning to let people go  Fluor’s   CEO said that “domestic cap-ex is dead”—a pretty harsh statement  The most negative in terms   of cap-ex was AT&T It reports that it cut cap-ex 15 percent in 2009  I mention it because,        November 3–4, 2009 78 of 201  arguably, it is the largest single committer of cap-ex; roughly $18 billion a year was budgeted for   2010 At the same time, it is budgeting a head-count cut of 12,000 employees in 2010   The most positive I talked to, such as Texas Instruments, are budgeting some   opportunistic cap-ex increases but plan no expansion of payrolls for the first half of the year, as   they feel they can “continue to drive productivity higher”  The theme of squeezing greater   productivity out of existing workers, which Dave Stockton referred to in our last meeting, and   out of existing assets remains a constant across all of my CEO contacts  For example, Wal-Mart   is planning on adding 11 million square feet of storage space in 2010  Yet because of IT and   other efficiency boosters, it will not increase its associated head count above 14 million  It has   an enormous employee base  That 14 million is actually down slightly in 2009 from 2008   Regarding retail, the container ships that carry goods across the seas are operating below   cost and continue to lose money  The rails that take those goods from the ports to their   distribution points report stability but no discernible pickup in end demand  And my favorite   metric, 178,000 freight cars, which would stretch 2,900 miles if laid end to end, and 28,000   locomotives have been laid up  Even though Buffett announced this morning that he was   acquiring Burlington Northern, the CEO of Burlington Northern reports that, in the same words,   “Christmas is dead”  These are not happy people that I talked to   The retailers themselves report continued trends of smaller unit sales at   lower prices and a shift to private labels and economy brands over a greater number of   transactions, with volumes falling off as the month progresses  This is confirmed by   MasterCard’s data, which show year-over-year growth of transactions but lower average tickets    Pricing power is nil  Again, going to Wal-Mart, it reports that food price deflation in its average        November 3–4, 2009 79 of 201  market basket is 08 percent year over year through this week and has had a third consecutive   month of slight deflation in general merchandise  Inventories remain lean  They are being   managed surgically  There is scant desire to build them overall  Stocking is being regeared to   just-in-time response in demand for specific items  And I take note, with regard to retailers, my   Bible, Women’s Wear Daily, is reporting that retailers have started laying off workers in the   month of October  That is very unusual for the fall season   There are no complaints from the big boys about accessing the credit markets  Indeed,   they report far more robust and better priced credit markets  AmeriCredit, which is a company I   have started talking to, is interesting because it finances purchases of used automobiles and has   900,000 customers  It reports that, thanks to the TALF facility and the improved tone in the   ABS market, its borrowing costs, for example, have been cut in half  So that is good news But   one reactionary theme has emerged as expected—at least as I would expect from the global   operators The combination of projected continued dollar weakness and low interest rates earned   on excess cash held in dollars is incenting their treasurers to keep their cash balances abroad    That phenomenon should wax and wane over time   Of less topical concern, and more disturbing to me, is the belief expressed by several that   risk adjustments had better prospects for returns by investing cap-ex elsewhere  If you have read   the Wall Street Journal recently—and we will have to check on the accuracy—it estimates that   the S&P 500 companies are carrying $1 trillion in cash on their balance sheets  The last time we   had that kind of carry on the balance sheets was the 1960s  As I say, this is not your mother’s   1960s We live in a globalized world, and there are options for investing abroad  I am finding a   good many CEOs and CFOs who are planning to commit to cap-ex and deploy that $1 trillion in   build-up in cash, plus additional cashflows, but very few—in fact, none out of the somewhat 30           November 3–4, 2009 80 of 201  that I spoke to—are planning to commit it here in the United States, unless there is greater clarity   about future policy initiatives The grape-shot approach that the Administration and the   Congress have followed—announcing so many policy initiatives—is adding to uncertainty   regarding progressive budgeting and planning for 2010  I might note that those who have spent   some time actually interacting with Mr Summers and others at the White House have come back   more concerned than placated, and this concern persists  The bottom line is that there is a lot of   hand-wringing and a great deal of hesitancy by my corporate contacts  I would say that the   mood is a little less sour, but still a little dour, and, Mr Chairman, these anecdotal soundings do   nothing to change my checkmark-shaped forecast   I continue to expect that, after this and the third quarter’s 3 percent plus growth rates, we   will settle in 2010 to a slower crawl, say to 2½ percent with unemployment hanging in at about   97 percent, which is I guess at the low end of our central tendency, as was presented earlier, and   only in 2011, will growth ramp up to near and above 4 percent, with unemployment lingering   above 8 percent well into 2012  Now, that said, these are still positive numbers, and they beg the   question of whether we should begin de-accommodating earlier rather than later  That we will   talk about tomorrow Thank you, Mr Chairman     Brian accented “this”   Are you talking about the dollar?   Oh, the unknown fourth thing    Mr Chairman, with a Norwegian mother and Australian father, I’m   genetically disposed toward alternative C, given that those are the two central banks—the only thing   that they had in common—that recently raised their rates  But I won’t argue for it  I don’t think it’s   timely, and I favor alternative B  I did note in the statement issued yesterday by the Reserve Bank   of Australia the following  It said that “it is prudent to lessen gradually the degree of monetary   stimulus that was put in place when the outlook appeared to be much weaker”  One of the things I   worry about is that we are finding our statements in constant iterations from a period when we   feared depression 20, deflation 20  What I’m hearing at the table, and looking at the estimates of   economic growth going forward, is that depression 20 is no longer a risk But I still hear—perhaps                     November 3–4, 2009 155 of 201  selectively because I fear it myself and through the retailers that I speak to—that there still is a risk   of deflation  I don’t think we’re out of the woods on that front   So I’m encouraged by at least the latter part of Brian’s presentation  The alternatives have   been laid out  On that front I would simply say that I would personally be in favor of asset sales   first, and I hope we can flesh that out somewhat  On the other options that have been presented and   the way they are being phrased, I would like to consult my team back at home and then perhaps   send in a memo, Brian, with some suggestions   I am concerned about the dollar  Mr Chairman, you raised this as one of the possible   dislocations resulting from low interest rates  Other people who intervened, Governor Tarullo and   others, have mentioned the dollar  In thinking this through and how we phrase alternative B, I put   on my old hat as a foreign exchange adviser, which I did for four years at Brown Brothers advising   corporations in the late 1970s and early 1980s, certainly different times, as to how treasurers should   position themselves and how speculators should position themselves Were I doing that today, I   would be advising, say, a large Russian trader like Vitol, which is the largest speculative oil   trader—bigger in terms of financial positions in the world than Shell or BP—on a dollar play based   on the language you have in this statement because it’s not simply the level but also the   predictability and duration  So as an adviser, were I reading that language—that we’re going to   keep rates exceptionally low for an extended period—to me it would be great kindling wood for the   carry trade  I do believe that that’s a risk and a problem right now  It may be less of a risk for us   per se, but if I know that I can borrow dollars cheaply and have this likely for an extended period,   I’m going to jam as much into the A dollar, as much into the Brazilian real, and as much into these   little currencies and move those markets as I can  I do believe it has something to do with the price   of oil I think in a great deal of the pricing of oil currently, given the excess inventory that’s on the                              November 3–4, 2009 156 of 201  seas and given the excess inventory of gas and other alternatives to oil, the dollar is clearly a   significant factor   Therefore, my one suggestion—which I don’t think will carry the table, but I’m going to put   it out there anyway—is that, if we do change the term “extended period,” to change it for “some   time”  I think that would throw enough uncertainty into those who are pursuing the carry trade and,   very importantly, to those corporate treasurers who are not repatriating capital because they find the   ability to earn a return here is less than what they can earn somewhere else, and it might mitigate the   risk of the kind of dollar crisis that we all fear  But that’s the only suggestion I have, Mr Chairman,   from a practicable standpoint  Other than that, I would embrace alternative B  Thank you   Mr Chairman, I simply wanted to point that out  It is not clear to me, if   we were to have a run on the dollar in an intermeeting period, what we would do  Would we   raise interest rates? What would we do?  So all I am saying is that we might consider this  I am   not going to argue for it I don’t think it is going to carry, but I just wanted to be sensitive to it    About the only thing we can do is the way we express ourselves, to say or to have the Secretary   of the Treasury say—as every Secretary, not just Tim, has said forever—“I believe in a strong   dollar policy” That doesn’t sound anymore in the marketplace  It has been said so many times   by so many people it just doesn’t ring  So I wonder what we would do under these   circumstances, and the only point I wanted to make is, if we are worried about this, if we are at a   tipping point or when we get to that, that maybe a little language change might help because it   takes away the permanence  It shortens and builds a lexicon for the period, but I don’t want to   make too big a deal out of it  I am concerned about it  "
8871,2009-12-15," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Just a quick question on slide No 29  What   do you guess that slide would have looked like before we began testing reverse repos as an exit   strategy?   Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman  As pointed out by First Officer Murdoch and   his shipmate, Nathan Sheets, [laughter] we have seen some rather startling economic data   recently—a less negative unemployment report, just to take President Rosengren’s interpretation,   and some indications of improved consumer dynamics and a much improved international   economic growth scene  Financial markets, I think, are robust  Key spreads have continued to   narrow We’ve had some major announcements regarding TARP repayments and some   significant nonfinancial transactions involving firms mainly in my District, for example,   Buffett’s acquisition of Burlington Northern and Exxon’s deal with TXO announced yesterday    These developments are encouraging  They indicate to me the recovery is under way        December 15–16, 2009 58 of 247  But I’m still in a “trust but verify” mode, mainly based on the anecdotal evidence that   I’m picking up, which is mixed, from my contacts  I’m beginning to detect a faint demand-pull   heartbeat among bulk shippers—air freight operators like UPS and Federal Express and the rails    Long-distance telephone usage is up slightly year over year  That’s always an interesting sign, in   this case driven by call center activity And yet the retailers report sequential slippage month   over month and year over year for December thus far, with Wal-Mart and Penney’s especially   concerned about the bottom three income quartiles for Christmas and for the first half of the   year   Pricing power, as I think Dennis just referred to, eludes producers in most sectors    Retailers who look back at their Black Friday activity and activity since then report ultra-price­  sensitive consumption, although I would note that the two large express shippers have announced   increases in prices coming on January 4  The announced number is 4 percent—if you look at the   way that’s practiced, it will probably be a net rate of 2 percent  And there are reports that Wal-  Mart and other large merchants are using a little bit of pricing power in order to protect their   margins   One worrisome development that I have heard about is in retail supply  Chinese   suppliers to retailers are attempting to renegotiate the price concessions for soft goods for 2010    Most of the merchants report that they have rebuffed them, but they do not believe they can   continue to hold off doing so into the second half of 2010 and 2011, as Chinese manufacturers’   margins are being squeezed by increasing labor costs, raw material costs, and inflation  And the   expectations are for a reversal in sign from a minus 3 to 4 percent for soft goods to plus 3 to 5   percent as we proceed through the second half of 2010, assuming that consumption holds up        December 15–16, 2009 59 of 247  On the balance sheet front, I could detect no change in this go-round with my   interlocutors  The capital markets are pretty much wide open to the big boys who are still   hoarding cash Most, with the exception of energy companies, such as Exxon, which are focused   on longer-term natural gas—a play that they consider defensive—are sitting on large cash   reserves Few are expecting to expand their cap-ex domestically until both the political and   economic skies are clear   As to the small guys, they continue to complain about the paucity of bank credit  As to   budgeting head count and other operating overhead for 2010, the new ubiquitous buzzwords are   “ZOG” and “NOG” The bias is towards ZOG, which is zero overhead growth, or NOG, which   is negative overhead growth  This will not likely change until they see the whites of the eyes of   top-line growth in their revenues It remains elusive  Those who do see it are pursuing what is   known in the parlance of consulting as the HOG approach, which is budgeting their overhead to   half the overhead growth they would otherwise commit to, because of gnawing uncertainty and a   newfound ability to drive higher productivity  That’s the big business crowd     The little guys, the small businesses, remain in a very defensive crouch  Small   businesses’ inventory investment plans are at historically low levels  Their capital spending is   on hold Actual outlays and planned outlays are at record low levels  More small firms,   according to what I can glean, still plan on reducing employment than plan on adding to their   payrolls And as you have pointed out, Mr Chairman, this is vexing, because we all know that,   during recoveries, small firms typically account for a large share of employment gains  We’ve   done some research on this at the Dallas Fed  In each of the 1983-1984, 1993, and 2003   expansions, the vast majority of employment gains were generated by firms with fewer than   500 employees  What we don’t know is the degree to which cap-ex expansion of the larger firms        December 15–16, 2009 60 of 247  drives that growth in employment in smaller firms  For example, El Paso Natural Gas has just   announced financing for a pipeline It will add 5,000 employees to its own payroll, but in   building that pipeline, of course, you feed into the small businesses that provide the supplies to   those employees and the construction of that pipeline  To the extent that smaller firms are more   reliant on bank finance, it’s obvious that their recuperative powers are being affected by tight   bank credit   As to the larger firms that have come to access financial markets rather readily and are   less constrained by bank financing, they still appear, according to my interlocutors, reluctant to   expand overhead and especially agnostic as to the need yet to expand domestic payrolls   I will just add to what several presidents have already mentioned by using a specific   reference A CEO just came back from touring the world  This is a company that supplies ten   million small businesses with a vital component on the IT side, and his response after the trip   was, “Every country I went to—India, China, The Czech Republic, Brazil, Vietnam—said,   ‘What can we do for you?  How can we help you?  We’ll give you low taxes  We’ll give you a   building We’ll give you land’  I come back here and it’s, ‘You can’t do this, you can’t do that,   you can’t do this, you can’t do that’” That attitude, Mr Chairman, is definitely having a   depressive effect It has nothing to do with monetary policy, but it is holding back the desire to   expand payroll and cap-ex and adding to the ZOG and to the NOG   As to the price pressure front, headline CPI rates have been increasing steadily these past   few months  The 12-month headline rate will soon turn positive, maybe with tomorrow’s report    The Empire State data released today or yesterday indicate some building price pressure on what   comes in the door, despite the weakness that was in that report  Both core CPI and core PCE   posted annualized one-month rates above 2 percent in October, and the 12-month rates have           December 15–16, 2009 61 of 247  ticked up to a little over 17 percent  The direction of change from negative to positive might   ordinarily ruffle a hawk’s feathers, but for now I remain unalarmed  In part this is because of   what accounts for the increase  excise taxes on tobacco sales and a number of small items that   are a bit obscure to me, other than the prices of new motor vehicles, such as the price index for   consumption expenditures for nonprofit institutions, and two other dodgy financial service   components, the price index for financial services provided by pension funds and the price index   for financial service charges, fees, and commissions  More encouraging to me is the fact that   both the median CPI and the trimmed mean PCE show continued deceleration  The fraction of   components in the PCE registering price declines remains elevated and sustained  According to   our calculation, over the past 12 months the fraction of falling price components has averaged 40   percent compared with an average 32 percent from 1994 to September of 2008   Having said all of that, my outlook for economic growth has not changed  I am not as   pessimistic as the New York Fed appears to report—a number, by the way, which I note is   strikingly close to what Goldman Sachs is forecasting  [Laughter]  Nor is it as robust and   optimistic as what the Board staff is projecting  And given all that I’m seeing now, I stick to my   previous forecast I’m somewhere in between the two, and having said that, I don’t think it is too   early to begin to think of how we will deleverage our balance sheet and pull back the monetary   accommodation we have provided  Thank you, Mr Chairman   That’s ex post, past tense   Well, Mr Chairman, on page 156 of the 177 pages of the last transcript, I   said, “My one suggestion, which I don’t think will carry the table, is that we change the term   ‘extended period’ to ‘for some time’”  Mr Chairman, my one suggestion, which I don’t think   will carry the table, is that if we do change the term “extended period,” we change it to “for some   time”  I’m going to be a broken record on that, but I know it will not carry the table   Here’s the point  I’m against expanding the balance sheet  I take the comments just   made by my predecessor commentator quite seriously  But I do believe that the language in   alternative B is acceptable even without changing “for an extended period”        December 15–16, 2009 113 of 247  I would note President Rosengren’s excellent point that we consider the treatment of the   spread on primary credit and its juxtaposition against the “extended period” language  I actually   was caught quite flat-footed by that discussion yesterday—unprepared for it  I’d like some time   to think about commenting on it  I’d like to see where it is sequenced into our exit strategy  I   understand the theoretical desire to re-widen that spread  I do worry about the signal it’s going   to send, by the way, to small and community bankers  I don’t quite understand the full   composition of who accesses primary credit, and I could see some interpreting it as  “You’re   still biased towards the big guys who are more active in the fed funds market and penalizing   smaller borrowers who may want to access the primary credit window”  So I’d like more time,   and I’m a little bit concerned that we’re rushing that discussion, particularly in the context of   these broader things we have been talking about  So I would ask very much that we not rush this   into the first week of January   To sum up  against expansion of the balance sheet, remain concerned about the phrase   “extended period,” because I think we’ve boxed ourselves in there—we didn’t get much for it,   but it’s there   The third paragraph is very good We did what we said we were going to do when it was   necessary to do it, and we’re done  We aim to complete these liquidity facilities and, indeed, we   signaled that we’re on that road for asset purchases unless, as President Yellen points out, it   becomes necessary, which I think we cover in the very last sentence, to modify our plans in order   to preserve financial stability and economic growth   I have one other editorial suggestion in the first paragraph whether we use alternative B   or C We talk about the housing sector  We talk about household spending  We talk about   business still cutting back on fixed investment  And yet, in your excellent summary of what we        December 15–16, 2009 114 of 247  said, we have one point that is not included in there, which is the reluctance of businesses to   expand overhead, including payrolls My editorial suggestion would be at the end of the   sentence that begins with “businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment, though at a   slower pace; they continue to make progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment   with sales, but remain reluctant to expand overhead, including payrolls”  I would insert that in   either B or C It is nowhere else referenced in this statement, and I think it’s a very important   point   Yes, sir With the sentence that reads, “Businesses are still cutting back   on fixed investment, though at a slower pace; they continue to make progress in bringing   inventory stocks into better alignment with sales”  I would add, “but remain reluctant to expand   overhead, including payrolls” This is what we heard at the table  You summarized it   eloquently It is not in the statement, and I think it should be  Thank you, Mr Chairman   “But remain reluctant to expand overhead,” comma, “including payrolls”   Well, payrolls are a big part of overhead  So that would be—but I think   we need to include that point   Don, you had the best words, I think   Excuse me, Mr Chairman, I think Janet’s point was that we not consider   the last sentence boilerplate, that we are serious about it, and that we will adjust if needed    Wasn’t that your point?   No, no, [laughter] To be accurate, I would amend the last sentence to   say, “The Federal Reserve is prepared—honest to God, really, and we mean it”—[laughter]—“to   modify these plans” I would not be in favor of taking that penultimate sentence out, Mr   Chairman   That’s why I used the word “overhead” originally, but I think it’s too fine   a point  "
8900,2010-01-26,"  Brian, I want to go back to your chart 4 on exhibit 1  I just have a   question  If I understand it correctly, one of the great things that has happened is that people   have used the high-yield market and the rally we have had in the high-yield market to rebalance   their balance sheets  If my numbers are correct, above 70 percent of the issuance in 2009 was   used for that purpose and to push out maturities beyond that wall of maturity in 2012 that we   were kind of worried about  But if my soundings are correct, toward the end of the year we   began to see some old behaviors reassert themselves—payments in kind, self-payment of   dividends, covenant-light issuance  So this is just a judgmental question  Are we reaching a   point at which some of this old, abusive behavior is beginning to reassert itself?  I am just   curious as to what you are detecting, and is my observation correct?    Thank you    Mr Chairman, I have three quick questions just for clarity  Jim, you   talked about floors, and Spence, you talked about, on your pages 8 and 9, the degree of   confidence to use the IOER rate to control short-term rates  My question is, given that the GSEs   are major suppliers of overnight funds and they don’t qualify for IOER under the current law, as   I understand it, doesn’t this make the floor somewhat permeable?  And doesn’t it reduce our   control as long as those conditions exist?  If so, what do we do about it?  That’s the first   question    You also on your pages 8 and 9 have the risks at some period in which the   funds rate could well be below the IOER rate  Doesn’t the IOER rate—I’m having trouble   saying that—have to be at or below other market rates by statute as well?    And then one more statute question, Mr Chairman  Jim, you correctly   mentioned that by statute it would be the Board that would set the IOER rate  I’m curious—and   this is a question probably for the Chairman of the Board—in terms of this Committee setting   monetary policy, how do you square those two if the IOER rate were to be our principal   monetary policy tool?    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support the normalization of the discount   rate  One additional point I would make is that I would like time to present that to my board and   the other boards  I also support the recommendation of the staff on the TAF  We have an   unusual, idiosyncratic, situation in Dallas, where we have a bank that is properly collateralized,   in every single way adhering to proper conduct, except we believe he is gaming the TAF system    I am eager to get those both closed as quickly as possible if only for that reason, but also because   I think it is the right policy to pursue  I would suggest that you signal to the markets in your   testimony of February 10 as well as in your semiannual monetary policy testimony  I would   support, by the way, just to add to President Plosser’s point, which is not on the table,   eliminating Freddie’s and Fannie’s access to the discount window  I’m in favor of a corridor   January 26–27, 2010 70 of 260    system, constrained on the downside by the IOER rate and on the upside by the primary credit   rate   With regard to the size of our balance sheet and draining reserves, the presentation made   by Spence Hilton earlier, when he listed the risks of aggressive asset sales, had exactly the kind   of questions many of the people at this table raised when we got into this problem  But we   entered this issue and justified it because of the emergency response to having a zero-bound   constraint  I don’t believe that we should be in the business of financing housing  I think that is   a matter for the Treasury and for other authorities, and I would like to get out of that business as   quickly as possible  I realize that we must be careful in the way we do that  But in general, I   would like to see us get back as soon as possible to the status where the private sector, and not   the Federal Reserve, becomes the backbone for these markets  So as to how we do so and how   quickly we do so, I will point out that President Kocherlakota not only wrote a good memo but   he has been lobbying extremely hard by handing out gifts, such as this Minnesota Vikings hat,   particularly to half Norwegians  [Laughter]  Despite that, I would say, as Governor Kohn has   pointed out, when we decide to tighten, then it would be appropriate to begin asset sales in order   to remove us from something that we did for emergency purposes but that we did not have   business being in in the first place   I would be in favor of redemptions in the intermediate period, but once we begin to   tighten, I believe we should be selling those assets  I believe we should be invested principally   in short-term Treasuries, although, again, things have changed over the last 30 years, and there   might be other instruments of that shorter-term nature—commercial paper; I’m not sure what—  that we might wish to be invested in  But I would be biased toward short-term Treasuries and   January 26–27, 2010 71 of 260    getting out of mortgage-backed securities and GSE debt as quickly as possible and as quickly as   markets allow  Thank you, Mr Chairman    800?    Hey, I am not a problem    I want to ask three quick questions, if I may, on the economic   presentation  With regard to E&S and cap-ex, which I think is an important variable we are all   looking at, when we talk about the survey of capital spending plans and the data that you   January 26–27, 2010 109 of 260    reported, are you distinguishing between plans domestically or plans overall?  For those who are   planning to spend, how much of this is domestic, and how much of it is global?    Thank you  The second question is on food prices, which we rarely   discuss  We always talk about oil prices  If you look at the key food oils as well as at corn,   wheat, and some of the other key grains, we have had a complete retracement over the year  If   you talk to the retailers, they are complaining about food-price deflation, and I wonder if you   have any comments on the food component looking at it from the standpoint of inflationary   pressures    And my last question, Nathan, has to do with your points on Chinese   economic growth as well as on the exhibit you had on fixed asset investment  I just want to   check a data point  If you talk to the bulk shippers, they will tell you that last year, if you look at   the slippage in terms of imports on all but two countries, you had an implosion of roughly   300 million metric tons of imports  Two hundred seventy million was made up by imports going   into China and the remainder into India  Question  Even with a slight reduction in what you   expect for Chinese economic growth, against the background that this occurred, if you look at   the chart on fixed asset investment in China, there is a decline over 2009  I am just wondering   about whatever pickup we have in the rest of the world, and we expect some pickup to take   place—I think the presentation captures the overall demand picture fairly accurately—could one   expect then to see continued upward price pressure on dry shipments and, if so, to what degree?    Thank you  Thank you all for an excellent presentation  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Unlike President Lockhart, I am less   uncertain than I was at the last meeting  I have upgraded the intensity of the economic growth   that we foresee, but I find that I am sort of in consensus with the numbers that you have   accumulated, Brian  That ought to make you all feel very uncomfortable  [Laughter]  It   certainly makes me feel uncomfortable   With regard to my District, we are seeing the production barometers for our District   signaling significant increases in factory activity for the past three months  The index of new   orders and shipments posted very large improvements  Our staff noted them as dramatic   improvements in the numbers we just released on Monday  And capacity utilization has   increased  The business activity and company outlook indexes for our District reached the   highest level since mid-2007, and we surmised from the sliver of what is either 8 or 10 percent of   the nation’s manufacturers that a recovery in activity and in our region’s manufacturing   production is definitely under way  Residential construction has stabilized  The rig count has   trended upward, as you may know  What’s interesting is that our largest employment sector is   health care, and it grew last year in terms of employment at the fastest rate in over a decade and   continues to surge forward   January 26–27, 2010 126 of 260    Employment in our District rose in October and November  It then pared back a little in   December  All eight components of our regional leading indicators have moved upward and are   signaling improvement actually since September, and we’re forecasting at least 18 percent   employment growth for our District for the year 2010  I expect that to be revised upward  We   also note from our regional surveys that, while there are reports of upward pressures on raw   materials prices and downward price pressures on finished goods have abated, prices at the retail   level have held flat  There does not appear to be much leeway in terms of pricing power  I am   going to turn to that in just a second  But the bottom line for our District is that it is expanding    Employment is actually turning into positive territory  As to price pressures, there are no red   flags yet   Nationally, my corporate contacts report slight improvement yet continued expectations   for limited growth  As you know, I like to look at how things get to market—ships at sea, air   travel, and freight shipments, as well as rails  Just to summarize what I have learned from my   contacts and the anecdotal evidence in those areas, there is a slight improvement taking place  I   like to talk about railroad cars  If you talk to Burlington Northern/Santa Fe, they still have some   25 percent in capacity, but the 200 miles of intermodal cars that were lying fallow in the third   quarter of 2009 have been pared somewhat  They now have 176 miles, so a slight improvement   has taken place  So in terms of how goods get to market, there has been a slight pickup  And in   terms of the intermediate stage, the best description I can give you is, in the words of the CFO of   Texas Instruments, that there is a slow crawl but it is positive upward  You see that in the   semiconductor shipment data that you gave us  In telephonic communications, AT&T reports   that they had the healthiest first week of January in three years on the business-to-business side   and, in fact, a spike upward in activity  And according to the CEO of Disney, in terms of   January 26–27, 2010 127 of 260    advertising for the networks, they are seeing “a shift from maintenance to opportunity,” which   indicates that there is some expectation of improved sales activity moving forward by their key   advertisers, in addition to Ed Whitacre, who is buying up a lot of personal space for General   Motors   I talked to many retailers  I’ll summarize that very quickly  According to the report   given back to me from the San Diego retail conference that took place last week—every major   retailer but JCPenney was there—the bottom line is that traffic is up slightly but it is still being   driven by value  The positive side for retailers is that, because of the commercial real estate   situation, they are able to negotiate better rents and move up into higher-class buildings  The   negative side is that, as one reported, while customers are willing to put one more item in the   market basket, they are still driven by value  I think that perhaps the best summary of what is   happening in retail is captured by one of the great literary journals of all time called Beer   Marketer’s Insights  Beer Marketer’s Insights had a very good article in their last issue—they   summarized 2009—when they pointed out that sales of the elixir of Main Street, beer, fell   22 percent last year  This is an interesting dynamic  That market is an oligopolistic market  It’s   controlled by two companies—Anheuser-Busch and Miller—which have 80 percent of the   market  They raised prices 5 percent last year, and for the first time since 1950 saw sales   decrease  I talked to the two largest beer distributors in the country, and they are seeing even   worse numbers at present  The two large manufacturers have announced 3 percent price   increases  I seriously doubt that the increases will take  And I think that is a good representative   insight into the pushback that’s being received from the customers at the end, even though there   are some price pressures building up over the supply chain   January 26–27, 2010 128 of 260    With regard to employment, perhaps the best summary was by the COO of Wal-Mart,   who said that for the first time in his memory, when he walks into a Wal-Mart store, the   employees greet him with smiles and with handshakes  They are grateful for their jobs  They   are afraid of losing them  And I would say that on net, Mr Chairman, this seems to be the   constraining factor, as was made clear by the presentation of our staff   Like President Bullard, I do not see immediate price pressures, but I am very concerned   about the intermediate and longer term, and I would just remind you that if you were to look to   the Greenbook, particularly the charts on consumer prices, we were in a situation where   globalization and other factors were leading to significant price pressures before the stick was   put into the spokes of the wheel because of the financial crisis  I remain convinced that neither   the Chinese nor the Indians will allow economic growth to slow to such a significant degree that   it creates political problems  We will have some demand–pull inflation pressures coming from   the EMEs, as you like to call them  And as we pick up our economic growth here and as we turn   the corner, we are at risk of going back to the kind of price pressures we had in the summer of   2008  Thank you, Mr Chairman     We are holding up the economy, Jeff  [Laughter]    Just a general comment, Mr Chairman, and then a comment on the   alternatives  I noted that in your summary you did point out that the dynamics can work in the   upside direction as well, and I just want to make a simple comment  I want to be very careful  I   do think we need to be appropriately patient but not lulled into inertia in terms of our concerns   about the downside  I sense that we are not at risk of doing so, but I do sense that there is some   inertia at the table, and it concerns me   That said, while I can see an argument for alternative C, especially against the extensive   disposition given by Narayana on price impact in a more robust market than in a market that was   bust when we bought these things, I am in favor of alternative B  I would make some suggested   changes  First of all, and following up on both Governor Duke and Bill English’s excellent   summary at the beginning, I don’t think in paragraph 1 it is correct to say, well, “bank lending   continues to contract”  I think it is better to say “remains tight”  My alternative B says “while   bank lending continues to contract”  Don, is that what you have?    I would suggest instead of “continues to contract” we say “remains tight”    It is not contracting from what I understand, and that was a suggestion made by —    Am I reading the wrong copy?    The recent loan survey indicates to me that it is not necessarily continuing   to contract, but it does remain tight  But if I am wrong, I will withdraw the brilliant suggestion I   just made   With regard to energy prices, I agree with President Plosser and the suggestion made by   Bill [English] that I do not think it is necessary to have that in there  First of all, they may be   temporary, and second, it excludes other prices  I agree with both President Plosser and   Narayana on the use of the word “holdings”  I take to the suggestion in paragraph 4 that we   consider mentioning that we expect to offer $25 billion in twenty-eight-day credit at the final   auction on March 8   I want to come back to one point that I’ve raised before  We had some discussion about   it last time, and actually in the last meeting President Rosengren made the excellent point that we   consider the treatment of the spread on primary credit and the use of word “extended period”    We have since had much more discussion about that  We have agreed or at least some of us   suggested yesterday that you might use your testimony on February 10, your subsequent   testimony, and our investigation of our own boards to move toward normalizing the primary   credit spread  But still, like a broken record, I am uncomfortable with the words “extended   period,” and I would like to make a suggestion, which is that we change that sentence after the   phrase “stable inflation expectations” to read as follows “are likely to continue to warrant   exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate”  Period  It may be just editorializing, but as I   said in the last meeting, I am a broken record on that subject, and I want to continue my record of   being a broken record on that subject  [Laughter]  Thank you, Mr Chairman   January 26–27, 2010 182 of 260     I thought Bill’s comment was a possible suggestion, that we would say   $25 billion in twenty-eight-day credit on the final auction on March 8  Is that correct, Bill, as   one alternative?  I would be in favor of that    Could you speak up a little, please?  "
8926,2010-03-16,"  Mr Chairman, I want to tie the two together because I actually am   concerned not by the presenter, Brian, but by the content of his presentation  As exhibit 2 shows,   all of those things we set out to accomplish, we did and we did well  Central bankers should   never pat themselves on the back, but I think those are all positive outcomes  What bothers me is   exhibit 4, chart 19  According to the memo Brian sent out earlier, we will wind up with   69 percent of our portfolio concentrated—I’m talking about the asset side of our balance sheet—  in GSE securities   Mr Chairman, you expressed this eloquently in your testimony, and all of us have   repeated it, and, Brian, you repeated it this morning  You used the word “ultimately”  I’m   wondering when “ultimately” is in terms of getting back to having an all-Treasury portfolio    March 16, 2010 21 of 146    We’re stuck with a massive portfolio of GSEs  Speaking personally, I don’t want to be there at   all  I’m concerned that we have somehow avoided the question; and, in fact, through statements   that are being made before we have complete unanimity at this table or at least agreement at this   table, we’re saying we’re not going to be selling GSE securities until we raise rates and other   things to that effect  This little yellow section here in that chart and even more dramatically in   the table and the pictures you provided in your briefing memo raise my question  When is   “ultimately”?   Second, in the excellent briefings you’ve provided and the Board briefing that was   provided yesterday, which was superb, we note that there’s pent-up demand for GSE securities    We’ve taken that market away  So my question is  If most managers are underweight MBS,   why don’t we sell to them and take advantage of it?  I’m all for Treasury redemptions, by the   way, but why are we, in a sense, putting Treasuries before MBS?  That doesn’t make sense to   me  I’d be interested in the Desk’s answer  If, indeed, we have pent-up investor demand, would   you give us some sense of how serious that is?   I also have a comment that links to the issue of RCAs  RCAs have the benefits that have   been outlined  But I’m also looking at some of the negatives, which you point out in your paper    It will probably shrink the federal funds market  That diminishes the role of the FOMC to a   degree, at least given the way we used to operate  And a super cynic would say not only were   the GSEs accomplices to the housing and financial crisis—we were cleaning up that mess by   buying up that portfolio, as we have particularly in two areas of the maturities spectrum; we are   at 80 percent of the market—but now we’re also handmaidens to cleaning up, in a sense, the   mess they are creating in the fed funds market   March 16, 2010 22 of 146    So I’m very uncomfortable—and I want to get this out up front—with the buildup in GSE   holdings  I’d like to get a sense from the Desk of what is the resolution and what does the word   “ultimately” mean  Second, I want to suggest that we go very slowly on this RCA concept    There’s a key statement in the very good paper that you wrote, where you say this is a   “permanent modification to the reserve account framework”  A permanent modification to the   reserve account framework to me warrants, Mr Chairman, a great deal more discussion than just   saying “go ahead and continue the process”  I have mostly made a statement, but I have also   asked a question  Brian, when is “ultimately?”  When do we get out of this stuff?  And do you   think it’s wise, operating the Desk, for us to end up in 2014 with 69 percent of our assets   invested in mortgage-backed securities?    And I don’t want to take too much time because we do have to run against   the clock, Mr Chairman, but it seems to me that the tone at the table has been “hold back on   sales of mortgage-backed securities until we raise rates,” and I don’t believe that has been agreed   at the table  This is a derivative of the broader issue, which is the MBS, and I guess I should say   I’m uncomfortable with question number four  I don’t have a problem with the first three   questions, but for number four, I’d say “Whoa, Nelly”    So ultimately is 2025, 2050?    Thank you, Brian    I’m sorry, Mr Chairman  I just want to make sure, because, again, we do   get asked about GSEs  I don’t think we’re asked about the RCAs  I haven’t gotten a question on   that    On GSEs, the question is—and it may have been misinterpreted, Brian,   from something you may have said—whether we would contemplate selling GSEs before or   after we raise the base rate  The timing is the question that we get now from the more   sophisticated audiences  I would like some guidance, Mr Chairman    Right    I think that’s probably the sensible answer—we are still discussing the   issue    Thank you, Mr Chairman    Well, I was going to say that the Texas version of the aphorism is, “Never   be silent”  [Laughter]  But I will try to be brief   Very quickly, in terms of our District, we are seeing a pickup in economic activity    Exports are up 316 percent year over year through the end of January, not unimportant for us as   an exporting state  Retail sales grew at an annual pace of 08 percent in December  They have   now increased for four consecutive months  Single-family housing permits increased strongly in   March 16, 2010 48 of 146    January  Our leading index increased in December and January and has now risen for nine of the   past ten months  And our job forecasts by our staff indicate that we our employment will   probably increase by 21 percent this year  By the way, 28 percent is the average for Texas over   the last 30 years  We see a pickup in economic activity  Having been one of the last to go into   recession, we’re coming out, not robustly, but we are coming out  With regard to the comment   on snowstorms, the snowstorms held things down  There may well have been a slightly more   robust expansion on our hands than we had thought  So enough of the District   I want to share with you quickly what I am hearing from my CEO contacts  Most of this   information is through last week in terms of their own activity, and I’ll just walk you through   some key indicators that I think may add to the information that you imparted so well in your   briefing   Through the end of January year over year, air freight activity has taken a big pop   upwards of 283 percent, building on what is continuous sequential improvement since October   of ’09  As you know, Herb Kelleher—I’ll drop one name—is on our Board  He has a sense of   humor  He said, “Things are not coming up roses, but they’re coming up periwinkles”  So we’re   beginning to see some improvement, including in premium traffic in terms of airlines  For the   first time since May of ’08 premium traffic has picked up by 1 percent   With regard to the shippers, they’re reporting a slight improvement in demand-supply   balance, and a slight strengthening of container market and day charter sales  And with regard to   the rails, which I like to look at, volume shipped through last week year over year is up   3½ percent year to date  Just to put that in context, their loading last week for the industry   entirely was 633,000 cars  The peak was 771,000  So it’s coming off a low of 525,000, and it’s   a sequential pickup  There still is excess capacity in ships and in rails  About 25 percent more   March 16, 2010 49 of 146    volume could be handled under the current availability of capacity, but the point is capacity is   picking up, and shipments are improving   With regard to petrochemicals, there has been a “remarkably strong beginning in January   and February,” according to one of the largest petrochemical producers  Most of that is going to   manufacturers and replacing very lean inventories, but autos seem to have led the way   With regard to semiconductors, the producers that I talked to are reporting underlying   demand increasing significantly across all business lines, “beyond normal seasonal demands”    This started escalating about 60 days ago in auto production, 30 days ago in communication,   most recently in PCs  The result is that some of them are adding capacity “aggressively,” and   this is confirmed by some of the computer and PC manufacturers that we talked to  The CEO of   Dell reports—and I believe this is not yet reported publicly—20 percent revenue growth year   over year through last week, the return of large business orders, but building what they call   “spend to save”—that is, continuing to drive efficiency so they don’t have to rehire labor   AT&T reports that long distance minutes are tracking upward, roaming has stabilized—  those are two key indicators for them  Very interestingly, only 3 percent of the people use   40 percent of the available bandwidth in this country  They charge them $30 a month  Needless   to say, to get that reshaped they are going to start pushing prices up on the order of 15 to   20 percent beginning in May—at least they will attempt to do so   And with regard to final consumption, it is interesting  President Plosser made a point   about advertising  The large national advertisers and the local advertisers are reporting they’re   seeing a trending upward, but the buys are coming late and there is very little visibility going   forward  There still is that uncertainty of how much buying you have three months in   anticipation   March 16, 2010 50 of 146    With regard to retailers, the lowest quartile still is in the foxhole  The second and third   quartiles are coming out of the bunker—that is, those in the middle-income groups  And then,   the balance sheet buyers that shop at Neiman Marcus and the higher-end stores are seeming to   party once again  And this is confirmed by MasterCard data, which show that luxury goods sales   year over year through the end of February are up 15 percent  And mall traffic is slightly picking   up  Malls, again, are places where people don’t need to go  They go because they wish to go,   and you’re seeing, despite gas prices, an increase  According to those that report to us, sales this   year are up in the 2 to 3 percent range, even in California, by the way  And Michaels, which is   an interesting store, has 1,000 units, 250 of them in California—they had the best month they   have had in the last four years in California this month  So, as their CEO said, there’s even a   sign of a heartbeat in California   Turning to inflation very quickly, every so often you get a PCE release which indicates   the outsized impact of one fluky item, and the misinformation being imparted by one month’s   numbers  The last PCE for January is a good case in point  Of all things, luggage and similar   personal items, which has a weight of 02 percent in the total PCE, had a one-month, annualized,   rate of decline of 94 percent  This was before it was announced that Janet might be the next Vice   Chairman and might have to move from San Francisco  [Laughter]  But it’s interesting that,   absent this little event, headline PCE would have grown at an annualized rate of 27 percent   rather than the 21 percent annualized rate that was reported  I mention this as a little   advertisement for the trimmed mean  Our Dallas trimmed mean came in at an annualized   08 percent in January  That is the third consecutive number below 1 percent  And the twelve-  month trimmed mean has trimmed down to 12 percent from 13 percent   March 16, 2010 51 of 146    So this and continued weakness in labor costs and wages indicates to me there’s very   little upward pressure, as President Lockhart indicated, to overall foreseeable inflation, though I   am watching carefully the turnaround in OER, which we saw a glimpse of in January  And then,   for the internationalists in the room, there are widespread reports that the Chinese are already   beginning the pricing for the next spring season, including significant increases—on the order of   10 to 15 percent—to cover their costs of labor, which they are trying to draw back from the   provinces to the coastlines and their manufacturing centers    So, in summary, Mr Chairman, on the economic front, I believe that we do have a   recovery under way  The issue really still has to do with employment  There does not seem to   be a great amount of interest—whether it’s small business or Fortune 500 companies—to rehire    And one still has to ask the question  Even if we had increasing prices coming through the front   door, is there consumer demand that will sustain it going out the back door in goods and   services?  I don’t see that in the immediate future   I want to conclude with a quick comment  In surveying small companies and large   companies, the issue is not the price of capital  Liquidity is ample, and money is cheap  The   constant refrain of complaint is what one small businessman calls regulatory roulette  Those   small companies that are creditworthy are seeking loans, and they feel that they have access to   capital  If you look at the NFIB surveys, they’ll tell you that only 3 percent of business owners   report finance as their number one problem  For most, their number one problem is uncertainty    A very disheartening point when talking to CEOs today is that small businesses are reluctant to   hire because of uncertainty in terms of what social overhead costs are going to be, taxation, and   all of these other things that we have heard about before  But most disheartening of all is that   large businesses are loath to grow their payrolls and spend beyond maintenance cap ex in this   March 16, 2010 52 of 146    country  And CEO after CEO after CEO, and business group after business group after business   group, at least claims that they will be expanding their cap ex  If it’s beyond maintenance, say   like AT&T or Exxon, or those kinds of people, it’s all going abroad  To have a CEO of an iconic   US company tell me, “It’s time to get the hell out of Dodge,” meaning to invest elsewhere,   because they don’t believe that ROI is comparable in this country, has nothing to do with   monetary policy or central bank policy  It has to do with uncertainty  And I hope, even though   it’s not our policy and has nothing to do with what we do for a living, that eventually those   uncertainties will be removed  If they’re removed, I believe that American businesses are   running very tight, they’re extremely muscular, they will have to add to their labor force, and   they will have to invest more  But currently they’re totally reluctant to do so  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    Mr Chairman, I mentioned my questions to Brian, and you summarized   eloquently and reminded us that we have accomplished a great deal, and to be sure the liquidity   measures we undertook, I believe, prevented a financial meltdown and restored the economy—  March 16, 2010 98 of 146    pulled us back from the abyss  We’re now undoing all of these initiatives because the markets   for interbank lending and commercial paper and money market mutual funds, asset-backed   securities, and so on have been restored and have been re-liquefied  So we’ve normalized in   almost all areas but one, namely, we are maintaining zero interest rates for interbank lending,   promising to do so for “an extended period,” despite the fact that the banks and the debt markets   at all points on the yield curve and across the range of quality have also been restored and, in   fact, are, as Governor Kohn pointed out, at least in terms of excess reserves, awash in liquidity   President Yellen had a very interesting phrase just now  She talked about the likely   direction of the journey, and I think that’s the key point here  I think it’s important for us to spell   out where we are likely to go  As I mentioned in my summary of the economy, I don’t believe   we’re going to have inflationary pressures for the foreseeable future  I worry enormously about   absorbing this big slack we have in labor  But I also worry about how people view us over the   long term, and I’m quite worried about our balance sheet   Not to put too serious a tone on this—but it did catch my eye—there was a very good op-  ed by Mikhail Gorbachev in the Sunday New York Times when he was talking about what went   wrong  As they were celebrating perestroika, he said he didn’t realize that the radicals were   pushing us to move faster and the conservatives were stepping on our toes preventing our   forward movement  I think we have to be very careful here not to take too much comfort in what   we’ve done, because we’ll be judged by where we’re likely to go  What I worry about in terms   of where we’re likely to go was touched on by Governor Warsh and others at the table  We have   an enormous amount of Treasury issuance coming forward  We have an enormous amount of   sovereign debt issuance coming forward  No one mentioned this, but it was covered fairly well   March 16, 2010 99 of 146    in the New York Times this morning, there’s a huge wall of maturity in 2012 in terms of   corporate debt, the debt that’s going to have to be rolled over for LBOs and for junk   By postponing laying out the road map, that is, the likely direction of the journey, as   President Yellen referred to it, I’m just concerned that we are boxing ourselves in  If rates were   to rise because of the factors that Governor Warsh mentioned or other factors in the marketplace,   I could see this Committee, if we continue down the current path, saying, “We dare not sell   because we’ll realize capital losses”  One hundred basis points leads to $100 billion, or whatever   number you mentioned earlier   I would like us now to lay out our path  I’m in favor of alternative C′, but I agree with   President Kocherlakota that a melding of B and C′ might be a wise thing to do, with a slight   variation, and that is that I would like that fourth paragraph to be in B  I would accept the fact   that we keep the phrase “for an extended period” I think that would mitigate whatever negative   influences we’re worried about in terms of the market reaction  We’re saying we expect to hold   rates low  I would prefer “for some time”—I know I can’t sell it at the table  But if we say “for   an extended period” and then we marry it with that road map, the likely direction in which we   are going, as stated in C′ paragraph 4, I think that would be a good combination, and that’s my   recommendation, Mr Chairman  Thank you  "
8974,2010-05-09,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have two questions  The last time we   activated our swap lines, of course, others piled on—we had Singapore, Chile, Mexico, and so   on  My question is  What’s the risk of other countries that are going to want to pile on?   As for my second question, maybe this isn’t the right time to ask it, but I’ll ask it anyway    Let’s say Ecofin does come forward and we announce these swap lines  I agree with you, Mr   Chairman, that doing so would serve not only substantive purposes, but it also has a   psychological impact  But let’s assume that it doesn’t work  What are the next steps that we   might be asked to engage in?  I just want to have us think through a little bit, without taking too   much time, a decision tree going forward   May 9, 2010 17 of 42             I think my first question presents a different set of political risks from the ones you’ve   already highlighted, Mr Chairman  So I’d be interested in Brian’s and Nathan’s judgment on   that    Thank you, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, I just want to underscore that I think all of Michelle’s   points were spot on, and we need additional efforts, particularly because it’s our money, such as   releasing the contracts, so that we better inform those who feel we’re conspiring against them    Mr Chairman, I’d also like to talk a bit offline with you—I noticed you were looking at your   watch, and I’m conscious of that—about certain people I think should be spoken to in a timely   way, so that there’s no confusion   I’d also say—and I’m sure Michelle has already thought this through—that we need to be   able to state this in the simplest possible English, so that it’s clearly understood that this is   something where we don’t bear a risk of loss, that it’s in our own best interest to do this, that   taking this step is a very cheap way to provide insurance against further contagion, and that it’s   certainly a better option than what might ensue if this were to infect our own system  So I’m   basically underscoring the points that Michelle made  They may have been unorganized   thoughts, but I think they touched all the right bases   I also want to ask that we consider—and, again, this is a question of timing, because we   can’t run any risk of leaks—broadening our base a little bit in terms of key senators  I have one,   as you know, particularly in mind that we have worked with very closely—hand-in-glove—and I   don’t want to undermine their sense of confidence in, and I want to enhance their understanding,   which is limited, of these rather esoteric but essential tools  Thank you    I’m supportive, Mr Chairman  I think we should do what’s right for the   sake of the economy, and yet we should be wary of the politics, which have been discussed at   great length   I think we should not just issue a statement, but we should have Michelle draft an FAQ    We want to answer the questions we want to have asked, anticipate them, state very clearly and   in simple English what our answers are  I was asking myself earlier if it might be worth your   actually doing a press conference  There are risks to doing so, but, in this atmosphere now, all of   us are being asked different questions, and I want to make sure we have clarity and a   straightforward explanation coming from one source, which, of course, has to be you, as   Chairman  So consider either a press conference or, in addition to a statement, in some other   format answering questions that we know will be asked of us in the most direct fashion   I would urge you, as Don mentioned, not just to reach out to Republicans, but also to   Democrats  And, again, I want to have an offline discussion, if I can, with Linda and you   quickly about one particular senator who I think needs to be included in that group  But,   obviously, I’d recommend front-running to the degree you can, with regard to sensitive time and   risk of leakage, as well as contact with key Ds and Rs from you directly before the   announcement is made, or simultaneously, or however it can be done   In sum, I’m supportive and continue to be worried about the politics of this, but I think   they can be handled  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8999,2010-06-22,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to come back to President Hoenig’s   point  I’m a little uncomfortable with the idea of swaps on the FNMA 55s  I’m intrigued by the   idea of actually making outright sales, assuming the market would accommodate them without   backing up significantly  We bought them for a purpose; the purpose was achieved; your own   charts show the accomplishment that took place in terms of their present levels  But your   chart 17 on MBS fails tell us there’s an imbalance in the marketplace  I would imagine, although   I’m guessing, that we probably would have a profit on these instruments  I’m not sure   You also gave some other pretty compelling arguments  the flight from risk that you   noted—these are absolutely government-guaranteed securities, and, not unimportantly, the   extension of expectations as to when we are going to tighten, which ought to provide any buyer   of these securities, assuming they’re available at a decent price, some comfort that it will be   some time before we tighten and might push up yields on the longer end  My guess is, given   what I used to do for a living, that sales would go well  Let me give you an example of how   things worked—it’s an exaggeration, but it illustrates the point  We would go to a large group,   Fidelity or anybody else, and say, “We’re willing to give you a portfolio, a very large one, of   these mortgage-backed securities”  They would have no trouble finding investors to take down   these coupons as they now are, because otherwise their yield on cash is negligible   June 22–23, 2010 13 of 213             So, Mr Chairman, I would like to suggest, if we’re going to talk about coupon swaps,   that we broaden the discussion to talk about selling outright, and perhaps buying short-term   Treasury bills  The objective would be to affect our portfolio, assuming this could be done   without sending a signal that we’re tightening monetary policy   We have experimented with demand deposits, with repos, and so on  I’m wondering, Mr   Chairman, if there’s not a way we could do this and send a signal to the marketplace that this   doesn’t have implications for monetary policy, but that we do have an imbalance in the   marketplace, and we’re seeking to solve that imbalance, rather than getting into the business of   swaps, which, I think, just prolongs the issue   So here’s my bottom-line question  Would we consider outright sales, taking advantage   of the fact that we will probably book a slight profit, take the proceeds, buy shorter-term   Treasuries that help shorten the duration of the portfolio, and sell into a market that seems to be   eager to buy this kind of paper?  That would be my question  I suppose it’s a Committee   question  I’m not putting pressure on Brian, but Brian gave us a partial answer and indicated that   there was a market appetite for these securities    Exactly    As long as it doesn’t preclude our having that discussion    I think that’s totally fair  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Just for clarity here, in following up on President Lockhart’s question  If   we were to sell these and buy Treasury bills, we don’t shrink our balance sheet, is that correct?     Thank you    First of all, I wasn’t the only member—Governor Warsh also had some   interesting arguments on that  But I think it threatens our independence more to have skewed   our holdings toward longer-term mortgage-backed securities  But we can talk about that when I   get my chance in the round    May I first ask two questions?  The first is  Are we indemnified from   losses on MBS?    Yes    Not by the Treasury  Second When is the Humphrey-Hawkins   testimony?    Mr Chairman, you went back to the last meeting and the four principles   agreed upon, which reminded me that I had forgotten my manners  I just wanted to thank   everybody for the support they’ve given me during a very difficult period   Setting aside sentiments—and central bankers are not supposed to have any feelings   whatsoever and are supposed to be objective—the one thing about taking a month off is this    When you read these materials and think about the things that we have discussed and look at   them with fairly fresh eyes, at least to me—and Narayana touched on this—the issue of whether   we wait to tighten before we sell assets is interesting  I can envision circumstances where we   might tighten, and the impact would be such that, at the longer end of the yield curve—at least in   the middle section of the yield curve—we might shift from gains to losses on our holdings    We’re not indemnified against those losses, and I could see where the political costs—I know   we’re not supposed to think about politics just like we’re not supposed to be emotional—could   be great, and we could be criticized for having pursued a bad strategy ex post  I would note that   we pursued this strategy deliberately, and Governor Kohn and I supported the purchase of   mortgage-backed securities for a specific purpose, and I think we have achieved our goal   As you, Mr Chairman, and President Yellen and others have correctly pointed out, the   macroeconomic situation has deteriorated, but it hasn’t disintegrated  It’s not as bad as it was,   and the financial conditions now are much better than they were when we implemented this   program  So I think we need to take that into account   The reality is that there is a demand for this product in the marketplace  What people are   being offered for cash is negligible  I would be willing to submit that we could sell a decent   portion of our mortgage-backed securities to hungry buyers  However, I would agree that this is   not the time now to reduce our balance sheet size, and in fact, if you do worry about some of the   June 22–23, 2010 46 of 213             tail risks of a weaker economy because of the trip wire of Europe or whatever it may be, I’d like   to have a little dry powder in my pocket  I think we could achieve this by taking advantage of   market conditions  I’m not going to go as far as Governor Warsh—actually rooting for further   weakness in Europe and disintegration of Europe—but we are the beneficiary of the misfortune   of others  Whatever the reason, it gives us an opportunity at least to consider the subject of   whether or not we can sell some of this portfolio, which we all agree is disproportionate to our   long-term goals; that is, we could take advantage of that and at least test the possibility  I would   be in favor of reinvesting it in Treasuries  I think President Lacker raised a good point, which is   that we might even, if we wanted to—and I’m not sure that’s the objective of the exercise—  extend the duration of the portfolio by doing so   So I’m uncomfortable with taking it off the table, Mr Chairman  I think it is a question   of communication  I don’t think it necessarily leads to tightening, Governor Kohn  I’m not   necessarily in favor of tightening right now, but I am concerned that this is a tool that we used  It   worked  It may no longer be entirely appropriate to carry this in our portfolio, if we can shed it   without taking losses and without necessarily impacting the current duration of the portfolio or   even shrinking our balance sheet   That would be my perspective on this issue  It sounds like there are many people at the   table who disagree, but whatever we decide, I would be in favor of your doing this through the   Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, because, I hope, by then, we will have gotten through all of the   deregulation and re-regulation and all of that political argument that’s taking place on the Hill   and get back to discussing monetary policy   June 22–23, 2010 47 of 213             As to the options laid out by Brian, my favorite, although I don’t view it as optimal,   would be option 2  It reduces the duration  It keeps the balance sheet roughly the same size for   now  It gives us a bigger chunk of securities with maturities a year or less to work with   But I’m a little concerned, Mr Chairman, that we’re just ruling out taking an opportunity   here when the market is very strong, and I think we can do it in a way that isn’t disruptive  The   question is  How do you communicate it?  That’s a tough one  I think we can come up with   answers  We can talk about that later  I think you could communicate in Humphrey-Hawkins,   and we can do so without damaging our obligation to live up to the dual mandate that we are   governed by  Thank you, Mr Chairman    First, Mr Chairman, on the Tealbook, I thought it was great, and I’ll add   a little historical footnote  The first use of the word “teal” as a color description was 1917 So it   goes back in our history  But it’s also forward-looking, because the Unitarian hymnal, which is   June 22–23, 2010 71 of 213             gray, by the way, was translated into Spanish, and all of the hymns in Spanish are in what they   call the Tealbook  So thank you for looking forward to our universal language here in the United   States    I have a couple of questions on the international section  One inflationary   impulse that I hear countering a tremendous amount of deflationary impulses relates to   transportation  The HARPEX Index and the Hamburg Index, which measure container   transportation, have come up dramatically since mid-June, and you hear retailers complain about   that  Second, of course, is the expectation that Chinese prices are pretty stiff, given wage   settlements and given what they’re asking for during the post-Christmas buying season in terms   of clothing, shoes, and other things  In your presentation for global economic growth, we have   reduced our expectations, including for China, and I’m wondering how you account for these   transportation pressures  Is it slow steaming, or is it something else, a dynamic that’s in place?   My second question is  Are we likely to see the Chinese back off from some of these   price demands?  The reason I ask is that I don’t believe there’s much likelihood that it will work   its way through to consumption here, but it does impact retailers’ margins  I’m curious as to   what your views on those two issues are    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  My colleague to my left, President Bullard,   talked about LIFO accounting regarding our balance sheet  In my District’s economy, we’re   basically are fortunate to have been last into the recession, and we appear to be one of the first   coming out  There is some dissonance between what I’m seeing locally and what I’m hearing   from the CEOs that I survey around the country  So let me give you a brief report   As far as our District is concerned, we just received the May payroll employment figures,   and our private sector payroll is up 47 percent year over year at an annual rate  The   unemployment rate stays steady  We have a lot of people coming into our workforce  There are   some awfully good things happening in the Eleventh District from the standpoint of   manufacturing employment--our index indicates it has risen to the highest level in three years   Our construction employment soared in April and continued to do so in May  Interestingly, if   you talk to the small retailers, particularly the convenience stores, they’re seeing a new influx of   Mexican workers  We’re not sure if they are coming from Mexico or from Arizona   Our housing inventory fell to a total of 69 months after a slight increase in February    The leading index has risen now for the third consecutive month, and we find a modest pickup in   input prices reported by our manufacturers, but there’s very little pass-through to consumer   prices  So our region is enjoying a robust emergence from the recession, which we went into   very late    As far as the national economy is concerned, I will just share the anecdotal evidence that   I have picked up from the list that I gave you, Mr Chairman  I am going to use a term only to   flatter my colleague from Minnesota, because I doubt the Minnesota Gophers have been talked   about—it was a football team for many, many years  [Laughter]    That’s as much as you’re going to get  And I warned you, Mr Chairman,   I would probably talk about a “Bronko Nagurski” economy  Now, I’m probably the only person   here old enough to remember who Bronko Nagurski was—maybe Governor Kohn also   remembers [laughter]  Basically, you gave him the ball—    Yes, I know  You gave him the ball if you wanted to run right up the   middle and gain short yardage, which he was consistently good at doing, and for that he was   named three times, at three different positions, as an All-Pro  No one has broken that record   Why do I mention that?  Because what brought us out of the end zone was inventory   correction  That player’s legs are tired, and I think that has basically run its course  I’m hearing   that from almost every sector that I talked to  The second yardage was gained by equipment and   software, and again, even though that continues if you talk to computer manufacturers and   others, you’re beginning to see a slowdown or a tempering of that activity  The game has   basically become a short yardage game, running up the middle, a cloud of dust, but still making   forward progress on the field  It’s standard blocking and tackling, and I think the pace has   slowed down, and, therefore, I have revised down my expectations for the second half   Every single businesswoman or man I speak to that is in a position of leadership   describes the following circumstances  They have gone back to basic blocking and tackling    They are beset not just by concerns about demands for products, say, in weakening areas like   Europe, but also by something we have not mentioned, which I will refer to as random   refereeing—that is, they beg for the huddle  They say they’re going to give Bronko Nagurski the   ball, and the ref comes up and says, “By the way, this time the first down is 15 yards”  In other   words, there is enormous uncertainty, which we discussed before, about the impact of   June 22–23, 2010 85 of 213             government programs and regulation  For example, one CEO reports that in the new health care   bill there are 1,100 instances that are “to be determined” by the Secretary of Health and Human   Services  There is no way you can cost out this random refereeing  In the case of the casual   dining sector, they estimate it will triple their personnel costs, or in the case of a large company   like Exxon or AT&T, which has all the legal power in the world, they still cannot figure what the   impact is going to be on the cost structure, which inhibits planning  That is point number one   Point number two is that enormous cash build-up has taken place in the corporate sector    According to the Wall Street Journal, which may or may not be reliable, the S&P 500 has built   up $18 trillion in excess cash over the cash flow needs  Every CEO or CFO I talk to has excess   cash  What are they doing with the excess cash?  They’re either buying their own stock—for   example, Texas Instruments has bought 30 percent of its own stock—or they’re going to increase   their dividend payments  I’m having a hard time finding people who are willing to add to their   workforce until the random refereeing stops, until there is greater certainty  I am also deeply   disturbed by a phenomenon that I have reported before regarding cap-ex intentions—if my   contacts are going to expand plant and equipment, they don’t plan to do it here   So, Mr Chairman, I would say we still have inhibiting factors, including uncertainty,   which stems from external developments and the lack of clarity as to rules and regulations that   are likely to impact those who hire, especially the small business sector that doesn’t have the   resources that large corporations do to try to decipher what’s coming out  These factors are   going to inhibit employment growth; at the same time, they will hold inflation at bay   In concluding, I’d like to follow up on Sandy’s comment on her staff’s median CPI index   and say that our trimmed mean index is, again, continuing to diminish and show less inflationary   pressure  Thank you, Mr Chairman   June 22–23, 2010 86 of 213              Nagurski    You asked a question, Mr Chairman, about timing  I have no problem   with the coupon swaps  We are talking about, at least initially, $9 billion out of $125 trillion    The question of timing, it seems to me, relates to the first two sentences in the directive, because   it basically says what we’re going to say in our statement  I would just ask, if we’re going to   give the Desk a directive—which I support—whether we need to put those first two sentences in   there  We’re dealing with a settlement issue  Do the first two sentences take away or pre-  announce, of course, what we all know we are going to announce, but before we issue the   statement?  Is it necessary to have those first two sentences in there?  We’re dealing with a   settlement issue—that’s the point     Yes, sir    Oh, I’m sorry  I thought you were asking whether we should issue the   directive before that    Okay  I apologize    Obviously, the purpose is to accomplish what we want to accomplish   without any implications about the change of policy  This is to accomplish a specific objective    I misunderstood your point, Mr Chairman  I apologize    Mr Chairman, I was thinking about your thoughtful summary,   particularly the last part of your statement  Don had scared me a little bit with his intervention,   and I think you summarized it all very, very well  I would like to just make some general points   I think we have to be very careful with our franchise  We have comported ourselves   well  We instituted liquidity measures that frightened some people and led to assumptions about   what we were likely to do, possibly leading the nation to ruin  We executed them well, and then   we unwound them  I can’t think of many government institutions that do that  In fact, I can   think of none, but there may be cases in history  The point is that I believe we are a very   credible institution  We are primus inter pares among central banks  That is befitting for a great   economy and for a great society  And I think we have to be extremely careful at this juncture,   indicating changes of purposeful direction   You know that I like to think in terms of decision trees  I think it is absolutely   appropriate for us to think of different conditions that might obtain  But I think we have to be   very careful how we signal that, having earned the respect of the marketplace and of other   leaders elsewhere, because they are way behind us, and many are seeking to emulate what we do   as they transform themselves, as in the case of the ECB  So, as my colleague from Minnesota   expressed well, I wouldn’t rule out either scenario   I would remind myself that we are correcting from a very traumatic period  It takes a   long time to recover from trauma, and it is being done in the context of globalization, a rapid   ascent up Moore’s curve, and several other things that are impacting a significant part of our dual   mandate  Inflation doesn’t seem to be the issue currently—we all acknowledge that  And, in   fact, there are downside risks  But there may be limits to what we can actually do about   June 22–23, 2010 140 of 213             unemployment  For example, I think unemployment is a function of many things  It’s a   correction from excess; when you’re fat and happy, you make mistake—employers did that   under the Great Moderation  It’s a reflection of enhanced ability to ride Moore’s curve to greater   productivity, having fewer people perform more functions  It’s a function of education  It’s a   function of choice, and by that I mean that if you’re not happy with the random refereeing here,   you go to where there’s more stability  There are other mentions of companies that seek to   increase their cap-ex elsewhere rather than here  Here is the point  We have to be very careful   that we don’t promise something we cannot deliver  It’s not clear to me that expanding our   balance sheet will have an impact on the employment side of our dual mandate  So I think we   have to be very careful about what we promise  Having said all of that, I think you’re right that   we have to consider the options and draw out the decision tree   I do want to comment on the asset part of the portfolio  When we started, if my   calculations are correct, the duration of our portfolio before the crisis was 26 years, and   35 percent of our portfolio was in bills  Even after adopting the option we seem to be gravitating   towards, option 2, the duration of our portfolio will be 39 years, and the holding of our bills will   be 9 percent, up from 2 percent  So we are far away from the norm, and I think we need to bear   that in mind  You make a good point on Treasuries, because this is a message all of us are   receiving whenever we’ve gone to see the Chinese and others  But we do need to remember that   our holding of mortgage-backed securities is an unnatural act, and it’s something we did to   remedy a market dysfunction  I still wouldn’t rule out taking advantage of the fact that this   market is priced very handsomely, and we might be able to take advantage of that in order to get   out of that unnatural holding that’s in our portfolio  So I want to underscore parts of what   Presidents Lacker and Hoenig have said   June 22–23, 2010 141 of 213             Against that background of remembering that we have hard-earned credibility and, at the   same time, that we’re in a very difficult period of uncertainty, I would be supportive of   alternative B  The one thing I notice missing in the draft statement is the reference—and I don’t   know how we do this and whether we should do this—to the random refereeing, that is, the   reason that investment in nonresidential structures continues to be weak and that employers   remain reluctant to “add to payrolls” is in part uncertainty about tax and regulatory requirements    That was referred to by the Vice Chairman, by Governor Duke, and by several others that talked   about what they are hearing anecdotally from companies and employers  So I would prefer to   add that in there, unless it crosses the line into politics  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Muddling through    We can just say economic activity continues  [Laughter]    I had asked a question, Mr Chairman, about whether we were crossing   the line if we added what we heard from many people about the uncertainty about tax and   regulatory requirements  I just want some definition here    No, not for that specific reference, but it is going to come through in the   minutes, and that’s sufficient  Thank you, Mr Chairman    May I just add?    On behalf of, at least, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, and I think all   the Reserve Banks, I’d like to offer an appreciation for the way Brian has conducted himself  He   has been very respectful of the input of the Banks, and the courtesy—punctilious courtesy would   be the best description—has been truly remarkable  I hope it’s noted that his work is deeply   appreciated, obviously, by the Board, but also by the Reserve Banks and their staffs   PARTICIPANTS  Here, here  "
9025,2010-08-10,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’d like to get a quick briefing from Brian on   the private sector’s issuance of securities  I’m thinking particularly of the datasheet on page 64   of the Tealbook that shows the volume of issuance  My interpretation of the volume of issuance   is that we are back to fairly decent levels—at least the 2006 and 2007 levels—both for   investment-grade corporate debt and junk, or high-yield, debt; and, noticeably, there’s much   more activity recently in the commercial paper markets  If you go back to page 62, which talks   about spreads, spreads have pretty much returned to the norm  In fact, if you look at the far- and   near-term forward high-yield corporate bond spreads, as well as commercial paper corporate   bond yields, we’ve made progress since the last FOMC meeting  But, even in the commercial   paper markets, we’re back to almost zero in terms of spreads  So my questions are  Is the   issuance schedule robust?  Could we describe it that way?  Or has it returned to near normal?  In   addition, what does it tell you?   August 10, 2010 10 of 160              I’ll start with a comment that I’ve actually made before  I think the   international briefing and the whole Tealbook, compared with when I first joined the Committee,   is much more informative—indeed, it has become superb under your leadership, Mr Chairman    I came here before you were Chairman   Nathan, I want to go to a point you made  You said that we’re at the point where private   domestic spending in many countries must basically pick up to offset the decline in government   stimulus; I assume that may be true here as well  I want to go to the first page of the domestic   economic developments and outlook briefing, where there’s the following statement  “Financial   conditions appear slightly more supportive of economic growth than in June”  I’m wondering if,   after the inputs of the last few days, you still would argue that  Nathan, if you would, please   argue that on the international side    Well, I mean that we’re here to debate principally financial and monetary   conditions, but you have a statement, “Financial conditions appear slightly more supportive of   economic growth than in June”  Is that still true?    I agree  Nathan?   August 10, 2010 18 of 160              Thank you    Excuse me—less tail risk on the downside or upside or which side?    Thank you    That’s very important    Mr Chairman, like President Pianalto, I can report that the Dallas Fed’s   forecasts were at the lower end  In fact, I think we had the lowest forecast for growth for the   second half of this year; it’s at about 26 percent  The Tealbook is now more closely tracking   what we were thinking in terms of the immediate future and, perhaps, is more optimistic than we   August 10, 2010 33 of 160             are farther ahead  I’d like to talk very briefly about what we see in our region, and then I want to   address the issue that Nathan raised about private domestic spending as a generator of   employment   The District economy and, particularly, Texas, which is the largest part of the District, are   experiencing broad-based economic growth  We have seen it taper off somewhat  We do have   positive developments, and we have some offsets  Positive developments really revolve around,   of course, the energy sector, where we are seeing the rig count increase  Venture capital   spending in Texas rose almost 20 percent in the second quarter  The S&P/Case-Shiller Home   Price Index shows that our houses are edging up in price, 03 percent in May, and currently   prices are about 3 percent above the year-ago level  So we have been fortunate on that side    Retail sales are inching upwards  The July Senior Loan Officer Survey saw a glimmer of easing   in C&I lending and pricing  We’re seeing significant competition coming from the large   national banks, and that’s creating some angst among the local bankers  Very importantly, the   bottom line is that we expect employment growth to be somewhere between 2½ and 3 percent   this year, which is between 250,000 and 300,000 jobs on our base of 10 million workers   District exports fell 22 percent in May and continued to fall in June, but they’re still up   about 25 percent on a year-over-year basis  So we continue to be very fortunate by virtue of our   location and whatever policies drive people to locate in our area   I’d like to turn to my survey of business leaders  As I pointed out to you in a private   memo, Mr Chairman, I’ve broadened that somewhat to include smaller employers  So the base   now runs from companies with 100 employees to the largest companies in the country, and I’ve   included some new companies that give me a better sense of different sectors, and I’d like to   summarize them very quickly   August 10, 2010 34 of 160             In brief, whether public or private, large or small, these companies are building and   hoarding cash  If you look at the old S&P industrials—which I still like to look at, maybe   because I’m old—you’ll see that 130 percent of expected operating earnings for this year is the   level of cash being held  That’s 102 percent of market value, a nearly historical high  They’re   doing so primarily for three reasons, according to my interlocutors  One, they want to protect   against a downturn  Two, they’re uncertain about the impact of tax and regulatory changes,   something I refer to as random refereeing—it’s a very real and very inhibiting phenomenon,   particularly with regard to employment of personnel  And, three, they want to be able to manage   their margins—they’re buying back shares, if they need to, or paying dividends to keep their   shareholders happy if needed  Those are the publicly traded corporations   This morning, the newly released NFIB survey reports that 91 percent of the businesses   surveyed say that their credit needs are being met, and only 4 percent report that financings are   their top business problem  Just to quote that report, “credit availability does not appear to be the   cause of slow growth”   For publicly traded companies, debt is cheap  Demand in the investment community is   great  My friends on the underwriting desks—and these are old, battle-scarred veterans I dealt   with many years ago—report that they’ve never seen the levels of bidding that they’re seeing   now  They’re seeing ten-to-one ratios  For example, one of the companies that I survey   regularly is Kimberly-Clark  It issued a $250 million, 10-year, single-A credit  It received   $3 billion in indicated interest, allowing it to price barely 67 basis points over Treasuries  On the   private side, I hear—as was confirmed by the NFIB survey—no complaints about the cost of   borrowing, though some complain about the stinginess of bankers’ lending terms   August 10, 2010 35 of 160             If you put these points together, I would say the cost of capital is not an issue    Availability is a significant issue, but not for all  The most vexing issue, as one of my   interlocutors put it succinctly, is the following question  “If I raise funds, what am I going to do   with them?”  Apparently, they’re not going to put it to work in the immediate future expanding   the US workforce, which is my greatest concern  All but one company I surveyed are   budgeting for no to minimal net new hiring in the United States, partly because they’re realizing   efficiencies that they wish to keep  They also have the unpleasant memory of having to lay   people off, and they don’t like it—it’s burned into their memory  Furthermore, they don’t know   how to cost out health care and other new social overhead  Let me illustrate that point with a   quote  Rex Tillerson of Exxon, the biggest company in the world, said, “I think it’s fair to say   that we have access to all of the consultants, accountants, and lawyers anybody would want  If   we can’t determine what a new employee costs, how can a small business do so?”  Finally, in   some instances, the return on investment in labor elsewhere is higher  To give you another   quote, this is what I heard from the CFO of a company that’s currently expanding capital   expenditure and acquiring firms abroad  “Why should I take the chance in hiring American   workers I don’t know the cost of when I can hire great talent abroad that I can budget with   greater certainty?”   I would recommend, without taking too much more time, that you look at the nice piece   that was in yesterday’s Wall Street Journal, “Why I’m Not Hiring,” by a fellow who runs a   company of 83 employees  “As much as I want to hire new sales people, engineers, and   marketing staff in an effort to grow, I would be increasing my company’s vulnerability to   government decisions to raise taxes, to policies that make health insurance more expensive, and   August 10, 2010 36 of 160             the difficulties in this economic environment”  Not once does he mention the cost of capital or   access to money   The rails, express shippers, and ship and freight operators report an improvement in   volume of consumer goods shipped, but, at the point of sale, the prices of what has been shipped   have been marked down  However, the CEO of Walmart, who does not participate in the chain   store reporting, tells me that they realize they’ve been cannibalizing their own margins by   aggressively discounting  They’re in the process of removing those discounts  They have not   given up customer counts, so they expect to get back to normal pricing  I also hear that reflected   with other retailers; for example, JC Penney’s is in the second and third quartile, and even   Disney is discovering that it, too, is able to reduce or eliminate its discounting without giving up   customer count   The bottom line among these companies is that employment growth is anemic, which is   worrisome  Price pressures are nil, except in the transportation and some commodity spaces    Deleveraging in the business sector continues  Liquidity is building  Almost all expect slower   GDP growth in the second half than what they saw in the first half, and almost all view deflation   as a tail risk   Now, as to random refereeing and the general outlook for the all-important issue of   employment, which is part of our mandate—they lead me to be somewhat pessimistic in the   short term  But I want to remind you that, if and as the fog lifts on regulatory and tax issues and   the referees achieve consistency, there appears to be significant potential for hiring and for cap-  ex at home, which is the outcome we all desire  That is my review, Mr Chairman  I have   significant comments about what we’re going to talk about in terms of the statements and I’ll   withhold them until we get to that part of the discussion  Thank you   August 10, 2010 37 of 160              Thank you, Mr Chairman  Brian, could you summarize the benefits and   potential costs of the strategy for the markets, viewed purely from the Desk’s perspective?    Yes, purely from the Desk’s standpoint  How much do we expect to see   longer-term rates fall, and what’s the potential cost of doing so?    Built in by the market’s expectation of our adopting this strategy?    I guess your argument is that there’s less potential cost in terms of exit   strategy with Treasuries than we would have if we had all MBS    Thank you    Mr Chairman, in thinking of all the things I’ve heard around this table   today—in addition to what I call “good news for Lutherans,” which is the economic growth that   you’re experiencing here in the DC area and the low unemployment rate in Minnesota—let me   just mention two that are of concern to me   One is the constant reference to the Japanese deflationary trap  For what it’s worth, I   have some familiarity with Japan, as I co-chaired on behalf of Prime Minister Hashimoto and   President Clinton what was called the “US–Japan Enhanced Initiative on Competition and   Deregulation”  To be sure, there were monetary factors involved in the deflation trap, but there   were also gross fiscal errors made by the Japanese government  One was raising the sales tax in   1997, and another was the inability to reform the banking system, because of what is known as   “amakudari,” which means basically that the Bank of Japan and Ministry of Finance officials   went back to the banks and influenced the authorities not to bring about the kind of reforms that   we just brought about  I think the cumulative effect of those fiscal initiatives, as well as the   monetary initiatives, was a consumer shift to perpetual thrift  So one point I want to raise a   cautionary flag about is that we should be careful that we don’t constantly refer to the United   States falling into the Japanese deflationary trap  Our conditions are totally different  Yet, to be   August 10, 2010 120 of 160             sure, none of us do want to have deflation  And, to be sure, all of us want to see higher   employment and lesser unemployment, more jobs for the American people  That’s part of our   mandate   The other thing is that I heard the following statements made around the table  from   Brian, “I don’t think capital markets are imposing a constraint”; from Larry, “financial   conditions appear slightly more supportive of economic growth than in June”; from Governor   Duke, “loan growth does not seem to be constrained by capital, liquidity, or funding,” or   whatever the third descriptor was; from Governor Warsh, “credit has turned in the United   States”; from President Lacker, “we have effectively eased”  And then, of course, as was   pointed out just now by President Kocherlakota—that we cannot depend on the Fed to solve all   our problems  He also gave us a good discourse on the Beveridge curve, and that it was unlikely   that monetary policy might shift unemployment because there had been a shift in the Beveridge   curve  And then, lastly, from President Rosengren, “fiscal policy is a more effective tool”   I’m very worried, Mr Chairman, that we are at risk of pushing on a string  We have   done an awful lot  We have earned an enormous amount of credibility  I think we have been   quite effective in what we have done  But I am worried about what signals we send when there   is a question as to how much return we’re going to get from the kind of policy that’s advocated   in alternative B  Will it be only 20 basis points, or 10 basis points, and at a time when there is, as   we have seen through the testimony of people around this table, a significant amount of access to   liquidity?  Not only have rates come down in response to declines in the Treasury rates, but, very   importantly, the spreads have narrowed, so that the issuance calendar for publicly traded   corporations is quite high, and access to capital for those private companies is at least increasing,   not decreasing   August 10, 2010 121 of 160             I’m not a voter this time around  However, I would caution against adopting alternative   B, with paragraph 4 in particular—I know this is a little bit cheeky, but  it will make Bill Gross   happy—and I don’t think it is going to do much in terms of its effectiveness  In fact, it might do   damage to our credibility, particularly if it comes to be viewed as our accommodating the fiscal   authorities, who have to get it right  I think we’re relying far too much on the Federal Reserve in   this case  If anything, we’re taking the pressure off the fiscal authorities to get their stimulative   policies and their regulatory regime correct  Whether or not my reports from the private sector   are sour grapes in terms of random refereeing, the fact is that we do have an inefficient fiscal   response  If we’re going to turn to the Japanese as an example, that’s one of the causes of the   situation they found themselves in  And I would be very hesitant to be an accomplice to not   adopting the most efficient policy possible  And I do not believe that the course of action   recommended in alternative B is the most effective course of action  But, having said that, I   don’t have a vote, and I just wanted to offer those views     Be careful    Well, that’s what it says in the other part    By reinvesting  "
9050,2010-09-21,"  Brian, even though we have been through the August period, any   comments on the issuance calendar and what’s happened in terms of corporate bond spreads,   whether it’s high-quality or B-rated or junk, over Treasuries,?    If I may, I’d like to ask a follow-up about your chart on the 10-year   Treasury yield  Although that’s a very short period, all things being equal, would one have   September 21, 2010 13 of 151             expected, with rates coming down as they have, in part or in whole in response to our last FOMC   decision, that the S&P might have appreciated and the dollar might have depreciated instead of   doing what they did?    And then lastly, is there a way that we can get a reasonable sense,   historically speaking, of the percentage of our Treasury securities in the market?  As I understand   it, we basically come back to levels that we had in terms of Treasury holdings pre-crisis in   absolute dollar amounts  But I’m just curious if, at some point, not necessarily this morning, we   could just get that information    Thank you  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Can I just ask a question quickly of Nathan?  I recall that data indicated   that last year that US FDI abroad was about $248 billion, and FDI in the United States is about   September 21, 2010 26 of 151             half that, $120-some-odd billion  Do we have a sense of how those numbers are tracking this   year?    Thank you    Mr Chairman, I’ll tell a story to frame my comments  Three Texas   Aggies apply to be detectives  The Inspector General lines them up, holds up a picture, and says   to the first one, “What do you see?”  The Aggie replies, “I see a man with one eye”  The   Inspector General says, “Of course you see a man with one eye  It’s a profile”  Then, he holds it   up in front of the second Aggie  He says, “What do you see?”  “I see a man with one ear”    “Well, didn’t you hear what I said to the other fellow?  Of course it’s a man with one ear  It’s a   profile”  And then, he turns to the third, and he holds up the picture  “What do you see?”  “A   contact lens,” replies the Aggie  “What do you mean?”  He said, “He’s wearing a contact lens”    He turns to his assistant and says, “Check the book  Make sure that’s the case”  The assistant   comes back and says, “He’s absolutely right  He’s wearing contact lenses”  He turns to the   Aggie and says, “Well, how could you tell?”  He says, “Well, hello  If he only has one eye and   one ear, he can’t wear glasses”  [Laughter]  Now, why did I tell this story?  I don’t know—it’s   just a great story   I think my job at this table is to round out or flesh out some of the perspectives we’re   getting, so I think it’s very important to listen to the operators of businesses to get a sense of   what they see going forward to supplement and complement the good work done by our staff and   the Board staff, etc  Let me just add parenthetically that I’m not surprised at the downward   revisions  This economic scenario is basically what we’ve been feeling would happen, and I   think it’s implicit in the numbers we have submitted   My District, like others, has seen a slowdown in activity, although I cannot help but brag   that 41 percent of all the goods-producing jobs in America have been created in my District, and   certainly a fifth of all private-sector jobs   September 21, 2010 38 of 151             Let me report to you what I’m hearing from my interlocutors, and, Mr Chairman, you   have that list of who they are, in addition to the dozens of small business operators I talk to  I   want to complement some of the points made by President Pianalto  My interlocutors report a   slight improvement in the tone change from the last pre-FOMC soundings, with the emphasis   being on “slight”  I’m going to mention some names of corporations—some of this is inside   information  We can talk about expunging it from the record, but I think it’s important just to   inform the views  One careful observer, who is the CEO of Wal-Mart, feels that, and I quote,   “Consumers are becoming more resilient, or maybe just more determined to get through this”    And this is confirmed by two of the middle-income quartile retailers that I talked to in “deep   dive,” JC Penney and Michaels  Consumers are opening up their pocketbooks slightly further   but remain extremely sensitive to prices  There is a marginally greater willingness to buy   nonessential items, but only when they’re priced aggressively  And I will add that there was one   odd exception, month to date in September—maybe because of my own coffee consumption—  Starbuck’s has experienced the biggest volume surge in history of the company—clearly a   discretionary, if addictive, expenditure   To a person, my interlocutors report their companies have even better access to credit   than reported before the last FOMC and enjoy abundant liquidity  Texas Instruments’ CFO said   that the request for relaxation of payment terms by their customers has completely disappeared    I hear no reports of lagging receivables from small or large companies  I actually asked Wal-  Mart specifically if it heard any comments or concerns about access to capital from any of its   suppliers, which is a substantial supplier base, and it could think of only one—a very small   company that developed a product to clean up garbage and garage oil spills  And once Wal-Mart   placed an order with it, every community bank in their district was crawling all over them to lend   September 21, 2010 39 of 151             them money  Among those that are creditworthy, I sense an even greater propensity for hoarding   liquidity  Example  Dell said that it only has $15 billion on its balance sheet that it doesn’t see   using in the foreseeable future  Dell recently tapped the markets for another $1 billion “just   because it’s so cheap”  The last time I looked, its market capitalization, by the way, was only   $24 billion  Balance sheets are being actively re-leveraged at lower costs  Cash as a percentage   of market capitalization is at an all-time high  Aggregate asset ratios are at a seven-decade high,   and cash flow from current production is 12 percent above total investment expenditures   economy wide   And yet, as all of us have pointed out, few are willing to commit to expanding US   payrolls, and all continue to cite nonmonetary factors—that is, fiscal, regulatory, etc, and, for   those with a global reach in my sample, better opportunities for ROI elsewhere  To quote one   CEO and to take off on Sandy’s comment, “Part of it is uncertainty We just don’t know what the   new regs are going to cost, what the new rules will be  Part of it is certainty  We know that   taxes are eventually going to have to increase to get us out of the fiscal hole that the Congress   has dug us into”   I want to give you one specific example, which I thought was eye-opening  Going back   to the largest purchaser of food products in the United States, the firm offered to buy an entire   apple crop in Washington  I don’t know if you know about the economics of apples—there’s no   reason for you to know it  But 25 percent of any apple crop is not usable in terms of selling   apples  You make concentrate out of it  Even though this company offered a specific contract   over a multiyear period to this large producer, it would have required building another   processing factory  And despite the guaranteed contract and the attractive pricing of the   purchase, it came back declining to build a new factory, because it couldn’t calculate the cost of   September 21, 2010 40 of 151             workers and the eventual tax load that might be imposed upon the company, and it turned it   down  And guess where the order went?  To Chinese apple producers to produce the   concentrate   All of my interlocutors are focused laser-like on enhancing productivity  For example,   AT&T just held its three-year budgeting meeting last Tuesday  They agreed to budget all capital   expenditures to zero top-line growth over the time horizon, not because they expect zero growth,   but because, in the words of their CEO, they want to force-drive productivity  An entirely   different type of company, 7-Eleven, reported doing the same, by the way, almost verbatim    Indeed, almost all my interlocutors are budgeting similarly to, quote, “get less people to wear   more hats”  Few assign significant probability to a double dip   Among the retailers, most expect growth of top-line revenue to be positive but subpar in   the second half, and then pick up through 2011, though all of my retailers, whether they’re in the   bottom quartile or in the middle two quartiles have experienced a surprising and inexplicable   pickup in activity following back-to-school sales beyond what they were expecting   In all but the bottom-income quartile, their same-store top-line increases year-to-date   through Friday of last week are pretty much evenly divided between price increases and   transactions volumes  This is confirmed by Mastercard’s internal data, and its CEO’s   interpretation confirming the general tone of the reports from my retail sources  Having been   caught short in last year’s holiday season, retailers have cautiously increased inventories but are   very nervous about it  As the CEO of Burlington Northern Santa Fe said, “Either the supply   chain is a leading indicator of a better retail quarter in the fourth quarter, or some very big   disappointments are in the works”   September 21, 2010 41 of 151             On the price front, retailers are reporting rising input prices from imported goods   manufactured in China and from high transocean shipping costs  Milk and grain prices are   increasing  However, as we might expect, they report insufficient, in their words, “pricing   power” and are worried about having their margins squeezed, which provides them another   incentive to maintain share prices by using their cash hoards not to hire new people but to buy in   new shares or to increase dividends   Deflation was not mentioned by a single interlocutor  Monetary policy, even among the   most erudite, is simply not on the radar screens of nonfinancial businesses that I talked to, as   capital is nominally cheap and abundant  Fiscal and regulatory rules issues remain the stuff of   concern in planning for payroll and domestic cap-ex expansion and are thwarting the   transmission mechanism of hiring more workers   So, in summary, Mr Chairman, that’s what I am hearing from my private-sector   interlocutors  I think the concern I have is the transmission mechanism, and I will make some   comments on the efficacy of our policy when we go to the policy round  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    Yes, I did    Thank you for listening, President Lacker  [Laughter]    Mr Chairman, just to take things sort of backwards, first, I’m encouraged   by the desire at this table to discuss a regime change  I think it’s timely  It might be   significantly effective  Some proposals have been put on the table  I read very carefully   President Evans’ paper on price level targeting, although to my knowledge, other than Sweden in   1930, it has never been successfully employed, but I think it is worth discussing  My own staff   seems eager to put together a paper on the possibility of targeting nominal income or nominal   September 21, 2010 116 of 151             spending  I’m not sure I’m convinced that that’s the right approach, but we would be happy to   add to the discussion   I think it’s necessary because these statements that we’re providing are becoming more   and more convoluted and, I think, run the risk of painting us into a corner or of further confusing   the market  So I’m all in favor of your very thoughtful recommendation, and I like Governor   Tarullo’s suggestion that we may not do this only at meetings, but that we may have some   interim stages where we develop this further so that we can do it efficiently   I want to go back very quickly to the implied debate we had earlier in the go-round about   final demand and whether or not government regulations and random refereeing are inhibiting   investment  One factor that is clearly not inhibiting businesses is access to liquidity or the cost   of money  The other thing that is clear is that you can’t have final demand unless you have   consumption, and in a period of high unemployment, you can’t have consumption unless you   have job creation  So I think our objectives are all the same on that front, and I don’t find much   distinction among them   I am concerned that, as we pursue the business of, in essence, subsidizing risk—trying to   lower the premiums by providing accommodation—in the globalized community, we may be, in   fact, subsidizing job creation elsewhere rather than here in the United States  That’s what I’m   hearing from those who hire and those who are utilizing their resources in terms of finding an   ROI elsewhere that is superior, not available in the United States  It’s not clear to me that further   accommodation is going to change that equation  I just wanted to put those points on the table   With regard to the statements, I find myself lining up, not surprisingly, with President   Lacker and President Plosser  I thought that Governor Warsh made a very good suggestion  But   I want to go back to a point that President Lacker made, which is very important, and also pick   September 21, 2010 117 of 151             up on the statement Governor Duke made  Governor Duke said if it’s not clear inside this room,   it won’t be clear outside this room  President Lacker correctly pointed out we have not discussed   what the inflation levels that we agree to at this table in three years  I’m very uncomfortable   with the sentences in paragraph 2 in alternative B where we refer to levels twice even though we   do not have agreement internally as to what they might be  We talk about 1 to 2 percent, around   1½, 17 to 2 percent  We have never had a thorough discussion of that, and I believe we should    I would be uncomfortable with alternative B if we were to reference those levels that the   Committee considers consistent with its mandate  If we haven’t agreed to it internally, I don’t   know how we can convince people externally as to what they might be   I would suggest especially dropping it in paragraph 4  If we were to go in the direction of   alternative B, I would suggest we take into consideration Governor Warsh’s point of substituting   “if” for the word “as,” and I would drop the rest of the sentence and include President   Kocherlakota’s editorial suggestion  Actually, my preference would be just to issue a one-  sentence statement if you want to set up your regime change  “The Committee met and decided   not to change the policy articulated at the last meeting”  Thank you, Mr Chairman    I agree    I don’t want to be too much of a squeaky wheel here, but I notice that   paragraph 2 focuses on it twice  First we’re saying it’s below that which we judge consistent   with our longer-run mandate, and, second, we say “before rising to levels the Committee   considers consistent with its mandate,” even though I don’t believe we have agreed on the levels;   but, ceding that, I think that probably says enough  What bothers me is adding it at the end of   that sentence in paragraph 4  I think that may be overkill, because it is implicit that we’re not   satisfied  But, by having it at the end of paragraph 4, I think it becomes a little bit too explicit    After all, we are saying “is prepared to provide additional accommodation”  I assume we’re   going to substitute the word “if,” which I would recommend, as Governor Warsh did “if needed   to support economic recovery”  We’ve already talked about inflation twice in paragraph 2  And   that’s a change    I think that’s clearly understood by just mentioning it in paragraph 2  It’s   less than subtle in paragraph 2—we mention it twice    Well, I just wanted to make that point    At a minimum, I would at least put the word “if”  President Bullard   mentioned the idea of having two-way conditionality  I think that’s not important  I don’t think   we can quite do it in the way he wanted to, but at least the word “if” indicates that it may not   happen, rather than the confidence that’s expressed with the word “as”  So that would be my   ultimate fallback, if I were negotiating, but I’m not negotiating  I’m just saying that it’s a little   bit too much to add it in all three places, twice in paragraph 2 and once in paragraph 4   I think the jury is still out on us  We have worked very hard to restore confidence  This   may offend people at the table, but I think we’re probably the only government entity that has   any public confidence right now, and I’m just a little bit worried that this confidence is thin and   that, if we press this argument too much, we might send a shiver up the spine of the marketplace    That’s solely my judgment, but I wanted to put it on the table   “As and if needed”   "
9072,2010-10-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  In the third line of the speech that you gave this   morning in Boston, you emphasized that we had “increased independence from short-term political   influences” and that that had historically assisted with the containment of inflation  I welcome this   October 15, 2010 38 of 62             discussion  I thank the Board staff as well as the staff at the Cleveland and Dallas Feds for their   papers, because it seems to me very important now that we also become increasingly independent of   market expectations and, may I add parenthetically, of creating market expectations that we then   have to deliver on   I think it’s good to have a broader framework  Because so much has been said by so many,   all of which are wise words, I’m just going to make a few limited comments  I can do that because I   agree 100 percent with what President Kocherlakota said early in the conversation, not because I   was in Minneapolis last week—he wasn’t there—but because every single one of his arguments   about quantitative easing I think is absolutely on point  I would add one other risk that I think we’re   running with quantitative easing—the risk of front-running being done by large money managers   and perhaps foreign governments in terms of our announced intentions on quantitative easing  I   think it’s a mistake  I think we should stop  The five risks that President Kocherlakota pointed out   are exactly the points that I would have made, and, therefore, I won’t repeat them  Therefore, I’m   certainly in favor of considering a different format for forward guidance   I want to dispense up front with the idea of price-level targeting  I think it would be   confusing to the public  I think the paper from Cleveland gave us some academic underlining of the   risks that we’d be taking if we engaged in price level targeting  I think it would undermine   confidence in the Fed  I think it would also provide a lot of red meat to those who do worry that we   are somehow biased towards inflation and who have yet to develop full confidence in our capacity   to develop an exit strategy  I would just add my support for Mr Hoenig’s point that having a   clearly articulated exit strategy should be part of whatever we decide to do   We did have discussions on inflation targeting quite some time ago, Mr Chairman, at the   very beginning of your tenure, as Mr Lacker pointed out, that were waylaid by the crisis that we   October 15, 2010 39 of 62             faced  One of the difficulties with inflation targeting and being specific, if you recall from the   discussion, was that we had to be sensitive to the fact that we did have a dual mandate  And one of   the issues that I raised at the time was the possibility that, if we did proceed down the path of   inflation targeting, we might then have the Congress ask us to be more specific about our views on   unemployment  I have listened to President Kocherlakota, President Lacker, President Pianalto,   President Hoenig, President Lockhart, and others, point out the risks of being specific with regard to   any statement of what we consider to be an acceptable rate of unemployment   It’s for that reason that the Dallas Fed and Evan Koenig, who is sitting on my left, put   forward a slightly different approach from just having inflation targeting  We put forward the idea   of targeting nominal spending out of respect for the need to be sensitive to the problem of   unemployment (which is the issue we’re trying to address), to the mandate given by the Congress,   and to the impracticability of discussing only inflation targeting and not discussing employment  I   don’t expect my colleagues to accept it, and I’m not sure I accept it, but, for the sake of argument, I   think it’s important just to consider this as an option  By the way, in this proposal, we’re talking   about nominal PCE rather than nominal GDP targeting  The reason is that PCE estimates are   available monthly and they’re subject to smaller revisions  The target path for PCE would very   likely tie down the PCE price index more tightly than would a target path for GDP, and there are   other reasons   Let me give you some sample language that might avoid having to be specific on   unemployment, and it also might even avoid specific mention of inflation targeting  We might say   in a statement that “measures of nominal spending have fallen well short of a path that the   Committee judges consistent with its mandate to promote maximum employment and long-term   price stability  Given the size of the shortfall, the Committee anticipates it will take some time   October 15, 2010 40 of 62             before spending returns to satisfactory levels”  And then, we could go on to say that the Committee   plans to maintain the target range, or whatever wording we decide to use there in terms of what we   plan to do in terms of the forward guidance  My point is that I’m in favor of making an attempt to   capture both of our mandates and doing so in a way that doesn’t raise the concerns that were   expressed by at least five of my colleagues about stating a specific unemployment target, while also   respecting the fact that Congress demands of us that we live up to our dual mandate   With regard to having spoken so strongly against quantitative easing, again, I would just   double underscore and highlight what President Kocherlakota and some of the others mentioned    The difference between large and small adjustments to me is the difference between being hit over   the head with a baseball bat and being hit 20 times by a ruler  The latter may be preferable simply   because you might decide after three whacks of the ruler that things didn’t work and you can   withdraw it  But I do find the entire concept to be very, very troublesome  I have great respect for   President Bullard, but, to me, the idea of buying the entire increment of Treasury issuance would   just put a big red sign in front of the public saying that we’re monetizing the deficits, and I think   that’s a significant mistake  I don’t want to go down that path   With regard to number 4, in terms of the statements, I am in favor, Mr Chairman, of your   having press conferences  You are our leader  You do summarize for us  Some of us dissent on   occasion, and I have been known to dissent on occasion  Some of us disagree and provide different   arguments  I don’t doubt for a minute your ability to pull it together and speak for us as a whole  I   certainly think that would be preferable to the kind of dissonance that we have been having, to   which I may have contributed and to which, by the way, some nonmembers of the FOMC may have   contributed, including some of the people who receive instructions to operate on our behalf   October 15, 2010 41 of 62             So I’m certainly in favor of providing greater clarity, whatever we decide to do  My   preference leans towards alternative 1, with the consideration, perhaps, of including the concept of   nominal spending  And my preference would be for you to help clarify after we issue our   statement, and perhaps before the minutes come out, and certainly for you to use your testimonies   before the Congress for further elucidation   I would just add one other point  This is an urgent situation  The urgency, however, I think   can be overemphasized  I think the urgency is for us to get a new regime and have it clearly   articulated and take the time to formulate it  I go back to a little Latin I tried to work on with   President Pianalto, given her Italian heritage, a long time ago, which is festina lente—I would make   haste slowly in this process  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
9093,2010-11-02,"  Mr Chairman, may I make a comment?    As you know, I feel very strongly about this issue  In 1977 and 1978,   President Carter had a group of three that wrote all of his decision memoranda—Jeff Garten, a   supervisor, and I  By the time we wrote them and got them to him, which was a day after the   economic policy group meetings, everything had been leaked to the press  It was leaked by   either principals or staff  The reason for the leaks was either that they opposed the view or,   frankly, that they just wanted attention—they wanted to be big deals  Now, there were a lot of   problems with the Carter Administration, but this problem, in particular, was incredibly   corrosive and divisive  What I saw firsthand as the Assistant to the Secretary of the Treasury   was that it led to principals literally hating each other at the end of the process   That is not what this institution is all about  I just want to underscore how divisive and   dangerous it can be in undermining the mission of a great institution like this  I hope that   everybody in this room, whether sitting in the back rows or as principals at the table, is most   mindful that this is a precious institution  It is unique in Washington  We can’t undermine it by   this kind of behavior   November 2–3, 2010 7 of 238             On the second issue of people that have close relationships with market participants, I   think of it as akin to insider trading  There are people who do profit  There is one former   Governor who recently visited my Bank when I was gone and who told the staff that the Reserve   Bank Presidents are of no consequence at all to monetary policy, that their views are not   considered, and that this individual—I’ll let you guess who it is—was, in essence, the 18th or   19th member, depending on how many we have, of the FOMC, and the equivalent of a voting   member  He makes money off of us when he talks and sells  If we can’t solve this, then I think   we should seriously look at some kind of firm legal strictures that are equivalent to the   prosecution of insider trading  If people make money off inside knowledge about our decisions,   it’s no different from people who make money off inside information trading securities  In fact, I   think it’s a more grievous abuse   On the issue of speaking for others, here’s exhibit A  In Fed We Trust  This was a   disaster  Whoever spoke to this writer, David Wessel, was duped by the trick that Michelle   carefully warns against and that you refer to in your excellent memo  I got a call from him a   couple of months later saying, “I understand that you changed your vote, that you walked down   the hall, that you came back and talked to the Chairman, and that the Chairman announced the   decision”  You’ll remember that was when I dissented and then decided that I just didn’t feel   that was an appropriate thing to do and that it would undermine the cohesion of the group  He   knew more about what I had said than I did, and I had said it  So somebody who was in this   room reported, and maybe that person isn’t in this room any longer  This goes back to the point I   was trying to make with the Carter experience  “Pride goeth before a fall”  You may get   attention at the time by talking to these people, but all you do is create divisive forces within the   Committee   November 2–3, 2010 8 of 238             On the third matter, I think Janet made a very, very good point  I think we have to be   careful to get the right balance—not to muzzle people, and, at the same time, because we’re no   longer dealing with the fed funds rate, to be very careful not to signal specific levels of, say,   asset purchases or sales  We create market expectations that way  It gets discounted in the   market  We begin to become fearful of disappointing markets, even though I don’t believe this   Committee should ever be fearful of disappointing markets  And we certainly shouldn’t think in   short-term consequences  We are paid to think long-term about the health of our economy  But   I think it could be a worthwhile exercise   I feel most strongly about the first two  And, Mr Chairman, I ask you to be very firm on   these issues  There’s no excuse for insider trading—it’s a criminal offense, and it should not   occur  In terms of speaking to others, or leaking materials from this room, it will do nothing but   wreak havoc with this institution  Thanks    Mr Chairman, can I ask a question?  We talked about the blackout period   being before the meeting  I always assumed the blackout period also ran after the meeting  Can   we have some clarity on that?   November 2–3, 2010 10 of 238              Okay  I don’t know if it’s in your memo, Michelle, but it runs afterwards,   and I think that’s worth observing    I’ll ask a question of Nathan, and then I’d like to ask a question of   Gretchen  Nathan, you report on your surprise at the import numbers  What was the   composition, to the best of our knowledge, or do we know yet?  What does it tell us?  Was it oil   or something else?    Gretchen, I have a question about what we sent out yesterday with the   SEP  I thought there was an interesting result to the question about whether one’s view of the   appropriate policy differed materially from that assumed by the staff in the Tealbook  The result   was 8 to 10  Is that unusual, or is that common?    So there were 8 yes, 10 no  Of course, this is a fairly new process, but   there’s nothing unusual about that balance, or is there?    Thank you  That’s all I wanted to know    Nathan, you mentioned two countries that are sort of leaning towards an   accommodative mode besides us  Japan and the UK  Are there others?  Canada?    Thank you  Thank you, Mr Chairman    When Bill English stands up, it’s noticeable, because he’s so tall    [Laughter]    Even though you’re kneeling now, you’re taller than the rest of us    [Laughter]  Mr Chairman, last Wednesday’s Wall Street Journal quoted you describing the   calibration of monetary policy as akin to putting  As a golfer—although, I must say, not as good   as Governor Warsh or President Lockhart or President Plosser, but much better than President   Evans [laughter]—    —I rather like that analogy  The master putters, like Ben Crenshaw and   Tiger Woods, are surely familiar with the equipment that they use  You talked about tapping    But as they prepare for a high-stakes tournament, they use their and their advisors’ knowledge of   the slope and the shape of the greens, whether it’s Bermuda grass or Bentgrass or other varieties,   even whether the cell structure of the grass is loose or tight, and how it changes and affects the   roll of the ball as the weather changes during the day  And, incidentally, data are maintained on   the putting surfaces of 16,000 golf courses in America by the Golf Superintendents Association    [Laughter]  What these teams do, as we do, is model how these greens perform under different   circumstances  But, in the end, the roll and the speed that the pros employ when they’re actually   approaching a putt depends on the real conditions at the time of play  And any of them will tell   you that the key to successful putting is the ability to feel or read the green according to the   conditions that prevail as they approach their putt   In the first go-round of our meetings, I try to give you and the Committee a reading on   the prevailing conditions as we approach a decision  All of us have forecasts based on FRB/US   or some other model—I don’t think I can add much there  Nor do I detect much tolerance for   Texas bragging at this table—we created 41 percent of all the goods-producing jobs this year   [laughter] and 26 percent of all nonagricultural jobs in America year to date  Therefore, I’ll   endeavor to give you a reading on the conditions on the greens, according to the experience of   the CEOs and CFOs and market operators who are playing the course—you have the list of my   31 interlocutors for this meeting  For our new Governor, these are not just in my District; these   are worldwide, though mostly in the United States  Here’s a summary of what they report   In general, my contacts report that more things are moving in the right direction than in   the wrong direction  None speak of the double-dip risk in the United States, and none are   November 2–3, 2010 58 of 238             budgeting to deflation  Bottom lines are healthy, but top-line sales and demands are not moving   enough to give satisfaction  Conditions are improving slightly, but continually, and are expected   to continue to do so   Based on data from the rails, shippers, express shippers, retailers, and the spending pulse   data assembled by MasterCard through yesterday morning, none of which has been reported   publicly yet, that activity picked up year over year in October and was slightly better than the   year-over-year pace of September  They report October’s year-over-year gain to be 2½ percent   versus September’s year-over-year gain of 13 percent  Looking forward, one who doesn’t mind   his name being quoted, Fred Smith of Federal Express, expects domestic Christmas season sales   to record a year-over-year improvement of between 2½ to 3 percent  And, by the way, parents   among you will be pleased that the nation’s largest candy retailer, Walmart, reported an   8 percent pickup year over year in sales for the holiday season, so we can expect at least the   dental profession will have a jump in fillings   Our contacts report price pressures for a range of commodities—from corn and higher-  grade food oils to cotton to pulp and, of course, metals and gold used in manufacturing,   including semiconductors—nothing that we don’t already know from reading the financial press    But I did find it of interest that one of my CEO contacts, who had just come back from meeting   with all 450 of his Chinese suppliers, reported that the Chinese government was encouraging   wage increases of 15 to 20 percent to boost domestic spending and putting that into their five-  year plan  Combining wage imperatives with commodity price increases, the manufacturers of   low-tech Chinese products—from wicker to clothing to the lower end of the entertainment   machines that this particular customer buys—have started their bids for supplying the fall of   2011 with requests for 30 percent increases from the current level  Alternative production sites,   November 2–3, 2010 59 of 238             like Vietnam and India, according to the source, were only slightly underbidding those numbers,   which may mean a shift to sourcing low-value-added goods back to Mexico or a squeeze on   profit margins from those sourcing from China, Vietnam, and India  No one I talked to feels that   currently they have pricing wherewithal to pass on these cost increases of more than, say   2 percent, and yet none of my interlocutors feel that inflation is likely to drift downward   This is in keeping, incidentally, with our trimmed mean calculation at the Dallas Fed    Several of you have been nice enough to mention it; let me just correct the misimpression  The   trimmed mean PCE inflation rate actually tells a different story from that told by the core PCE    The trimmed mean came in at a 10 annualized rate in September, compared with an annualized   rate of 13 percent in August  The numbers for those two months are both above the rates we   saw early in 2010, and the 12-month trimmed mean rate has been steady over the last six months,   within 01 percentage point of 1 percent, and actually precisely 1 percent for the past three   months  If the trimmed mean is a better gauge of the underlying trend in PCE inflation—of   course, believing in Texas exceptionalism, we believe it is—then it’s not too surprising that the   core PCE should be moving down towards the lower and steadier trimmed mean rate  The   message the trimmed mean is sending is consistent with the bottom line we’ve drawn in the past   couple of inflation updates  The underlying trend in inflation appears for the time being to be   holding steady, albeit at a rate typical of the 1950s rather than at the rate we’ve become   accustomed to since then   Without pricing power and in the face of anemic demand, all of my nonfinancial business   contacts, large and small, public and private, continue to protect their margins through   productivity enhancement and to take advantage of ready access to cheap money to refinance   their balance sheets, pay dividends, or buy their stock if they are public  Some of the larger ones   November 2–3, 2010 60 of 238             report borrowing domestically in size and warehousing those funds so as to avoid having to   repatriate funds building up abroad  A few—and this is good news—are using cheap money to   refinance their remaining pension obligations in light of unsustainable discount factors used for   accounting purposes   Almost all the businesses I talked to are expanding investment in productivity   enhancement  Even Wal-Mart plans to open more stores in the US, but at the same time plans   to reduce, for the second year in a row, its number of US employees  As I’ve reported before,   almost all the large companies I talked to report little interest in hiring American workers or   committing to large-scale cap-ex here  They believe that their potential for ROI is greater   elsewhere  The smaller companies that do not have global options are not hiring until the coast   is clear on the tax and regulatory fronts, as we’ve heard for some time at this table  This   hesitancy intensified during the final innings of the election season, and your guess is as good as   mine as to whether this will be relieved by the new Congress or compounded by it   Nonfinancial and financial companies alike report that they are flush with liquidity    Bankers are aggressively courting the larger corporate credits  Several reported to me that, in the   last few weeks, the Big Four have “literally been begging us to lend money for 10 years at less   than 3 percent”  Corporate debt markets are robust, including junk markets  Smaller companies   are not complaining about a lack of access to capital  As a special part of our monthly Texas   manufacturing survey, I had our staff ask questions of 240 companies about credit availability    Only 109 percent of the 60 percent who were seeking credit responded that they were having   substantial or extreme difficulty obtaining financing for long-term expenditures, and only   63 percent of the 55 percent that were seeking short-term credit—let me repeat that only   55 percent were seeking short-term credit—responded that they were having substantial or   November 2–3, 2010 61 of 238             extreme difficulty  To be sure, this is specific to the 11th District, but you may have noted in the   ISI Group report of October 26 on the various Federal Reserve Bank surveys that the Dallas   Fed’s business activity index has the highest correlation of all to the PMI, so our survey may   have some credence   It concerns me, Mr Chairman, that liquidity is so omnipresent on bank and corporate   balance sheets, and yet is not being put to work to hire American workers  Last week’s Lipper   data show year-to-date portfolio flows into virtually all asset classes except money market funds    The flow is strong into every category from high-risk to low-risk bond vehicles, taxable,   nontaxable, domestic, and external, fixed and floating rate, and, of course, commodities  Junk   yields are at their lowest level since October of 2007  Margin debt remains shy of the 2007   highs, but is fast approaching levels that prevailed before the Nasdaq implosion in 2001  And   margin account debit balances, as a percentage of market capitalization, now exceed the pre-  crash levels of 1987 and 2001  And the LBO market is back to paying 2006 multiples of   EBITDA, between 6 and 8½ times  The recent announcement of Carlyle’s purchase of   Syniverse, at 10 times, echoes the peak of the pre-crash craze  As you know, buyout people do   not typically buy companies with a plan to expand their workforce, but rather they plan to tighten   operations, drive productivity, rejigger balance sheets, and provide an attractive payback in a   shorter term than normal corporate horizons  And those corporations I have talked to that are   eyeing possible acquisitions with their surplus cash and ready access to credit markets, are not   given to thinking of strategic acquisitions as a way to expand payrolls  In sum, Mr Chairman,   and to kill the golf analogy, the greens are playing very fast  We need to be very careful in how   we calibrate our next putt, lest we overdo it and roll right off the green into a trap  Thank you,   Mr Chairman   November 2–3, 2010 62 of 238              On that subject—    Our Vice Chairman owes me a beer, and I owe several cases of beer to   the First Vice President of the San Francisco Fed  [Laughter]    First, I wish to weigh in with Governor Warsh regarding the 35 percent  I   think you can handle this, by the way, by saying “up to” when we talk about the amounts we’re   going to invest; for example, “up to an additional $600 billion,” “up to $850 to $900 billion,” “up   to $110 billion,” and then you can also say that, on occasion, the Desk might move above   35 percent  There’s a way to word this other than by waving a red flag in front of people    Echoing Kevin’s last point, it doesn’t take an agile mind to take $110 billion, multiply it by 12 to   annualize it, and, voilà, it comes out to $13 trillion, which is the amount of the deficit  So it   looks as if we’re monetizing the deficit, and I think you have to be mindful of that  Sophisticated   November 2–3, 2010 119 of 238             people may be able to sort this out, but it’s not only sophisticated people who are going to read   it   Second—and you were very conscious of this; you and I talked about this off line—you   have to be extremely careful that people don’t “front run” our intentions  Even though we may   not give a specific number, by saying we’ll move above 35 percent, the game is going to be   trying to figure out where we’re going to move above 35 percent when you do  I think there’s a   way to editorialize this, and we can talk about that a little bit later   I have a question, Mr Chairman, and I have a statement disguised as a question    I just want to understand this in plain English—I’m referring to panels 4,   5, and 6 in Brian’s handout  Let’s say the Chairman is called before the Senate Banking   Committee at the end of 2012 and is asked, “Do you have a loss or do you have a gain on this   portfolio?”  What’s the answer?  Under the assumptions given here, did you make money or did   you lose money with the strategy that your Committee has adopted?    Go right ahead  You’ve laid out the sensitivities  Let’s assume that rates   are up 100 basis points under alternative B  What’s the answer?    So rates have gone up 100 basis points  We have an unrealized loss, but   the income outstrips the loss—is that correct?    By how much?   November 2–3, 2010 120 of 238              And, of course, if rates go up higher than 100 basis points, it’s less    Got it    Sure, particularly where we’re further out on the curve    Thank you    We’re trying to reassure people we are not going to go hog wild    First, let me say that I was pleased with the comments made yesterday by   Board Vice Chairperson Yellen, especially those regarding the importance of listening during   these conversations and not making prejudgments  At the same time, I listened very carefully to   what you were saying yesterday, Mr Chairman  I understand the direction that we are headed in    I would ask that we do listen to each other very carefully here, and I would like to say that I am   deeply concerned about proceeding with further quantitative easing  I understand the logic  The   goal is to drive down longer-term interest rates in hopes of stimulating loan demand, offsetting   the propensity I reported on earlier for economic actors to hoard rather than invest  Another   desired benefit, as you outlined it yesterday, Mr Chairman, is to devalue the dollar to stimulate   demand for our exports—and I don’t think we should ever say that publicly  And to one of you   that I discussed this matter with, and whom I hold in the highest regard, it implies that we would   also help ward off protectionism  The ultimate objective, of course, is to advance final demand   and general employment for American workers, and to promote output growth   November 2–3, 2010 150 of 238             We are indeed in a liquidity trap or a bog, as Governor Tarullo says  We already have   low interest rates, and spreads against risk-free instruments are historically narrow  Variations in   interest rate levels are clearly not driving loan demand  Loans are desirable and businesses   borrow when they see an opportunity for a return on investment  Even at the low rates that   already prevail, businesses lack confidence in the prospect of earning a superior ROI by   investing so as to expand their domestic workforce, in comparison to what they might earn from   alternative investments abroad or by buying in their stock or cleaning up their balance sheets    Consumers borrow when they believe it makes sense to shift consumption forward  But after the   sobering experience of the last three years, they are inhibited from doing so by a lack of   confidence that their income streams in the future will be sufficient to cover their payment   obligations   On the supply side, we know that businesses are floating on a sea of liquidity  Banks   already hold over $1 trillion in excess reserves with us  Their holdings of government securities   as a percentage of their total assets are growing, as pointed out by Governor Duke in her   comments yesterday  Loans, as a percentage of assets, are declining  If we had a level of bank   reserves or liquidity in the marketplace that was binding or inhibiting loan growth, I could   understand the impulse to relieve that stricture  Incidentally, I hope we can succeed, as you   indicated, in getting away from the expression “QE,” but I doubt it   I have no doubt that asset purchases will increase the level of bank reserves, they will   lower rates marginally in the short term, and they will add more liquidity to the markets,   meanwhile weakening the dollar  The question for me is whether this works to the benefit of job   creation for American workers and helping those most in need  You spoke in Jackson Hole, Mr   Chairman, of the need to weigh the costs and benefits of further accommodation  Yesterday you   November 2–3, 2010 151 of 238             expanded upon that, and you acknowledged some of the costs  But, like President Lacker and   President Plosser and his referencing President Hoenig just now, I’m skeptical about many of the   presumed benefits of further QE  However, I’m certain of some of the costs  One cost will be   the risk of placing our quasi-independence in jeopardy  We know that once a central bank is   perceived as targeting government debt yields at a time of persistent budget deficits, the concern   about debt monetization quickly raises its ugly head  I expect the propensity to draw that   conclusion has been enhanced by this congressional election  Indeed, I believe that if the   statement we discussed with Brian is unedited, we would be waving a red flag in the face of   those who are our most volatile critics   I realize that there are two other countries that are engaging in quantitative easing  As   you know, I just don’t buy the analogy between the US and Japan  Let me give you a statistic,   not for humor but to put this is in perspective  More adult diapers are sold in Japan than   children’s diapers  It’s an aging society that is in no way comparable with the United States  So   the QE that I look at is that of the Bank of England  But Governor King is offsetting the QE with   an announced fiscal policy tightening that out-Thatchers Thatcher  That is not the case here—  here, we suffer, just to stay with my diaper analogy, from fiscal incontinence  If this were to   change, then I would make a case for accommodation, but that is not yet happening  And by   providing monetary accommodation, I would suggest we are reducing the odds of fiscal   discipline being brought to bear   I also see a risk of quantitative easing being accepted as the new normal  Everything we   know from monetary history tells us that, in times of crisis, we should open the flood gates  That   is Bagehot 101  We did that  It worked to pull us from the maw of financial panic and economic   ruin  But this is neither a time of panic nor is it a time of emergency  If we were to come to be   November 2–3, 2010 152 of 238             perceived as applying QE as part of our normal policy toolkit, I’m willing to bet that the markets   will expect more, as was referred to earlier  And, by the way, Nouriel Roubini is not alone in   predicting QE3 and QE4  Quantitative easing is like kudzu for market operators—you’re   familiar with this analogy because you’re a southerner, Mr Chairman—it grows and it grows   and it may be impossible to trim off once it takes root in the minds of market operators   I might understand the case for accommodation if serious deflation were a clear and   present danger  It is not, as I pointed out yesterday by citing the trimmed mean and by giving   my anecdotal reports  I should add that, thanks to your leadership, Mr Chairman, and the   support of this Committee in engineering the liquidity measures implemented during the panic of   2008-2009, and by avoiding the policy errors of the 1930s, serious deflation has not happened—  neither M2 growth nor inflation has fallen off the cliff  And while nominal growth is less than   desired—I have actually trimmed back my estimates for the next several years—and is very   painful, nominal income is growing, however, incrementally  It’s not shrinking   I’m skeptical about the purported benefits of a weaker dollar in exchange markets  Much   of what we export is in the form of high-yield goods and services and in commodities like   soybeans, for example, which we produce with enormous efficiency  As Nathan pointed out, the   recent statistics indicate that much, though certainly not all, of what we import is used to clothe   and support lower-income earners, the very people who are suffering from high unemployment   and lack of job creation, whom we endeavor to help as part of our dual mandate   The Walmarts, the Dollar General Stores, the Costcos, the Michaels, and other stores   where the most affected people buy necessities are faced with a further squeeze on their margins,   and they will likely react to higher import prices by driving productivity even harder, which   means selling more while employing even fewer workers  As to warding off protectionism, from   November 2–3, 2010 153 of 238             what I’ve learned about that dynamic by serving as the Deputy US Trade Representative, much   depends on the skills of the Chief Executive and congressional leadership  And when push   comes to shove, Presidents and good congressional leaders tend to steer the Congress away from   its baser instincts  Dollar depreciation, however, if viewed as a deliberate intention of US   government policy, will work against us in terms of the rules-based system we have at the WTO   and other rules that we have to limit the potential damage of protectionism   As to the proposition that higher prices of financial assets will liberate those most in   need, I wonder if this is, indeed, true  We’re already seeing the beginnings of speculative   activity in stocks and bonds and commodity markets and buyouts, and the rich are getting richer    Woody Allen said once that being rich beats being poor  Well, that’s true  It’s not funny,   however, and I find no delight in it, and I see considerable risk in conducting policy with the   consequence of transferring income from the poor, those most dependent on fixed income and   the saver, to the rich  Senior citizens and others who saved and played by the rules are earning   nothing on their savings, while big debtors and too-big-to-fail oligopoly banks benefit from their   subsidy  Now, outside of monarchies, I know of no democratic system, and certainly no   President on the right or the left, who would tolerate that kind of policy, let alone advocate it    And I expect a reaction against it that might lead to political retribution against us   Then, there’s the issue of exit policy  The more we engage in quantitative easing that   moves us further out the yield curve and the more we load our balance sheet with price-sensitive   assets, the greater the likelihood of our realizing a loss on our holdings  So I ask you to consider   the prospect of appearing before a House Banking Committee in, say, 2013, to report that the   central bank of the United States has generated a loss—this is a tail risk, but I think we need to   consider it  We believe the loss is not likely to happen  We believe, according to Brian’s   November 2–3, 2010 154 of 238             excellent briefing—and, by the way, we appreciate what you do even though we beat up on you   so often—that we can cover losses through the stream of income  But there should be some   more sensitivity analysis done on this front and not just a single point analysis of a 100 basis   point reversal   The Committee might consider that we could be prescribing the wrong medicine for the   ailment that our economy is suffering  Liquidity and abundant money are not the binding   constraints on economic activity  The binding constraints are uncertainty about income and   future aggregate demand, the disincentives fiscal and regulatory policies impose on   decisionmakers, and the reluctance, given those disincentives, of employers to create jobs for our   American people  The remedy for what ails the economy is in the hands of the regulatory and   the fiscal authorities, not the Federal Reserve, and throwing another $600 billion to $1 trillion at   the economy to see if it will generate a spark in the engine of the economy is, in my mind, a   questionable tactic  We are uncertain that it will lead to behavior that creates jobs or spurs final   demand  We can be certain that it will lead to a declining dollar that will encourage further   speculation, that it will promote commodity hoarding, that it will accelerate the transfer of wealth   from the deliberate saver and the unfortunate to the more well-off, and that it will place at risk   the independence of this great institution   Therefore, Mr Chairman, I respectfully recommend that we not engage in any further   quantitative easing, regardless of market expectations that we have created through our public   statements  Now, I expect the Committee will decide that the benefits of further accommodation   outweigh the costs that I have outlined  And, like the Texas Rangers, I will be gracious in defeat    However, I do ask that we leave some room for adjustment in this endeavor in the case of an   adverse reaction  I have some editorial suggestions  If you decide to adopt alternative B—and I   November 2–3, 2010 155 of 238             want to record that I am firmly against it—I’d first reiterate my suggestion regarding Brian’s   statement; specifically, to keep the markets from front-running us, I’d suggest using the phrase   “up to” before the term “$600 billion” or “$75 billion,” or whatever the number is in A or B   I would also suggest that, in paragraph 3 of B, we change the words as follows  Keep   “To promote a stronger pace of economic recovery,” because, after all, that’s what we are trying   to do—we’re trying to increase employment and decrease unemployment  But then strike “and   to return inflation, over time, to levels consistent with its mandate,” and say instead “while   maintaining the firm commitment to keep inflation within levels consistent with its mandate”  I   would do the same in the first sentence in paragraph 5, after it says “to support the economic   recovery”  I would say, “…and to maintain inflation within levels consistent…”  The reason for   that is that I’m a firm believer in the dual mandate, but I know that it’s not just people of Tea   Party inclination, but very serious critics, like Paul Volcker and others, who worry that we might   overemphasize one mandate at the expense of the other  I’m a believer in the dual mandate, but I   think we have to be mindful of the fact that there is a fear in the marketplace that there might be   inflationary consequences of our actions  Emphasizing twice that we will maintain inflation   “within levels consistent with our mandate” is the way to word it   Returning to Brian’s statement, in the first paragraph I would recommend “up to” an   additional $600 billion, and “up to” $850 to $900 billion, and “up to” $110 billion per month  In   terms of your 35 percent rule, I’d say that the Desk may be allowed, on occasion, to move above   35 percent  The reason for that is to keep the market slightly on its toes and to prevent front-  running, and to give us a little leeway  I also would like the “up to” phrase in there, because   otherwise we’re binding next year’s Committee  That may be something some desire to do, but I   don’t think it is the proper thing to do  Thank you, Mr Chairman    November 2–3, 2010 156 of 238              “While maintaining its firm commitment to keep inflation within levels   consistent…”  I think that would be reassuring to the marketplace and also reassuring to our   critics, who, I think, are going to turn up the volume    I think that’s better than what we have  And “to help ensure” is the   operative phrase   November 2–3, 2010 200 of 238              That would be an improvement    Could you read it, Mr Chairman?    Mr Chairman, could you read paragraph 3 as it now stands?    I trust you to be very careful here in the way you word it, because, again,   it can be a spark that incites the people who are quite critical of us  You mentioned that some   November 2–3, 2010 209 of 238             very smart people are concerned about inflation and about whether we’re opening that door  So   just be careful, that’s all  "
9119,2010-12-14,"  Brian, margin debt continues to rise to an extraordinarily high level  I’m   curious as to how you interpret that, from the standpoint of the Desk  Are we getting a signal   that we have excess, or is it just bringing it up to modern times?    The focus has been on the absolute number, but the absolute number—  whatever it is, 300 or so—relative to where we are in terms of the depth and breadth of the   financial market is not yet worrisome, is that correct?    Thank you    Can I ask one more?    On Dennis’s point on chart 3  For what it’s worth, I don’t consider this a   bad thing  You remember, Brian, you and I went through the dealer survey that was conducted   December 14, 2010 11 of 127             in November because I had some questions about whether it provided the right balance, and I can   see where people would conclude a larger number of differences to that survey  But the fact is   that we’ve reached a decision, with all the debate that took place and all of the post-meeting   commentary, and I’m not surprised that there’s a narrowing of the distribution  We’re back to   $600 billion, which is what the decision was  My question—and we can talk about this off   line—is  Were any changes made to the way the dealer survey is conducted to reflect a balanced   view or to throw them off guard in terms of expectation?    To keep them guessing    My point, Mr Chairman, is that we’ve achieved greater definition, and I   don’t consider that to be a bad thing  We could dispute the cause of the backup in rates—  obviously there are many different variables here  But I just wanted to point out that, since   people might refer to this chart in their discussions of policy, this is not necessarily a bad thing   from my point of view    Right    I imagine this will get some—forgive me for mentioning this—political   attention  We just need to explain it in plain English, because my guess is this will be one of the   actions that comes out of this meeting that is different from what we have done before  It might   get more attention  I would rather just pay the price for a nine-month or a longer-term extension,   because we are likely to renew it  Of course, it is obvious we should explain this in the simplest   terms to that audience regarding the low nature of the risk that is involved  So if we are going to   get some criticism from some of the people that like to criticize us, I would rather just lock it in   now than do it in bits and pieces  That would be my opinion    Be careful with your answer, because the questioner has a Spanish son-in-  law    Mr Chairman, let me cite my favorite economist, myself  [Laughter]  I’ll   read from my last intervention at the last FOMC  “My contacts report more things are moving in   the right direction than in the wrong direction  None speak of the double-dip risk in the United   States, and none are budgeting to deflation  Bottom lines are healthy  Conditions are improving   slightly, but continually, and are expected to continue to do so”  I’m going to spare you a   protracted recitation of my soundings    Thank you  I am, however, going to say that uniformly there has been a   shift in tone  If anything, I would take out the word “slightly” from the recitation I just gave    One sector is an exception, namely, the rails, because you always have a downturn at this time of   the year—it’s a seasonal adjustment  But, otherwise, to a person, my interlocutors are seeing   improved confidence in final demand  According to my retailer contacts, airlines, express   December 14, 2010 34 of 127             shippers, IT firms, and manufacturers of household products, household spending, including   discretionary spending, is expanding   One of the key indicators I like to look at is mall traffic  No one has to go to a mall  You   don’t have to buy anything out of necessity at a mall  The last seven weeks we have seen growth   in mall traffic  It’s reflected in MasterCard’s internal data, which, again, I like to remind people   is confidential, but we have developed a relationship of going through and parsing that data and   reading the entrails  November retail sales, ex-auto, ex-gas, year over year, were up 52 percent   versus 27 percent in October and 13 percent in the third quarter  So there appears to be a   pickup in final sales, and that is new data and unlike the slight pickup that I reported earlier    There seems to be improved confidence  I fully suspect you’re going to hear that from the   Business Roundtable and others who are going to be making these pronouncements shortly   In talking to my interlocutors, none see a real threat of deflation  While they maintain   they do not have the power yet to price more aggressively, they would like to, Charlie, but they   don’t yet have it  We know from the recent data they are even more flush with liquidity than   they were before  They are beginning to put some of it to work, primarily to drive productivity   enhancement, though some, Mr Chairman, are beginning to report and budget for payroll   expansion   Anecdotal input from my contacts, triangulated with the work of our research staff, leads   me to think that the Board staff is underestimating economic growth for 2011, though   unemployment, I think, will remain sticky despite a pickup in the desire to hire  And it strikes   me that we will see growth in the first quarter and second quarter 2011 close to 4 percent, with   inflation remaining slightly under the wire of 2 percent  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Governor Raskin just sort of took the words   right out of my mouth  I am not a fan of QE2, as you know  I would balk at expanding it  I see   no economic justification, and I think it would be politically suicidal to do so  That’s a little bit   less erudite and academic than your presentation, President Kocherlakota, but I’m happy not to   hear anybody advocate for alternative A  I was going to suggest that, if they were, they had been   living on Pluto and then I’d remind them that Pluto is no longer part of the official planetary   system  [Laughter]   At the same time, I think it would be a mistake to pare it back at this juncture  The strong   economic growth that my staff and I envision has not yet been confirmed by the data, and I think   December 14, 2010 102 of 127             correcting course after making the very tough decision that we made at the last meeting would   make us look extremely indecisive and make us quite vulnerable   Now, I want you to bear with me for a minute here because I’m sympathetic to many of   the arguments that President Hoenig and others have made  At the last meeting I attempted to   provide a sober assessment of the possible costs that should at least be considered alongside the   surmised benefits of the LSAP, and I expressed skepticism about what likely happened on the   foreign exchange front and warned about speculative activity in stocks and commodities  I   believe I used the term “monetary kudzu,” something that would be very difficult to cut back   long term, and I concluded that we could possibly be prescribing the wrong medicine at the   wrong time given the economic circumstance   But the most worrisome to me, as I stated, was the cost of possibly placing our   quasi-independence in jeopardy, and I said that we know that once the central bank is perceived   as targeting government debt yields at a time of persistent budget deficits, the concern about debt   monetization quickly raises its ugly head, and I went on to say I expect the propensity to draw   that conclusion has been enhanced by this congressional election—that we’d be waving a red   flag in the face of those who are our most volatile critics  So I wasn’t surprised, Governor Duke,   at the reaction that we received   Now, I made my best arguments  The Committee decided to pursue a course  There   were others who made similar arguments, but the Committee made a decision  When I was an   undergraduate I was disappointed not to receive a scholarship, and a friend of mine, who became   a well-known folk singer named Tom Rush, gave me a great lecture about making the best of a   bad situation  I’ll summarize it and clean it up a little bit, but I think it gets to the point   December 14, 2010 103 of 127             He told me a story about a neighbor who would go to work every morning, very diligent,   and 10 minutes after he left, the milk truck would pull up and the neighbor’s wife would come   out in her kimono, and the milk truck driver would kiss her on the cheek and go into the house   and come out two hours later  It bothered the heck out of Mr Rush, so he went up to his   neighbor, and he said, “You know, it’s none of my business, but I want you to know what’s   going on”  And the neighbor said, “Well, yeah, but look at it this way  We’ll never run out of   milk or cottage cheese or yogurt”   I think we need to make the best of this situation  The people who did voice concern   mainly were coming not from theory, but from the marketplace or from the real economy    Remember that, in theory, theory and reality are the same, but in reality they’re not the same, and   we have to be driven by the reality that we hear from people who come from financial market   backgrounds or from the real economy or from the Districts  I hope that one byproduct of   making the best of the situation is weighing very carefully the input from the Banks and the   Districts, as well as the theory that we try to put into practice   I would also say that we must not make the situation worse  I do believe we are   politically vulnerable  I listened very carefully to the comments you all made recently, and   there’s a subtext there  I think we have to be very careful about what we say, and I think we   need to unify as a team  Otherwise those who mean us harm will take advantage of the   cacophony that comes out of this Committee  I confess that I may have been part of that   cacophony  I haven’t said a word publicly since November 8, and there’s a reason for it  Once   we make a decision as a Committee, I think we have to knit together and get our message very   clear  Of course, we should allow dissent, and I may well dissent in the future  But knitting   together and being very clear about our message are important because there are a lot of people   December 14, 2010 104 of 127             just looking for opportunities to tear us apart, and I think there’s going to be a great proclivity for   that, particularly going forward politically   So, in summary, Mr Chairman, if I were a voter, I would support alternative B  I’m   sympathetic a little bit to the comment about the $600 billion, but the $600 billion is already in   there  Having looked at the chart we were given earlier by the Desk, if we took the $600 billion   out and just talked about $75 billion, I think we’d see that number all over the place in terms of   expectations  As others have mentioned, I do take it seriously when you say that we’ll regularly   review the pace of the securities purchases and the overall size of the asset purchase program  I   learned earlier today that Bill Dudley and I had the same dreams when we were kids  We both   wanted to be physicists, believe it or not, and I do believe in the physical principle of—    We both would have been a disaster  But I do believe in stochastic   optimal control, and what that means in terms of a rocket launch is that you continually   reevaluate the course you’re going through time, and I take the Committee at its word that we   will do so  But for now, Mr Chairman, to change course and not embrace alternative B I think   would be a serious mistake, and I hope that all of us, including myself, in terms of our future   expression are able to convey the seriousness with which these decisions are made and support   the Committee as a whole, even if we are tempted to dissent and even though at times we are   uncomfortable with the decision that’s made  Thank you, Mr Chairman    There’s a big space in between though   December 14, 2010 105 of 127            "
9145,2011-01-25,"  I’d like to pick up on Tom’s point  It’s not just what’s said in the   meeting; it’s also very importantly the materials that were prepared for the meeting  I’m not a   lawyer, as you know, so I view this as a sort of housekeeping issue—it’s restating an ethic, and   the ethic is that we do our utmost to maintain confidentiality of things that others might profit   from or otherwise use improperly  I think you basically know what it is and know what it’s not    To me, this is just an updating—for example, we had to update the word Greenbook to Tealbook    We worked a lot on this, but the more I thought about it, the more it seemed to me that this is just   a housekeeping matter and that we need to bring it into the modern era, particularly given the   kind of scrutiny we’re getting  I wouldn’t read too much into it beyond the fact that we clearly   have an ethic here which I think (1) needs to be preserved and (2) needs to be as pristine as   possible  How you put a precise legal definition on that is probably beyond my capacity    In the last table, it’s not clear to me whether those are our NAIRUs—or   what are those numbers?    I would caution you that it depends on what your thinking was pre-crisis   versus post-crisis  For example, a lot of our thinking in Dallas has been conditioned by   questioning the basic principle of the NAIRU because of globalization in terms of workforce   capacity and the willingness of people to hire and where they wish to hire  So, the Dallas Fed   indicates a minimal increase in the NAIRU, but we’ve been thinking about it this way for years,   before the crisis  The work you’ve done is great, and this has been an illuminating discussion,   but I just wanted to know what this table is purporting to show, and I would caution you against   reading too much into the table    Well, that was his point  Well-summarized    I have asked the same question  I think the answer is that employers find   lower-wage workers outside the domestic workforce  So that’s the release valve  Nobody wants   to say, “Well, you know, I’m willing to pay someone a substantial fraction of what we paid them   before”  It’s socially unacceptable, and it’s not necessary, because they have options  This is   what globalization is all about  So I think it is effected by looking to other workforces    Maybe it’s not the world we want, but that’s the world that we live in    Whether you like the social philosophy or not is not the issue  It’s a question, Mr Chairman, it   seems to me, of another source of friction, but you have pointed out that this is just one source of   friction  If you are trying to allocate capital, it affects the capital allocation decision  That’s the   simple point that I’ve been trying to make    Excuse me, Brian, can you explain “old bonds”?  Is it in terms of price   gains over book value?  Or does “old” mean that we bought them some time ago?    Actually, I have a statement, Mr Chairman, because I want to thank   Brian and Bill English for pulling together that memo  I don’t know how many people read it   thoroughly  It’s a subject I have been pestering you about for a long time, and I know it has been   an annoyance  But I learned a great deal from it, in addition to the exhibit you just presented  It   does condition our deliberations; for example, if we decided to have more rapid asset sales   combined with an adverse interest rate scenario, it might result in nonremittances to the Treasury   for quite an extended period  So I want to thank you and your staffs for putting this together  I   think it’s a very important memo   January 25–26, 2011 57 of 282              The other point I would make is that it’s the kind of memo I wish we had had before we   entered into the program, in that it would have informed our decisionmaking  Sensitivity   analysis is so critical in understanding the consequences of what you do  And when you commit   to buy $125 trillion worth of any asset, it is helpful to have this kind of analysis in place  I   gather you have had to build this from the ground up, almost from CUSIP up  It’s great work,   and, at least from this corner of the table, much appreciated  I’m sure it is by everybody, and I   want to thank you    Brian and I have talked a great deal  This is a very complicated piece of   work—there are so many moving parts—and I don’t recall, at least in my six years, something   this thorough  But, of course, the programs have changed, the way we conduct monetary policy   has changed  Even though we have had work like this before, I still think this group deserves a   big pat on the back, because this was a very difficult exercise  I don’t know how many hours   you spent on this  I’m trying to impart a compliment, Mr Chairman  I think Brian needs   compliments every now and then    Good    I’d like to ask a question about exhibit 7, the bottom right-hand corner,   and, in particular, about commodity prices  First, it’s uncanny that both lines moved straight to   the right  Also, I’m curious to know what your nonfuel index is based on  You may have   mentioned it    Okay  Would you kindly mention it?    So it’s more model-based and it uses futures curves to the extent we have   them   January 25–26, 2011 89 of 282               And we know the record of futures curves    I point that out    Very good  I have just a couple of points  First, for certain key industrial   commodities, such as iron ore and so on, I wouldn’t underestimate the impact of the Australian   floods  The backup in shipping and the short-term price pressures that seem to be emerging on   that front are extraordinary  Second, I still wonder about the substitution effects; maybe this   could be the subject of another conversation  I’m not talking about physical demand, which, one   would assume, will grow over time as the economies improve and as China moves up the food   chain, and so on  I’m talking more about demand that’s financially driven  For example, if I put   on my old hat as an investor, right now I’d be looking for greater returns on my portfolio  Of   course, the US stock market has done brilliantly, but, with my surplus liquidity, I’d be tempted   to look to, say, Brazil or Russia with at least a portion of my portfolio  As these countries erect   more capital barriers—and the Brazilians have been a bit active here—a perfect substitute for   Brazil, if you plot the two markets together, is the copper market, and there’s no carrying cost of   copper futures  A perfect substitute for the Russian market is the oil futures market  My point is   that I didn’t notice any discussion of how much of the trade is financially driven and how much   of it is physically driven, and I think that’s something we need to contemplate  I don’t want an   answer right now, but I think it’s something we need to continue to think about in terms of   driving prices upward and becoming a vicious circle   January 25–26, 2011 90 of 282              Third, I just want to say a word, for what it’s worth, about Chinese inflation  What I’m   hearing from my contacts is that, for retailers who sell nonfood goods in the United States and   source in China, the demands are now 40 percent  It’s a combination of labor inflation running   about 15 percent per year as computed in their five-year plan, and transportation and other costs    The US retailers hope to whittle it down to 8 to 10 percent through negotiation  According to   one CEO of a major retailer, who at one point ran the largest retailer, this is the worst inflation   he’s seen in 25 years, and it’s sourcing out of China and alternative markets    Thank you    Mr Chairman, I’m going to talk purely about the economy as seen   through my own District and about my conversations with various CEOs  Before I do, I want to   thank President Hoenig for pointing out the need to contemplate unintended consequences as   well as intended consequences  I would say that is true not only when we enter into a program,   January 25–26, 2011 118 of 282              but, as President Plosser commented, it is true also when we exit  And I want to come back to   try to pay a compliment to the New York Desk for the work that they did on the various exit   scenarios, and I hope they will not interrupt me this time, because I think we need to contemplate   what the cost of exit is and how we exit   Now I will turn to the economy and, in particular, to developments in my District,   because it has been an engine of economic growth and employment growth  We have looked   closely at the data, and the Texas share of US employment growth for last year amounted to   19 percent of total nonagricultural growth—40 percent goods production and 60 percent   services  So Texas is not quite North and South Dakota, but I think it is not an unimportant   indicator of where we may be going  Let me just give you some summary statistics  Our payroll   employment rose at a 3 percent rate in December  Our Texas manufacturing outlook survey is   indicating expectations of capital expenditures and future business activity at a level that we have   not seen for over three years  Construction employment rose at a 36 annual rate  And we are   beginning to hear that convenience stores are reporting increasing traffic, which is usually an   indication of a pickup in construction activity in terms of those workers’ consumption  Service   sector employment grew at a 23 percent annual rate in November; we are still looking at the   December rate  The key number that I wanted to mention is temporary employment, which rose   at a 19½ percent annual rate—Charlie, I think you mentioned Manpower  Our manufacturing   outlook survey had a very interesting statistic  We asked about the hiring intention six months   out  The ratio of firms expecting to hire versus those expecting to lay workers off is now at   19 to 1—not insignificant  So our surveys raise the prospect that this recovery might actually   generate more jobs than we had expected   January 25–26, 2011 119 of 282              There are two offsets to what is happening in our District, but it is happening in all   Districts  One is that the state does have a fiscal shortfall  In the typical Texas manner, I doubt   it will be met by tax increases, but, rather, it will be met by continued severe cuts in social   services  In the state’s budget, 75 percent goes to education and health, and, unfortunately, I   think the cuts are going to come out of the education side as well as the health side  The second   offset is in our Texas manufacturing survey, where the proportion of firms that expect to be able   to pass on higher prices by midyear rose to 372 percent, the highest level in almost three years    And the prices received index is now running at the highest level in three years  So that’s my   District   I’d like to turn to what I have gleaned from the roughly 30 CEOs I speak with  You’re   the only one that has that list, Mr Chairman, and I will summarize that quickly  I think it’s fair   to say that the view of that group collectively is that fears of a double-dip recession have faded   into the rearview mirror  Confidence is higher in the direction of final demand moving forward    The best summary quote is, “We are moving forward at 3 knots, not at 20, but it’s definitely   forward motion”  The same holds true even among small businesses, according to my contact at   AT&T; he said the company is seeing the highest small business demand for connectivity and for   services that they have seen in the last three years  By the way, according to the casual dining   industry—for example, Chili’s and the middle brands—despite GE’s withdrawal from the   financing business, franchises are able to raise capital now, which is something they haven’t seen   for three years  Improvements in final demand seem to be more likely, liquidity is abundant, and   many regard the prospects on the tax and regulatory front as potentially better—I stress   “potentially,” because these are hard-headed people, who are hopeful, but wary  I’m finding   January 25–26, 2011 120 of 282              more that are saying they are contemplating expanded domestic cap-ex, and some are at least   beginning to budget for domestic payroll expansion   On the inflationary front, those with rising input costs are planning price increases  Many   have the ability to pass through increases automatically, for example, the rails and others  But to   return to a point raised earlier, they are uncertain about their pricing power  And I have tried to   drill down with my interlocutors specifically on this issue  Generally speaking, those in the   bottom two quartiles in the retailing sector appear to be budgeting for 8 percent increases on the   apparel side, particularly as we get to back-to-school season, because of the higher prices of   inputs such as cotton  And Mr Tarullo will be very happy to know that that has also led to   higher prices of polyester, because polyester is a substitute for cotton  I noticed him nodding off   during my statement—[laughter]—so I just wanted to make sure he was paying attention  But   when you really do press, they’re still uncertain as to how much, given the weak demand we   have, they’ll be able to pass through  Nonetheless, the intention is to pass through whatever they   can get away with  The business community has worked very hard to preserve the margins,   which have become extremely taut, and they are quite worried about it   So, in summary, Mr Chairman, I would say there is more than enough liquidity in the   system  Businesses and financial intermediaries are flush with funds  Money is burning a hole   in the pockets of many, sensing that fiscal and regulatory policy might become friendlier    Businesses are beginning to budget for cap-ex, including, hopefully, more in the United States    And some additions to domestic payrolls may occur, although those additions and investments   are still earmarked to drive productivity and, therefore, are likely to have less of an impact on   unemployment than is desirable  The outlook, according to the CEOs I surveyed across the   January 25–26, 2011 121 of 282              country, is the most upbeat it has been in two years  But inflation is a concern  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    Could you take a little bit longer, President Rosengren, with your   summary?  [Laughter]    Thank you, Mr Chairman  A couple of things come through from   listening to the conversation that we had earlier about the economy  One thing that’s very clear   is that things have shifted  I think our words and our deeds need to recognize that the economy   January 25–26, 2011 176 of 282              is much stronger  It has moved forward, and it has more forward momentum and sustainability   than was the case last summer and autumn when QE2 was proposed and formulated  As a   corollary to that, I think the economic expansion seems much less vulnerable to shocks  Like   President Plosser, I have made it very clear in my public statements and at this table that I would   have not supported QE2, but QE2 is in place   One thing that is fairly clear to me is that inflation is at an inflection point  It could—and   I stress “could”—come under considerable upside pressure from what I consider to be reduced   slack in the global economy and possibly less slack here in the United States than is generally   appreciated  And one could make the argument that a continuation of QE2 purchases will only   add to this inflationary pressure  I am concerned about the fact that businesses and banks seem   to be drowning in liquidity  I think it’s leading not just to speculative activity of the kind that   President Hoenig and others have mentioned, such as farmland price appreciation, but also to the   misallocation of resources  So I am eager to normalize the allocation of credit as soon as it is   feasible  In addition, I do worry about the inclination I’m hearing from business leaders to want   to exercise pricing power  They will look for any excuse they can to do so, because their   margins are so tight and because they’re eager to grow their top lines and sustain their stock   values  But I think we’re going to need a couple more months of data to confirm that directional   shift   I also feel that there have been some negative consequences to QE2, some of which affect   those most deeply in need  It has certainly exposed many pension funds as the Ponzi schemes   that they are, and it has hurt the small saver significantly, particularly in the lower income   quartiles   January 25–26, 2011 177 of 282              I could argue for alternative C  I could even argue for alternative D, but I won’t  I’m   convinced the economy is on a sustainable growth trajectory, but I could be too optimistic  I   think we need a few more months of evidence to support my convictions before reducing or   stopping the additions to our balance sheet   I do think we should be communicating about our flexibility  I do believe there is some   value in our making more positive statements about the economy  After all, we heard them at   this table, and we believe them   With regard to the difference between alternative B and alternative C, I think reputational   risk cuts two ways  President Plosser referred to this in a different fashion, but some do argue   that we damaged our reputation with QE2  Some might argue that we shouldn’t have undertaken   QE2, but I think shifting gears too quickly would indicate weakness, in that we would not be   sticking to our conviction at least until we see the whites of the eyes of recovery  So I am in   favor of alternative B  I listened very carefully as President Kocherlakota and President Plosser   advocated substituting paragraph 1 in C for paragraph 1 in alternative B  I think you could   probably take care of their concerns without making that substitution by adding what President   Lockhart just endorsed, namely, putting a comma at the very end of paragraph 2 after   “disappointingly slow” and adding, “although the economic recovery is strengthening”    Alternatively, in the first sentence of the first paragraph you might say “confirms that the   economic recovery is strengthening”  So I don’t see a need for the substitution of the first   paragraph from alternative C into alternative B if we don’t want to change too many words  But   I would suggest that we find a way to indicate the mood that was expressed at this table, namely,   that the economic recovery is, indeed, strengthening even though it is still constrained  And I   January 25–26, 2011 178 of 282              believe President Lockhart’s endorsement of my suggested sentence is the way to do it rather   than shifting those paragraphs   I would add one word in the first paragraph  “Employers remain reluctant to add to   domestic payrolls”  In a sense, that’s one of the problems that I’ve been talking about for quite   some time, and you point out the difficulty of differentiating between our role here as the US   central bank and other pressures that are developing worldwide  But I still find employers are   reluctant to add to domestic payrolls   With regard to the $80 billion sentence, I’m a little worried about that  It is the truth, but   at the same time, I think the markets will pick that up  There will be much discussion about it    It’s much ado about nothing  We’re still on a $600 billion pace, and that number could change   as early as our next meeting—it could be 85 or it could be 75  So I’m not in favor of pointing   that out  I would end the sentence with “securities by the end of the second quarter of 2011”    And I rather liked President Kocherlakota’s insertion of “longer-term” between “stable” and   “inflation expectations”  Those are my suggestions, Mr Chairman  I will support alternative B    I would like very much if we could improve the tone from the standpoint of economic recovery   strengthening   Finally, I have a comment on your comment on inflation targeting  I have argued at this   table that, as long as we have a dual mandate, we have to be extremely careful with regard to   targeting inflation because then that might impose upon us some more specific unemployment   target  I have come to conclude over my now almost six years of experience at this table—which   is not much, but it’s certainly better than where I started—that the employment mandate is a very   slippery political slope  It’s also evident to me that there is some shift in sentiment in terms of   those that have given us our franchise and given us that mandate, and I think it might be time to   January 25–26, 2011 179 of 282              think about preparing to shift to a single mandate of inflation and letting the politicians worry   about unemployment through fiscal policy  So I welcome the discussion, Charles  I look   forward to talking to you about this and giving my ideas to you  Thank you, Mr Chairman    So the sentence would take out “while investment in nonresidential   structures is still weak”?    Yes, you could say it “strengthened, though the growth rate has …”  That   was one of my suggestions    It has either strengthened or it hasn’t strengthened  But the Chairman had   an interesting suggestion  Could you repeat your suggestion, please, Mr Chairman?    I think that’s a fair statement    There was a more positive sense at the table    I feel equally passionately  [Laughter]  So let us cancel each other out  I   would suggest that we listen to the good advice that Michelle just gave, because I think she is   right    But imagine this news article  “Charles Plosser met today with selected   clients of Goldman Sachs and said the following”    You asked for an example  It seems to me that the optics there would not   be good    I don’t    I’ll tell you how I do that, because that’s important  The ground rules are   that I will impart no information, and I will only listen    And they’re not financial firms  I do not impart a thing, including my   own views    And if Toys R Us can make a profit off of my interaction, that would be   something  But we have very strict rules   January 25–26, 2011 207 of 282               I do think, though, that we have to think about the optics here as well    Unfortunately, Mr Chairman, I have to leave, because I’m giving a   speech tomorrow morning to the Armstrong Dad’s Club at a local elementary school—it’s not   about monetary policy  [Laughter]  I apologize for not being able to stay  I do think this is a   very good suggestion  We have talked about this  I don’t want to talk too much because I’m on   the subcommittee, but we should frame it in the positive sense that President Bullard and others   mentioned, that we’re attempting to communicate more broadly  I think John hit the nail on the   head—we’re viewed as being too cozy with Wall Street and too opaque to the public  If we   phrase it that way, we can also point out some things that we do not do, such as provide inside   information to unnamed former Governors who are consultants, so that they can make a profit  I   think we could emphasize that within a positive context   I think President Lacker is right that having very bright lines is extremely difficult  I   think good judgment, in the end, is what is required  What we are really talking about here is   reaffirming an ethic that makes us an exceptional institution  There are some bright lines,   however; for example, Sandy referred to the SEC fair disclosure rule  I’m also sympathetic to   broadening the group, as Charlie said, because it’s not just principals at this table but also the   staff that have access to inside information, and we have to be very careful not to allow anybody   to trade on it   But the general principle that has been expressed here, which is fairly new for our   subcommittee to hear, is to put it in a positive context  Our job is to communicate as broadly as   possible, to inform the public, and not to have certain subsets of the public have privileged   information from which they either might profit or it might be interpreted that they are benefiting   at the expense of others  If I may be excused, I would be grateful  Thanks   January 25–26, 2011 217 of 282             "
9173,2011-03-15,"  The FOMC song; it’s a great one  [Laughter]    So the answer to Dan’s question is that the dealers are better informed   about the market dynamic and the stock argument than the economists appear to be    May I ask a question?    Brian and I have talked about this, but not this bluntly—is there any   reason why the dealer survey can’t be shared with the FOMC principals as it goes out, so we   know what’s in the dealer survey?  After all, Brian, you are operating on our instruction, and the   Desk is responsible for collecting the responses  It would be interesting for us, I think  I had a   chance to look at the survey once, but as a matter of course, is there a reason why we don’t have   a dealer survey circulated amongst the principals of the FOMC?  Is there any reason not to?  We   might learn something from it  Do you feel uncomfortable with doing that?    No, not receiving our input, just letting us see what is in the dealer survey    May I just ask that that be considered, Mr Chairman?  I don’t think it’s a   big deal, but I just think it would be helpful for us  Again, it would bring us up to date  All of us   are intensely interested in the reports that Brian gives us  It would help us process better the   responses, as Brian reports them to the Committee  And, after all, he is conducting this on behalf   of the Committee  We are members of the Committee  Unless there is a legal reason not to do   it, I’d like it to be considered    I’m talking about the questionnaire  Brian summarizes the results very   adequately for meetings    The Committee is not surveying the dealers  I just want to see what the   questions are that are being asked to the dealers  Also, I wouldn’t recommend that we do our   own analysis of responses  That is the responsibility of the Desk    Mr Chairman, I’d like to ask a question both of Dave and of Nathan    Dave, you gave a rather extended monologue on inflationary pressures, and you concluded by   referring to the TIPS-based measures that Brian talked about, and added a comment about the   Michigan survey  Would you say that long-term inflationary expectations remain stable?    Based on those new data points, you still feel that way?    Nathan, you talked about Japan in terms of the impact of the devastation   particularly on the Japanese equity markets  Could you give us just a first glance—and I realize   this needs to be studied—as to what kind of impact it might have on the price of key   commodities, such as lumber, iron ore, and steel, that will likely be imported to rebuild Japan?    And then the supply constrictions on autos and other products that they do export, or the price   effect, say, on semiconductors  Have you had a chance to at least initially think that through?    San Marino    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m going to comment on three things  first,   on my District, where activity remains robust; second, on inflation, where I am wary—and a   little comment on overall economic activity for the nation; and third, I want to conclude with   comments on the financial markets, where I see disturbing signs developing  In all of those   areas, I will not comment on Lindsay Lohan   As far as my District is concerned, I reported last time that payroll employment had risen   at an annual rate of 3 percent in December  It continues to rise at that rate, and, in fact, we see it   accelerating  Temporary employment rose at an almost unprecedented 291 percent annual rate   in December; we see that trend continuing  And construction employment, very importantly,   March 15, 2011 60 of 165              rose at a 22 percent annual rate in December; we see that trend continuing  And interestingly,   convenience store sales, where the average purchaser is a 27-year-old Hispanic in my District,   have seen sales pick up by 7 percent year to date  So we see increased activity in the   construction sector   If you update the figures on employment through January, with all due respect to my   colleague from Minnesota, there are, as you pointed out, regional differences  I was going to   declare Texas to be the “Bavaria of the United States,” but that may go to Minnesota  However,   given the numbers that we have, year-to-date total nonagricultural employment in terms of our   share of employment growth in the United States is roughly 50 percent—495—for the month of   January  In terms of the numbers employed in the services sector, Texas accounts for   789 percent of the employment growth in January  So we continue to steam along   Our leading index recently rose to its highest level since the third quarter of 2008  We   looked for negative signs  One of the negative signs in our surveying is that prices-paid   indicators continue to rise, with a growing number of firms planning to pass along price   increases to customers later this year, and I will comment on that a little bit further when I talk   about my national economic survey  We do have a negative, of course; like all states, we have a   budgetary imbalance  I fully suspect, given Texas’s tradition, that they will take it out of   education and health care and not in increased tax revenues   As far as inflation is concerned, I do want to point out a couple of things  Our trimmed   mean suggests that December’s underlying rate was not quite as low as that indicated by the   core, and that January’s rate was not quite as high as indicated by the core measurement that we   more typically use  Our trimmed mean PCE is running at about 1 percent, similar to December’s   11 percent  The 6- and 12-month trimmed mean rates are holding steady at 11 percent and   March 15, 2011 61 of 165              09 percent respectively  Both the Dallas and the Cleveland trimmed mean have shown upward   drift, however, on the 6-month horizon  There is one change, and that is that January’s Dallas   trimmed mean showed the lowest level of items registering price declines since the inflation   scare of August 2008, and this is for the third straight month  The number of items showing   price declines was roughly 30 percent of the basket   With regard to pass-through and the comments that were made, I remain a little bit wary    For example, processed foods  One company I surveyed at the beginning of the year was   budgeting $800 million in inflation increases  They just revised that at their board meeting last   week to $2 billion, and they expect to pass through whatever they can pass through because the   prices of processed food appear to have some leeway in terms of the pricing for consumers   In apparel, if you look at the data that were recently released by MasterCard   SpendingPulse, we have seen a 3 percent increase in each of the last two months  The price of   apparel has decreased for 20 years  Every retailer I surveyed—big box or lower- or higher-  income quartile, across the spectrum—is pricing in increased prices, mainly because of the price   of cotton or its nearest substitute, which is paraxylene  In terms of even those products that we   would consider to be nonrelated to raw material price increases, I find it interesting that AT&T   has moved every single price category forward and priced in price increases  So I think we need   to be a little bit worried about the assumption that non-oil commodity prices are not having an   effect on business expectations  I think President Lacker talked about that quite correctly, and I   would second some of the points he has made  We’re building in a mindset here that may,   indeed affect expectations as well as the reality of inflation   With regard to wage pressures, in our Eleventh District surveys and our Beige Book   survey, we find that higher wages are being reported by some high-value-added firms,   March 15, 2011 62 of 165              particularly in accounting, in airline and aviation, and in high-tech manufacturers, all of which   are reporting slight increases in wage pressures for highly skilled positions  So I think this is   something we need to watch carefully   Last, on Japan, and this may be affected by my having lived and made a business there   for a period of time, but the devastation is overwhelming  Almost all raw materials are imported   in Japan  You add to that the price pressures—even though they seem to be somewhat abating   with somewhat slower growth in China—on steel, which is up 14 percent year to date, or the   prices of imported protein, or, as you pointed out, the price of semiconductors in terms of the   constriction of supply, or the supply of autos likely to come out, referencing back to the   comment on Ford Motor Company, and I view the developments in Japan as having an   inflationary bias  You have to remember how relatively isolated and how export driven that   economy is, and the fact that they are extremely dependent on imported goods  So whether it’s   lumber, steel, or other inputs, or the output that they produce, I would expect there will be   constraints and inflationary pressure   Let me conclude by commenting on the financial markets  Again, I think we’re seeing   signs, Mr Chairman, of increasingly imprudent risk-taking  We’ve seen a surge in covenant-lite   loans  Thirty billion dollars have been issued in the first two and a half months of this year    That compares with $24 billion for all of 2006 and $100 billion total for the boom year of 2007    There have been $15 billion in year-to-date dividends—payouts by private-equity-controlled   companies, all using leverage  That equals the running rate of last year, which was a record year    Payment-in-kind toggle notes, or PIK toggle notes, as they’re known, are an increasingly active   methodology employed in the market  According to the March Senior Credit Officer Opinion   Survey on Dealer Financing Terms, which was reported on page 69 in the Tealbook, traditionally   March 15, 2011 63 of 165              unlevered managers, insurance companies, and pension funds are increasingly using leverage   through OTC derivatives and repos, and the same can be said for hedge fund activity  Retail   investors are plowing fresh money into equities at the highest pace in two and a half years  The   current rally that we have just experienced is the sixth richest on record, going back to 1932, and   the third most rapid  By the way, the two that were even more rapid were in 1932 and 1933,   which I find of interest   Crude oil noncommercial futures contracts are climbing dramatically, and they’re   markedly higher as the oil trades are at ever higher prices  I think that’s something we should   monitor  And just to put this in perspective, the total volume outstanding on the NYMEX and   the ICE, which is the Intercontinental Exchange, now exceeds six times the storage capacity of   Cushing, Oklahoma  This can cut both ways, but this activity has accumulated momentum and   accelerated as prices have gotten higher, and the fact that Cushing, Oklahoma, inventories are   abnormally clogged up because you can’t release from Cushing as much as you’re taking in   means to me that we have to be extremely wary in terms of the volatility that might be created in   the movements of these futures markets  Whether or not they’re accurate indicators, there   certainly is an enormous amount of activity  I believe that activity is undermeasured because it   doesn’t take into proper account the derivatives that trade off of those markets   And one more data point from AutoNation and Experion—they show approvals for   38 percent of the subprime customers at year-end  Now, that’s not quite 50 percent, which was   the level just before the crash, but it’s up significantly from the 18 percent average level for   2009   I would say in summary, Mr Chairman, I’m seeing signs of the intoxicating ambrosia of   cheap money and readily available money  I think it is exacerbating price movements, and it   March 15, 2011 64 of 165              may well be adding to inflation  As you know, I remain extremely wary as to the utility of the   recent round of the $600 billion-plus in purchases, and I think we have a lot to be mindful of  I   agree with President Bullard  Given the pace of activity and the change in the mood that has   taken place in the country, we may have to move much more quickly in terms of undoing the   monetary accommodation we’ve provided, which would be a happy case, not a sad case  Thank   you    May I ask one question, Mr Chairman?    This is picky, but why use “and” instead of “but”?  If you say “and,”   you’re sort of dismissing it  If you say “but,” you’re saying we have to pay attention    I hate to butt in   March 15, 2011 96 of 165               May I just ask for a clarification, Mr Chairman?  The last time we   discussed the $80 billion, as I remember, Michelle spoke passionately about not including it    Could someone just review the reason we did not include it last time very quickly before we   proceed?    Mr Chairman?    I think I’m pretty hawkish on this issue    I’m very concerned about inflation  I think to say “low” is even worse   than saying “subdued,” and I prefer to keep the language as it is  I’ll argue some other things   when I have my intervention, but if we say “are low, the trends are staying low,” I think it   undermines our credibility  I think it’s a mistake    I’m sorry I jumped in, then  I didn’t know I was going next  A couple of   things are evident from this conversation  One is that there is a feeling at the table that the   recovery is gaining momentum  The second is that we’re obviously taking caution to express   ourselves on inflation carefully  The third is that President Rosengren’s statements are getting   longer  I view him as a model of efficient expression, and I’m not sure how to read that,   President Rosengren, but I’m going to study the entrails to try to understand it  And the fourth   is, I’m delighted to hear President Lacker talk about how the average businessman or   businesswoman thinks    Yes, sir  Back to the subject matter  I am against tapering  If I felt that   there was any risk that we might advocate tapering, or extending the program, then I would argue   alternative C, because I would like to begin tapering now down to lower levels  But I read the   drift at the table, and I am encouraged by the likelihood that this experiment with this extra phase   March 15, 2011 116 of 165              of LSAPs, whether you were for it or against it, as I was, is coming to an end  And I can live   with alternative B under that assumption   I’m sorry to do this, because I know President Tarullo is about to squirm out of his seat    Governor Tarullo  Well, maybe someday, “President” Tarullo  One   slight editorial suggestion—I apologize—and that is with regard to a suggestion made by   President Plosser in writing  Our mandate does not refer to the unemployment rate  The   suggestion I have is in the second paragraph  Instead of what we have as a second sentence, I   would say, “Although the level of unemployment has recently declined, it is still elevated”  Take   out the word “rate”  This is a problem that we have to deal with  We are talking about the level   of employment or unemployment in our mandate  I also don’t like the word “remains”    “Remains” has a stickiness to it, and it sounds like we are reluctant  But the fact is, it is still   elevated, and so I would say, “Although the level of unemployment has recently declined,”   which is a fact, “it is still elevated”  Then you could go on to say, “The measure of underlying   inflation”—I think President Kocherlakota’s suggestions are excellent   I do not believe we should put a pace of $80 billion a month into the statement  Thank   you, Mr Chairman    Sir?    I do not believe we should put the $80 billion a month in the statement    Thank you    Which one is that, Mr Chairman?    I’m in favor   March 15, 2011 124 of 165               Yes, I do, too    Close of business or midnight?    No, no  I’m a member of the subcommittee  I’m trying to not to interfere   with the process  [Laughter]  So, Tom, your argument is that we should end it at noon on   Thursday?    So we’re shortening the blackout period  At least we got Friday out of   this thing    I thought the proposal was—again, being a member of the subcommittee I   want to be careful and listen—that even for the one-day meetings we’d end it for Friday as well    Is that right?  "
9197,2011-04-26,"  Mr Chairman, I don’t know if the questions are over, but I would like to   move that we accept the proposal for the extension of the swap lines from Mexico and Canada   and approve the Desk operations as you suggested    I would like to move acceptance of all three    Thank you, Mr Chairman  You asked for some principles  The   principles, or desiderata, that I would suggest before going into the questions are, first, we wish   April 26–27, 2011 47 of 244              to normalize the conduct of monetary policy as quickly as economic conditions allow  To me,   that means returning to a system of an active funds market in which the funds rate is the principal   instrument of monetary policy   A second principle would be an obvious one but I think needs to be restated—that we   support growth in real activity while guarding against both deflation and excess inflation  To   me, that means getting the monetary base back on an approximate 5 percent pre-crisis growth   path within a reasonable time—say, three to five years   The third would be to stop distorting the allocation of capital in favor of housing  To me,   the faster we get out of MBS, the better  Shedding those holdings need not result in a rapid   shrinkage of our balance sheet  We can always reinvest some or all of the proceeds in   Treasuries, but I do believe that we must get away from that kind of asset allocation and social   engineering   Fourth, this may be offensive, but I think we must shut the door, lock the key, and throw   it away from the principle that we are ever again going to proceed down the path of monetizing   the debt of our government   And, fifth, we should seek to reduce our exposure to capital losses, but I think that any   good portfolio manager, particularly given the mix that we have, can balance that out  I don’t   accept the formal aspect of not worrying about capital losses because of whatever leeway we   have been granted by Treasury or other authorities  I think we are subject to political criticism   there  Part of my principles, or desiderata, would be to reduce our exposure to capital losses or   at least balance out the losses and gains  To me, that means probably reducing and moving away   from our long-term exposure as we proceed to sell assets   April 26–27, 2011 48 of 244              And then, the sixth principle, which is very important to me, would be that we, in all our   decisionmaking, maintain the full power of the Federal Open Market Committee in making these   various decisions  So now let me turn to the questions that were asked   With regard to the first—Should the first step be to stop the current policy of reinvesting   principal payments from agency securities?—the decision to reinvest principal payments was   motivated by having the funds rate at zero  To me, it’s a no-brainer that we would want to end   the reinvestment program as soon as the Committee was convinced that the time had come to   start normalizing policy, just as we have now decided or, I believe, will decide—we will see   what the policy round indicates—to stop QE2 expansion  I call the principle the “stop digging”   principle, and to me I would stop digging at least in terms of mortgage-backed securities as soon   as we have the leeway to do so   In terms of the second question about removing policy accommodation—Would we   prefer to put asset sales on a largely predetermined or preannounced path?—I think I have heard   my previous interlocutors reference this, but to me the “prudent man” principle applies here  We   have never been in a situation like the one we find ourselves in now  You could detect that in the   little mini debate or discussion between Bill English and Brian in response to the question of Mr   Hoenig  I think we need to retain as much flexibility as possible to respond to unforeseen or   unforeseeable developments as we get back to normal  I do believe some forward guidance   would be important  I think President Plosser’s proposal is a good attempt to suggest some   forward guidance, but we’ve got to make sure we don’t put ourselves in a straitjacket, and not be   carried away with confidence about rational expectations or efficient markets  There are some   competing needs here  I think we need to allow maximum flexibility   April 26–27, 2011 49 of 244              With regard to the third question about sequencing actions to remove accommodation,   and whether we would sell assets before or after or at the same time, I would again suggest that   we maintain as much flexibility as possible  I am very sympathetic to President Bullard’s   argument for LIFO accounting  It is eminently sensible, but, again, maintain flexibility  One   advantage of cleaning out the balance sheet before raising rates is that it would at least   potentially eliminate the issue of whether the funds rate or the IOER becomes the main policy   instrument  I feel strongly that a channel system is preferable, with the funds rate being the main   policy instrument and the IOER being some distance below that in normal conditions  But, in   my opinion, as long as we have trillions of dollars in excess reserves sloshing around the banking   system, the funds rate and the IOER are going to have to move pretty much in lockstep with one   another, with the IOER being the real determinant of a bank’s willingness to lend out reserves  I   am not so sure about the real practicability of the massive use of reverse repos and term deposits   to prevent excess reserves from spilling out into the broader economy  I know we’ve tested   those channels, but, given the newness of those instruments, Brian, one might wonder whether   they can be used on a scale sufficient to control the excess liquidity that is out there  A middle   course of raising the funds rate, IOER, and selling assets all at the same time is probably the best   course of action  I think we will have to feel the market to see which is the most effective   With regard to the statements in the fourth question, the answer is yes, yes, and yes to the   first three  With regard to the fourth, about asset sales being communicated to the public in   advance, again, I want to be careful we don’t put ourselves in a straitjacket  As a former   portfolio manager, I would want to maintain as much flexibility as possible  The answer, really,   comes down to where I started this discussion or where others have raised the question  What   are we trying to get to?  What is the purpose of our normalization?  I would want to make sure   April 26–27, 2011 50 of 244              that we don’t put the words before the subject  If we determine the res, the reason for what   we’re going to do, then it might be more easy to communicate what we intend  But, again,   maintain the flexibility  Do not place us in a straitjacket  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Could you clarify, Mr Chairman, that last point?  I have a feeling that   will come up    I want to second that point  I think the more you begin to process, the   more you’re likely to get questions that force you further to process  I think providing these   general outlines and a direction is what counts here  You’re going to have subsequent press   conferences, but it could be a trap  So I agree with Governor Tarullo on this front, and I would   just be as general as possible    Still, you’re going to get questions on specifics of sequence and all of   these kinds of things if you’re not careful    I have two questions for Nathan  We are still accommodative  The Brits   appear to have stopped, but, as you mentioned, the Europeans are tightening and others are   tightening  What do the Europeans see that we don’t see?  In your opinion, is it a difference in   mandates, or do they see the world differently?    Mr Chairman, when we talk about our US situation, one of the   restraining factors we envision on inflationary pressures, even though we revised our numbers   upward, is our amount of slack, and particularly significant unemployment  So I’m wondering,   Nathan, if you would describe to us how much slack you see outside the United States  And,   how well and how able are we to measure global slack?    Thank you    Mr Chairman, economic growth in our regional economy appears to be   accelerating, and, notwithstanding some soft spots, we think that the Eleventh District is about to   turn in its best performance since 2007  Our payroll employment grew at a 26 percent rate in   the first quarter and at a 36 percent rate in March, and on almost every front we have significant   activity, including multifamily construction and rents that are on the rise across the Texas   metropolitan areas  We’ve been assisted by robust economic growth in Mexico, which is   growing at 48 percent   There are some areas of concern, particularly that input and selling prices are increasing   faster  And as I mentioned last time, we did find a typical Texas way to resolve the budget—by   cutting everything, including education and social services  The joke is, and it’s a horrible one,   that we’ve gone from the electric chair to electric bleachers in Texas  It’s a hideously interesting   way to resolve our program issues   April 26–27, 2011 114 of 244              From the standpoint of employment growth, as you know, I like to brag on the percentage   of jobs we’ve created as a percentage of the whole in the United States  The good news is, while   we continue to grow, the rest of the United States is catching up with us, and I think it reflects   the comments that have been made at the table   Bearing in mind the great virtues of modeling and academic precision, I’d like to turn to   the US economy and address three questions that were raised in the domestic briefing  One is   that employment is proceeding  Second, GDP may be understating the momentum of the   economy, a point that I believe President Lockhart made in his presentation  And a very   important point he made is that inflation seems to have some intrinsic momentum  These are the   points that I’m picking up from my anecdotal evidence, and as you know, I do a fairly thorough   survey, to the best of my ability  Mr Chairman, you know who is on my list  I’d like to   summarize that for the group since we’ve heard a lot of macroeconomic data, but I’d like to   provide for the table the microeconomic inputs   What was previously a faint theme is now a very loud, uniform drumbeat on two fronts,   according to my interlocutors—that is, the CEOs and CFOs that I talk to across all of our   Districts  The first is that cost inflation is pushing forward price increases in all sectors beyond   energy and basic commodities, and the second is that excess liquidity is giving rise to faster and   looser decisionmaking by financial intermediaries, something that I referenced before  Final   demand is growing, although at a lesser pace, and the reason given by my interlocutors is that   inflation in basic necessities is becoming a factor dampening consumer confidence and   tempering the rate of expansion  The ease with which credit is available is being exploited by   businesses, but it is simultaneously giving rise to trepidation of what might ensue  As one of   them said, we’ve seen this movie before, and just recently   April 26–27, 2011 115 of 244              To a person—and I mean to a person across all sectors  public, private, large, small,   whatever sector in which they operate—my contacts feel that they and, in general, American   businesses large and small, public and private, have, as President Lockhart pointed out earlier,   achieved tremendous operational efficiency such that they have no fat from which to absorb   widespread and pervasive cost increases, and they must protect their margins by passing these   cost pressures on to consumers  To be sure, they’re not sure how much leeway they have, but it   does alarm me to hear from one interlocutor—whose name I will mention because I think it’s of   value, Bill Simon at Walmart—that Walmart has approved increases  These are not yet   announced, and they’re not for public use  They are to be implemented in the June time frame in   much higher orders of magnitude than I would have expected—for example, dairy products up   15 percent, all Proctor & Gamble products up 5 to 7 percent  As reported in the Wall Street   Journal this morning—I presume everybody reads section B?  Nobody reads section B   [laughter]—5 to 7 percent in diapers and tissues from Kimberly Clark; blue jeans up 8 percent   Walmart is an interesting interlocutor  They force their suppliers to go through their   entire cost structure  In the ugly parlance of one of them, they’re known as the cost proctologists   because they examine absolutely everything  They have concluded, and I quote, “Practically all   of our suppliers’ cost structures have been rationalized  They’ve achieved remarkable operating   efficiencies, which is revealed in the macroeconomic data  They have severely limited room to   absorb broad-based inflation,” end of quote   An example—a separate retail chain, Michaels, which sells 40,000 products in   1,040 stores in 48 states, is planning price increases of seasonal goods, which is one-third of their   40,000 products, of 8 to 10 percent, and their CEO put it this way  “Commodities will swing up   April 26–27, 2011 116 of 244              and down in price, but wage inflation is real in China, India, Vietnam, and the inherent cost to   manufacture everywhere, including the United States, is going up”   My smallest contact, John Faulkner, a dry cleaner with 20-odd employees, was almost   offensively blunt in echoing what I heard from everyone in size up to Rex Tillerson at Exxon, or,   say, Burlington Northern, or TI, or AT&T  “I have no problem getting credit or money  That’s   the good news  The bad news is that inflation in all my inputs is killing me  I haven’t increased   wages for my people  I’m sure as heck not going to hire more until I sense my other costs can be   controlled even if bankers pay me to take their money”   Every CEO I talk to, large or small, public or private, is now budgeting for and managing   to inflation, and I think this addresses your point of the inherent carryover of inflationary   numbers  The question is for how long, and perhaps we could turn to Chicago’s model to get a   sense for that   As to the effects of excess liquidity on behavior of financial operators, I see only an   intensification of the very disturbing patterns I reported at the last FOMC  Continued   accommodation is encouraging a debasement of prudent credit practices and an enhancement of   speculative impulses, some of which only add to inflationary pressures  I note that in the   Tealbook on page 59, the pace of institutional leveraged loan issuance in the first quarter was   about the same as the pace for the entire year of 2007, and the expected nonfinancial year-ahead   defaults have come down significantly; I note also that they have come down to nearly the same   level that they were in 2007 before all the defaults occurred  As an example, I’ll point to Energy   Future Holdings  You may remember, that’s the electric utility that just refinanced the   $45 billion leverage buyout that was done by KKR, TPG, and Goldman  Their CEO confided in   April 26–27, 2011 117 of 244              me that the covenants in the refinancing they achieved last week were “even better this time than   what we got in 2007”   I agree that many current inflationary variables may be transitory  I accept that over the   past 25 years inflation expectations have been largely unaffected by commodity price   fluctuations because of the inflation-fighting mindset that we have at the Fed, which is not in   question  I can also understand the reasoning behind the initiation of the current LSAP program    Even though I did not think it was necessary, I will grant that it has lifted stock prices and   increased investor returns  But here’s the summary point  Based on anecdotal input, for what   it’s worth, I fear that we are, first, on the edge of losing the faith of the business community and   households as to our inflation-fighting resolve—I think that needs to be reemphasized, a very   important part of what you will do tomorrow afternoon, Mr Chairman—and, second, planting   seeds of financial recklessness, some of which are beginning to sprout  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    I want to just address one issue the Governor raised— and I admire the   way you spent Easter weekend  I think if you look at the transcripts thoroughly, what you’ll see   is that what we were hearing from business reporters, to which I am a devotee, was a significant   buildup in price pressures leading up to August 2008, and they were right  They did not   anticipate the collapse in demand that occurred as a result of the financial crisis, and that’s when   you began to see a reversal in expectations  I think we have to be very careful to dismiss   microeconomic decisionmakers  They should supplement and complement the data  Data are   history  What we’re trying to get a sense of is things at the margin  I always preface my   comments by saying “for what it is worth,” and for what it is worth, I think it is valuable to listen   to those who actually allocate resources, decide who to hire, and price products   April 26–27, 2011 157 of 244               Is it all right if President Fisher makes a comment?  I am delighted to hear   you say it was a temporary phenomenon  I am especially delighted to hear you make it clear that   this is not what we’re going to do  And I think we have 100 percent agreement at the table    Thank you for clarifying that    I believe we temporarily did so  I believe the numbers are there  That’s   my belief  The beauty of this Committee is we have a diversity of views  I don’t want to waste   our time on this discussion, Mr Chairman  I think we should get back to addressing the   alternatives    Well, I was thinking through what we heard from David Wilcox   yesterday, and from the Bank presidents in particular, and the dissonance that is being reported    My notes to myself summarized them as follows   On economic growth, like the old saw about the music of Wagner, “It’s not as bad as it   sounds,” and on inflation, like gangsta rap, it’s worse than it sounds  I think so much depends,   Mr Chairman, on, really, what you say at this press conference and your comportment, which I   am very confident about   In looking at the statement, I think less attention will be paid to the statement than is   normal  Almost as much attention will be paid to you as is being paid to what Kate Middleton   will wear at her wedding  [Laughter]  And I am grateful for that distraction   April 26–27, 2011 203 of 244              On the statement, I think Mr Evans has a very good point  Here are the facts  The   headline PCE price index posed an annualized rate of increase of 49 percent in February  That’s   its fastest one-month rate of increase since June of 2009  That makes three straight months of   headline readings in excess of an annualized 3 percent rate  I would have no problem with   inserting the word “headline” between “pushed up” and “inflation”  I think he makes a good   point  Generally speaking, I agree with Mr Lacker’s amendments  I’m glad that they were   reflected in alternative B  I like President Kocherlakota’s inclusion of “in the context of price   stability”—it takes some of the seesaw out  But I think the most important amendment that’s   been suggested thus far was President Plosser’s, which is to conclude the first paragraph by   saying, “longer-term inflation expectations remain within historical norms,” et cetera, et cetera  I   believe I heard him say, “indicating” whatever—“over the medium term” rather than the   “medium run”  But I would accept that language   Let me just make a general comment about some of the tempers that seem to have flared   during this discussion  The beauty of this Committee is that it reflects diversity  There are   academics, there are very serious scholars at the table, there are actually three former bankers at   the table, and there are people with a supervision and regulation background  I don’t think we   should discourage diversities of view  I take a chapter out of Oliver Wendell Holmes  “Do not   be bullied out of your common sense”  And, moreover, that it is very important that we adhere   to both education in the obvious as well as investigation of the obscure  One of the great things   about this Committee is we have the talent and capacity to look at things in great depth, but we   also have the ability to take soundings in the field  And, as I mentioned earlier, those soundings   I wouldn’t disparage, I would use to complement and supplement what we analytically and   intellectually infer from our discussions and from our models   April 26–27, 2011 204 of 244              Mr Chairman, I think that, in addition to the statement and the suggestions that I have   just made, the important thing today is really this press conference  I think it would be prudent   for you to make a firm statement in your conference as to our resolve in containing inflation  I   thought your summary, as you presented it at the beginning of this discussion, was spot on  I   was tempted to embrace alternative C and to dissent at this meeting; I will not do so  I would ask   that you do, indeed, focus and reassure the markets about our intent to contain inflation and seek   price stability, because there are some doubts out there, whether they are deserved or not  And I   would conclude by saying that you might also consider noting during your press conference that   the Committee is aware of, and is monitoring, the resurgence of some financial practices that   could prove to be counterproductive  This is a concern we haven’t discussed as a group and we   don’t include in the statement, but I sense it is out there and I would like to put any notion that   we are not aware of it to an end   So, in summary, I would support alternative B, with the amendments I mentioned,   particularly the end of the first paragraph with President Plosser’s suggestion  I would insert the   word “headline” before “pushed up inflation,” because that, indeed, is the fact  And I would   accept Narayana’s truncation of the last sentence in paragraph 2  Thank you, Mr Chairman   "
9226,2011-06-21,"  I would just ask for clarification whether this does not rule out our going   to a corridor system    Thank you    I have problems with the ritualistic sequencing of all this  We’ll talk   about that later  But in this case, just to take your concern, Governor Yellen, and Mr Plosser’s   excellent point, I would just say, “When economic conditions warrant, the Committee will begin   raising its target for the federal funds rate”  We don’t know if we’re going to do it within one   month, three months, or six months  Why are we pinning ourselves down here?  And then we   create expectations  Even saying “a couple of meetings,” Mr Chairman, again—with all due   respect—we’ll do it when it’s appropriate  So why not simplify the language?  I respect   President Kocherlakota immensely, but I think we are making this much more complicated than   we should  I would simply have it say, “When economic conditions warrant, the Committee will   begin raising its target for the fed funds rate”    Mr Chairman, I’m in favor, as is President Rosengren and I sense   Governor Tarullo, of taking all time references out; I think it unnecessarily binds us  So I   wouldn’t include “probably within a few months” in the fifth paragraph and “over a period of   four to five years” in the sixth paragraph  Any reference to time, I think, puts us in a straitjacket,   and conditions may well change  I know no one at this table who five years ago expected us to   be where we are today  So it just doesn’t make sense to me to have a specific time reference, and   that would be my first point  I’m a little uncomfortable, possibly out of ignorance, as to whether   it makes sense to declare that we would raise rates first and then sell  It might incur losses  It   might move the yield curve  I would like to say, in paragraph 5, “Sales of agency securities from   the SOMA will likely commence sometime after the first increase in the target for the federal   funds rate,” but then go on to say, “though the timing of sales,” and then use the very last part of   that sentence, “could be adjusted in response to material changes in the economic outlook or   financial conditions”  To me that’s operationally a commonsense way to phrase it, rather than   saying “probably within a few months”   In summary, I would like all time references to be taken out  I think that’s a sensible   thing to do  I would also suggest an editorial change in the fifth paragraph in that it allows us at   least the opportunity to adjust the timing  In the language in paragraph 5, I would say, “Sales of   agency securities from the SOMA will likely commence sometime after the first increase in the   June 21–22, 2011 47 of 282              target for the federal funds rate, though the timing of the sales could be adjusted in response to   material changes in the economic outlook or financial conditions”  I think we need to be as   opportunistic going out as we were going in  I understand the need for us to have a sense of   what our priorities are, but I don’t want to be locked in, in case economic or financial   opportunities present themselves  And to me, that would be a sensible way to write that sentence   or that paragraph    Mr Chairman  Could I just make it clear that I support taking out all the   time references in every paragraph?  “Five years” and the “three years”    Just a thought—in terms of what you say tomorrow, which I think is very,   very important, I would say as little as possible about this subject unless you’re pressed, and the   reason for that is, first, we made substantial progress, but we still have more to go in terms of   complete consensus, and second, we can get into this later when we get briefed on financial   June 21–22, 2011 54 of 282              markets, but I think we’re in a very sensitive time  My recommendation would be to go very   easy on this, and after all, what you say is what people are going to hear, and that’s what they’re   going to interpret is our policy    On the swap lines, there are no current outstanding balances—is that   correct?  And they’ve been minimally utilized, including from Japan?    And they’re open ended in terms of the amount?    Mr Chairman, I think that’s also a selling point to our critics  We put   them there  They haven’t been heavily utilized  The pricing is important  I don’t know if the   timing is right—you asked for approval  I’d like to move that we approve this, unless we have   other discussions on the swap lines   June 21–22, 2011 65 of 282               I just want to make sure I understand this  We do have contingency plans   in place  So you have some decision-tree analysis here    Well, I would expect you to be doing so, and if it does require coming to   the Committee, you’ve said you would but, obviously, first you have to develop all the   possibilities  So thank you for answering that question    Mr Chairman, may I ask these two gentlemen—in the early ’90s, we had   a problem with several banks being downgraded in terms of their commercial paper, including   Citi  They weren’t as reliant on short-term funding back then as they are now, and, of course, the   complexity of their business was less so  But are there any lessons we learned from that   experience?    Thank you    I have a question for Beth Anne, Mr Chairman, if I may  When we went   through your exhibit about the bond spreads and so on, I didn’t hear anything about France  And   the reason I mention that is because, in visiting the ECB last March, including with Mr Trichet,   the subject of the French primary deficit came up—that perhaps it is much worse than anybody   really knows  Last Wednesday, which was an interesting day in the marketplace, for the first   time I heard, at least from my interlocutors, some concern that this is a shoe that would drop at   one point  So I wondered if you’ve done much work on that, if you have any insight into it, and   if not, if you would be kind enough to look at it, because so much of what we have been hearing   about Greece is obviously somewhat discounted in the marketplace as it seems to get worse and   worse  But the one thing that would be a total surprise, if it were to occur, would be a surprise   coming from the French fiscal situation, particularly given that they’re an anchor country    Thank you    On the financial stability, I do want to thank Nellie for her good work and   for the work of the 70 people, as I understood your footnote, which were affiliated with it, and   for the presentation we just had  I distinguish between the faucet, which is how we address   monetary policy, and the sprinkler system, which is how we water the lawn of the economy    That is, we either have it distributed properly so that we don’t kill it with inflation, or starve it   and destroy it with deflation  I think this financial stability aspect of it is very, very important    The transmission mechanism is critical  And I do want to tip my hat to Governor Tarullo for the   work he is doing in terms of “too big to fail,” which to me is one of the major hindrances to the   proper conduct of monetary policy—all the work he is doing on capital ratios and other aspects   of getting our system right  I think it is very important that we focus on the shadow banking   system and the trip wires that are out there—for example, those that Eric and the staff have   pointed out—because it puts us in a very difficult position   One of the risks that I think we need to contemplate and that I worry about is the   possibility that we could have a significant selloff in the market  This wasn’t discussed in terms   of financial stability, but having been a market operator, I know these things can happen   June 21–22, 2011 105 of 282              sometimes inexplicably  Let’s say that we had a 20 percent selloff in the S&P  What would we   do?  I’m going to switch here from the sprinkler system to what I call the soufflé; soufflés don’t   rise twice  And by that I mean that I’m not sure that we can just pour on more large-scale asset   purchases or more quantitative easing  I think the impact of this, as it goes through time,   becomes less and less potent  I would ask you to consider that as a financial stability risk, in   addition to the specifics we have gone through in terms of the specific banks, the short-term   funding of those banks, the exposure of money market mutual funds, and also some of the risks   that you have in your much longer paper dealing with, say, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan  I   think this is a very valuable exercise  I don’t think we can conduct monetary policy without   considering how the sprinkler system works and what Rube Goldberg devices are being attached   onto it or where the leaks are and what the repair mechanism needs to be  I think this should be a   part of our ongoing discussions  It is so much better than we had before  When Governor Warsh   was here, he would bring up certain issues, I would bring up issues, others would bring up   issues—this is much more systematic  Again, I want to pat you on the back, Nellie  And if I   could pat 70 other people on the back, I would  Having an organized discussion here rather than   pulling out layers of anecdotal evidence that we can layer on top is very, very important  So I   want that to go down as registered    What’s the time frame?    When you say they’re going to issue suggestions, are these remedies to   mitigate the risk or to deal with risk if it occurs?    Mr Chairman, I am going to dispense with my usual sunshine report   about my Federal Reserve District, if only for fears that the governor of Texas will run around   saying we’ve created 3 trillion percent of the jobs—[laughter]—in America, but with one   exception  I want to say that whatever momentum President Pianalto has in her District is solely   due to the fact that the Dallas Mavericks trashed LeBron James and the Miami Heat  [Laughter]   Very quickly, Mr Chairman, what I’m hearing is that liquidity is not an issue  I have   talked about that before; I won’t repeat it  There is no question that the rate of the recovery has   slowed, and I just want to make a few comments on this inflation discussion that we have heard   from many of our colleagues  With regard to the trimmed mean, which, as you know, is our   guidepost in terms of the PCE inflation, the fraction of prices declining has come down to   29 percent in the last PCE measurement  In two of the last three months, the number of   components increasing at a rate greater than 2 percent have exceeded 50 percent, and that   number has been near 50 percent in three of the last four months  Having said that, we have seen   a rise in the trimmed mean, but over the last 12-month period, and even the 6-month period, we   are really still talking about 1½ to 2 percent  So it has risen from 1, or actually from 09   June 21–22, 2011 139 of 282              The anecdotal evidence is something of a cognitive dissonance message  Going back to   President Lockhart’s initial intervention, we are hearing from the big-box retailers that they are   indeed passing through price increases  In one particular instance, starting at the end of June,   40 to 50 percent of their entire product line will put through price increases of between 5 and   8 percent  Dissonance comes from those with alternative business models  Dollar General, for   example, has made it clear it is just going to eat into its margin to buy market share, so there’s a   bit of a tug of war taking place  We are hearing constant concerns about escalating prices in   China due to not only wage increases in an effort to push people inland, but also the   transportation differentials and the structural changes associated with the infrastructure of   moving inland; you are still running at 15 to 18 percent in terms of adjusted labor costs  The   good news is that people are looking elsewhere in terms of changing their supply chains and are   doing so rather quickly  This puts Mexico, by the way, despite its crime problem, in a much   better light  I was reminded at the last meeting that I have to be careful about using anecdotal   evidence, but I think it’s not clear yet whether or not these companies will succeed in pushing   through these price increases Yet significant price increases, on the order of 5 to 8 percent, are   indeed planned at present on some basic products, ranging from diapers to paper products to   essentials  We’ll have to see what happens, because I think that might affect inflationary   expectations   With regard to job creation, one of the things that I am concerned about is the constant   effort by businesses to enhance productivity  This was mentioned earlier, I believe, by President   Evans  Again, they’re using inexpensive money, widely available capital, to continue to drive   their productivity—and I know the numbers have come down—to try to do as much work and   have as much output in goods and services with the least amount of human labor possible  So I   June 21–22, 2011 140 of 282              remain very concerned about job creation in the United States  And I think this dampening of   demand and this slowdown that we have all discussed here may further that process and retard   the process of job creation  I will report one thing I have noticed in my own sampling of   anecdotal evidence from the CEOs and have now heard from other people  For example, Ivan   Seidenberg’s last act as the head of the Business Roundtable was to instruct the staff to reduce   the estimations of cap-ex and headcount, because what both of us have noticed is that those that   operate internationally seem to be much more optimistic about the United States than those that   operate solely in the United States  So I am worried about job creation  I do note that there’s a   tug of war taking place on the price front  It is driven not simply by commodity prices, and I   think that still needs to be resolved  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Bill, when you say that alternative C would upset the markets, you’re   referring to the third paragraph, I presume, and I would be curious if you would be kind enough,   from your perspective, to parse the difference between paragraphs 1 and 2 in B and C  Other   than one sentence, which is in alternative C, paragraph 2—“However, the upside risks to   inflation have increased somewhat,”—is there really a significant difference between the first   two paragraphs of B and C?    And maybe the difference is that one sentence in alternative C,   paragraph 2, “the upside risks”    Thank you    Mr Chairman, I’m going to pick up where President Kocherlakota left off   because I agree with his analysis and with his sentiment  I’m getting increasingly close to   alternative C, but I’m going to suggest at this meeting that we should play it up the middle and   adopt alternative B  The reasons for that are manyfold  One is the weakness that we heard   discussed at this meeting, although, like President Pianalto and President Plosser, I would say   that one reporting period does not a trend make, and I would change the words as suggested in   paragraph 1 and take out the “loss of momentum”  I’ll come back to that in just a second  The   second reason is because we are in the midst of, I hope, the finalization of a budget/debt ceiling   debate  I’d like to keep the focus on fiscal policy; I don’t want monetary policy to be a   distraction  Third are the developments in Japan and Europe  And the fourth is what I view as   extreme market sensitivity to what we say and what we do at this juncture, despite the discussion   we had yesterday and some apparent alleviation of what we detected a little bit last week  So I   would recommend playing it up the middle with alternative B   In terms of the language, I would like to support Presidents Williams’s and   Kocherlakota’s suggestion to take out that part of the first sentence in paragraph 3—that is, to   have it read, “To promote the ongoing economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over   time, is at levels consistent with its mandate, the Committee will keep the target range,” et cetera,   and Presidents Plosser’s and Pianalto’s suggestion to remove “loss of momentum” in   paragraph 1  I must say that I find paragraphs 1 and 2 in alternative C, even with the conclusion   we have in alternative B, to be much more palatable and, in fact, to reflect what I heard discussed   yesterday  I say that with a caveat of somebody who has been married 37 years and is a selective   listener  [Laughter]  But I do think—and Bill, I appreciate very much your including my   June 21–22, 2011 183 of 282              comment on putting imported goods in the statement—it’s really the result of how firms react,   and we did hear discussion, and it is a fact, that firms are reacting by trying to figure out if they   can get away with raising costs or not  While I don’t want to argue the point too hard, I’m much   more sympathetic to the first two paragraphs in alternative C   I want to raise one flag of caution, Mr Chairman  I think President Williams is correct    On either side we need to think about what we will do under different scenarios, and I think I   understand what Bill is saying, but I’d be extremely careful about the concluding sentence you   had in your summary, Mr Chairman, about greater or extended accommodation that may be   needed to achieve the intended effects  I referenced a soufflé yesterday  I couldn’t quite hear   your response, but you said something about a Bernanke–Greenspan put  There is an expectation   in the market that that is out there  I think the point that Bill was making—and I tried to make a   little bit yesterday—is that the potency of our standard monetary accommodation, large-scale   asset purchases, is diminishing over time  That doesn’t mean we rule out trying to think of other   alternatives, and I think that’s a good idea  And there has even been a suggestion from President   Rosengren that we consider other variables—in your case, the interest paid on excess reserves  I   would be very careful about how we state Bill’s point in the minutes  And, again, I would do as   little as possible in this statement and especially in your press conference—go right up the   middle of the course, be very bland, and do nothing that upsets the marketplace or tilts the   balance one way or another because we’re at a very uncertain point  Thank you, Mr Chairman    No, but how it’s reflected in the minutes is my point  And I don’t   disagree with Bill, by the way  Bill and I have talked about this before  But in terms of how we   reflect it in the minutes, I think it’s very, very important  We’re going to be scrutinized very   carefully    And I would encourage you to discourage it  You can’t come out and say   that, but I’m glad to hear you say it      I do want to keep “employment” in there  I mean, after all, we have a   dual mandate  I do also agree we should get rid of “loss of momentum”  Maybe you could use   Charlie’s alternative language or you could just say that “The economic recovery and   employment are continuing at a moderate pace, though somewhat more slowly than we had   expected,” so you could work the word “employment” in there  I don’t want to eliminate it   entirely in the first paragraph  It’s improving much more slowly than we had expected, but it’s   still continuing    Does that answer your question?    If I can add to Janet’s and Eric’s point—and Eric nailed it, saying it’s an   appeal to common sense—what we don’t want is for people to speculate or telescope policy   decisions either publicly or, very importantly, in a way that someone can profit  That’s really   what this comes down to  We’re not trying to suppress thought or research that informs us  It’s   really a matter of—particularly on the staff level but also among principals—telescoping or   speculating about where we’re likely to end up after a meeting, as we approach that meeting, or   what the next steps may be or the intention of the Committee is in terms of the next steps it’s   going to take  I come back to Eric’s key point and Janet’s, these are commonsense guidelines,   and I think that’s the spirit in which we crafted them, and it’s the spirit with which they should   be observed    I don’t want to jump ahead here, but this is why I’m chary about putting   specific time references in here  The point is, I can see both sides of the argument  We’re going   to do it in a way that is designed to minimize the extent to which we might affect the allocation   of credit across sectors of the economy  The reason we put a time frame in there—and, I would   argue, one of the arguments for that—would be just to make sure it’s clear this isn’t going to go   on forever  Forgive me, Mr Hoenig, but I have a feeling that’s your driving impetus here  But,   you know, this is a debate—“four to five,” “three to five”  First, we don’t know when the sales   are going to start  And, second, we are going to do it in a way that minimizes its impact  That’s   what our expectations are  So I could argue both sides  I agree with Tom’s concern, I don’t   June 21–22, 2011 217 of 282              want this to be pushed off indefinitely  But I think we are boxing ourselves in again by having a   specific time frame here  I don’t think we need to do that right now    My preference, trusting that this thing will not go on forever and that the   Manager will not allow it to exist forever, would simply be to say that, “Once sales begin, the   pace of sales are expected to be aimed at eliminating our holdings of agency securities over a   period designed to minimize the extent to which the SOMA portfolio might affect the allocation   of credit across sectors of the economy”  We could break it up like we did that last sentence, but   the point is to take out the specific time reference of three or four to five years    I would do the same  The problem is putting a specific time frame in   there  We can argue how many angels dance on the head of a pin  Is it “two to three” or “three   to five”?  But I’m also sympathetic to Tom’s argument here, in that we want to at least have an   outer limit    The one thing we agree on is, we don’t want to disrupt the marketplace    What we don’t agree on is the time frame   June 21–22, 2011 218 of 282               “Three to five” encompasses “four to five,” so, therefore, I would vote for   “three to five”  [Laughter]  "
9251,2011-08-01,"  Mr Chairman, I presume that the effect of the money market funds’   activities that Brian mentioned is reflected in an increase in excess balances held by us  Is that   correct, Brian?    Thank you    I just want to get oriented here  I’ve been out of the country for a little   bit, but when we last met as a Federal Open Market Committee, I think excess reserves were   running around $900 billion—am I correct that they’re currently running about $124 trillion?    Does anybody, Brian or anybody else, have a sense of those numbers?    So we haven’t seen it all run into excess reserves then  That’s the point    There’s not much of a change    Thanks, Bill    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I went away and came back, and I am   delighted to see that, maybe for the first time despite our close personal friendship, I’m probably   more in agreement with President Evans than I’ve ever been before  I don’t know if it’s a time   warp of having been to Italy or a time warp of being in an almost dysfunctional place like the   United States, but anyway, I don’t disagree with most of what President Evans said   As to the first five points, I have no problem there, with the slight caveat that under dire   circumstances I would worry that we might be a price determiner, and I’m not fully comfortable   with the assumption that competition among primary dealers would help ensure that the prices   August 1, 2011 36 of 53              the Desk accepts are the market values  So that’s a minor concern, depending on how dire the   circumstance becomes   With regard to proposals 6 through 10, again, I’m on Charlie’s wavelength there  So   much depends in proposal number 6 on the definition of “broader market functioning”    President Plosser made the point that we need some clarification here  I think that’s very   important  But it seems to me that proposal number 6 would be sensible if, indeed, there was   market disruption, once we have that well defined  As far as proposal number 7 is concerned, I   don’t have significant problems with that  Neither of those—6 or 7—has issues on which I am   immovable  On proposal number 8, I think Eric, as usual, has given wise counsel  We need to   have a longer-term solution for money market funds  I do think invoking 13(3), whether it be   under the current circumstance where we have to do it industry-wide or before where we did it   for individual firms, can create political pushback  I would say that it might be acceptable if we   had a serious and dire liquidity situation  There is a difference between that and solvency issues    When we had a discussion about those money market mutual funds that were in dire straits due   to the circumstance in Europe, we found that there were some small firms in particular that might   be a tripwire for concerns in the marketplace  I think we have to be extremely careful how we   navigate our way through the difference between liquidity, market dysfunction, and just bad   management and bad structure on the part of the money market mutual funds  With regard to   points 9 and 10, again, Bill and Brian made it clear that these were unlikely outcomes  I would   be personally firmly against either one of them  To me it would be basically political dynamite    It would be QE3 in defaulted securities  Charlie made the carefully crafted statement that “item   10 is a sterilized version of item 9,” and in summary, I would view both as political dynamite,   August 1, 2011 37 of 53              and if not political dynamite, certainly political black powder  It’s not an avenue I would wish to   go down   Finally, Mr Chairman, going back to President Kocherlakota, who wrote a superb memo   at the very beginning of this exercise in response to the first memo sent out by Bill and by Brian,   I think your personal touch here in what we communicate at the right point is very important  At   some point I want to have a discussion, and I hope you’ll tolerate that discussion among the   principals of the FOMC, as to what you say in Jackson Hole because the last time we spoke in   Jackson Hole, we set in train a policy process that had not yet been fully cleared and worked   through with the entire Committee  I think there’s going to be an extraordinary amount of   attention under the current circumstances and particularly given that, under the proposals we’ve   heard that Linda so adequately summarized, we really haven’t solved much of the problems   other than a temporary relief on the debt ceiling and a pushout of the possible date for default  I   would like to make a mental note here and a request for you to consider that we very carefully   think through what might be said because, again, you’re our leader, and your personal touch here   is critical   Finally, I’d like to thank Bill and Brian for the memo and thank Bill personally for   calling me abroad and walking me through this in the most thoughtful way  Thank you, Mr   Chairman  "
9273,2011-08-09,"  I want to go back to panels 1 and 3 in your exhibits  In your view, from   the standpoint of our New York Fed surveys, is there a substantial concentration of people who   expect us to either raise rates or shrink our balance sheet in the foreseeable future?  When we say   “extended period,” it appears to me that these are confirming the fact that it’s really an extended   period, not the next one or two months  Is that correct or incorrect from the standpoint of what   you hear on the street?    And do you sense that that has increased or decreased over the past few   weeks?  Just in terms of your gut    And as to panel 6, where would you say we are in terms of historic   valuation guidelines in terms of the S&P 500, even after this correction?    Mr Chairman, I’ll remark on that during my comments  I just have one   other question for Brian, if I may  And that is, because there is a lot of the chatter in the market   about substantial liquidity parked in excess reserves, I just want to understand the dynamics   there  Do we know what percentage or what amount of excess reserves is foreign banks versus   domestic large banks?    So 50–50   August 9, 2011 11 of 162               Thank you    Actually, Mr Chairman, Bill makes a good point there  This goes back to   Ben Graham’s original analysis  You know that Shiller did a substantial amount of work in   terms of cyclical adjustment  After yesterday’s correction, we’re at 19 times earnings, and I do   want to remind the Committee that things can be worse  The normal valuation is about 19 and a   half  We got down to 66 in August of ’82, 83 in ’74  So— just to pump up the enthusiasm at   this table—I think one of the arguments that might be made is that there is substantial downside   left  This is just one of many valuation models that we can look at  I think Bill has a good point    Thank you, Brian  Thanks for your good work    I have one question for Mike and one for David  Mike, you talked about   the widening of spreads  You mentioned Italy and Spain  You did not mention France  This is   something that I raised last time  I believe the spreads have widened somewhat in France    I’m hearing more noise about concern about the French fiscal situation, in   addition to their bank exposure  Could you take a minute to comment on France?  Is this   something serious, or is it something that people are just piling onto as they look for other   problems?    Very quickly, David, we seem to be lurching back and forth—all of us, by   the way; not just Board staff, but Bank staff as well—in terms of our outlook for the economy    And we’re constantly asking ourselves, what have we been missing, or what did we miss, and   how useful are our various models, depending on their degree of sophistication, in terms of being   of assistance to us in trying to get a sense of what’s developing in the economy?  I wonder if, at   some point—we may not do it now, but it strikes me that one of the issues that I don’t think we   understand very well—this is my working hypothesis—is how our models are affected by overall   deleveraging  Consumer sector deleveraging, for sure  Certainly a releveraging has taken place   in the business sector amongst corporate credits, and, right now, what I expect to be a significant   deleveraging is happening in the fiscal sector—that is, with the federal, state, and local   governments  This is just really a request that we pursue this a little bit more  I see by your   nodding of your head, I think I may be correct  But I do think it’s something that’s inhibiting our   understanding—a better understanding of this would probably enhance our understanding of   what’s going on with the economy    Well, I didn’t mean that in a pejorative sense  I mean, we’re trying to   come to grips, let’s put it that way    I’ll take a chapter from Governor Tarullo’s opening monologue and   dispense with the average presentation  I do want to note from my corporate contacts that,   regardless of the sector, whether it’s rail activity, electricity usage, cargo hauled through the air   or on the seas, airline traffic advance bookings, restaurant pricing, or even one of my favorite   leading indicators, elective surgery—which, by the way, has declined significantly nationwide,   but showing the difference between my District’s performance and elsewhere, cosmetic and   elective surgery is up in Texas [laughter]—there is no question that we are seeing, in the reports   given by business leaders, a mystically stated “slowdown in the pace of play”  Also, in terms of   not embracing shibboleths that are dear to some of us, I think I have been reporting that   inflationary pressure, particularly as we look at it from a trimmed-mean standpoint, certainly   seems well contained and within reasonable bounds  It’s not an issue that I find myself   preoccupied with any longer   I must say, Mr Chairman, I’m a little concerned when I hear people talk about the way   the markets—and they’re talking about the equity markets, but I think we’re also talking about   broader market phenomena—have behaved in the past few days  And having been a market   operator, working under the strong sense that markets are manic-depressive mechanisms, I think   we have to be very careful not to overreact  We do know—as we mentioned earlier in the   previous discussion we had, particularly with Brian—that we’ve had worse periods  ’82, ’74,   August 9, 2011 44 of 162              March of 2009  So there is substantial downside here  I would simply say that I think things   have gotten worse  I think we have to call a spade a spade   One of the things that I believe firmly has compounded the pessimism or, put it this way,   the lesser enthusiasm I am hearing from my corporate interlocutors—which is one difference I   bring to this table; whether it’s valid or not is to be decided by others—is that we cannot ignore   the fact that the debt ceiling negotiations were an absolute debacle  And we have, if not an   incompetent government—and I’m not referring to the Administration, I’m talking about the   structure—then certainly one that does not give rise to confidence  Now, I spent 10 days in Italy,   away from the lead-up to the congressional vote  By the way, full disclosure  President Pianalto   was in Italy also  We were not together; we were in separate parts of Italy  And I was reading   the correspondence we had through encryption in terms of possible alternative actions that might   be taken in the event of a default  One thing I did not see was any television for 10 days  When   I got back, I got off the plane, went to exercise to get over my jet lag the night before the House   vote, turned on the television, and scanned through CNN, the networks—even Fox, which I don’t   ordinarily watch  I was taken aback by the frenetic nature of the discussion, but most   importantly by what I felt would be a signal that would be received by average consumers, which   is having been told by their President, their congressperson of either party, and their senator that   the sky is falling  My immediate reaction would have been to turn to my spouse, if I were an   ordinary consumer, and say, “My God, we cannot take this trip  We cannot buy X or Y, and we   cannot do this or that”  If I were a business leader—and this is what I did hear in my subsequent   discussions with CEOs—I’d be standing, arms crossed, legs spread, saying, “Show me  Where   is the tax regime going to change?  What about the subsidies that I hold so dear for my   August 9, 2011 45 of 162              industry—that I’ve lobbied so hard over generations to get?  How are spending patterns going to   change?  And very, very importantly, what are you going to do to me on the regulatory front?”   Here’s my point  The problem we have now is, there’s no question we’ve had very weak   demand  If you look at mall traffic, which is aspirational goods largely—nothing necessary is   sold in a mall—and talk to the interlocutors I talk to, it has dropped to zero from a pace in the   first quarter of 3 percent  Off-mall traffic has dropped to 26 percent over the past three weeks,   largely owing to sales of food, which is a necessity  But there’s been weak confidence  There   has been a very tenuous—and Governor Tarullo used the term—a sort of “halting” one step   forward, one step back; it’s not continuous  But we all know it’s been somewhat tentative in   terms of confidence, and confidence has been undermined  It has not been undermined by   monetary policy  It’s been undermined by nonmonetary factors  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Yes  Why not say “financial conditions have become more volatile”?  I   don’t believe, particularly after Governor Duke’s intervention and the point that Dennis just   August 9, 2011 92 of 162              made with regard to Treasuries, that you could argue, other than the downturn in the equity   markets and a slight widening in spreads, that financial conditions have become “more   restrictive”  Volatile?  Yes  Restrictive?  I’d question that    Everybody knows that    Delete it    You wouldn’t be willing to put a number on that—2 percent, or a   number?    May I defer two or three slots until I have listened to others, Mr   Chairman?  I’d like to hear some more arguments    Mr Chairman, I’m sympathetic to your concern  We’re expressing, as   you said, a general darkening of mood and expectations  The issue is, what action do we take?    And there is a proposal on the table by Governor Yellen, which I’m not willing to support  I’m   not willing to support it because it’s asymmetric—that is, it talks about maintaining rates low as   long as unemployment exceeds 7½ percent and a medium-term outlook for inflation remains   subdued, undefined  We have a lot of work to do to define our comfort level here  I’m   sympathetic to President Evans, but I think the asymmetry of it will create problems further   down the path   I worry about paragraph 1 because there’s a lot that’s unspoken in here  I would like to   actually add a sentence—which I don’t think I’ll get, but I’m going to state it anyway  That is,   after we talk about how housing has flattened out, investment in nonresidential structures is still   weak, and the housing sector remains depressed, which is true, I would like to add the following   August 9, 2011 115 of 162              language  “Uncertainty regarding non-monetary-policy initiatives appears to have added to the   hesitancy of businesses’ willingness to expand payrolls, utilize existing capital, and add physical   capacity, although business investment in productivity-enhancing equipment and software   continues to expand”  I would further insert that “uncertainty has been compounded by financial   developments in Europe”  For some reason, we’re not mentioning this  I think these are   significant factors   I think there are risks to us going further than we’ve already gone  I understand the   desire to act, but I think we have to think through those actions, and presently I don’t think we   have a consensus at the table that we should do more  I am not willing to vote in favor of doing   more  I think the proposal that Governor Yellen has put forward, which I’m somewhat   sympathetic to, is too asymmetric  I take President Bullard’s point seriously—that is, that   pushing things out to 2013 looks too politically convenient—and I just think we don’t have   enough information at this juncture  I would endorse alternative B with the enhancement or   complication that I’ve added, and I’m not willing to support much more than that  I think we   have to be extremely careful here  We need to conduct monetary policy in the most deliberate   way, not a reactionary way  We have had a significant market selloff, which we talked about   earlier with Brian  In terms of valuation levels, we could have a great deal further to go  I think   the tool kit that we have in place has limited potential because we’ve exhausted much of what we   have still in our pocket  Thank you, Mr Chairman    At this juncture    I’m sorry, because we do have two more to go, and then we should   probably have a discussion, but I’d be extremely cautious on “2013,” Mr Chairman  It just   looks so politically convenient  I really think that through your good efforts of communication,   through the actions taken by this Committee, we’ve in essence, removed ourselves from the heat   of the political debate  I think we’re less suspect in the eyes of our critics than we have been    And I think the attention is rightly focused on getting this fiscal situation under control  I might   have different prescriptions than what has been suggested, but the focus is back on the Congress,   with the assistance of the executive  The “2013” just looks too politically convenient, and I   don’t want to fall back into people being suspicious about the way we conduct our business  So I   just want to plead on that front  I think it’s a mistake  I think it would then allow those who are   trying to squirm out of their duties of actually getting their act together on fiscal policy—  whatever that act is—to put the finger back on us  And it’s unfortunately after an election, and   it’s a declaration before we know what the outcome is of what’s likely to happen on the fiscal   side, which is critical here  So I wanted to plead that we do not adopt that specific date, given   that it is ultra-inconvenient and given that we have worked very hard—and you have taken   special personal risk in terms of your communications—to lower the temper and suspicion about   monetary policy  I think this would raise the suspicion and make us look like we’re way too   politically acquiescent, whatever our personal politics may be    No   PARTICIPANT  “End of 2012,” then   August 9, 2011 127 of 162               It depends on the conditions  But look, again, we have restored our   integrity to a great degree, and I don’t want to put a dent in it    Right now you have “extended period”  “Extended period” is indefinite    That’s an interesting suggestion      I’m confused as to where we are right now, Mr Chairman  Maybe I’ll let   Governor Raskin finish, but I think Governor Tarullo’s suggestion is worth thinking about   August 9, 2011 131 of 162               Me, too    Let’s get it right    Mr Chairman, could you read the full sentence for me, please?  I’m sorry    Yes, sir   August 9, 2011 136 of 162               Mr Chairman, again, I think we have labored mightily to make clear that   we are as politically independent as possible    But sir, it may well be interpreted as that by our critics  We have   mitigated our critics substantially  Why don’t we just say “for a substantial period”?  I mean,   we’re putting a date on here    The date happens to be right after the election—I cannot support that    It would be nice to see the whole thing so that we know what we’re   voting on  "
9300,2011-09-20,"  This is just a comment, Mr Chairman, but you gave a speech in October   2003, which was titled “Monetary Policy and the Stock Market  Some Empirical Results,” and   you spoke of how—and I loved the particular word that you used because it had such emotion to   it—the market “quivers” as they await the FOMC’s decision  And you concluded, obviously,   September 20–21, 2011 11 of 290              that FOMC decisions can move markets  I’m interested, in listening to Brian today and the past   many, many reports we’ve had—really, beginning with your third slide, you talked about the   market’s anticipation of our lengthening of duration  So we’ve moved from the meeting itself to   expectations of what we’d accomplish at the meeting, which are oddly correlated with what   we’re actually contemplating  And we might be tempted to conclude that these quivers, or   whatever you might call them, would then lead to tremors if we don’t act according to what the   market’s expecting   I guess the question I have is, is there a way we can better understand this?  There’s an   uncanny resemblance, as I said earlier, to what we’re actually discussing and what markets are   thinking about, and then we are tempted, perhaps, to live in fear that if we don’t deliver   according to market expectations, we’ll have a very harsh reaction  In other words, markets are   anticipating quivering before we act rather than upon our action, as you articulated so well in   2003  I don’t think things have changed that much since 2003  There’s more information, the   net is much more thorough, we have more market operators, et cetera, but something is amiss   here  And I wonder if we could at least think about that  Maybe the Board staff or a group of us   could form a committee to get a better feeling for how this is happening, what it means, and   whether it is affecting the way we make decisions?  Because I’m concerned about that—and this   isn’t a criticism of you, you’re just reporting what you’re finding in the marketplace—from   slide 3 onward to the very last one  That’s one point  The second point—and it’s most un-  central-bank-like, it’s un-Bagehot-like—is that they’re expecting us to move into assets that   everybody else is demanding right now—until you got to your mortgage-backed security slide    Those are just observations, but I’m very concerned that we might be influenced by market   expectations  I’m not sure how those market expectations are built, but things have progressed a   September 20–21, 2011 12 of 290              little bit, Mr Chairman, since that speech in October 2003, which I thought, for the record, was a   very good speech    Or transparency    Again, because both of us used to do this for a living, I think you’re right    I think what the Chairman said is most important  We let what is in the best interest of the real   economy guide us, not what the markets expect us to do at any one meeting  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    Eric’s point is very good, and I think the point about domestic banks is   very good  But I thought that under Regulation D, we couldn’t pay interest rates on bank   balances that exceeded market rates  Is that true or false?  What is the law, and what do the   regulations require?    Short-term interest rates are defined as?    But Eric just laid out all the way to two years  It must be defined   somewhere  Did we not codify this in Regulation D—was it section 204?    Thank you    I think that’s an important question  I think an even more important   question is whether it would induce banks to lend more  Have we had a chance to survey banks?    Seth, you may have an answer to this    Mr Chairman, you’re going to hear a lot of different views around this   table, and some of them have already been expressed, so I will try to be concise, which means I   won’t be  I’ll go in reverse order here  Generally speaking, I’d prefer focusing on   communications policy over working our balance sheet  Parts of those reasons have already   been expressed  I’m still at sixes and sevens trying to figure out the right communications   policy, and actually, I was somewhat encouraged by paragraph 2 in alternate A  I was   discouraged by the specifics that were outlined in paragraph 4  But I do think we should have a   good, robust discussion about this as we go forward   Going in reverse order up to number 1 and the questions that were asked, I’m quite   sympathetic to what Eric argued earlier, but I’m undecided in terms of the efficacy, which is the   key question, because it’s not clear to me yet—and perhaps we could learn more—that if we did   lower the IOER, it would indeed induce banks to lend  Therefore, I asked the question of Seth,   and I think his answer was that it’s not clear   I’d like to focus my comments, if I may, on, first, 1(a), which is the potential efficacy of   policy tools tied to the size and composition of our balance sheet  And I would say that if the   choice is between more QE and twisting, then twisting wins hands down  That’s the good news    September 20–21, 2011 57 of 290              The bad news is, it’s a Hobson’s choice  And I believe both provide perverse incentives  The   key questions are  (1)  What are the magnitudes of the effects from the reduction in the   outstanding supply of longer-term Treasuries?  (2)  How do these effects extend beyond the   market for Treasuries to yields on corporate debt or mortgages or into the stock market? and (3)    What is its impact on savings and consumption?  Well, that’s what I think we’re trying to deal   with  The answers to 1 and 2 are “not that big”; that is, they don’t have much influence  And the   answer to 3 is “not so much”   Krishnamurthy—which, by the way, always sounds to me like a Hindu–Irish combination   of bloodlines—and Vissing-Jorgensen at Northwestern University estimated that QE2 had   roughly a 20 basis point reduction in Treasury yields but that it had a much smaller effect on   corporate yields; they estimated we had a 7 to 12 basis point effect for investment-grade   securities  Swanson’s study at the San Francisco Fed has been referred to twice, I believe, in this   conversation so far  He went back and looked at the original Operation Twist, which, I might   add, was announced by President Kennedy on February 2, 1961, roughly corresponding to the   bottom of the business cycle  But Swanson estimated, as was mentioned by Charlie, that the   original Operation Twist had about a 15 basis point reduction in long-term yields and, very   importantly, as President Plosser mentioned, a 2 to 4 basis point impact on corporate yields    What worries me is that the confidence bands that surround the studies that were sent to us are   awfully wide  I found it interesting that the Board staff memo now concludes that QE2 had half   of the impact that we had originally guessed, and the Board and the New York Fed memo now   estimates the maximum effect of a reinvestment maturity extension program transfer of, say,   $275 billion as lowering 10-year yields 7 basis points  So these are very modest effects or   benefits, Mr Chairman, which I think need to be weighed against the cost of exposing the Fed’s   September 20–21, 2011 58 of 290              balance sheet to a greater amount of interest rate risk, because longer-duration assets decline   more in value versus short-duration assets in response to interest rate increases   In summary, I want to mention that, as I said earlier, most of these variations that have   been suggested are very un-Bagehot-like  And what I mean by that is, twisting entails   purchasing assets that investors are fleeing toward, not assets that they are fleeing from  When I   talk about perverse incentives, I’m worried about any action along these lines incenting people to   hoard more, particularly savers  I’m actually concerned about its impact on pension funds  I   don’t know if we’ve gone through the numbers and studied that or not  But the way pension   fund accounting works, and particularly for government and organized labor workers who are   more given to defined-benefit programs, is that lower interest rates raise the expenses required   and require more funding  Incidentally, I asked our staff to examine a decline in the interest rate   or return assumption from 5¼ percent return to 5 percent, just on Federal Reserve employees   alone, and it increases the expense requirement or the additional reserving by $300 million  So   we need to think through the practical consequences of this in terms of the cost and what impact   it would have, not only on the sense of a need to hoard more for those who earn less, are out of   work, or are worried about the small value of their savings, but also on institutional investment   and what impact it might have   Also, larger holdings of longer-term debt may make future decisions regarding short-term   rate increases more politically contentious  The good news is that the bind of extending the   maturity or duration of our portfolio might encourage investors short term, but it could hurt our   maneuverability and undermine confidence—a key word that’s been mentioned many times   around this table—in our ability to conduct independent policy  Similarly, long-term duration   exposes us to losses, and yes, we might take comfort under that very adverse scenario that you   September 20–21, 2011 59 of 290              had in your chartbook, that we can book these curtailed future advances to Treasury as a deferred   credit asset on our books  It’s reasonable, however, to hypothesize that the prospect of such   losses could discourage rate increases when the time comes  Conversely, the stronger the   recovery, the greater the losses the Fed is likely to suffer should it actually want to tighten  And   the political incentive to hold rates down becomes stronger precisely when you want to unmoor   it  So those are my comments on 1(a)  Again, I would prefer to stress communications than deal   with the balance sheet   Just a general comment in terms of the SEP exercise, because I think President   Kocherlakota, or maybe it was you, opened up the discussion of fed funds  I’m a little bit   concerned about how that exercise would work  It’s one thing to state our destination  Let me   use a simple analogy  If I say I want to drive to Abilene, and I want to get there by a certain   hour, that’s my goal  As far as the fed funds rate is concerned, to me that’s the degree to which I   press down on the accelerator—how many inches or, to the degree we talk about things, how   many angstroms  And I don’t think that’s a very realistic exercise  What counts is the   topography that we encounter, the roadblocks that we encounter, and how we’re going to   maneuver our way around them  But it’s not terribly practicable or sensible to forecast the   degree to which we’re going to press the accelerator by so many inches or so many angstroms,   because that’s likely to change depending on the conditions that govern either the vehicle we’re   driving or the terrain through which we’re trying to drive  So I have some questions there, Mr   Chairman, that I think would be worthy of discussion  But in general, as I said earlier, it’s   important for us to think about communications  There are real dangers for dealing with the   balance sheet under the two different options that have been suggested, and the point that this is a   one-time effect is of great concern   September 20–21, 2011 60 of 290              When we talk about contingency planning, my concern is, what do we do if the S&P goes   to 600?  I talked about that before  It’s a real possibility  What do we do if we end up with a   disaster in Europe?  A real possibility  What do we do if there’s some kind of exogenous   development that just completely takes us for a whack?  That’s the kind of contingency planning   I think we should be talking about, rather than diddling at the margins here for limited returns    Governor Duke made a very good point in the last meeting, which is that we have limited   ammunition  We must use it very carefully  And I believe the proposals that we’ve seen so far   are expending that limited ammunition for a limited return  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Yes, sir  And let me also just add, if I may, that I’m delighted with the   framework exercise because I think that’s really what we should be discussing, and I look   forward to it  Thank you    Mr Chairman, can I intercede here to ask Governor Raskin’s views?    Real quickly, Steve  Also on the negative potential side—Turkey, Brazil,   and China—our staff work indicates that there’s substantial overheating, certainly in the first   September 20–21, 2011 120 of 290              two, and at risk in the third  Banking systems are highly fragile  Have you factored that into   your discouraging scenarios?    Thank you    Mr Chairman, it may surprise many at this table that, like President   Rosengren, I’m more concerned now about developments on the employment front than about   those on the inflation front, and I’ll reverse the order of comments  Unlike President Williams,   I’m going to lead off with inflation and explain my views, talk about what I hear from the CEOs   and my business contacts, and then mention an issue that I think is of great importance to us but   one that we often do not talk about   I will dispense with talking about Texas—because we have a presidential candidate who   talks about it too much [laughter]—except to say that the data are a little fuzzy  We had   3½ million acres burn and an enormous amount of destruction in terms of homes and agriculture,   and it’s difficult to decipher the August data on events that took place during what is now the   hottest summer on record in the history of the United States, surpassing that in 1934 in   Oklahoma during the Dust Bowl  So I won’t bore you with that   With regard to inflation, I want to correct one thing that Eric mentioned, which is a   concern that I also have  If you look at the growth of wage and salary increases on a four-quarter   basis, it is quite limited at 15 percent  If you look at total compensation, which includes   benefits, it’s actually risen to 22 percent  Despite that, all of our indicators from the trimmed   September 20–21, 2011 139 of 290              mean PCE indicate that inflation is settling in around the 2 percent range  We have seen some   pressure in core goods  We’ve also seen some in core services—one of the previous   interlocutors mentioned owners’ equivalent rent and rents—but if we look at the 178 items that   we carefully track, we’re seeing it settle in at about a 2 percent rate  And I do believe that the   headline inflation rate, as you seemingly posit, is trending more in that direction than trending   the other way, such as President Lockhart mentioned   Not unimportantly, one has to consider what is the risk of deflation, and I note in that   light that the fraction of components experiencing price declines within the 178 items that we   carefully track for the trimmed mean PCE has fallen to a much more normal level in the past few   months—certainly more normal than it was during the deflationary scare period of 2008 to 2010    It now averages closer to 30 percent, as opposed to the 40 percent level that it was running   during that period  So I can see inflation coming in around 2 percent, trending toward that from   its current headline rate, which is much higher, driven by core goods and OER, but I do not yet   see signs that deflation is a significant threat   My concern is about economic growth and employment, and if you surveyed all of the   CEOs that I talk to—and I should note for the record that I’ve added a new one, Bunge, which is   a significant agricultural producer—all of them pretty much are on the same note  If you look at   the key ones that I like to look at, which are telephony, semiconductors—because of the nature   of our society—rail movements, logistics, and air transportation, you’re pretty much hearing the   same response  Things have gotten awfully tepid  Volumes have dropped off  The past three   weeks, in particular, the very large telephone companies and communications companies have   seen things almost grind to a halt, and when I say “grind to a halt,” I’m talking about year-over-  year growth reduced nearly to zero  You see the same thing in the rails  Year-over-year   September 20–21, 2011 140 of 290              performance for the rail industry in 2010 was up roughly 10 percent; in the first half of this year,   5 to 6½ percent; and now, it’s running between 0 and 1 percent  I won’t use the profanity that   was repeated almost as though they had decided to collect it at the Business Roundtable with   regard to the issues of what is stymieing their activity  We’ve heard an awful lot about   regulation and uncertainty about fiscal policy  I’ve talked about that in previous meetings, but   there’s no question that there are concerns about final sales and demand   Now, with regard to job creation, President Rosengren mentioned something that I think   we should consider, and that is, he talked about more-stringent supervisory activity over foreign   branches and their activity in the United States  I believe that’s what you said  I want to not   dwell on that subject, but I want to dwell on another aspect of supervision and regulation    Something is wrong with the transmission mechanism  I believe we have created an enormous   amount of liquidity  We see it in terms of excess bank reserves, half of which are domestic   banks  We see it now in the over $2 trillion in liquidity that sits on corporate balance sheets in   excess of working capital needs, and as I’ve noted before—and actually, before he left, Governor   Warsh spoke about it—there’s an enormous amount of liquidity that’s floating through the   nondepository financial system  My concern is that we haven’t figured out how to engage that    Logic tells me that community banks and regional banks play a bigger role than we typically   account for at this table  If small businesses are indeed the job creators or at least the job   incubators, the question is, where do they get their credit?  And I’m wondering, Mr Chairman, if   we think only about monetary policy qua monetary policy and don’t think about how it is   transmitted into what counts most at this juncture of great economic delicacy, job creation, then   all the discussions we’re having about monetary policy are for naught  As I’ve said publicly   over and over and over again because I like the analogy—I hate to bore you with it again—we   September 20–21, 2011 141 of 290              certainly have filled up the gas tanks  Whether we’ve filled them enough or we’ve filled them   too much is another issue, but somehow the business creators and the business incubators are not   depressing the pedal and engaging the transmission mechanism   I would like to suggest, and those who are involved in bank supervision might correct   me, that we certainly spend as much time, if not more, on how we engage that transmission   mechanism, particularly with small community banks—those are the ones that lend to small   businesses and local businesses—and at least oversee our supervisory and regulatory activities so   that we don’t discourage them from transmitting what we’ve created and put into place  I’m   willing to bet that we spend less time thinking about that, and I hope I’m wrong, than we do   about capital ratios, too-big-to-fail, and the problems with systemic risk with the large banking   institutions  But I just fail to see how we’re going to take the liquidity we’ve created—and if   you all decide to create more at this meeting or whatever the decision of the Committee is—and   have it more effectively transmitted into what really counts, which is job creation  I’ll argue   tomorrow that I think many of the activities we’ve undertaken actually have been   counterproductive on that front, but I raise this because I don’t expect anybody else to do it  I’m   more concerned about it than I am about inflation, and I want to put it on the table  Thank you,   Mr Chairman    Yes    I wanted to ask simply a point of information  Is it true to say inflation   has moderated since earlier in the year?  On a year-over-year basis?  Now, we expect it to   moderate, and the rest of the sentence is correct  But is that correct?  I want to check    I was looking at the 12-month for core and the trimmed mean, et cetera    I would just be careful about that  That’s our expectation, but I don’t   think that statement is correct because it depends on what time interval you measure, 12 months,   6 months  I would moderate it somehow were I to support alternative B    Could either of you continue on?  What are the negatives of reinvesting   the roll-offs in MBS, in your opinion?  Bill?    We went through that before    So we have a pretty clear concept of what the costs are  We also have a   pretty clear concept of what the benefits would be  If that spread is widened, we do believe, as   you just summarized, that it will impact mortgage-backed rates and help decrease that spread   over 10-year Treasuries  Is that a correct summary?    Thank you    If I may, Mr Chairman, would it be considered, in your opinion,   counterproductive to those other initiatives?    Yes, sir    Inspired by Governor Tarullo’s laudatory comments yesterday about the   Norges Bank and the reference from my colleague on my left about the Scandinavians, I reached   into my Norwegian mother’s electronic photo album, and I want to read to you the sign that   greets those that are brave enough to go to the northern-most Norwegian islands called Jan   Mayen, where there is a weather station that tries to assess global warming  I’m going to speak a   little Norse here  I will translate it later for the transcripts  But it says, “Teori er når man forstår   alt men ingen ting virker  Praksis er når alt virker men ingen forstår hvorfor”  And what that   translates into—and here is the sign—it says, “Theory is when you understand everything, but   nothing works  Practice is when everything works, but nobody understands why”  It goes on at   the bottom to say, “At this station, theory and practice are united, so nothing works and nobody   understands why”  [Laughter]  Forgive me, the Congress of the United States   Mr Chairman, I cannot support alternative A  I agree with Mr Lacker on his points   about inflation  Governor Yellen went back to 1983 with her long experience  I go back to   thinking about the briefings I gave for Bill Miller’s transition from this wonderful independent   body to the Treasury, and the memory that I tried to recall in my comments for Tom Hoenig   about President Nixon, the Nixon–Burns era  I think it’s extremely dangerous for us to embrace   a 2½ percent inflation number  If you are not persuaded by President Lacker, I would urge   everybody at this table to read former Chairman Volcker’s op-ed in The New York Times  That   is a dangerous course of action to embrace  We have to really think through it extremely   September 20–21, 2011 218 of 290              carefully  I believe President Rosengren and others have mentioned the importance of   distinguishing between ceiling and target, but there is an ultra-sensitivity out there—particularly   if you think in a historic context—of breaching the confidence that we hope to engender with   regard to inflation   There is very little that I can support in alternative B  I put forward my arguments   yesterday in terms of the limited returns and the costs involved with duration extension or   Operation Twist  I even quoted Mr Swanson, who I think is a Swede by bloodline  He is sitting   over there, and I don’t want to put him in an uncomfortable spot  But in terms of the knock-on   effects, as well as the direct effects, I think they are of limited utility, and the costs are quite   great  I particularly am worried about the costs that we have imposed on those who have the   least means, those who are out of work, those who are struggling to keep their jobs, and those   who are aging, like me, and who are becoming more conservative with their portfolios, and   therefore, shortening the duration of their exposure and doing what they are supposed to do  In   other words, those who play by the rules have done what they are supposed to do, and are being   penalized by our interest rate policy   Of interest to me in the recent data that were released by the Census—and I know we are   still looking at our triennial survey—was that the only income group between 2007 and 2010 that   saw an increase in median income were those who are 65 and older  Those who are 65 and older   are not going to take risk in equities  They are going to shorten their duration; they are going to   focus on CDs  They are trying basically to preserve their savings but also are a source of   purchasing power, since all other income demographics—whether it is age, race, or gender—  have seen a declines in their income over the last three years  Every single one of them but   citizens 65 and older   September 20–21, 2011 219 of 290              I cannot see how lowering interest rates increases purchasing power  My logic chain is   very simple  Final demand is horrid right now  How do we bump up final demand?  We need to   have more jobs  How do we create more jobs?  We have to have more spending, more   consumption  We also have to have more incentives  I don’t believe inflating is an incentive; I   believe inflating is a disincentive  And I believe in the basic principle of “do no harm”   I cannot support an extension, and I will not vote for alternative B as it is stated, nor   alternative A  The one thing, which will surprise my colleague Mr Lacker, that seems to make   sense to me is to reinvest the proceeds as proposed by Vice Chairman Dudley from our   mortgage-backed security roll-offs back into mortgage-backed securities  I mentioned yesterday   that everything being contemplated at this table is most un-Bagehot-like  We are going to be   purchasing more of, or extending the duration of, things that people are rushing into  If we do   believe that we are in dire straits, then we should be purchasing things that people are rushing   away from, or where the spreads are widening  By the way, Mr Lacker, we are not allowed to   buy municipals; we have already proceeded down the path of buying mortgage-backed   securities  I think it is sensible in this case to help narrow that spread, which is widening, and I   agree with Vice Chairman Dudley’s argument on that front, and that is one thing that I can   support   I want to conclude with what I started with yesterday  We must plan for the most adverse   outcomes  I articulated what they could be yesterday a significant selloff in our own stock   markets, which by different valuation methods—that at least I learned when I was in the   business—is, if not richly priced, fairly priced, and therefore, has a lot of downside; the debacle   that might ensue in Europe, despite their efforts to prevent it; or other exogenous shocks that   could knock us for a huge loop  Right now, we have very little left in our holster  If you will   September 20–21, 2011 220 of 290              forgive the pun on your initials, Mr Chairman, we are shooting BBs, not bullets  We should   figure out what ammunition we have left, how we might best deploy it, and what more   ammunition we need should those dire circumstances prevail  Therefore, I can only accept   alternative C, and I will vote accordingly  Thank you, Mr Chairman    But, Mr Chairman, this is a very delicate issue, and I think you’re going   to have to figure out if there’s a way to do it when you put out the Frequently Asked Questions   September 20–21, 2011 257 of 290              on September 26  There may have been virtues back in 1961 to doing it hand-in-glove  There   could also be drawbacks to being perceived as doing it hand-in-glove now  You’re going to have   to carefully vet this wherever you vet these things to make sure that we don’t look like we’re   setting this up    Yes, but I would address this in the Frequently Asked Questions that we   provide    Mr Chairman, without giving offense, which I’m sure I will, I do think   it’s important that we all be on board with this, but we also have to be extremely mindful that   none of this leaks out to the public, and that’s what worries me    If any of this contingency planning leaks to the public    Again, I remind myself and everybody else that we have to watch this   very, very carefully as we share what alternatives are being developed    We need to think about that then because we could scare the heck out of   people    And we did it well during the crisis, and there was almost no leakage  So   I just want to remind folks  I think it’s critical  "
9325,2011-11-01,"  Yes, thank you, Mr Chairman  Unlike some operators on Wall Street, we   at the Federal Open Market Committee do pay our debts in full  [Laughter]  I have a debt that I   need to pay back to the gentleman on my left  [Laughter]  I am tempted to claw his eyes out and   scratch his legs during the meeting, but instead, being honorable, this is the bet  [Laughter]    This is beer  This is the elixir of working men and women, and I never   resist giving some facts  Beer is the third-most consumed liquid product in the world after water   and beer  It goes back to at least the Neolithic Period, 9,500 BC  There was a goddess of beer   that the Sumerians have called Ninkasi  And there is a famous prayer that is called “The Hymn   to Ninkasi”  I evoked it so many times during the sixth game, but I found out that Ninkasi,   whoever she was, gave way to the god of Bud  There it is, Shiner Bock, the best of Texas beers    I would have brought you a Lone Star, but real men and women don’t drink light beer    [Laughter]   November 1–2, 2011 4 of 282              Mr Chairman, thank you for giving us this opportunity  I won’t tell you how I snuck it   into this room  I never want to go through that security procedure again  [Laughter]  But you   won, congratulations    It was a terrible World Series  [Laughter]    How smart is your brother-in-law?    Mr Chairman, I am going to start and conclude where President Williams   concluded  That is, I don’t think now is the time, but I do think it is a subject we are studying   First, I want to thank the staff for their good work  I also want to thank them for their   honesty  I thought section 4 about the risks of our models at least, and the faulty potential of our   models, was frank and honest  I do want to have submitted for the record a particularly pungent   sentence, which says, “Given that the strategies we consider lack historical precedent, and even   the tools used to implement the strategies are relatively unconventional, there is considerable risk   that our model results may prove faulty in some respect”  Indeed, any policy outside the range   of historical experience, ranging from the strategies considered here to balance sheet adjustments   and macroprudential regulation, could have unintended consequences for economic welfare, for   November 1–2, 2011 71 of 282              better or for worse  Your section 4 expands upon that somewhat  I thank you for the good work   that you have put together   I am in favor of at least more discipline, if not a rule  I think we have been a little bit   spastic in the way we have developed policy, a little bit reactionary, and we have sent signals to   the marketplace, which then seem to be built into expectations  I would like to see a little bit   more discipline as we go through time   I am in favor of the exercise  I boil it down to two simple principles  We have to be   realistic, and we have to be credible  What I mean by realistic is that we know that we have   more influence on inflation as a monetary phenomenon than we do on employment  What I   mean by credible is that shifting horses, whether we do it midstream or whenever we do it,   cannot be viewed as a weakening of our commitment to price stability, and cannot be viewed as,   in particular, a weakening of our commitment to long-term price stability   I thought President George’s comments were interesting  To me, the key variable is to   identify a longer-term inflation target  I am in favor of doing that  President George pointed out   some issues around that—which target do we pick, under what conditions, and so on—but   talking about having one is a worthwhile exercise   Then, I would want to understand better within this Committee what the bands of   tolerance are around that target if we are going to talk about flexible inflation targeting  Once we   have achieved that understanding, then I think we need to explain to the public that as long as we   have a dual mandate we have to deal with both inflation and unemployment variables  And as   long as we have that mandate, then it may be desirable, if we decide that is the case at this   table—once we have agreed on a long-term inflation target, and our tolerance bands around it—  November 1–2, 2011 72 of 282              that we may have to deviate occasionally from our target on maybe the high or the low side in   order to deal with our employment mandate   This is something that we should take some time to consider  I started this meeting by   giving President Bullard a six-pack of Shiner Bock beer    There are only two left, actually  [Laughter]  Shiner Bock beer, by the   way, Mr Chairman, was picked because the Shiner brewery was founded in 1913, fitting for the   Federal Reserve  But if you look at the way beer is made, out of hops and grains, the standard   formula has been in place since the year 1541 under a ruler of Bavaria named Henry IV  Now,   there have been improvements made to beer, but I think it is something that you would have to   proceed with extremely slowly   I am not suggesting we take another 500-and-some-odd years to change our rule or our   discipline, but I do think that we need to vet the thoughts that have been circling around this   table  Reference has been made to Ms Romer  I thought that was an interesting article    However, I must tell you that all I got out of it was, “Be bold”  That was what her message was    I wasn’t convinced by her argumentation  I have listened very carefully to Ken Rogoff, who is   on our advisory committee at the Dallas Fed and our Globalization and Monetary Policy   Institute  I respect him enormously  And then, I observed the pushback that came from another   person I respect enormously named Paul Volcker  I understand that Tobin made the arguments   in the 1970s, but I also understand that no other central bank has attempted what we are talking   about  You had a slight variation of price-level targeting in 1930 by the Swedes  We love to   evoke the Scandinavians at this table  But it was not held for very long, and it was a variation of   November 1–2, 2011 73 of 282              price-level targeting  To my knowledge, no central bank has adopted nominal income targeting    It is true that Tobin made the argument in 1970  It is true that Martin Feldstein agreed with it   I did have Professor Feldstein down the other day to the Dallas Fed  He is completely   against it presently  Why?  Because he doesn’t think we are quite credible yet in having   anchored—and this is his own personal view—our commitment to long-term price stability  I   come back to long-term price stability  To me, that is the key variable  The flexibility around it   is something that we need to define, and then we need to socialize it  Despite the interest that   has been shown by Goldman Sachs and Christy Romer and others, I think we need to socialize it   further  I would say at a minimum I would take the theoretical work that has been done, and   some of the studies that we are doing, and at least get these out into academia and into a more   serious discussion, so that we can evaluate these alternative policy rules and see what kind of   criticisms come forward   Mr Chairman, in short, I am in favor of trying to achieve greater discipline  I would like   to come up with a rule that is more modernized  I am willing to change the formula to the beer   that we brew, but we should take our time  I would like to suggest that we look at a time horizon   that doesn’t have to be infinite  I would be against changing this horse in midstream now, as   President Williams mentioned  But I would at least like to have these questions discussed and   vetted and thought through—including the risks that I mentioned at the very beginning—over the   course of the next several months, if not half a year  I think it is a worthwhile exercise  Thank   you, Mr Chairman    First, I want to congratulate you on handling MF Global the way you   handled it  I have a question about that, and I have two other questions  But on this front, any   other trip bars that might ensue from MF’s failure that you’re monitoring in terms of its impact   on the system—not the Federal Reserve System, but on the fixed-income markets and on   financial stability?   November 1–2, 2011 105 of 282               I would add a fourth factor, which is humility versus arrogance and   balanced risk  The principals involved here were extremely arrogant, taking the positions that   they had, and were imbalanced in terms of their judiciousness of risks, and I think the markets   are well aware of that   The second area of inquiry I have, Brian, if you look at your chart 1 and chart 8, is with   regard to the way Treasuries have moved and the initial way that corporate bond spreads   moved—remember those spreads are relative to an increase in the yields as shown in chart 1    Can you separate out for me the Operation Twist impact versus the impact of Europe in terms of   influencing the way yields have moved?  The question really deals with the efficacy of Operation   Twist—and mind you, we’re just starting this process—and trying to separate out the seesaw   effect and the whipsaw effect of what’s happening in Europe    What I care about is whether it passed through to private borrowing rates    That’s my priority—how it impacts the market for private debt  Because chart 1 doesn’t indicate   November 1–2, 2011 107 of 282              what one might have expected, but I care more about what happens in terms of private debt    That should be our objective—affecting the real economy  I am curious as to your judgment at   this stage, and mind you, it is initial  And then, how are you able to separate out the seesaw   effect we have gotten from the standpoint of enthusiasm over Europe and then sudden   disappointment on the details?    Thank you  And then, one last quick question  Do we know why the   Norwegians liquidated their MBS portfolio entirely on Friday?    It might be interesting to get as much as we can  They are running a   $500 billion plus sovereign fund  They do interact with the central bank  I haven’t seen an   explanation yet as to why they would liquidate their entire MBS portfolio  If you can just follow   up, I would be very grateful    Thank you    They didn’t explain it in Norwegian or English  [Laughter]    Just a point for David and the international side—to tie them together  In   talking to the oil companies—which include Exxon; it has pretty good information—what they   note is that gasoline–diesel demand is off 2 percent year to date  But what has occurred is that   with the slowdown in European growth, there is less refinery output, meaning less exports to the   November 1–2, 2011 129 of 282              East Coast of the United States  As a result, they haven’t seen the decrease in motor gas prices   that they had expected  So there is this odd phenomenon  It is an international market  It’s   marked off of Brent, by the way, not off of WTI  But it’s a refinery concept  The slowdown in   Europe is actually affecting supply in the United States, even though demand has come up   somewhat  The same is true for av gas—that, in the parlance of business, the crack spread has   just not narrowed  The question is, when will it happen?  But the pressures are moving in that   direction from a demand standpoint  I wanted to make that point   On food prices, the entire structure seems to be supported by Chinese demand  Soybean   oil, for example, which is the most important—10 years ago, they imported 5 million tons; this   year, they’ll import 60 million tons  I mention that because, if you look at the headline PCE   number, Mr Chairman, of that 2 percent, 17 percent was either gasoline or food—14 was gas   and 03 was food—and the rest, the core, of course, was flat, in keeping with what the trimmed   mean was forecasting, as I’ve said, at a six-month run rate   For what it’s worth, I think you need to take note of that phenomenon  The international   side is definitely impacting, in both gas and food, what is happening here in the United States    Thank you, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, I was listening to President Evans  My summary of the   economy is not that we’re sputtering, but we’re loping along rather than galloping, to use a   November 1–2, 2011 150 of 282              Texan term  And I’ll basically say that things are not that much different, but they’re slightly   improved   With regard to my own District, we continue to create private-sector jobs  We created   204,000 private-sector jobs year to date, and lost 41,000 government jobs  Twenty-three   thousand of those were lost in September alone, and yet we still have net job creation  I find it   interesting that there is a disparity between the private sector and the public sector, with the   private-sector job creation growing at a pretty steady 3 percent, but clearly we have an offset   from the public sector   In the District, conditions in housing are improving  We have increased home sales,   lower inventories  Prices, however, are flat, somewhat stagnant  Our construction job growth   has been weak this year, but we’re seeing significant investment in multifamily units and very   robust demand translating into the price of rentals  Overall, price pressures are moderate in our   District; wage pressures remain subdued   All three of our indexes—which we’re constantly working to perfect—in terms of   manufacturing services and retail, continue to point to continued economic growth in the next six   months  So from a District standpoint, we’re not quite in the parallel universe that President   Kocherlakota’s District is, but it’s pretty much the same story  We just have a higher   unemployment rate, but things are proceeding progressively   From the standpoint of my business contacts and broader anecdotal evidence, the general   claim is that business is slightly better than what we read in the press  For example, one of my   business contacts is a large trucking company  In fact, it’s the largest trucking company not   located in my District, which runs 16,000 trucks—the largest in the country  They surveyed their   customers  Eighty-five percent of their customers feel good about the fourth quarter and feel   November 1–2, 2011 151 of 282              better about it than they did—that is, they expect better growth in the fourth quarter than they did   in the third, which I found different from almost every other economic forecast I have heard    One of the key worries that seems to be vexing for the private sector, particularly retailers, is a   fear of understocking—that is, running under inventoried for the year-end season; based on last   year’s experience, there’s no question people are running extremely tight inventories  The real   issue is whether you’ll see a pop at year-end or not  In terms of looking at rail activity, trucking   activity, there appears to be a little bit of a pickup to hedge that risk, but it’s not very strong   From the standpoint of overall cap-ex, the best way it was described to me is, people are   still finding that there is a benefit to the cheap money that we provided and abundant liquidity,   but the use of it is hampered by the constant concerns we hear at this table about fiscal policy   and regulation And cap-ex is being deployed but “with a string”   From the standpoint of inflation, I said earlier that the trimmed mean is still running at a   21 percent six-month run rate given that the BEA upward adjusted the last two to 21—but fairly   constant  We expect the headline PCE to trend in that direction   Without exception, in every sector for the CEOs that I speak with, this money is being   used, and the conditions in the economy are being used, to drive additional productivity   investment  Whether you talk to the telecoms, or you talk to the manufacturers, or you talk to   almost any sector, given the uncertainty that surrounds fiscal and regulatory policy, there is an   effort to make sure that risk is reduced by driving productivity significantly through technology   investment—not a good picture for unemployment; maybe a good picture for inflation  I remain   concerned as to the efficacy of policy as it treats unemployment, and I still, despite my hawkish   reputation, am less concerned about immediate inflationary pressures   November 1–2, 2011 152 of 282              I am concerned, however—and I mentioned this last time—about the effect that low   interest rates are having on pensions  I asked our staff to analyze the Fed’s own pension system    I referenced that last point  The data reveal that the pension discount rate within the System has   fallen 100 basis points since the beginning of the year, and this would mean that we would have   to reserve another 9 percent  I’m not sure whether that would apply through the rest of the   economy  I heard cases, in terms of my anecdotal go-round with my CEOs, from an extra   reserve of $17 billion to several hundred million dollars, but there’s no question that anybody   who has a tail end of a defined-benefit program is going to have to recalculate the expense ratio   that they’ve imputed   In terms of the insurance industry, I think this is something that we need to at least be   aware of  Insurance is the most basic savings product that most ordinary Americans do utilize    I’m hearing increasing reports again that the profitability of the life insurance industry—I’m not   talking about the demonized health insurance industry—is coming under increasing pressure and   may result in a different sort of product that they are able to offer and disappointing returns to   those who use that as a method of long-term savings and also protection   Finally, with regard to the banks, they continue to report about margin suppression  I   heard a new term  It’s a bit earthy, but I’m a Texan  The new term in local and community   banking is “cashtration,” meaning that they are being squeezed by too many deposits—it’s worse   than being squeezed—and not enough demand for loans  The margins continue to flatten, and   basically, in the words of Jamie Dimon, they’re being crushed   Let me make one last comment  I really don’t see a need for change in policy at this   juncture  If anything, the conditions are slightly better than they were the last time we met, and   November 1–2, 2011 153 of 282              I’ll talk more about that in the next round  So, Mr Chairman, that is the extent of my report    Thank you    Mr Chairman, can I ask Brian a question?  Yesterday in his presentation,   he said that it was our description of the economy that you felt was a little harsher than markets   expected  I’m interpolating your words  The operative word here is “significant”  Is that what   you were referring to in terms of statement B as it’s drafted?    Well, have they digested that word “significant” by now in your opinion?    Thank you  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, I support alternative B, with maintaining the language   “through mid-2013”  Mr Evans may be surprised that I agree with him completely—that the   longer we go with high unemployment, the more we undermine potential  I just don’t believe   that our monetary accommodation has been all that useful in assisting the reduction of   joblessness, given the uncertainty that is posed by the fiscal and regulatory morass that we see on   Capitol Hill  And I believe we’re pushing on a string on that front   I have been outspoken on this publicly and within this room  I did not support the   extension to mid-2013  I voted against it  I still—despite, I think, Brian’s very good briefings—  view Operation Twist as incomplete  I suspect it was good for the rich  As a former trader,   having learned very well to operate on “buying on the rumor and selling on the news,” I think we   November 1–2, 2011 212 of 282              did end up enriching certain swift and capable money operators  It’s not clear to me that in the   end it will benefit the cost of business borrowing  I do believe very firmly that we have   significant liquidity in the economy   I found all the interventions yesterday to be quite brilliant, but I was particularly struck   by Governor Duke’s, in terms of some of the improvements that have been made regarding   balance sheets and the potential that exists out there  I wouldn’t say that I want to completely   embrace the “Tigger” scenario, nor am I willing to embrace the “Eeyore” scenario, but I found   that to be a sobering assessment in contrast to what everybody else was talking about at the table,   and it’s something we should bear in mind   I continue to believe that we should harbor our ammunition  We have few bullets left  I   referred to them in the last meeting—in reference to your initials, Mr Chairman—as BBs  But   whatever we have left we need to use under dire circumstances  I am still of the belief that we   could see an S&P 500 trading at 600 under very easy circumstances if we have the horrific   scenario that some fear obtained in Europe and just because of the nature of the skittishness of   markets   I continue to worry about the impact of what we have wrought on those who played by   the rules, saved their money, and are being hurt by low interest rates  I do believe this is not   constructive from the standpoint of the 6,000-plus community banks we have in this country in   terms of squeezing their profitability   I do believe that this has a negative impact related to the resetting of pension fund   liabilities, which takes away from investment that might otherwise go into job-creating capital,   and I worry about the consequence of our low-interest-rate policy    November 1–2, 2011 213 of 282              These are costs that are involved  There are certainly benefits that accrue  But I don’t   think one of the benefits is that we impact the too-high unemployment levels in this country if   we just act as a substitute for fiscal policy     We’ll have more information by December in terms of knowing what the supercommittee   is likely to do, and in my book, as long as we provide accommodative monetary policy, we give   them an excuse not to act  It is time for them to act, and I would urge you, in your press briefing,   to underscore what you have said publicly—and Mr Dudley, the Vice Chairman of this   Committee, mentioned yesterday—that we should stress regarding the need for fiscal policy to   get its act together    Mr Chairman, I would support statement B  With regard to the word “significant,” I am   somewhat indifferent  I would prefer not to use it, but if the Desk tells us that it’s been digested   by the market, then I could swallow it  I didn’t think it was in blue, by the way—I thought it was   in purple, Mr Lockhart, just to satisfy you  And I would suggest that those who are seeing   purple squirrels may be taking the drugs that Mr Lockhart and Mr Lacker have been talking   about  [Laughter]  So that’s it, Mr Chairman  I support statement B as drafted, with “through   mid-2013”  Thank you    So you would caution against “humongous”?    It’s implicit in what we’re saying  "
9353,2011-11-28,"  Steve, can you bring us up to date on what is likely to occur in the G-7 in   terms of addressing solvency issues?  That’s the first of many questions I have, but it seems to   me that we have to have a backdrop  And I’m curious as to what you expect—or what we   expect, Mr Chairman—to come out of these discussions, in addition to our committing to   addressing liquidity needs  That’s question number one  What do we know that is not in the   press?    Brian, am I correct that two-year Greek debt is trading over 100 percent?     Thank you  Mr Chairman, as I understand this—obviously, there’s a   code among central bankers  These don’t seem to be extraordinary  I’m curious as to whether—  we’ll have a discussion in just a minute—part of this package is that we’re going to reduce the   domestic discount rate as well  In other words, what lies herein is extending swap arrangements,   which we’ve all, for the most part, agreed to, and adding the new dimension of providing   liquidity in Canadian dollars, British pounds, Japanese yen, euros, and Swiss francs if requested   by the appropriate Reserve Bank—I presume that means Richmond, largely, or New York for B   of A, and then the other big institutions, but it might include others  The suggestion here, as   stated in the current intention, is that we reduce the rate on existing lines to OIS plus 50  OIS is,   what, 12 basis points?  So that would be less than the 75 we charge domestic institutions to   borrow  Implicit in this is that we would reduce the domestic discount rate  Or can we justify—  even though they are central banks—lending money to foreigners—to use the term that our   overseers might use—at a cheaper rate than we lend to our highest-quality domestic banks?  Is   that our intention?    Yes, sir—of course    And then the last thing is—and maybe this is a point you wish to   address—in terms of adhering to Bagehot principles, not just regarding the rate we charge, but   also regarding the collateral that is accepted, that this is an intra–central bank facility  But to   take an extreme example, if during the course of time we decide to roll it over between now and   November 28, 2011 12 of 40              February 1, 2013, and the euro is no longer the euro that we know, I’m curious as to how this is   actually secured  How would they pay us back?    Thank you very much  I have other questions, Mr Chairman, but I’ll   defer them until we get into the discussion  Thank you    Do we have in mind, Mr Chairman, a limit in terms of the expansion of   our balance sheet?    Thank you, Mr Chairman     To get back to Eric’s question of disclosure, I’m trying to understand this    If someone draws down one of these swap lines—I’m talking about the dollar lines—we’d book   it as a loan to a central bank  Is that correct?    Once it is lent out, then, from that central bank—    Right  Once that central bank lends it out, does it shift to a loan to   depository institutions, or does it stay as a swap?    So we have no way of knowing, to answer President Rosengren’s   question, where this ultimately ends up  It’s not disclosed  Is that correct?   November 28, 2011 22 of 40               Okay  Thank you    Mr Chairman, I’m torn on this issue  There is a code among central   bankers  I think Vice Chairman Dudley is correct from the standpoint that we’re most effective   November 28, 2011 23 of 40              when we work together  We’ve learned this from our own history  I think we have a   communications problem here, which I would ask you to address  You made the correct point   that we—and you used the term “we”—are trying and have been making efforts to normalize   rates  And you’re right—Dallas and one other Bank have been rather aggressive on that front    I’m very worried about what’s going on in Europe  It’s a political mare’s nest, and the   sovereignty issues are horrifically vexing  I’m also quite concerned about where the European   banking system is—the false stress tests that they put together before and now the real effort—I   know we’re having an influence on them—to make sure that they get their capital ratios   organized  Obviously, we know how they’re doing it  They’d like to issue tier 1 equity, but   that’s not easy in these markets  They’re cutting back, therefore, on their risk-weighted assets   and on their lending  The Commerzbank call to the analysts this past week had very clear   instructions and a revelation that they’ve instructed their bankers to lend only to Poland and to   Germany, and they’re just cutting out other activities  So we know some deleveraging is taking   place  Shriveling up of other credits, including dollar-based credits, is happening, and I think   Vice Chairman Dudley is absolutely correct  We all understand this  It comes back to bite us on   the rear end   What I’m most concerned about here is the reaction to our lending to others at less than   we lend to the highest-quality community, regional, and large banks in this country  I wouldn’t   understate or underestimate how that might reverberate negatively against us  I’m a little   concerned that we’ve agreed to OIS plus 50 basis points  If it were OIS plus whatever equates to   75, assuming OIS is 12, I’d be more comfortable  And that just gives me pause  I don’t think   that just issuing this statement, which does not refer to the OIS plus 50, is problematic  I do   think it becomes problematic in terms of the execution and, again, in the minds of those on both   November 28, 2011 24 of 40              sides of the aisle in the Congress  There is a tradeoff here  We do want to normalize rates, but   we’ve been presented with a very difficult circumstance that poses risk to us  And I think we   need to noodle that through before we make a decision  Again, I’ve been probably the most   aggressive advocate for normalizing rates  We’ve pulled back from that recently, but just   because of the circumstance  I don’t think we could easily answer those questions unless we   deal with our highest-quality domestic credits  I think it would be very, very difficult,   particularly with the community banks, the regional banks—which are high quality, from which   we demand substantial and measurable collateral to make a loan—to say that we’re trusting other   institutions  Again, they’re our brethren  These are central bankers  We understand the code   But it presents a huge communications problem, and the question is whether we should take   action or just try to deal with it through communications  And I’d leave that up to the rest of the   group to decide, but I wouldn’t understate it  I think the optics are not very good, particularly   when we’re under the microscope—or certainly the magnifying glass  That’s my biggest   concern, Mr Chairman  I’m torn on whether or not I can support this, unless we have a clear   understanding of how we’re going to deal with that  It might be through a press conference on   your part  It might be through other efforts to communicate  But it’s a hard sell  Thank you,   Mr Chairman    I think, Mr Chairman, first of all, that nobody wants to undermine you,   and I certainly personally never wish to undermine you  And I do think you have to have the   leeway you discussed  I do find more convincing the explanation you gave us earlier, which is,   we’re not lending through the discount window  And we’ve had criticism of lending to foreign   borrowers through the discount window, so we’re not changing there  We’re lending to another   central bank and within the fraternity and sorority of central banks around the world  All I’m   suggesting is that we really think through how this will be communicated, because we know—or   at least I’m willing to surmise—that there will be tough questions asked, and we just have to be   clear  And that goes beyond what the statement said  So the question is whether there is a   vehicle for you to do that  I’m not against the proposal; I have concerns about the proposal  Its   effectiveness will be dependent on how we communicate it  I’m just raising that flag and asking   November 28, 2011 26 of 40              us to think this through, as to how we get it done so we don’t end up pulling the rug out from   underneath you or from the purpose of the exercise  That’s my point    Mr Chairman, the way the statement is written, there’s no mention of the   rate we would charge  It does say that “the Chairman shall establish the rates on the swap   arrangements by mutual agreement with the foreign central banks and in consultation with the   Foreign Currency Subcommittee,” and that you’ll keep us informed  I assume that paragraph   applies to both sets of swap arrangements—the dollar swaps and the foreign currency swaps—is   that correct?    Okay  And that it’ll be “consistent with principles discussed with and   guidance provided by the Committee”  Again, my guidance, for what it’s worth, as an individual   on the Committee and as a voter, is that we not lend at less than what we lend to high-quality   US banks  You will have the freedom under this, in consultation with the Foreign Currency   Subcommittee, to make that decision  I want to be extremely careful here in terms of not   undermining authority  You’re primus inter pares; you’re the Chairman  But I do think it is   inadvisable for us to lend—despite the counterarguments, which are helpful and should be   articulated—at less than we lend to our domestic counterparts; I have real trouble supporting   that  I guess—and please don’t take offense—I don’t like the process with which this has been   developed  I think we should have had this discussion at some point to highlight what these   November 28, 2011 34 of 40              obstacles are  Obviously, you know us all well  You’re making the best judgment possible, and   you are the central bank in the eyes of our counterparts  But that is a very tough one for me to   swallow as an individual member of this Committee  And then the second thing, which   President Rosengren and President Evans mentioned, is the transparency issue  I’m sure we’re   going to get questions  We have to be prepared to deal with that  Again, when we release the   statement, we’re not going to state the rate, as I understand it  We are going to say that you will   establish the rate in consultation    So you’re asking us to agree, then, on the 50 basis points—is that correct?    And we would make that public?    Would we record minutes of this meeting, where you had some concerns   expressed about lending at less than we would have lent to the domestic banks?    Well, again, I’m worried about putting you in an uncomfortable position    There is a principle here that I’m worried about as well, and then there is the reactive aspect of   November 28, 2011 35 of 40              this, which I’m concerned about  If I may just put my cards on the table, in answer to Governor   Duke’s question, I think it would be a mistake to cut the rate to domestic banks to 50 basis points   and do it simultaneously  I believe we would then panic the markets  So, Governor Duke, I   agree with you  I think it would send a bad signal  I wouldn’t close that door, depending on   what happens in terms of economic developments  Where I come down personally is that we   should not have agreed to 50 basis points  We should have agreed to 75 or 12 basis points less   than that, wherever OIS is  But this is a dilemma because, again, we don’t want to undermine   our standing, and certainly we don’t want to undermine your standing  So I’m just being utterly   frank here  I think that’s the biggest problem with this proposal—the 50 basis points  Thank   you, Mr Chairman    This is just on the section in quotes, is that correct?  "
9368,2011-12-13,"  First, Brian, you have all of our sympathy for the hard work you’ve done   all year and the excellent work you’ve done all year  I have four questions if I may quickly ask   December 13, 2011 9 of 198              them, and maybe we could answer some of them outside of this meeting  If my memory is   correct, in terms of the 20-plus-year maturity allotment in the maturity extension program,   roughly 29 percent of our allocated purchases would be in that area  A lot of holders of those   instruments are basically matching liabilities, are buyers and holders, and my question is  Do   you still feel comfortable with that 29 percent allotment in terms of a portion of the market? Or   have you thought about readjusting that?  Are we reaching any constraints?  Then I have three   other questions after this, if I may    The second question has to do with inventories being maintained by   dealers in the corporate sector  If my information is correct, they’re pretty near historic lows,   and I’m wondering—again, being an advocate of stricter capital standards—if that’s a legitimate   excuse, because I hear some of that, or is it something else at work in the marketplace?   December 13, 2011 10 of 198               It has been trending down in terms of dealer inventories    And then last, you talk about mortgage-backeds in your presentation  We   own roughly 15 percent of all agency mortgage-backed securities and about 20 percent of the   fixed-rate conventional pass-throughs?  Is that correct, presently?    I’m wondering what the capacity is if we were to expand and how much   space there is for us to do so, because the fixed-income markets are not divided into these neat   compartments  We often think about them that way, but that’s not the way they actually operate    I’m trying to get a sense of were we to come forward with a proposal to expand the portfolio   there, how much resistance or how much impact do we have in the marketplace, not simply the   MBS portfolio, but all fixed-income activities, particularly given the inventory levels that are   being maintained by dealers    So the two numbers here, that would probably push us to 25 or   35 percent  Is that the rough ballpark?    Yes    The last question is  What is a “fully convincing resolution” of the   European crisis?  [Laughter]    Or the ECB is going to hire Brian away because he has the answer and   he’s not sharing it    Thank you, Mr Chairman    A comment, Mr Chairman, and a question  First, the comment is how   different the conversation is at this table now than under the previous regime  It was noteworthy   that Steve led off the presentation, and coming full circle to the conversation we have just had   It is wonderful that we think in globalized terms  In thinking in globalized terms, Steve,   going back to your presentation, obviously, we are concerned about Europe presently, but we are   December 13, 2011 26 of 198              also seeing significant price declines the past two months in Chinese real estate—actually   plunging sales  We’re monitoring the employment in that sector informally through one of our   contacts, and we are also seeing people laid off significantly in terms of the brokers  As you   know, shadow banking has a huge role in the Chinese system  Most of that shadow banking, we   think—we don’t know—has gone into real estate  I am not going to ask for a breakdown  We   can’t afford to have both of you break down at the same time  But do we at least have a sense of   how much impact that might have on the Chinese economy, are we monitoring it, and might it   come back to bite us in some way, shape, or form?    But you wouldn’t foresee a housing price collapse  You don’t think they   would allow it    Thank you   December 13, 2011 28 of 198               Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to make sure Mr Rosengren can hear   me because he was complaining earlier  I’m not sure he wants to hear me  [Laughter]  Our   District has been very fortunate this year  We had decent job creation  242,000 private-sector   jobs were created; after subtracting government, a total of 186,000 jobs were created  We grew   at a 2 percent rate in 2011  Our regional indicator suggests that our economy has slowed   moderately in the Eleventh District since our last meeting, mainly due to weakening in the   government sector—in particular to school teachers where we’ve had a contraction—and in our   manufacturing sector  About one-fourth of our manufactures go to exports  Weakening of   December 13, 2011 52 of 198              foreign demand and a strengthening of what we calculate as the “Texas dollar,” which is the   dollar weighted by whom we export to and import from, has had a net damping effect on exports   I’m going to spend my comments time, Mr Chairman, not signaling any direction in   policy, but rather reporting what I’m hearing from my corporate contacts  Again, for what it’s   worth, I did a particularly deep dive this time with the broader group of CEOs, big and small,   public and private, and I thought I would report on that to the Committee   My CEO interlocutors report slightly improved final demand since our previous meeting   in almost all sectors  The one exception would be home furnishing, which remains a laggard    Indeed, according to the major credit and debit card processors I visit with, ex auto and ex gas—  we all know that auto, as reported earlier, has been fairly robust—sales paid by credit and debit   cards were up 74 percent year over year in November  That’s the highest year-over-year gain in   five years  October was up 53 percent, September was up 71 percent  Ten of the 11 sectors   that the credit card industry tracks performed positively in November, and my soundings with   the CEOs of the truckers and the rails, the air carriers and express shippers—and this is not just   in my District, this is nationwide—all reported improved volumes in the US in November and   during the intermeeting period   That said, there is, as others have noted, some anxiety about the Christmas season and the   future  Most consumer-oriented companies I talked to—including theme parks and   entertainment, and broadcasters (the latter basing their projections on ad bookings)—believe that   Christmas will be weaker than originally projected  Nevertheless, among retailers there is some   anxiety about stocking  Confirming this, the largest express delivery company now reports a   backlog in trans-Pacific shipments for inventory replenishment  The largest trucking firms   remark that inventories are very lean and restocking is taking place   December 13, 2011 53 of 198              As to pricing, consumers are staying, in the words of one of my interlocutors, “very   surgical”  They are value driven on most needed goods  They’re resisting the price increases   that branded products continue to push  I find one of the more interesting examples from one of   the largest food distributors is that there has been a substitution of tuna for beef, given high beef   prices, in order to provide protein, and it’s a marked and measurable one  Many of my   interlocutors now expect price rollbacks in 2012  On the agriculture price front, the large   producers feel that the bubble was pricked in September, and given the yields expected from   expanded crop planting relative to projected demands, expect the price relief of the past three   months —you can see it on every commodity chart—to continue well on into 2012  That fits   with what Mr Wilcox was telling us earlier in his briefing   As to nonnecessities, electronics are the stuff of great consumer demand  Apple is   reported to have accounted for 10 percent of the nation’s sales volume for the four days   surrounding Black Friday  The telephonic companies report consumer sales running 8 to   9 percent year over year relative to the previous holiday season  Wal-Mart sold 1½ million   televisions in a 24-hour period on Black Friday  Electronics still seem to be leading the   consumption sector   Capital is widely available and attractively priced  Customers are paying on time  My   contacts confirm that cash flow is at a record high both in absolute terms and as a percentage of   GDP  It’s 474 percent, if memory serves  That’s a function of very strong profits and   increasing depreciation, including the bonus depreciation that has helped so much     My small, nonpublic contacts confirm what the NFIB data show—and incidentally, there   are two good reports out by Dunkelberg this morning—which is that they’re not worried about   access to funding  Smaller businesses, while the big guys remain concerned about their cost of   December 13, 2011 54 of 198              doing business, are “sickened” by the political process  I should add here in my most Jesse   Jacksonian rhetoric, “The bile applies to both sides of the aisle”  They’re happy with neither   side  They remain focused on achieving greater productivity  They’re hiring selectively and   sparsely, but with a slightly improving pace  They’re hoarding cash, partly to hedge against   possible tax, health care, and other cost increases, including pension funding  They’re generally   refraining, but not totally, from cap-ex that would ordinarily result from the high profits and cash   flow numbers we’re seeing, until the rules are clarified  In the meantime, they’re still using their   cash to buy back stock, enhance their dividend payouts, and improve their debt structures   One surprising thing was that the homebuilders report that land prices in areas where   housing is feasible across the United States, not just in the Eleventh Federal Reserve District,   may be beginning to creep up, indicating a possible turn in the housing market, however faint    Emphasis is on the possible, though some are looking to build again, and when I asked where the   financing was coming from, the ready answer was from hedge funds and other nonbank sources   The CEOs that I speak with that operate internationally report a slowing in Chinese   growth, but not in Chinese operating costs, which are still running on the order of 15 to 20   percent when labor, other government-imposed costs, and renminbi factors are taken into   account   The credit card companies importantly, or at least interestingly to me, report a very   marked slowdown in demand growth in Brazil and Mexico  As to Europe, the best comparison I   got actually came from one of our staffers, Mark Wynne, who reminded us that the Catholic   Church has a saint named Saint Willibrord who is the patron saint of convulsions, and there’s   actually a procession in western Luxembourg where they proceed every year, and they take two   steps forward and one step back, and I think this is the pace at which we seem to be proceeding   December 13, 2011 55 of 198              with Europe  All of my contacts are concerned, but can’t quantify the impact that Europe is   likely to have, and they are reporting a compression in European sales  One suggestion—I’m   sure it was tongue-in-cheek—is that Greece leave the EU and join the SEC football conference    That would increase their revenues [laughter] and help them balance their budget  Thank you,   Mr Chairman    That’s right, or to pay the college players what we pay them  One other   thing, Mr Chairman, that I would like to work in here, and we could talk about this at another   time, but I remain deeply concerned that we could have a significant correction in stock markets    If you go back to the pre-Greenspan years, and you look at the 10 bubbles that later were burst, it   typically takes 14 years to recover the old trend  Quickly looking at those 10 episodes, if that   were to occur presently—and we have surely been of assistance, through your administration and   through Chairman Greenspan’s administration, in moving quickly enough to have an impact on   equity markets—my personal calculations are that we could easily go back to 800 on the S&P    There are very few money managers who have lived through any one of those 10 periods, which   means mistakes can be made, perhaps tripped off by an exogenous shock, which may occur from   China while we’re looking at Europe or may occur from Europe, whatever it may be  Again, I’m   very concerned that we don’t have overt, at least at this table, contingency plans for such a sharp   reversal  If we had the S&P correct to 800, it would undermine enormously the achievements   that we have made through our emergency programs, and if we were to observe the typical   14-year pattern to full recovery, then we would be presented with significant challenges  I don’t   think that tinkering with our communications policy is sufficient to prepare us for that possible   December 13, 2011 56 of 198              tail risk adverse scenario, and I’d like to have deeper conversations about that at another point    Thank you, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, I couldn’t hear you, sir    Mr Chairman, I support Alternative B  It has the benefit of accurately   stating where I believe the economy is  I remain concerned, as I hinted in my questions, about   the distortions that may stem from our maturity extension program, and perhaps increasingly   from our activity in mortgage-backed securities  I would not support additional monetary   accommodation   I do want to make a quick comment on inflation, because, as you know, we are somewhat   fundamentalist at the Dallas Fed  We do follow the trimmed mean rather religiously, and the   trimmed mean is running at a six-month rate of 19 percent  We have had two months of   softness in terms of the component numbers—falling price components—but two months don’t a   trend make  And I do believe, as I have said before and have pointed out in my corporate   conversations, that we are trending back toward that 2 percent level     With regard to employment, I listened carefully to Governor Yellen  I am sympathetic  I   grew up in a household that was affected deeply by some of the things you mentioned, and it   does tug at my heart strings  I just don’t believe that we can effect a significant amount of   December 13, 2011 92 of 198              change there, given the present inefficiency of fiscal policy and the disincentives that are   provided by our fiscal policymakers   I also have a view that Alternative B does remind people that we are on the balls of our   feet, and yet I don’t think it is the time of year for us to change what we agreed to in the last   meeting  It is not propitious to surprise the marketplace at this juncture  In summary, I support   Alternative B  I would not support and I would vote against—despite my great respect for Eric   Rosengren—extending the date past the current language, since I was opposed to it in the first   place  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Go back to the language    That is a good point, Mr Chairman, but we do refer in paragraph 2 to   strains in global financial markets  And I would add my name as the fourth to leave paragraph 5   unchanged    It would become a YouTube sensation if it’s released    Can I ask a governance question, Mr Chairman?    Assuming we get along the path here, and we decide to finalize this in   January or at a subsequent meeting, is it done by a vote of the members or of the entire   Committee?    Thank you    Yes, sir  Thank you    Mr Chairman, at the Oxford Union you always said a little prayer before   a debate, which is to sharpen the wits of those who have different views than you in order to   focus your own mind   Though having a different view on the proposal to publicly release our forecasts, I’m   grateful for the good work that the Committee has done  It builds upon the first step that we had   December 13, 2011 131 of 198              in the Committee under Governor Yellen’s group of four to enhance our communications  I very   much appreciate the thought that went into the proposal outlined in the December 2 memo, but I   have deep concerns about that particular memo, about the proposed expansion of the SEP to   include our funds rate projections, and about the proposition that an expanded SEP is an effective   way to convey policy information to the public  I’m going to argue in the spirit of presenting a   different view, because I have strong feelings that it may end up having a counterproductive   effect and confuse the public  Let me state at the outset that with regard to the statement of our   longer-run goals and policy strategy, I’m in favor of such a statement  I have some suggested   edits to the statement, but I am supportive, generally speaking, of what’s been outlined in that   single-page document   I’d like to turn to the points that I made in a memo that I distributed to everybody on   December 9 with regard to the SEP and inclusion of the funds rate projections  I’d like to   enhance or expand upon some of the points I made in that memo  As I mentioned, I have several   concerns, so let me reiterate those     First, I sense that the funds rate projections are unlikely to provide reliable guidance to   the public on what this Committee will actually do  As I said in my memo, in 2011 alone we’ve   seen significant shifts in our outlook for GDP and for inflation and for unemployment, reflecting   the obvious fact that we’re in a very unfamiliar and rapidly changing environment  You referred,   Governor Yellen, to the great moderation  We no longer have the kind of luxury we had back   then in terms of a general sense of the direction of policy  We were quite tight-lipped back then   without even thinking through what we wanted to signal a few weeks out, but we’ve gone   through the looking glass, as I said in the memo  We’re now in an economic environment we   don’t fully understand, and I find it odd that in that environment that we’re still coming to grips   December 13, 2011 132 of 198              with—and admittedly we have said that our forecasts, economics, the outlook for inflation,   unemployment, and all the other variables we worry about, have had to be constantly corrected—  that we would now want to release forecasts for the funds rate that extend three or four more   years out  On top of that, there’s the added complication that the composition of this Committee   will change  I won’t be here four years from now, much to the relief of some people, I’m sure,   but many of us will not be here over the long-term forecast horizon  When you look at it from   that standpoint, these projections are unlikely to be useful as forecasts   Second, the benefits of releasing forecasts are limited because releasing such information   will just highlight the diversity of opinion among FOMC participants, while conveying very little   sense of the source of that diversity of views  I believe it will be difficult for the public to   decipher whether differences in policy forecasts arise from alternative predictions of future   pressures on inflation and real activity, are the result of fundamental disagreements about the   weights in our objective functions, or reflect different views of how the economy operates   Third, the release of policy forecasts provides little guidance, in my opinion, on how a   consensus policy path, much less any individual policy path, is likely to change as the economic   outlook evolves  What happens to the policy path if growth surprises to the upside or the   downside, or if inflation surprises us on the downside or the upside, or if some level of   uncertainty diminishes?  When you think about it, the most informative way that we could   possibly report and inform the public would be for each of us to put out a decision tree to show   how we would react under different circumstances  I noticed in the FRB/US stochastic   simulation that the odds of a relapse of recession are relatively low, and even the odds based on   the Tealbook forecast errors are low—about 15 percent  But I read through all the alternative   scenarios that were proposed, and I could buy into almost any one of them  It would be most   December 13, 2011 133 of 198              informative if each of us took each one of those scenarios and published a decision tree as to how   we would react in terms of our policy response  But I think that would lead to total cacophony   A fourth concern I have is that the Board staff’s own simulation suggests the timing of   liftoff from the zero bound is less important to private decisionmakers than how we plan to   conduct policy after the liftoff     We are under intense scrutiny  Given the publicity likely to be given to the outliers   among policy projections—and there will likely be dispersion—participants may be tempted or   feel pressured to explain their individual thinking about the appropriate policy path  I pointed   out that one paragraph and considered the questions that popped out of that section on the mock-  up of the appropriate monetary policy, which was distributed again today  “Participants   generally viewed the current weak economic conditions and a moderating outlook for inflation as   warranting highly accommodative monetary policy for an extended period, though at some point   a reduction in accommodation would become appropriate in order for the recovery to proceed in   the context of price stability  A number of other key factors informed participants’ projections of   the appropriate path for the policy rate, including their judgments regarding the extent to which   current conditions deviate from longer-run goals and the mechanisms through which policy   actions affect economic activity and inflation over time”  “Generally,” “though at some point,”   “a number of other key factors,” “the mechanisms”—I’m not sure how that paragraph clarifies   anything  It certainly doesn’t provide specificity  I can envision each one of us being asked  At   what point would you think it’s appropriate to reduce accommodation?  What were the key   factors in your projection of the funds rate?  And what is your judgment regarding the extent to   which current conditions are deviant from the longer-term goals and the mechanisms through   which policy actions affect economic activity and inflation over time?   December 13, 2011 134 of 198              The cover memo considers it “inadvisable” to publish participants’ balance sheet   projections—something that my colleague from St Louis has noted might be helpful—and it   dispenses with it by noting that “a plethora of such projections might well be required to convey   the diversity of participants’ views”  I’m not sure how this is any different from that exercise    How is publishing a participant’s views on future funds rate paths any different?  Might this not   also require or lead to a plethora of projections of the key factors and judgments to convey the   participants’ different views?  And are we not inviting even further cacophony of voices than we   already have?  Those are my major concerns   In summary, Mr Chairman, in addition to the little nitpick that I pointed out on page 11, I   don’t know why you would lead any paragraph with “a few” other than indicating a bias, and I   would suggest that we go to the language itself if we decide to proceed down this path, which I   recommend against, and that we should not phrase any sentence in such a way  But the   hackneyed comment on the music of Wagner is that it’s not as bad as it sounds  I would   respectfully submit, again, that I am interested in providing as much information to the public as   possible in order to enlighten and not to confuse  The end result of the proposal that’s been put   forward to us in the December 2 memo is that it’s not as good as it sounds  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    Of both?  "
9391,2013-10-16,"  Mr Chairman, as I understand it, the period we’re in now is one of the   periods when, given the way the tax income flows are, we are most dependent for outflows on   the issuance of debt  I think the ratio is 65 to 35  Does that change in this new period, this new   time frame that now runs through February?  In other words, my understanding was that we were   most vulnerable during this period to the dependence on debt issuance  Is there a different   dynamic at the beginning of the year than there was at this time of year?  Do we know?    Yes, 65 percent of all outlays  Thirty-five percent were going to be   covered basically by borrowing needs rather than by tax input  So I’m curious as to the   difference of the dynamics on that front for the beginning of the year  Do we know?    October 16, 2013 10 of 50     So they probably picked this period for the same reason that we have   now  That’s the point  Nothing changes on that front      Yes  I was going to basically make the same point  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     I agree with Bill  We were just both mentioning that we spoke in Mexico   yesterday, the day before I spoke here  You get questions, and all you can say is, “We will take   every initiative feasible to maintain market stability”  Especially if we get through this little   exercise that Linda described, there might be a space in time where we could be proactive, in the   right kind of way, to make sure that we, the central bank, have the capacity to take certain   actions and will do so  The risk is that it gets interpreted politically, so it’s best if it’s a period of   October 16, 2013 24 of 50    calm  The question is how we get it out there, and this is what needs to be considered  The idea   of releasing minutes of our meeting, when we hold minutes back for other meetings—I’m not   sure, Mr Chairman, if that’s the right idea  It may be either a technical communication from the   Desk or a statement by you  But I do think it is wise to communicate it ex ante here, particularly   if we get through this little exercise that Linda just mentioned, and we have some time to do it    Thank you     Actually, on second thought, Mr Chairman, I just realized that we’re   talking about a three-week time interval  So that gives us space  I think the important thing is to   have space     Well, that gives us even more space  That’s good    Mr Chairman, if we agreed on the first five, I would include that  But,   obviously, you’d leave the door open that we will take other initiatives  What I worry about is,   with each passing incident like this, markets discount things well ahead of time  We don’t know   when they’re beginning to discount, or sniff out—and I would defer to the Desk here, but my   sense is that they sniff things out a little bit more quickly  And if we wait until just before   default or default, already markets and market operators are beginning to position themselves    So I think we should show that we have discussed the matter, have agreement on certain tools we   can use, but that we haven’t shut the door to taking other initiatives to maintain market stability    The market is moving faster with every passing day, and I don’t think we have the luxury to   October 16, 2013 28 of 50    wait  I would like, in a market-operation sense, to at least take advantage of a period here where   there seems to be a little bit of an opening to make it clear  “We’ve thought this stuff through    We have some tools  There are other tools we can apply,” without stating the specifics of those   tools  But I would defer to Simon on that    Mr Chairman, I am comfortable with 6 and 7—of course, 7 is an FOMC   matter, but I am very comfortable in delegating to you, on an intermeeting basis, the authority   that was discussed  As far as 8 and 9 are concerned, I see Governor Stein’s argument from an   economic standpoint, as Governor Powell mentioned  I think Governor Powell is guilty of   understatement in terms of my description of the politics of those two options  I would like, if   we can—and I don’t know how we’re going to write the minutes to this meeting—say that we’ve   October 16, 2013 46 of 50    agreed to 1 through 7, but I would not, if we can, specifically articulate 8 and 9 and just say that   other options are still on the table   The one thing I would ask us to consider over time, and maybe to discuss in a more   fulsome manner when we have the time to do it, is that if we do everything in this menu, we are   going to have a pretty odd-looking balance sheet, and I still don’t have a sense of what the limits   are  And I would like to have that discussed at some juncture  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
