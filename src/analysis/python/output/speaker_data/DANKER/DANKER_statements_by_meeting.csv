2756,1993-07-06," [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, most of the data gathering costs are incurred by the investment companies that provide us with the mutual funds data We have access to these data entirely through the ICI at this point If we want to enhance the quality of those data considerably, that entails at the first level dealing with ICI and convincing them that that would be a good idea or convincing them to let us deal with the funds one-on-one in terms of editing the data There are, of course, alternatives--vendors that sell these data But the ICI seems to have the best series on an aggregate basis   I think the data on the inflows--rather than formally shift adjusting the aggregate--are very helpful in looking at the developments in M2 and in figuring out how it's [behaving] vis-a- vis its path The Feinman/Porter work last year looked at using an aggregate that just cumulated the inflows But that's not very satisfying when viewing it in terms of an aggregate and one thinks of the capital gains that occurred 10 years ago not counting as money today But on a shorter-term basis thinking about inflows as some kind of shift adjustment I think can be helpful   Well, if you think of it as a stock adjustment process, it's going to be over after some period of time and this    7/6-7/93  isn't a brave new world or something like that So, maybe we'd just want to shift adjust it for a while There has been an explosion in bank offerings of mutual funds that might make that appropriate I don't know that we get a sense of there having been a discrete step so much as a somewhat more gradual broadening of assets   The only thing we subtract out of those are foreign currency denominated [assets]   For example, the aggregate value of these things is about a trillion dollars, but only about half of that will show up in M2+ because of the institutional and IRA/Keough accounts "
