4960,1993-07-06," [Statement--see Appendix]  Well, most of the data gathering costs are incurred by the investment companies that provide us with the mutual funds data We have access to these data entirely through the ICI at this point If we want to enhance the quality of those data considerably, that entails at the first level dealing with ICI and convincing them that that would be a good idea or convincing them to let us deal with the funds one-on-one in terms of editing the data There are, of course, alternatives--vendors that sell these data But the ICI seems to have the best series on an aggregate basis  I think the data on the inflows--rather than formally shift adjusting the aggregate--are very helpful in looking at the developments in M2 and in figuring out how it's [behaving] vis-a- vis its path The Feinman/Porter work last year looked at using an aggregate that just cumulated the inflows But that's not very satisfying when viewing it in terms of an aggregate and one thinks of the capital gains that occurred 10 years ago not counting as money today But on a shorter-term basis thinking about inflows as some kind of shift adjustment I think can be helpful  Well, if you think of it as a stock adjustment process, it's going to be over after some period of time and this    7/6-7/93  isn't a brave new world or something like that So, maybe we'd just want to shift adjust it for a while There has been an explosion in bank offerings of mutual funds that might make that appropriate I don't know that we get a sense of there having been a discrete step so much as a somewhat more gradual broadening of assets  The only thing we subtract out of those are foreign currency denominated [assets]  For example, the aggregate value of these things is about a trillion dollars, but only about half of that will show up in M2+ because of the institutional and IRA/Keough accounts "

7939,2006-06-28,"  I’ll be reading the directive wording from page 29 of the Bluebook and the   assessment of risk from the table that was handed out with Vincent’s briefing   “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will   foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output  To further its long-run objectives,   the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with   increasing the federal funds rate to an average of around 5¼ percent”   And “Although the moderation in the growth of aggregate demand should help to limit   inflation pressures over time, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain  The extent   and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the   evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth as implied by incoming   information  In any event, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed   to support the attainment of its objectives”   Chairman Bernanke  Yes  Vice Chairman Geithner Yes  Governor Bies   Yes  President Guynn  Yes  Governor Kohn  Yes  Governor Kroszner  Yes  President Lacker  Yes  President Pianalto  Yes  Governor Warsh  Yes  President Yellen  Yes     June 28-29, 2006 139 of 177     Just to follow up on the memo that was distributed summarizing  the results of the survey on meeting format, that survey revealed a number of areas of  clear agreement  The recent format with the separate go-rounds on the economy and  policy is viewed as a good one, and there’s little appetite for substantial change to the  format at least for now, but more give-and-take during the meetings would still be  welcome by most  Also, special topics are overwhelmingly considered a good use of  time, with strong sentiment for using staff from both the Board and the Banks as well as  for allowing enough lead time for ample preparatory work  Finally, there appears to be  widespread sentiment for lengthening the amount of meeting time, but opinions are split  about whether two-day meetings are the best way to accomplish this      On this last point, the survey results and subsequent consultations suggest that a   consensus could probably be reached around a steady state of, say, four two-day  meetings each year  These four would consist of two meetings with special topics (two  was, in fact, the modal response to the survey question on that) and then two meetings  before the Chairman’s semiannual testimonies to allow a more in-depth discussion of  the economy and the outlook with the lead-in of the chart show  For 2007, we are  thinking of a baseline of two-day meetings in January and June, as those precede the  testimonies, as well as two-day meetings in perhaps March and October for  traditional-style special-topic presentations  Whenever possible, we would schedule  those two-day meetings on Tuesdays and Wednesdays since that was the day-of-the- week option that appeared least distasteful to you in the aggregate  [Laughter]     Now, coming back to the nearer term, as Governor Kohn noted, communications   issues are likely to require significant additional meeting time before the end of this  year, including perhaps a couple of two-day meetings  Therefore, we would like to add  time to the August meeting both by beginning a bit earlier and by extending into the  afternoon as much as needed  As long as the policy decision has been completed, the   June 28-29, 2006 142 of 177    announcement could be released as usual at 215 in the afternoon, even while the  meeting remains in session  In addition, we would propose to expand both the October  and the December meetings to two days to accommodate the communications topic   Discussions on this topic are, of course, expected to spill over into next year as well, but  for now we are not proposing additional two-day meetings for that purpose  Depending  upon how the extended one-day meeting in August goes and how the communications  agenda itself progresses, there would be various options for setting aside meeting time  next year for those discussions     So, going forward, if you are broadly in agreement with this approach to the   schedule, we will be sending to your offices in the next couple of days a proposed  calendar of meeting dates for the remainder of 2006 and through 2007  We would  request, if possible, a relatively prompt turnaround on identifying significant calendar  conflicts because we’re receiving numerous inquiries about next year’s meeting dates,  which would typically have been released by this point     Also, as to the special topics, we plan to survey you later this year to see what   special topics would be of interest for the slots next year  So if you have any specific  suggestions to make, please let Vincent or me know before then  Then once the topics  are chosen, we propose to use the System Research Advisory Committee to organize the  work, with perhaps Board staff leading one special topic effort and Bank staff leading  the other     Finally, thank you also for the additional comments many of you provided on the   survey  They will be useful going forward     Monday and Tuesday, again, was not the least distasteful option from the   perspective of the survey respondents    We’ll distribute the precise dates in the next couple of days and then please   just get back to us    I think the intention is to package the ’06-’07 calendar together  We hope   to have clearance from your offices before the end of July, at which point we’ll go out with the   calendar going forward  I’m sure our Public Affairs colleagues will assist us, explaining the   additional meetings later this year on the basis of the communications topic, which I think should be   straightforward since that has been in the minutes    And lunch  [Laughter]   END OF MEETING   June 28-29, 2006 145 of 177     "

8758,2009-06-23," Yes The vote covers the statement that’s in the packet that was handed   out today, with two changes  One is dropping the phrase “and indicators of consumer and   business sentiment have risen”  The other is dropping the bracketed sentence at the bottom   In addition, the vote covers the directive from page 69 of the Bluebook, with one   amendment  That directive had included the sentence stating that the Desk is expected to   purchase at least $500 billion in agency MBS by the end of the second quarter of this year    Given that it is June 24, and they already have purchased $500 billion, that sentence has now   been changed to, “The Desk is expected to purchase up to $125 trillion of agency MBS by the   end of the year” So it just covers the full year amount   Chairman Bernanke Yes   Vice Chairman Dudley Yes            Governor Duke  Yes  President Evans  Yes  Governor Kohn  Yes  President Lacker  Yes  President Lockhart  Yes  Governor Tarullo  Yes  Governor Warsh  Yes  President Yellen   Yes   June 23–24, 2009 201 of 261 "
