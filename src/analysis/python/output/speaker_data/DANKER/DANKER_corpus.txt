  Thank you     This is from page 13 of the Bluebook, on the directive  “The Federal   Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and   promote sustainable growth in output  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the   immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing the federal funds   rate to an average of around 2 percent”   And then the risk paragraph from the press release on the assessment of risks  “The   Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth   and price stability for the next few quarters to be roughly equal  With underlying inflation expected   to be relatively low, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace   that is likely to be measured  Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic   prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability”

Santomero  Yes  President Stern   Yes  President Yellen  Yes  First Vice President Holcomb Yes       I’m reading from the Bluebook, page 13, for the directive wording  “The   Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price   stability and promote sustainable growth in output  To further its long-run objectives, the   Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing   the federal funds rate to an average of around 2¼ percent”  And then the risk-assessment language,   which is in the table that was handed out, is unchanged  It reads  “The Committee perceives the   upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the   next few quarters to be roughly equal  With underlying inflation expected to be relatively low, the   Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be   measured  Nonetheless, the

Yes   Governor Olson Yes   President Santomero Yes   President Stern Yes     I’ll be reading from page 28 of the Bluebook the language for alternative B    “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price   stability and promote sustainable growth in output  To further its long-run objectives, the   Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing                                                      May 3, 2005 102 of 116  the federal funds rate to an average of around 3 percent” “The Committee perceives that, with   appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both   sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal  With underlying inflation   expected to be contained, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a   pace that is likely to be measured  Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic   prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability”    I’ll be reading the directive and the risk assessment from page 23 of the   Bluebook “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that   will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output  To further its long-run   objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent   with increasing the federal funds rate to an average of around 3½ percent”  The risk assessment   portion reads “The Committee

inflation expected to be contained, the Committee   believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured   Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in

Governor Olson No    President Santomero Yes    President Stern  Yes     I’ll be reading the directive wording from page 27 of the Bluebook and   the assessment of risk from exhibit 6 in the material that was passed out  For the directive  “The   Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price   stability and promote sustainable growth in output  To further its long-run objectives, the   Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with   increasing the federal funds rate to an average of around 3¾ percent”     Now for the assessment of risk  “The Committee perceives that, with appropriate   monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable   growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal  With underlying inflation expected to   be contained, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that                                         September 20, 2005 104 of 117  is likely to be measured  Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic   prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability”    I’m reading the directive wording from page 24 of the Bluebook  “The   Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price   stability and promote sustainable growth in output  To further its long-run objectives, the   Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing   the federal funds rate to an average of around 4 percent”   And the assessment of risk, unchanged from the September statement, is  “The Committee   perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the   attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal  With   underlying inflation expected to be contained, the Committee believes that policy accommodation   can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured  Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to   changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to

Governor Olson    Yes  President Santomero   Yes  President Stern    Yes    I read it from this table as unchanged from September      Chairman Greenspan Yes   Vice Chairman Geithner   Yes    Governor Bies  Yes   Governor Ferguson Yes   President Fisher Yes    Governor Kohn  Yes   President Moskow Yes     Governor Olson  Yes   President Santomero Yes    President Stern  Yes     I’ll be reading the directive wording from the Bluebook and the assessment   of risks from alternative B in exhibit 2 from Brian’s presentation  “The Federal Open Market   Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote   sustainable growth in output  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate   future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing the federal funds rate to an   average of around 4¼ percent”  And the wording for the assessment of risks  “The Committee   judges that some further measured policy firming is likely to be needed to keep the risks to the                                                                       December 13, 2005 90 of 100  attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance  In any event,   the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster these objectives”     As Secretary and Economist, Vincent Reinhart; as Deputy Secretary,   Debbie Danker; as Assistant Secretaries, Dave Skidmore and Michelle Smith; as General Counsel,   Scott Alvarez; as Deputy General Counsel, Tom Baxter; as Economists, Karen Johnson and Dave   Stockton; as Associate Economists from the Board, Tom Connors, Steve Kamin, Brian Madigan,   Sandy Struckmeyer, and David Wilcox; as Associate Economists from the Banks, Bob Eisenbeis,   John Judd, Mark Sniderman, Joe Tracy, and John Weinberg     Thank you, Mr Chairman  In that the decision has been to go ahead with   the status quo in the same way as in the past, I will read the wording out of page 31 of the   Bluebook—the directive wording first and the risk assessment second, dropping the word “well”   “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will   foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output  To further its long-run objectives,   the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with   increasing the federal funds rate to an average of around 4½ percent”  And “The Committee judges   January 31, 2006 77 of 106    that some further policy firming may be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both   sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance  In any event, the Committee   will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster these objectives”   Chairman Greenspan  Yes  Vice Chairman Geithner Yes  Governor Bies  Yes  Governor Ferguson  Yes  President Guynn  Yes  Governor Kohn  Yes  President Lacker  Yes  Governor
