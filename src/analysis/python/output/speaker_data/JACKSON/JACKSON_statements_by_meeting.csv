10,1976-03-29,"  I’d like to ask a question, Mr Chairman  Maybe our problem is our  concept of measures of these monetary aggregates  Perhaps we should move toward John  Balles’s suggestion of a longer-term measure instead of  a shorter-term measure and then  measure the operational aspects against that concept of M1 rather than the shorter-term concept  of M1  Then we could in fact produce the type of relationships where something makes some  sense  And we all have to admit that as long as you stick with the short-term concept of M1,  nothing is going to make any sense     And that only when we go to a longer-term concept will any of this  begin to make any sense, and maybe our definition of what we’re looking for ought to change  rather than the way we look for it     I have [unintelligible] knows that your projections for M1 may just  happen to accidentally hit the midpoint, which will lead you to future error     3/29/76 - 35 -      How much time?     Let me speak to this, Mr Chairman, because I raised this point several  months ago  It makes me extraordinarily uncomfortable to tell the public that we are watching  some measures or a relationship when in fact it’s a lie, and I just hate to see us do it  I’d rather  see us do the wrong thing and tell the public the truth than perhaps to do the right thing and lie  about it     Excuse me, that perhaps was an overstatement, we don’t say things so  directly [unintelligible] we say things more subtly  "
35,1976-04-20,"  Alan, have there been any developments in Italian private debt as a  consequence of all this?     My only comment was, if you had gone ahead and operated on a strict  basis as the Chairman mentioned, then the disparity between the results you did achieve and the  results you might have achieved would have been narrow  So perhaps you weren’t off as far as it  might initially appear     4/20/76 - 18 -             Mr Chairman, I share most of Governor Gardner’s comments in  general  However, I do share some comments by Mr Kimbrel concerning the price situation  I  think we’ll have to face this  I’m inclined to think that our posture should not only recognize  that we would find intolerable a larger range of growth, which the reduction of upper limits  would do, but I think that it might be equally appropriate, perhaps, for the public to clearly  understand that we would find equally tolerable a slower rate of growth  And for that reason I  would be inclined to go ahead and drop the lower limits about 1/2 point as well as drop the upper  limits about 1/2 point     However when it comes to M3, I think the 9 to 12 range is probably reasonable  If you  look at the actual rates of growth on that narrow portion of the difference between M2 and M3  [unintelligible]  But I believe the consequences of the broad action would bring those into the 9  to 12 range, which would be a significant reduction from their present posture and probably  would be an appropriate action just to leave it right where it is     Mr Chairman, I would agree with that  However, I would think that we  would want to then discuss this perennial topic of the zones of indifference  So if we go to the    4-1/2 to 5-1/4, we probably expect the Desk to focus around 4-7/8, which means a range of 4-3/4  to 5, which would suit me fine  I don’t see any need to discuss that any more  Those other  ranges are certainly all right  I don’t expect that we’ll see a volatile M2 in which it’s quite as  widely fluctuating under those circumstances  If anything, we might see it on the weak side, to  the extent that you move  Therefore, I would think that, under these circumstances, leaning on  the M1 side might be a little more prudent than giving equal balance     Mr Chairman, before you go into that, would it not be wise to instruct  the Desk as to the relative weights of these two measures, because I believe last month we  recommended that they be equally weighted, and that may or may not be the procedure this  month     Just let me be sure I understand what counsel is advising us  If the  Committee decided to go to a set of minutes in the normal customary style that most  organizations operate, wherein minutes are not final until approved at the succeeding meeting,  it’s your judgment that the Government in the Sunshine Act or Freedom of Information Act  would require disclosure of those minutes prior to the time they were approved at the subsequent  meeting     Maybe I missed the point, because it strikes me, Mr Chairman, that  perhaps Mr Baughman’s suggestion has merit  That we adopt one set of minutes for this  organization, and it includes all the things we have decided to do, but the actual verbiage of those  decisions as they would rest in the permanent Record of Policy Actions of this organization  would not be approved until the subsequent meeting, and after that subsequent meeting, they  would be disclosed     Then my suggestion won’t work     Well, if we eliminate the Memorandum of Discussion, that would give  some member of the Committee the opportunity someday to present an oral history at some  university that would bring great credit to that individual, whereas the Memorandum of  Discussion denies him that opportunity     4/20/76 - 70 -             I was just interested in whether he consented to the consensus or not  "
61,1976-05-18,"  If you didn’t, you might distort the information that you give to the  public, which would mislead them rather than inform them     How would you say no decision is a decision?     It strikes me, Mr Chairman, that we could well establish the custom, to  the extent that those meetings were held, that the public record would show that the Committee  had either a [unintelligible] or other type of meeting for the purpose of a discussion of recent  events which have transpired since the last meeting  I [unintelligible] just, a comment, and that  no policy actions were taken  And if you establish this custom, then the nature of the  discussion--I’ve never seen one of these yet where we didn’t discuss more than [we planned for  on] the day [on which] we convened  So I think that would be an accurate statement     This is really a [moot] discussion because the procedural issues are  subject to change by the Committee at any time  I think we haven’t had any occurrence [where]  delay of release of information would be appropriate, [but] all we do is change our procedures       5/18/76 - 13 -           [Unintelligible] but if that [unintelligible], then we have got that  alternative open to us so we really don’t have any problems     Mr Chairman, for the next meeting, why don’t we try to encourage each  Reserve Bank to make a special comment about industrial capacity in their Redbook comment?       I was just going to ask Lyle  We know that the cost pressures for price  increases have been there all along, it’s just [that] they have not been able to be validated by the  results coming in  And it looks to me like your projections will indicate, if anything, that that  aspect to demand is not going to continue to grow as rapidly as it has  Is it therefore possible  that even if these cost pressures exist, they will not be validated as well as businessmen might  hope or expect?  As a consequence of the lack of growth in prices?       I would generally share the approach that other people have expressed,  Mr Chairman  But I would be inclined to think that perhaps a more stable approach towards that  solution would be to use a federal funds range of 5 to 6, which would indicate a gradual  movement towards 5-1/2 over the immediate prospect, but then widen the range of M1 and M2  to, say, 4 to 8 or 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 for M1, somewhere in that range, and a 6 to 10 for M2, which  would mean that you’d need strong validation of the continued growth [of M1] before you’d go  above the midpoint of the 5 to 6 range  It is the same approach, just a different way to get there  "
88,1976-06-22,"  Mr Chairman, what provisions do we have in the by-laws or  incorporation certificates of the Federal Reserve Banks to authorize the Banks to defend actions  of its elected officers in their official capacity?  To commit the resources of the Banks to the  defense of the officers totally or the indemnification of the officers?     What about the officers and their [unintelligible] capacity as such?     Do we have any information about activities along the Southwestern  border indicating a change in people’s attitude toward the peso?  That might be a more general  question than the Desk would be informed about     I think generally they’re optimistic  But there’s no question about the  figures Lyle talked about, that for the last three months the index of sales of existing homes is  down and has not come back up  The number of single-family units sold is down, and has not  come back, which tends to support everything, except, perhaps, the permits figure, which is up   And although they are still generally optimistic, there’s no question about this     Up from a very low level--a less-low level I guess is about the best way  you could say it      What problems would you have if, when you had mechanical failures  like you had recently, you were operating on nonborrowed reserves versus fed funds  Fed funds  information is something you get externally, whereas the nonborrowed is internally generated     I would generally concur with your comments, even to the [point] that I  wouldn’t object to a money market directive rather than the aggregates directive     I think the money market directive versus a half [percentage point] and a  quarter [percentage point] on either side of the midpoint is in [unintelligible]       So I don’t think it’s worth discussing      Chairman, nobody discussed relative weights of the [M1 and M2]  aggregates and--     It appears from staff projections that the behavior in the savings deposit  market would be different from expectations, that it may be more different to date, and I would  personally be inclined to shade emphasis on M2 somewhat compared to 50-50   "
111,1976-07-19,"  Mr Chairman, I don’t think we ought to change [that decision]  I think  the best example I know of in our government of the reason to [not] change is the highest  decisionmaking body of people in our government, the Supreme Court of the United States,  composed of a number of learned people who give decisions that affect the lives of our people as  much as we do, if not more so  And if I [understand correctly], and I’d bow to members of  counsel around the table, they don’t give the deliberative process by which they arrive at a  conclusion  They give a conclusion which was concurred with by all     And to a significant extent, our minutes of actions or the type of disclosure that we give  now goes substantially beyond anything that the decisionmaking process in the judiciary goes  through, and outlines all alternatives that were considered and the range of discretion  And I  think from the public policy point of view that is sufficient  I don’t see any outcry on the part of  attorneys claiming that the Supreme Court of the United States must keep a verbatim transcript  for scholars to research later  And I just frankly never understood why there was this outcry for  this body to do the same thing     Be careful in writing the letter that we don’t suggest or bring up the  subject of [the Government in the] Sunshine bill [in regard to] the Open Market Committee   You be very, very careful that we don’t bring that up     Is the Mexican situation stable?  What are the prospects there?     Believe or disbelieve  I think the most interesting comment I’ve heard  recently about rents and multifamily construction was from Baltimore this past week from a  guest at lunch, Mr Meyerhoff, who’s very experienced with all kinds of apartment developers   And the question was asked, how much increase in gross rents will it take with today’s levels of  interest rates and construction costs before it becomes economical again or attractive for  professional apartment developers to reenter the market in any strength     He said it would depend largely on various geographic areas  For instance, he said in the  Atlanta area, Mr Kimbrel, that rents had stayed so flat so long that it would take at least a  25 percent increase in gross rents to make it attractive  In the Baltimore area, where they were  operating and where there had been some continual increase in gross rents, he felt 15 percent  would do it  And I find that these comments of his are pretty typical of those around the country   I hear some comments, for instance, in California that it may take a 20 to 22 percent increase to  make it economically attractive, where there is some prospect of profit     Well, as you approach the margin you will find some people begin to  anticipate, certainly  But here again, this feeds back to the attitude of the institutional  investors--the insurance companies, the banks  They got burned because they made some  investments on expectations of increases that did not materialize, and they will remember it a  long time, in my judgment, and they won’t fall for that again  They want to see bird in hand  before they [unintelligible]     Mr Chairman, may I ask to what extent is the impact of velocity  projections being influenced by the changes in the character of the definition of money ?     We publish a four-week and a 13-week moving average, don’t we?     I am not sure of the 13 weeks, but I believe I’ve seen in the last two,  three days our most recent publication on the four-week     The consequence of that, Mr Chairman, as I understand that suggestion,  would be to react more irrationally, because you’d have a wider range over which reaction would  take place over the same uncertain information     7/19-20/76 - 49 -     I would like to add just one more reason for reducing the limits on M2  and M3, and that is the changing financial technology that has been discussed here today  It  would make at least logical [sense to] say that, as these other measures become substitutes for     7/19-20/76 - 58 -   transaction-type purposes, they will naturally be more closely equated to M1, which we have  long thought of as [a] transactions measure [of money]     So therefore, for that reason, the rates of growth are not as necessary to  sustain [given] patterns of activity, and that would encourage us to at least bring [those rates]  down slightly     There’s a legal question only  As pertains to this meeting that we’re  having right now, is there any likely prospect that a court would order the immediate release of  this vote prior to the testimony scheduled for the 27th?   SPEAKER(?)  Quite frankly, the answer is no     Then I would like to suggest a pragmatic solution, that the decision be  made [for] this meeting to go ahead and have the vote because the possibilities of damages or  consequence are sufficiently remote as to not overweigh the merits, apparently, of some people’s  wishes to dissent     Same     Let me ask a factual question of the Desk, Mr Chairman  Would you  move to the limits on the federal funds range unless the aggregates were clearly outside the  ranges?     I would argue, Mr Chairman, that now would be a good time to broaden  the range  Using M1 as an example, we see April at 149, May at 64, and June at negative 12   If July and the projections for August would indicate something below the 4 we’re discussing, I  would argue that 1/2 point would not be too much     Conversely, if we see the figures for that period going back into the 8 range, I would argue  that a 1/2 point on the top side would not be too much  Because if we see the figure coming in  low, it would tend to substantiate the June experience, which we really have some question  about, and properly so  Conversely, if we see them coming up in the high range, this would tend  to add validity to the April-May trend we saw and [imply] that June was in fact a statistical or  maybe some other freakish type of situation that was not reflective of the underlying strengths   And therefore I would argue that using the full range would be a good thing to do under these  circumstances     I do, too  "
139,1976-08-17,"  It might be more appropriate to talk now than at some other time     Do we have any current estimate yet as to the degree of US private  investment in Mexican CDs?  I noticed that in a consumer-type advisory service in the  Washington papers yesterday they were continuing to recommend to US investors that they buy  Mexican CDs at 12 percent  But do you have any idea of the nature of it and, if the devaluation  occurred, the potential ratifications?     My understanding was all pesos     I don’t know whether it would have domestic implications or not for our  relationship with Mexico  I don’t have any idea what size it is     Did you have similar changes as a non-M1 transactional concept of  money that we’ve had like in our [unintelligible] occurred in [unintelligible] those periods of--     8/17/76 - 19 -       I would agree with the fundamental approach being taken  However, I  would not recommend any strong move that might be interpreted by the public as an overt     8/17/76 - 22 -    action, primarily because I think the public would misinterpret it  One, there would be  allegations that it was done for other than monetary reasons despite what the real reason may  have been  Two, if overt action toward ease [through a] change in reserve requirements were  made, I would suggest that, if you have a business community that’s cautious, this might  reinforce their caution because the monetary authority would be adding its doubts to those  already in their own minds and so perhaps inject an additional element of caution  So I’m not  sure that psychologically the [unintelligible] expression of a level of interest rates would  necessarily overcome the attitude of the monetary authorities     Getting back to the other issue, I’m not sure I’d agree with President Black about M2  We  had this balancing point creating arbitrary rates of growth around Regulation Q, and therefore I  would think that M2 rates of growth to a significant extent are still artificial as we go to one side  or the other of a Q rate  And so while I’m not a worshiper of M1 for any reason, I wonder  whether we really ought to be that persistent in our attention to M2 when we are at this peculiar  balancing point where we can have all of the money flow in one direction due to just a slight  change in the rate     In short, I would stick to alternative B, and certainly--unless we’re going to change the  rules--I would say have the full range available based on the incoming evidence that is available  to us  "
160,1976-09-21,"  Is it possible that this is the ultimate enforcer of their programs?     9/21/76 - 4 -       The continuing monthly needs will be supplied only to the extent that  they can qualify--     To declare a moratorium when you need $200 million a month  additional?     Mr Chairman, I feel that it is appropriate to maintain about our same  posture  I do think that in view of the announcements expected this week, we may get a market  reaction on the reverse side     Right  And to that extent I think we may get a slight change between  our posture and the market’s posture, which may take a little while to work out  For that reason,  I would be inclined to favor the narrow rather than the broader approach to the federal funds rate  and a money market directive  And I do think, in view of the strong growth in savings, that in  the first part of September, the 9 to 13 range is probably the more likely consequence of this type  of interest rate posture that we have, although I don’t know that I feel we need argue about 8 to  12 or 9 to 13 percent  The consequences of [unintelligible] worth arguing about, but I think  those are possibly the likely consequences  "
182,1976-10-19,"  You’re speaking of short-term leasing?     Mr Chairman, I think Steve’s comment makes me want to say  something  We have been through a long period of declines in unemployment rates  Declines in  inflation rates  Coupled with what in many people’s judgment in our society and around the  world has been relatively conservative monetary policy  And I think that the issue that Governor  Gardner just mentioned is not that we’re going to suffer absolute decline  I personally don’t  think that’s a likely prospect     I think the issue facing us is whether the rate of progress in the future will continue to be  acceptable in our society and other societies--so that, while the concept of the ultimate solution  being achieved through further control of inflation and further conservative monetary concepts  will continue to be bought, I think the test will come as to whether or not our rate of progress  becomes acceptable in our society, not whether we have an absolute decline  And to that extent,  it may be even more difficult to continue to hold the world’s feet to the fire, if I can put it that  way, even though we may be convinced of the original wisdom of the concept, [and the]  objective, and the approach to reach that objective  As I say, it may be much more difficult in  the future     Now, that brings up the question as to whether or not a temporary bow in the other  direction might produce significant change as we continue to pursue the objective in the way that  we’ve been going or, indeed, the way the world’s going  But it strikes me as [being] relative  rates of progress that we’re talking about, and I don’t share quite the pessimism in the tone that I  hear around the table  I see a slowdown, but I don’t see quite as pessimistic a rate of slowdown  as other people have seen in general       I’d agree to the two aggregates constraints  I would personally consider  a kind of skewed federal funds rate of 4-1/2 to 5-1/4, but to go to the “midpoint” of 4-3/4  I  wouldn’t want to see it go under 4-1/2 or over 5-1/4, but I would like to see us go to 4-3/4 right  away       Yes, that’s what I’d like to suggest  [Unintelligible]      Mr Chairman, I would not want to see us lower the upper end of M1  today  I think if you listen to our staff’s projections for the next year, over which this time  framework is proposed--while admittedly an overall reduction in the growth of that aspect of our  monetary policy is appropriate, I don’t know that it’s appropriate considering the economic  projection     I would disagree with the likely consequences of the relationship between that type of M1  growth and the M2, M3 growth  I would suspect that, here again, in this trading off between the  breakpoint of the arbitrary price mechanism that we call Regulation Q, as the short-run operating  aspects have traded one side or the other to that, it has produced distortions in the rates of growth  in M2 and M3  And in the longer-term context, the experience that we have seems closer to our  longer-run targets [unintelligible] the more likely consequence of the two     There’s another reason why I would hesitate to increase them, and that is, to the extent that  M2 and M3 are becoming transactional as we discussed, it strikes me that increasing those  ranges by whatever mechanistic means would be a mistake and certainly out of character with  our attitude about M1    "
204,1976-11-08,"  Good morning, gentlemen  Like others that have spoken earlier, I have  some concern about the present rate of growth in our economy  However, I am not quite as  pessimistic as some of you would appear to be this morning  I do think that considering the  present price prospects, we’ve got a dual dilemma  [One is the] need to be sure that we don’t  exacerbate [price prospects] in any way by our monetary policy--in fact, to go further than that,  to do what we can to slow them down  But at the same time we have the problem that--given the  shifting emphasis toward a higher price level--a smaller growth in the supply of funds actually  produces a higher rate of restraint       11/8/76 - 9 -           There is a great argument I can see in reducing the rate of growth in M1 for the future   Further, I can see a valid argument that somehow or another we need to break ourselves out of  this recent habit of half of 1 percent reductions  Because otherwise it would take us forever to  get down where we really ought to be, and that will require much more material reductions in  rates  And another half a point reduction tends to give the color of custom and habit, which is  the holy of holies in most economies, to the half-point rate of change  And to that extent there is  some argument in my mind that says, stick to the 7 percent upper level, warn the public that  more material reductions will be necessary in the future, and urge that perhaps a 1 percent  reduction take place the following quarter  Just as evidence that this small amount of reduction  can’t be tolerated     And also, I’m sold by Mr Winn’s shifting-base concept, and on balance I would prefer  that we keep the 7 percent upper range for the present  However that would not say that I feel  that a reduction to 6-1/2 would be something really worth fighting and arguing about one way or  the other, because I think the merits on both sides of this argument are pretty well balanced   Material consequences are probably--it’s how we say it, more than what we do, in this  circumstance that strikes me as being the most important aspect of our targets announced to the  Congress     Before that discussion takes place, Mr Chairman, would it be possible to  ask Mr Axilrod a question?     Mr Axilrod, we have seen substantial growth in M2 and M3 in recent  months as a consequence of the Regulation Q interest rate ceilings on certain classes of time and  savings deposits  Is it your judgment that, if interest rates stay at the same level--and I recognize  that’s a hypothetical situation because we have no way of knowing--we’re likely to continue to  see the rapid rate of growth in M2 and M3 that we’ve seen in October and September and in  more recent months?  Or is that likely to level off in the future in relationship to the long-range  prospects that we’re discussing today?     Mr Chairman, I would favor leaving the present ranges for M2 and M3  as they presently are stated to the public  It strikes me that the arguments that Mr Winn made  about the shifting base of M1 becomes especially pertinent [to] the effect of shifting the base of  M2, which is at a much higher level  And thus, as we look at the prospects for increased growth  based on this higher level, the present ranges are certainly more appropriate than an increase  "
221,1976-11-16,"  Let’s don’t say “enjoy” that much credit; they just have that much credit   It’s an important difference     Just how long do you think this will hold the Mexicans, if I could use  that expression?     Are references to actions [unintelligible] personnel issues of matters of  substance?     I share Governor Coldwell’s feeling about the economy and particularly  the unemployment rate  At the same time, while [the unemployment rate] may be unacceptable,  I think the real question is, what are you going to do about it, if [there is] anything you can do  about it?  To that extent, it’s my conclusion that there’s a relatively limited amount that monetary  policy can do about it  There may be only slightly different action that fiscal policy can take, and  I’m inclined to believe that there are limits as to what fiscal policy can do about it  To that  extent, I think that our action in this country in that particular area lies in fields as yet untried, in  the area of structural changes to which we’ve been addressing ourselves in various speeches and  so forth  And until the country does address itself to some of these structural changes, we will  continue to be frustrated in our conclusions  And the consequences may be counterproductive  rather than effective     Nonetheless, having said that, I do feel that in the general environment in which our  country is operating today, that some ease in nominal rates of interest are appropriate  I really  wonder whether lower interest rates necessarily will produce the more expansive growth in  monetary aggregates, particularly over the short run, that we’re discussing today  At the same  time, I’m inclined to think that if we only ease 1/8, it will not be sufficiently [evident] to the  general public to accomplish the goals that we’re really trying to [accomplish]  It’s my judgment  that, to a significant degree, these are cosmetic rather than substantial, and properly so--only  cosmetic     To that extent, I would be more inclined to have a federal funds rate of 4-1/4 to 5, or 4-1/2  to 5-1/4  I’d be inclined toward 4-1/2 to 5-1/4 with an asymmetrical 4-3/4 [midpoint] rate, but I  think these are mechanics  The main thing is, I’d like to see us go to 4-3/4  [For M1 and M2], I  would be inclined to use [alternative A]--3 to 7 for M1 and 10 to 14 for M2  It appears that the  staff’s projections--and we’re a quarter of the way into the two-month projections--lead us to  believe that we’ll have about a 12 percent rate of growth in M2, anyway, and it strikes me that  the portion of the market where M2 rates of growth are so sensitive are the places where we do  continue to need an assurance of liquidity, if I can put it that way--the housing market being one  of them       11/16/76 - 41 -           I share Governor Partee’s feeling that we may be getting close to the place where  managers, particularly in the thrift institutions and savings departments of commercial banks,  may be having a reassessment of what they can continue to pay and at what rates they may  reinvest their funds in order to stay in business  It strikes me that if we view the housing market  as being one of the basic strengths, a significant reduction in interest rates on long-term home  mortgages, and by that I mean 1/4 or a 1/2 point, as a result of continued liquidity that thrift  industries [unintelligible], would be a method of sustaining that demand  I don’t think it would  help the multifamily side of that market at all  I think it takes something substantially more than  that, and, in fact, the inflationary trend in construction probably will outrun even any change in  interest rates that are likely to take place, so I don’t see much change in that     But it strikes me that, if we’re hanging onto two things right now as being signs of  strength, namely housing and hopefully final consumer demand, these two areas strike me as  being a good place where we might have some genuine impact from a monetary policy point of  view  And to that extent I would be inclined to [put] M2 [at] the 10 to 14 range     Conversely, if they are low, we’d tighten earlier     I gather we’ll have the revised version of our testimony on the new  [monetary aggregate ranges]; that the Committee will discuss it?     11/16/76 - 48 -             This is the old-style version, Chuck  "
247,1976-12-20,"  [Unintelligible]     Maybe I’d better ask counsel then  In the event we were required under  the various lawsuits and hearings to publish the meetings, is there any particular strategy or merit  in separating the specification from the directive?  Or is that temporizing with the situation as  recorded by--we proceed through that and require that both be linked?     So we would be required to publish the English and the Arabic  [numerals]     My point is that by incorporating the two, it is possible that we could  foreclose our options that might be available to us at a later date     Do you want to insert the word “normal”?       I can see value in imprecision because then we interpret collaboration to  mean what we want it to  It could mean whatever on occasion we want it to mean then     It doesn’t mean participate     Do you want to go beyond this to say, in the absence of the Chairman,  senior members of the Committee?     Would it be possible to take action and encourage those people who later  have reached different conclusions to present their conclusions at a later meeting?     Would it even be possible for them to address the issue of how often the  Committee should meet?      How often the Committee should meet      I’m not trying to challenge the idea of when to meet, I’m just thinking it  should be objectively viewed in light of the policy action      I’m not advocating a change, I just think that if they’re going to study  the issue of policy action, the change in the rate of policy actions is sometimes as important as  the action being taken    I think the proposal by Governor Partee would accommodate that kind of  problem because it discusses action from a midpoint rather than action within a range      That’s a shortfall in revenues of about 2 percent generally?     It’s in the range of expectations for the next 10 years or so     Steve, have we had any unique events take place in the December  figures that you’ve had, like currency going to Mexico, a bank that’s [unintelligible] reserve  accounting, anything like that that we create uniquely?     [Unintelligible]     Yes, for the December figures     You don’t think that’s significant, though     In the growth rates that have been projected     12/20-21/76 - 59 -           I didn’t think the economy was in grief as some people thought [during]  the past months  [Unintelligible]  As the first quarter begins to unfold, how [unintelligible] is  the third and fourth quarter of 1976  The first quarter might continue to be the type of economic  growth that is going to produce social nonsatisfaction despite the economy’s satisfaction  As far  as monetary policy is concerned, I do think that it would be appropriate to use the money market  directive at this time because of these decisions and it would be foolish to create unnecessary  noise as a result of statistical circumstances  Since we’ve become so extraordinarily precise  about how we do these things, I would like to point out that if we go to 4-5/8, that would mean  that we would come down 6 basis points from where we were last week, which is one-third of  the way down to the 4-1/2 that people argued for  And I think that illustrates the problem of  trying to be so precise  I would hope that the Desk would understand that if we center on 4-5/8,  [unintelligible] on the low side or on the high side, which probably wouldn’t have a material  difference, and we’d all end up being happy     I was going to say, if we are going to go in that direction, I would prefer  the 2 to 7 range for M1; the other ranges are okay  But if prices move, the difference in the  projection [unintelligible] and in Richmond  The center of the world here is moving south  "
275,1977-01-17,"  It doesn’t [unintelligible]     This is not linked to that [unintelligible]     1/17-18/77 - 7 -             If we decide that we are not an agency covered by the statute, but do  decide to publish as a public gesture the Committee rules of procedure, we are then not  constrained as to time by the Administrative Procedures Act or the Sunshine Act, and therefore,  we could publish our own voluntary and gratuitous disclosure any time prior to the effective date  without having any time constraints otherwise  Is that correct?     It is mostly likely that the [Bank Activities] Committee meeting would  be open, too, under those circumstances     The best answer to this, Mr Chairman, is to have one open [meeting],  and then nobody would show up after that     We’re increasing how often we intervene in marks  Do you think we  need larger working balances, or is the swap an adequate substitute--     How did that information compare with inventory accumulation in  nondurables at retail?     That’s true in materials and intermediate goods, not in finished goods   So you get a substantial disparity based on the stage in process     I have a slightly different judgment on this question, Mr Chairman  I  would think that once the perception of these [large-]size deficits takes place, we are likely to see  a continuation of what we have already seen--a desire on the part of businesses to get their long- term financing accomplished rather promptly, particularly refinancing, like the utilities are  doing     Right  Second, I would guess that you see maybe a very, very short- term acceleration in capital spending as people try to get projects completed that are in process     1/17-18/77 - 37 -           of construction, and an attempt to get under firm contract things that are committed but are not  nailed down as to price  But over the long-term, I would think that into ’78 it would indicate a  reduction in capital spending because of--      Yes, I would have a slightly different judgment about the consequences  for the economy for ’77 to those expressed  I think my own judgment about the actually  measured economic progress wouldn’t be too different  My own judgment would be that the  public perception of that progress would not be as strong as the actual measurement of it  I think  [that members of] the public are poor economists is what I am trying to say, and therefore I think  the consequences for unemployment, things of this sort, would produce a public attitude that  would not reflect the progress that would actually be measured and be made     However, I don’t know whether to be awed or amused by the accuracy of the measurement  you have been able to make on full employment, when you are able to measure unemployment  levels at full employment down to the fourth decimal place  I wish we shared your capacities in  much more important fields, because I think that’s an amazing performance     496 percent is an amazing figure     When we talk about structural change, I think that’s true of the labor  force, too, as we talk about the public perception of economic progress  When you see about 40  percent of the women as participants in the work force, I think our perception of an acceptable  unemployment level for those participants in the work force is going to change     Would the weather, natural gas situation impact on this prospect?     It strikes me as a possibility--the inventory accumulation could be  delayed even though it might be not be canceled at this time     1/17-18/77 - 39 -             Does your figure adjust for military and government workers?     Mr Chairman, I think the one thing we need to recognize in the  discussion we’re having, particularly in the M2 and M3 measures, is that the retention of  approximately the same targets [assumes] a substantial reduction in the rate of growth in time  and savings deposits, both in commercial banks and in thrift institutions, because the actual rate  of growth in M2 for ’76 was 113 [percent], which is out of our present range, and M3 was 131  [percent], which is even more substantially beyond  And I think we need to recognize that even  retention of our present targets over time will constitute a substantial change from the present  environment in which those types of saving activities are taking place     Now, of course, the next question is, to what extent is a substantial change appropriate for  the economic and inflationary prospects that we have before us?  I personally feel that these  aberrations, as I’ve said before, are to a large measure the product of this silly price-fixing  mechanism called Regulation Q, and that the underlying fundamentals of the monetary policy  that attaches to these are clouded by the shifts from one type of liquidity to another type  And  we’ve seen some indications of that I feel that, given the perspective of ’75 that we had, and  given the impact on economic activity that will take place--and there will be some real impact  taking place as liquidity shifts from these types of savings forms to other types of savings forms  if our long-term objectives are reached--that this will produce a salutary effect on inflationary  prospects, but it will also produce some effect on real economic activity     So therefore, I share the fundamental objectives that you outlined  And I think this  perhaps will be much more real in [the effort to control] inflation and inflationary expectations  than perhaps we recognize from the action taken today  And so I would support the proposals  that you’re making, but I think the impact will be much more dramatic if they are carried out      1/17-18/77 - 45 -           After all, these are current objectives [unintelligible]  But I think the result, perhaps, is more  dramatic than has been outlined in your statement because I think they would be very real, and  probably even dramatic, in some of their economic ramifications     Did you say “to the extremities” or “through the extremities”?     I would be inclined to support the 3 to 7 M1 and 7 to 11 M2 ranges  It  strikes me that, within the current environment of the money market, I would be more inclined to  the 4-1/4 to 5 federal funds rate [range]  While I share the concern about the prospective bulge, I  don’t share the opinion that near-term prospects of changes in the federal funds rate of the  magnitude we are likely to undertake are going to produce a darn bit of difference     1/17-18/77 - 63 -             Could I have Mr Axilrod’s judgment on the reaction in the marketplace  toward a perceived slight firming in the federal funds rate given the recent emotional reaction to  prospects of interest rates     That might be the reason I asked you--he’s too close to it     You would plan on moving to 4-3/4 with deliberate speed is the course  you--  "
300,1977-02-15,"  Are you speaking of commercial bankers or central bankers?     Mr Chairman, I will just say that all of this assumes that we will have  had a relatively strong sustained rate of growth for three full years after the trough  And that  may or may not occur  Well, I begin to question the validity of that strong a rate of growth for  that long a period     John, what [effect does] the development of much more modern farm  techniques in all of Mexico begin to have on that projection and on our relationship with that  country?     Recent newspaper reports would indicate that the substantial  improvement in modern farming techniques [in Mexico] could have some moderating effect on  that influence of California     Maybe they just recently had a drought, too; I don’t know       Have you noticed any change in the source of CDs for banks in domestic  versus foreign?     --material shift in the sources of them?     Would you think it material if there was?     That’s the impression I’m getting  That’s the reason I was asking the  question  But I frankly don’t know whether it’s material or immaterial     Excuse me  I used the wrong expression  I’m talking about purchased  funds as a whole     Have we done any studies on V3 which would tend to eliminate the  changes in financial technology?  It wouldn’t totally do so, but it would reduce it     Until you get to V3 you don’t have the total effect as well covered as  you would     It just strikes me that it might tend to give you some indication [of what]  effect changes in technology would have on this     But it’s not all going to banks [unintelligible]     I don’t see the need to make a big, long speech, Mr Chairman  I think  you ought to just stay at alternative B      I think we ought to incorporate it in the record just like it’s proposed   We just had a long discussion this morning about our living within the spirit of the Sunshine Act,  and I think this is just evidence of that intent      It imposes a duty on the Manager, though      Most of these require the Secretary of the Treasury’s approval?   "
327,1977-03-15,"  Do we have an indication that they would accept the appointment?     They’ve had a good bit of cost pressure and relatively little price relief  from it     Mr Chairman, I just think that the underlying economic situation is  stronger than the staff expects, and that the prospects for continued expansion are probably better  than they estimate, although how materially is hard to anticipate, as much as it’s hard to  anticipate anything  It’s my guess that we will see some increases in the public’s demands  despite our generally liquid position  For that reason, I’m inclined for strategy reasons to go  ahead and remind the country that the central bank will be responsive to that need     And while we have remained relatively static, almost mechanical, for the last couple of  months, I think we ought to not lure the market or the country into thinking that we would  continue to do so  And therefore, for strategy reasons as much as any other, I would be prepared  to use a 4 to 8 [for M1] and a 6 to 10 [for M2], and a federal funds rate of 4-1/2 to 5-1/4, moving  to the midpoint with deliberate speed even now, anticipating that it would have a generally  salutary effect, even though it might be very small       3/15/77 - 30 -           Unfortunately, I think the problem of our meeting today is that we’re arguing over  millimeters out of our universe, and it’s somewhat foolish on our part, but at the same time, the  market has gotten so sensitive to millimeters, I guess even those little tiny steps do have some  psychological impact, and I think it’s worth taking them  "
350,1977-04-19,"  We noticed from Bob Black, in the directors meeting last time, some  evidence that the [sentiment was positive] as a consequence of the reaction of financial markets     On your nonfinancial corporation capital expenditures, is it fair to say  that you have not included the inflation budget as part of these projections?     It strikes me, though, that perhaps one aspect of that inflation budget that  could impact on this projection is an alleged commitment to speed up the approval process,     4/19/77 - 9 -           through which planned expenditures--starts--could be made--construction permits  If we get  that--     I said, if we get that  The consequences would likely be that you would  have an acceleration as a result of those that are already in the pipeline, going on the slow  process, together with those that could get added to it in the speeded up process  Together with  perhaps even a third factor, those that weren’t quite committed to go forward because of the  expected long delays, those might be encouraged to come along and do something     And so it could well be that, while these projections here look to me like they are very  strong, it’s possible that they could be strengthened even further, which would increase that gap  between internally generated funds [and expenditures]  And it strikes me that those components  of the so-called inflation package that might have a real prospect of taking place, this could well  be one of them that would be more under the control of the Administration rather than require a  more massive legislative package  And would that more likely take place and have an impact on  the interest rate factor we just talked about and get translated into the market?     The other question I had is this  We’ve seen automobiles be so strong for so long, and the  figures would indicate that that has been assisted by a lengthening of the maturity schedule on  automobile debt by consumers  And of course our consumer credit figures begin to look like  there’s a lot of it taking place  To what extent would you guess that this is borrowing from the  future, rather than being a sustainable pattern of investment?     How does that tie in with the continued increase in the prices of used  cars?  Is that a function of the price of the new rather than the scrapping rate or the trade-in rate?     Does this influence land prices upwards or downwards?     Are those loans based on the market value of the land or based on the  income-producing value of the land?     I’ve also heard some suggestions that perhaps our use of seasonal  borrowing at what we otherwise call reserve-city banks, or the denial of the use of seasonal  borrowing for that size bank, has hampered the delivery system of crops in some sense  And I  heard this in Memphis, Larry, that the people there were talking about their [being the] focal  point for the delivery system [for] agricultural products, which produces seasonal pressures on  the banks, but they didn’t have the privileges that the country banks have  And that this was  hampering their capacity to serve the agricultural system     How does the flow of funds projections predict interest rates over the  past few years?     Mr Chairman, one thing that hasn’t been mentioned is the more recent  environment of inflationary prospects and [unintelligible]  First, we have had recent price  increases, and while the staff projection indicates that those will flatten out, and perhaps [during]  the balance of the forecast period they may not be anywhere close to what they have been, we  can view different opinions as to how likely that prospect can be  Each of us would have  different [views]     I think there’s a consensus around this table, as I hear it, and around the country, that any  energy policy is likely to have a negative impact on the price situation--be likely to increase  prices [unintelligible]  I think for that reason it’s appropriate now for us to go ahead and lower  slightly our future range  I recognize, Mr Chairman, that we’re in a funny situation  You have  apparently some information about an energy policy that the rest of us don’t have  And when all  of us have that energy information, it might be entirely appropriate that we reconsider anything  we do today  But unfortunately, for that reason, I think the judgment here should be based on  what we know rather than what we think might occur  We have ample time to reassess our  decision     Getting to the point, I noticed that in the first quarter 1977, our actually experienced rates  of growth were 42, 80, and 97 for M1, M2, and M3  And while I recognize that that’s only a  relatively short period as to what we’re discussing today, I don’t see any indication that we’re  going to see dislocations of the type that Chuck indicated are likely to occur  Second, if there’s  any validity in the staff forecast, I would say the chances of M2 and M3 growing at a  significantly slower rate than we’ve experienced are probable  That’s in the range of probability,  not possibility  All of that added together, I would support a 4-1/2 to 6-1/2 for M1 and reduce  the range for M2 a half a point on both ends to go to 6-1/2 to 9-1/2, and M3, 8 to 11     That’s one reason I’d accept your proposal, except I would go to the  midpoint instead of having an asymmetrical midpoint  I’d go to the natural midpoint, if there is  such a thing     That’s just the money market directive without saying it  "
378,1977-05-17,"  Mr Chairman, let me clarify the point you made  My recollection is that  the staff memorandum we received indicated that the outstanding volume of commitments by  life and insurance companies was going up  Did I forget--     This is nothing new, Mr Chairman  This has been going on all  throughout the country for the last 10 years or so  Really, consumer finance companies have  offered this type of financing  Their experience has been excellent  The last nationwide figures I  saw for one of them showed a net underwriting profit instead of a loss  In other words, they had  no loss whatever  Many of the bank holding companies have entered into this type of activity  through  their consumer finance subsidiaries  Their experience thus far has been generally good   I would suspect that if you looked at the actual loan-to-value ratios, you would find that the first  and second mortgage combined wouldn’t exceed a prudent first mortgage whatever, and  probably the combined debt service would not be materially more burdensome than that on a  first mortgage at current rates     I need to be shown the figures to see that this is wild speculation on the  banks’ part because it’s a practice that’s been pretty well known throughout the country in the  last 10 years     Because many times the existing first mortgage, which may be assumed  or retained, is at such a low interest rate--4, 5, 6, or 7 percent--that the combined total cost of the  two produces a lower cost to the customer than a refinance rate at current rates, which now have  risen to the 9 to 9-1/4 rate, I understand, out there  Is that correct, John?       To what extent have we seen a growth in the use of margin accounts for  personal consumption purposes versus securities purchases?  Is there any indication of that--I  know there are several plans afloat that would relate the two types of financing so that you could  use a margin account for personal consumption purposes     Well, that’s my judgment  It’s obvious the money is going someplace     5/17/77 - 8 -             Steve, in view of your flow of funds projections and the general scenario  painted in the Bluebook, what do you see the yield curve doing during this next six to nine  months?  Is it going to get significantly flatter, or are long-term rates going to react upward,  where you continue to have a significant disparate view between short and long term?  Or what’s  the general scenario you are expecting to pull out of all of this?     Does that tie in with the flow of funds projections that we’ve got?       I would share a lot of the judgments that have been expressed about the  concern for an unusual rate of growth, but I also am concerned about the uncertainty of the  reaction that might flow from that  I wouldn’t want to hesitate to restrain that rate of growth if  it’s quite clear that, in the period ahead, this growth has some underlying fundamentals to it  But  at the same time, I think it would be a mistake to try to react to it too severely when it could be  seasonals and everything else that would distort the course of policy  I would prefer that we do  so with a slightly different technique  Of course, the one alternative would be to use the money  market approach, but I think that’s a mistake under the circumstances, with the underlying  economic conditions developing the way they are     I think perhaps a better way, in my judgment, would be to intentionally broaden the ranges   More specifically, zero to 5 [for M1], 3 to 8 [for M2], which would give us the flexibility of     5/17/77 - 28 -           recognizing that we may have some reaction within a range  But at the same time, it would give  us the capacity--without having to have any special meeting or anything of that sort if the  aggregates were clearly way below any expectation or the strength continued--to react and go  ahead and move to it with a 5 to 5-3/4 percent federal funds range and the same midpoints of  5-1/4 to 5-3/8 we talked about  But it strikes me that this may be an easier operating method of  approaching the same goal that’s been expressed by all of us     Mr Chairman, while you are studying that, may I ask Mr Kimbrel a  question?  In discussing the Florida freeze, you mentioned that you thought it might have been  an act of providence  We are aware that certain of your townspeople are now running the United  States government, but I didn’t know they had taken over the weather     Estimating errors really are getting tough around here     5/17/77 - 36 -             I didn’t say that  "
397,1977-05-27,"  I think we have got to get our facts together before we can make a  decision, and obviously the IRS’s attitude toward any course of action is one of the most  essential [facts] we have got to get  I think that the discussions that we would initiate are not  likely to damage our alternatives, and so therefore I think we ought to go forward and have a  discussion based on what facts we can develop at the next meeting      I would not want us to stop doing the transactions without a meeting of  the FOMC to make that decision     5/27/77 - 7 -        Paul, I’d hate to stop acting as principal without a meeting of the  Committee  "
415,1977-06-21,"  Is that a consequence of returns filed in the first quarter for gifts made in  the last quarter of the term?      How did you relate the stock market to that, considering that many of  these long bonds are purchased by people that would normally have been in equities to a certain  extent  And they obviously are not going to     In that connection, John, I happen to have been at the New York board  meeting, and I don’t think Paul was; Alan was, some others  But there was some indication that  this was not an unusual phenomenon, that typically loan demand growth in New York lagged the  rest of the country in a business cycle, and that this was not abnormal in any sense of the word--     I have already said what I was going to say     I prefer alternative B, but I would prefer a money market directive  If  you look at the calendar and the distortion to take place July 1, and we meet on the 19th, and the  projections are that it’ll take two weeks for this to be worked out, we will really hardly know  what’s going on for July or most of the period ahead of us  So I think a money market directive  would be preferable      6/21/77 - 34 -        "
440,1977-07-19,"  But are they doing too much?     Alan, what are the ramifications of significant changes in official  holdings?     To what extent has that total flow been reduced by the change in levels  of exports as a result of seasonal impact and also by all reserves having been built up?     As I recall from the weekly report last month, at least one of those  countries that had normally made substantial RPs [repurchase agreements] had substantially  reduced deposits to transfer what small amount there was to Europe immediately to cover some  of their old--     Well, as I recall the figures, if we had a labor force composition similar  to that of 1970--teenagers, women, and adult men--the consequences today would be roughly 1  percent lower on the unemployment rate     If you had the same composition--     Would it be possible to adjust them based on a changing rate of  inflation?  Would that be just too complicated to be meaningful?     I was just interested in the comparative mix proposed in automobile  sales, which has been a major source of strength in the economy  And over the next quarter, or  [few] quarters, it looks like you are staying pretty much constant about the total  But the mix  between foreign and domestic looks like it changes  And I am wondering [whether] you had  anticipated the type of exchange rate actions that we have had this week, and [if so], we should  perhaps listen to you more often than we do to some of our foreign traders, because you knew  more about [that] more fundamental situation that influences that     My only reaction is that I have had some question about the rate of auto sales that you  proposed  Because if you’re proposing a 6 percent rate increase in prices here, together with the  consequences for foreign sales that are likely to occur as a result of a change in exchange rates,  together with the continued high levels of consumer debt despite your low ratios to disposable  income--the chances of a lower total auto sales picture seems to me to be substantial  In addition  to that, we see a strength in the single-family house sales, and I wonder if we looked very  carefully at the rate of sales that have taken place for new houses in the last three months,  because it has been down, down, down  Not major, but distinct--     But, on the point of view of the GNP figures, [unintelligible]     Maybe yes, maybe no; time will tell  The disparity in prices makes you  begin to wonder when you see the price differential now $10,000 on median prices  It will begin  to have its impacts, I think     The differential in price between existing and new houses  Wider and  wider     My recollection is that it is over $10,000  I have forgotten the figure     The median price for new housing is so substantially higher than the  median price in existing houses     I am suggesting that the capacity of the consumer to continue to pay for  the new house is being diminished  And the capacity of the consumer to be willing to pay for the  additional price of the new houses is being diminished  And in that way, sales of existing homes  may not translate into sales of new ones     What I’m really saying is, I think it’s entirely possible that, while the  psychology will probably offset the increased interest rates that you project, particularly the  psychology of inflation in house prices--the consumer will not be as sensitive to increases in  interest rates--I believe that the capacity to pay, despite the ratios of debt and so forth, are  beginning to influence that, and it looks like the actual sales experience will be sensitive  I  wouldn’t be surprised if we [saw] an earlier tightening, if not a slight downturn, in new houses  under construction--or total value     I know you don’t have a bullish housing market, but I--     --I’m wondering whether even the slight increase you show might be in  more doubt     I believe the real issue that will face the Committee will not be whether  we will accommodate a lower rate of growth in M1 that’s suggested by the 4 to 6-1/2, but  whether we will move against the higher rates of growth  For that reason I would favor a 4 to 6  range for M1  Having done so, I think the consequences would likely be that a reduction in the  M2 range would be appropriate, or logical at least  And for that reason I would favor the 7 to 9  for M2     Now, I’m embarrassed to admit that I haven’t done my homework to see what rates of  growth would accrue to the thrift industry as a result of a specified change in the rates of growth  between M2 and M3  I haven’t done my homework, but my guess is that, here again, the  consequences of the first decision would be a lower rate of growth in M3  Only from the point  of view of candor with the public would I then anticipate that we’re likely to see an 8 to 10 or 8  to 10-1/2 range on M3     Why do we have to have it?     Could we vote to include the bank credit or not to include it?     But the implicit vote is to state an objective for bank credit     Because I don’t think there is any indication [in] Governor Coldwell’s  suggestion as to whether we exclude it completely or include it and have the staff insert the  figure     What better way would there be to convey to the public our  determination to operate closer to the midpoint than to reduce our maximum upper end?     Just one question  To what extent do these short-term projections  include the possibility that, for brief periods, the wild-card maturing deposits will be deposited in  the M1 demand deposit figure before they’re rolled over?     Do you think that would be a material factor?     You don’t think that [any] of [the] alternatives here would pose the  likelihood of substantial disintermediation then?     Mr Chairman, I would support the aggregates proposed for M1 and M2   I would also support the federal funds range, while normally, I think the wider range of latitude  would be desirable  In view of the unknown consequences of financial shifts as a result of the  wild-card expirations that we may be experiencing, of which we don’t know the ramifications, I  think a narrower federal funds [rate] would be a better course of action while keeping the  monetary aggregates  I would move with deliberate speed to the midpoint of the ranges  Which  means 5-1/2--not instantaneously, but with deliberate speed in that direction  "
466,1977-08-16,"  Is the morning telephone call in Europe still in action?  If so, how did it  work out?     As I remember, the central banks were exchanging a morning  conference call     Any of these speculative?  Or just institutional?     The people with whom I’ve discussed the situation within the last three  weeks have come back to a surprising concern about inflation  This appears to be the number  one issue in the minds of most people that I’ve visited  They think business conditions are good,  they think underlying demand is good  They think the biggest single risk event that would  destroy future growth is a sufficient resurgence of inflation [unintelligible] that would destroy  confidence [unintelligible]  And in the minds of the people I’ve talked to, that’s been  surprisingly number one and very strong, much stronger in their views than I’ve heard before     May I ask a question about the lumber situation?  My impression is that  lumber prices are closer to their peaks  They’re very high, yet you talk about mills unable to  operate in a relatively efficient market like that  I’m surprised     Is this slopped over from British Columbia, where they have those  massive settlements?     I don’t know that I’d share that judgment about the threat of the capital  gains tax  It appears that the stock market has had a type of segregated action  The so-called  high-growth, high-multiple corporation has had an agonizing readjustment in future expectations  of their growth, or the profits that might be achieved in the market as a result of their growth,  and they have come down in price; on the [other hand], many of the other small corporations that  have not had as much influence on the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones have had pretty good  experience     If I had to guess, I would guess that your major institutional buyers, bank trust  departments, pension funds, and things of that sort have been a major factor in the reduction of  the share price of these major growth companies, whereas individuals have been more inclined to  go with the smaller companies  Individuals, in turn, have probably had a net increase in values,     8/16/77 - 17 -           which wouldn’t sustain the belief that there was any likelihood that there would be a depressed  [market] as a result of the loss of capital gains     I would guess that some of this has got to be the continued shift of expectations by  professional managers of major portfolios, and their expectation for profit through the stock  market, and their shift to fixed-income securities--which I think would be supported by the stable  long-term interest rates we’ve been seeing and continue to expect--and the high cash flow the  life insurance companies and the pension funds have experienced and their predilection to stay in  fixed-income securities to a large extent     May I ask to what extent our industrial capacity in this country presently  differs from the industrial capacity of other major industrial countries throughout the world?  It  is the question of, we’re closer to the top than they are, and therefore future demands worldwide  might be supplied [unintelligible]?     Just in general, your impression     It strikes me as that is the essential question to Governor Wallich’s  potential hypothesis, as to what extent will pressures from capacity utilization in this country and  capital expansion be ameliorated by the capacity of other industrial nations if they increased  their [exports] to the US, which would not enable prices in the US to rise to respond to the  need you describe     Significantly lower     As I recall, in the fourth quarter of ’76 it was up in the 18 range     May I ask what you mean by that  You mean that you change your  criteria for loans?     In what way could you avoid it?     Why?  On what basis would you justify such action?     But I got the distinct impression you changed your policy in view of a  change in monetary attitude on our part  Is that what you’re saying?     I got the distinct impression that you were tougher on the banks and  wouldn’t allow them to get credit--on some of the banks--as a consequence of your changed  attitude about monetary policy     8/16/77 - 38 -             But do we adjust the concept of the discount window to suit our whims  or is that a constant criterion that we use at the moment     That’s what I would want to get clear, that we weren’t changing our  standards     I think the issue of rates of growth for our economy for the next six  months or year are pretty clear  I think the recent rates of growth we have had are unsustainable   At the same time, I think that, unfortunately, we’ve overlooked the result that our rates of  unemployment are still unacceptable politically or socially  And it’s going to take rates of  [economic] growth above 4 percent to make any net change in that percentage of unemployment,  particularly given the prospects for the rates of growth in the labor force     So I think the target is rather clearly before us all, that rates above 4 percent are going to  be the objective, whether they are achieved or not  Now what are the most likely  [circumstances] that would cause us to fail to reach that objective?  I think the most likely cause  of failure, given the rest of the economy, is a collapse of sentiment and optimism on the part of  our society  And there again, I think the most likely cause of such a collapse would be inflation  and its ramifications, or the expectation of it     Now that sounds very simplistic to say, but I think it equates to our purposes because,  unfortunately, many of our people have become four o’clock Thursday disciples  And we have a  large number of people in this country--particularly those that make decisions for plant and  equipment expansion and those aspects of this economy that we are required to see expand to  reach our expectations--we see many of these people have become mechanical monetarists by  watching money supplies, and things like that, in a very superficial way  I don’t think they  understand it, but they look at it  And sometimes people react based on what they see rather than  what they expect     For that reason, I do think that we are going to have to be alert to significant deviations  from our long-term targets in monetary aggregates more than underlying circumstances would  have otherwise reasonably dictated  And I think that that will be the best tool that we can utilize  to assure the type of expansion in our society that would be socially, politically acceptable to us  and to the rest of the world     And when it comes to equate that right now to current action, I would advocate that we  would have a 0 to 6 M1, a 3 to 8 M2  I don’t share Governor Partee’s judgment that going to a  money market directive is appropriate at this time, with this wide range  Meaning [that the  monetary aggregates directive] accomplishes the same result but clearly provides for the  alternative that, if we do get continued sustained growth in monetary aggregates over the 30 days  ahead of us--and we’re two weeks into it now--then we would not hesitate to go ahead and move  even within that range       8/16/77 - 50 -           As to the federal funds rate, I would personally favor the skewed situation of 5-3/4 to  6-1/2,  using the 6 percent [as midpoint]  I do think that, given what we know for the first two  weeks, and given this type of broad sentiment of the Committee for accepting the lower rate of  growth, going below 5-3/4 would probably be a mistake  At the same time, if we do see strong  expansion in the money supply even within the next 30 days, I think the most constructive thing  this group could do for the sustained confidence of our people to go forward with our economy  would be 6-1/2, if that’s what it takes  And so I would be prepared to do it     May I suggest, Mr Chairman, that we use the 5-3/4 to 6-1/4 and then the  0 to 5 [for M1], [which has a] slightly lower midpoint [than 0 to 6], which I think would  accomplish the two positions     If we say 230, we will start at 245     May I ask a question?  First, I believe you characterize this as being  politically inspired--partisan politically inspired  I’m not sure I understand what you mean by  that     Given that--and I appreciate your explanation because I wasn’t aware of  all the details you mentioned--but given that, should we not then consider whether or not the  possibility of releasing all of the unreleased Memoranda could diminish any allegations that that  was the motivation that you mentioned  In lieu of just the one you mentioned was under public  discussion, release all of them     May I ask a question  We’ve recently had some congressional requests  for Reserve Bank minutes and forecasts  Is it our counsel’s judgment that a congressional  request for these memoranda will be properly and successfully refused?     8/16/77 - 70 -             Considering our very unhappy recent experience, is it your judgment  that it’s possible the Times could ask certain well-known members of Congress to request these  for their own judgment if they were refused by us?  I’m not trying to urge them to do so, far from  it  I’m trying to uncover the realistic alternatives that might arise on how to [unintelligible] on  our part  We seem to have had so many other people effectively communicating with the  Congress their wishes and desires     Frankly, Mr Chairman, I think my personal conclusion is that we should  not release the document currently  However, I think we should give serious thought to not only  releasing 1972 but all the other unreleased Memoranda in January 1978     It appears to me, Mr Chairman, that it’s my personal judgment that our  best course of action would be to deny this request but at the same time advise that we will  release all Memoranda in January unpublished as to now     Because I think that does two things  Number one, that does eliminate  any inference that we are protecting this situation for improper purposes  But at the same time, I  think it pushes this organization to the type of posture where our alleged secrecy,  [unintelligible], of manipulating the strings of the world, is exploded and done away with once  and for all  "
495,1977-09-20,"  I do think, Jim, though, that you’re running into a situation--as I recall,  in the California area, [according to] one of the banks that I talked to that was active in the  second mortgage area, about 28 to 32 percent of the second mortgages extended were for the  purpose of refinancing existing consumer debt, to reduce either the monthly payment burden or  extend maturity or something like that  So we may be in a situation where you’re having  consumers contract debt to purchase automobiles on short term but are refinancing it on the 15-  to 20-year [mortgage] plans  Now, unfortunately, though, I think we’ve run into the problem  where much of this debt is still recorded as consumer installment debt on our consumer  installment charts that you see at the end of the room, rather than real property debt, so I’m not  sure that our figures are clear as to what’s really going on, as being influenced by that other type  of consumer credit     Mr Volcker, can I ask you a question, please?  Do you see foreign  prospects as being dim versus immediate circumstances as being flat?     It looks like Brazil is another major foreign borrower whose prospects  are looking up     I think the point that Governor Partee has, though, is important--an  evaluation should include prospects for shock effect of a serious situation that might develop  with an individual weak country     9/20/77 - 24 -     Did this adversely financially affect the Nichols company that owned all  that area?     My question pertained to that subject, Mr Chairman  Mr Axilrod, to  what extent do we better understand the ramifications of the Regulation Q ceiling interest rate on  the growth rate of M2 and M3, and how much they may have impacted on the high side in earlier  periods, and to what extent they may impact on the lower side in the period which you are  projecting?     Do you think that the implication of the Regulation Q ceiling will make  the use of M2 as an operational target more imperfect, or will it be sufficiently distortive to make  it worthy of reconsideration of the use of M2?     9/20/77 - 40 -     But you don’t think you would destroy the operational effectiveness of  it     I think philosophically I would agree with you that, particularly where  the ramifications of our operations are so uncertain, particularly as to the mechanistic definitions  of what constitutes money, and particularly as we may be entering a phase where there’s a new  relationship between supply and the real economy, which I would read as our goal--that to purely  take either approach would be a mistake     Speaking to the issue of the ramification of two months of instructions to the Desk, in view  of the fact that staff projections for the two-month period are effectively 7 percent, I do think that  issuing instructions to the Desk in the 3 to 7 percent range would most likely produce  instructions to increase the funds rate even though there might be only a very small divergence in  the result of such  And I don’t think such an overt intentional move to raise funds rates today,  based on the uncertainty of our knowledge, would be appropriate  And for that reason I would  suggest that, while I would be perfectly happy to see the lower end of M1 down in the 3 percent  range--be perfectly happy to see that, in fact--I’d even buy zero, except it’d look foolish on the  statement when we published it, and I’d admit that  I would say 3 percent would certainly be  acceptable, but I would argue for an 8 percent ceiling in light of the staff’s projection because     9/20/77 - 42 -   we’re now significantly into September; we have a pretty good insight as to what that might be   And the staff projections for October exceed 7     Another thing, I don’t know how to implement this concern, but the truth is that every 90  days we’ve had a surge  And we’ve had a surge in previous Octobers  While I would be the first  to hope that we don’t have another one, at the same time I recognize that, given our recent  experience, the prospects of having another one aren’t ridiculous or remote  And therefore,  seeing such a low limit in contrast to the projections, [it] strikes me [that] the result would be an  intentional increase in the federal funds rate with relatively little change in the relationship  between money supply and economic activity     For that same reason, I would be inclined to go 4 to 9 percent on M2  However, having  made such an expansion on the top, I would be willing to see a 6 to 6-3/4 percent range for the  funds range rather than a 6-1/2 top limit so that if we get another massive movement in October--     It puts it over the top of the range, which then I think would justify a  stronger move in the federal funds rate--     That’s an operational question that I’m not sure I agree with, based on  my understanding of the way we operate  But at any rate, I would prefer to see the 6-3/4 percent  top limit so that if the Desk saw significant increases beyond the 3 to 8 percent that I’m  suggesting, that we would go as high as 6-3/4     Excuse me, I overlooked the fact that I would propose the 6-1/4 estimate  for the midpoint  It was a 6 to 6-3/4 percent range     In my own viewpoint, I wouldn’t view an eighth of one percent as being  a significant change     May I ask a question, Mr Chairman?     If the Committee chooses to adopt the 3 to 7 percent range for M1 and a  4 to 8 for M2, and the staff’s projection of approximately 7 percent increase in M1 and a  comparable increase for M2 arrives, comes to fruition, to the extent that we will understand it as  the period develops, could I ask Alan where you would move the federal funds rate?     That’s the reason I predicated my question on the assumption that the  results are what the staff projected  Namely about a 7 percent increase     Did I understand your answer to be that if, say, by the third week, it still  affirmed a likely projection of 7 percent, you would likely be at 6-1/2 percent?     Well, that’s what I concluded     Mr Chairman, if I sense the thrust of the discussion that we have had, it  appears to be considerable concern that the adoption of a monetary aggregates directive with  midpoints expressed the way they are would result in a relatively certain move to the upper ends  of the federal funds range  [And] perhaps a greater likelihood than normal that there would be a  call meeting of the Committee to take action beyond that     I wonder whether there might be some sentiment for adopting the proposal made by  Governor Wallich earlier, where you use a money market directive with the ranges, with the  likelihood that staff projections are correct  The result would be that the aggregates would move  beyond the expected ranges and action would be taken as a consequence of it, which would  again give us the likely opportunity that we would have another meeting, and we would have  another look, [and] perhaps greater knowledge could be brought to bear on our problem     9/20/77 - 60 -  "
519,1977-10-17,"  Or the consequences abroad, or the lack of growth, could produce  political instability, which would produce inflows regardless of the rate     May I ask a factual question in that regard?  What price in imported oil  did you include in these projections?     That’s my point, I don’t have the facts on which to base a projection, but  it appears that apartment housing and [federal] urban development multifamily programs perhaps  are a little stronger than some people originally estimated it  There was a push in the fall of last  year to accelerate the rate of starts temporarily  What it appears is that their programs are a little  more on track and have a more rational basis of future growth than they had been for the last  several years  At the same time, there have been some real rates of increase in gross rents, with     10/17-18/77 - 8 -         oversupplies in many communities being worked off  And I believe our flow of funds would  indicate that the historic group of lenders that have concentrated in the multifamily sector still  have strong supplies of funds, which would tend to support that market     Well, the demand side has improved  Unfortunately, we got the opposite  side of that equation  Gross rents may go up, but it takes net rents--as we keep reminding  ourselves--to go up before you get any production that comes along behind  I do think that the  one thing that should be the follow-up question, Bob, is that the chart on three-month Treasury  bill expectations combined with the domestic private mortgage borrowing would presuppose that  the continued flow into the historic mortgage institution would at least stay positive if not strong,  or relatively strong     I think your best news there was the most recent sales figures that we  saw both in existing and in new housing  We had several months where it looked like  production exceeded the sales, but there was a quick one-month catch-up in that, and it occurred  during a part of the year where you normally have heavy sales  So while I don’t know the actual  sales figures--we see the seasonally adjusted sales figure--but I suspect the actual sales figure  would be very strong  Sometimes in the winter months you can get a sales figure that looks real  strong, but when you analyze the actual rather than the seasonally adjusted, it doesn’t make that  much difference  But when you get an August or September sales figure that looks very strong, I  think it has much more meaning for the whole market tone than we would if we saw, say, a  January or February sales figure that was strong     Even if we get a mix, Mr Chairman, of slightly lower rates of single- family starts or construction and slightly higher rates of multifamily, the net total constant-dollar  effect of the two would be flat, or maybe even a reduction, because of the difference in the cost  per unit  So you need to be very careful between looking at units figures versus total put-in- place dollars     That may have opened up in the last 60 days--first time in over 15 years     Is agricultural land continuing to be effective for foreign investment,  which would influence our discussion?     Isn’t October one of your taxpaying months, also?     So, therefore, if your people had a good month this month, at least a  reasonable month, it would be an even stronger month than you might expect     Usually, in a taxpaying month you go negative in Boston, as I recall     I think the staff’s projection is a very rational, thoughtful, and  appropriate effort about the expectations for the economy  Unfortunately, though, at this stage  of the economic recovery of the United States, at least, I think we are entering an area where it’s  not what is or what is expected to be but the reaction to these events that may be the determinant  of change  For example, if the expectation comes forward, I would judge that there would be a  substantial segment of our country that would consider the rate of progress grossly unsatisfactory  and would advocate all sorts of governmental or other efforts to make radical changes in the  rates of growth as a result of the unemployment situation having effectively stagnated at about  its present level  And so the public perception of our economy may well be deteriorating as a  consequence of political rhetoric and those other members of our society that don’t view it as  being satisfactory  I think that the same thing is unfortunately true in the business community  about action of government  It appears that we are about to embark on a very serious series of  discussions--energy being the first of them, the tax, other aspects of the business community   [These] will be the subject of intense government discussion, much of which is very likely to  lead to a sense of discouragement on the part of the public  Our staff illustrated the consumer  confidence series, and things of that sort     In short, I think the proposal is a rational one, and one that is most likely to be achieved  I  do think, however, that the risks are definitely on the downside rather than the upside as a result  of the deterioration in general public confidence and the economic prospects that we have--led  on, unfortunately, by many people who will give an emotional reaction to a series of facts or a  philosophical reaction to a series of facts that will distort the real event, which will in turn erode  confidence to the extent that you’ll have real changes on the downside  I think, therefore, that to  that extent our responsibility on this whole equation will be even more sensitive--to do our best,  not only to do the right thing but to try to ensure that it is understood in the right way--to that  extent we have a more than normal responsibility to contribute toward the recovery, not only in  real terms but in emotional and psychological terms     Is there any change in the psychological attitude of foreign official  institutions that are a major holder of the dollar reserves, other than these major trading people?     To what extent could these shifts in currencies be a reflection of the  change in the currencies in which they’re buying their imports?  For example, that trade with  Japan and Germany has picked up relative to that in the US?     Well, gentlemen, they say a little humble crow is one of the most  therapeutic medicines that any individual can have  Having led the argument for reducing the  ranges three months ago, I’ll have to eat a little of my own medicine and say that I don’t share  that judgment today  Why?  First, I recognize that we have got this problem about this so-called  overshoot in M1, and I think it does run the genuine risk at this stage of the growth of the  economy, where, as we said yesterday, we see capacity pressures beginning to show up  And if  we built this potential inflationary pressure into the economy, that we accept and don’t do  anything about, we are running the risk on the upside of inflation, and we have to recognize that   I also recognize that if we don’t do something about it, there are certain of our critics who will  enjoy criticizing us and questioning the validity of our commitment toward reducing inflation     Nonetheless, it is my judgment that alternative B would be the appropriate course of  action  Why?  First, I do think we have to recognize that if we look at our rates of growth since  the third quarter of 1975 for M1, they have been gradually up almost quarter-by- quarter in most  of the periods that we’ve had  So I do think that we have to recognize that there is a real  potential that changes in velocity that we talked about have taken place  I think that if we adopt  the 4 to 6-1/2 percent for M1 under alternative B, that it should not be misunderstood  The likely  consequences, in my judgment, are that this is going to be a relatively restrictive monetary policy  on our part--not an expansionary monetary policy, but a relatively restrictive monetary policy  If  these changes in money demands have in fact taken place, that may be a very restrictive  monetary policy, and the base drift would be only a very modest change in how restrictive it  would be     Next, I think that, to reduce the ranges in M2 and M3 recognizes that there are many things  that we as a body, in our regulatory function, could do to achieve arbitrary targets for any one of  these Ms  Let’s face it, we can take some regulatory changes in the Board of Governors today  that would make M1 come out about 4 percent, and all it would do would be to transfer the  concept of time and savings deposits and let them be [for] transactional use  And we could  produce any sort of artificial thing like that we wanted by regulatory changes, but that’s not the  business we’re in  Our business is to try to conduct the monetary affairs of this country so that  the real economy will operate properly  For that reason, I think that our credibility is better  stated by addressing ourselves to the broader ranges, which encompass all these potential  regulatory changes and encompass, to a certain extent even some of these artificial price  mechanisms we call Regulation Q  I recognize that even M3 does not take that into  consideration  However, I think a reduction in those will state not only to the country, but to the  world, our commitment to long-term price stability     I think that raises a valid question, what will the consequences of such reductions of a full  percent[age point] be to those sectors of the economy that are most sensitive to the flow of funds  into the thrift industry and into the time and savings deposits at commercial banks?  I realize that  any staff projections have to be mechanistic and use arbitrary assumptions about various  components of measures of money  But I asked the Board’s staff what the consequences would     10/17-18/77 - 47 -         be of using the midpoints of currency and demand deposits growth under M1 and then the  consequences for actual thrift industry growth [if we have] time and savings deposit growth in  commercial banks  And it was their judgment that if that were assumed and the alternative B  were assumed, it would still allow the thrift industry to grow at a 103 percent rate for the  coming year, from third quarter to third quarter, and the time and savings component to grow at  9 percent, which I believe would be consonant with maintenance of real economic activity in  those sectors of the economy which [are] so dependent [on] such types of money  Mr  Chairman, in short, I would advocate alternative B just like it’s stated     I take it that bank credit would be plugged in at 7 to 10?     Bank credit would be plugged in at 7 to 10?     I think I would prefer, to get to the point, to leave the aggregates as  indicated in alternative B, but I would prefer a money market directive with the federal funds  range from 6-1/4 to 7 percent  The reason for that is, I think, while I would share the judgment  that going below 6-1/2 would probably be a mistake, my limited understanding of the way all  these figures are kept is, in order to get below 3 percent on M1, for example, we’d have to have a  reduction in the money supply in the neighborhood of 4 percent for November, which I think is  most unlikely  From what I can see of the way the estimates for October are developing, there is  some risk that even the present projections for October may be low  To the extent that we do run  into estimates exceeding 8 percent, I would not hesitate to go all the way to a 7 percent federal  funds rate in response to that, and that’s the reason I prefer the money market directive  Once  we see it’s clearly moving out beyond that range, I think we ought to get pretty good movement  "
548,1977-11-15,"  Give us the rationale for directing that?  I’m not sure that’s clear     11/15/77 - 5 -           Could it be possible, Tom, to outline the maximum stalling tactic--and I  don’t mean that in a negative sense, but just a factual sense--that we are likely to accomplish  under either of these [scenarios], considering that the Supreme Court either would not grant  certiorari or else would grant it but then decide against us in this decision?  My question is  related to this fact--if our delay is not going to be sufficient in duration to enable the Congress  with great expectations to act, then the question, [it] strikes me, that [we] should address  [is]--would our ultimate best interest be served by having the effect on the court order earlier in  the day or later in the day from a congressional relief point of view?  And my question really  relates [to the following]  Is there a practical prospect that we could sufficiently delay the effect  of the court order as to give practical impact on congressional resort?     In other words, the Supreme Court would normally grant or fail to grant  certiorari within that period?     It’s the Supreme Court’s custom, then, to either grant or fail to grant  certiorari within the 30-day period?     Mr Chairman, I think we need to appeal [the court’s ruling], which is  quite obvious, and at the same time I think the consequences are that we will be, prior to  legislative actions, releasing our policies  I think those are the most likely prospects  I think that  in the present state of the economy, we are unlikely to get a little test--this month, maybe even  next month--of the consequences  However, I believe we’re moving in the right direction  Do  not change now, because I think that if the worst events occurred, it would be unlikely to damage  the real economy of the United States and the world     If that inconveniences the Federal Reserve, we’ve been inconvenienced before  If that  inconveniences the money markets and the Treasury, the Congress will address itself to that  issue in due course  It’s been inconvenienced before  I hope we don’t create dragons that are  just fictions in our minds  Yes, it will probably be a disadvantage to us  Yes, we will make  adjustments  Yes, the market will make adjustments  Yes, the Congress will probably  ultimately do this, and these things will come out  But I would hope that in the process of all  this, we don’t create the impression that the Federal Reserve is a devious organization trying to  circumvent what has become the national will, that government be done in as much sunshine as  possible, as inconvenient as that might be     So as the Committee goes forward, I would hope that we wouldn’t do foolish things by  adjusting our actual decisions on monetary policy to the market ramifications  The one thing I  hope I’ve learned in this experience in this Committee is that markets are amazingly resilient   And as soon as we make one change, they will make another  And I believe we will get the job  done  So please let’s don’t do the foolish thing like making sudden adjustments to avoid a court  order or the practicality of a court order as we go forward     I share the sentiment that the staff has that the progress of capital  investment will continue to be the real question  I think that the time lapsed since 1975 has  begun to generally erode the risk aspect of the profit expectations that various enterprises will  have in their minds before they commit [themselves to] long-term major projects  However,  unfortunately, we are having several things that would work against that generally positive  movement  Generally, I would think that, as the distance [from] the traumatic experiences of ’75  [lengthens], people’s memories would dim and they would get a little more optimistic and realize  that, in many cases, they have neglected opportunities that have come their way in the meantime,  and they’d better step forward     But unfortunately, there are some things that will influence that  First, I share the staff’s  concern that we are likely to get a general shock in inflationary expectations around the first  quarter of next year  Which strikes me--we’re less likely to get any benefits from agricultural  price levels  Yes, we’ve gotten nightmare situations where government, instead of being the  chief engine to arrest inflation, is the chief culprit; and I think this will hurt expectations and     11/15/77 - 30 -         increase, potentially, long-term interest rates, which will be a very material adverse factor in this  situation  Yes, nonfinancial circumstances could become more certain  But these types of  influences will be difficult to offset     Unfortunately, I think we have to face the realization that social policy is going to be very  difficult to interpret in the economic environment  We are rapidly getting into a two-class  society in which those that have any experience and have a job will be in short supply--already  probably are, in my judgment  And I guess this is a very unscientific way to do it, but I have  been looking at the want ads for employment in nearly every city I go to, and I find that it looks  like there is a heavy demand in nearly every case for anybody with any experience  And, except  at the very lowest job-entry level--busboys, some waitresses, etcetera, there’s practically no  demand  And so, unfortunately, from our social policy, we are going to have a very difficult  time trying to equate these two aspects of our society, and this breaks down not only racially but  ethnically, and urban versus rural, and so forth and so on  I think these types of stresses will  make it difficult     On balance, I think yes, we have a real opportunity with an expectation that we’ll move  forward, but the uncertainties will stay with us throughout the year, and therefore the course of  economic progress will move haltingly forward instead of breaking into the new environment of  which we have the potential  The ramifications for this organization will be that we will  continue to be in the forefront of discussion, and while we have an opportunity to be put on the  back burner and more or less ignored, it’s unlikely to take place     I would agree with alternative B as stated [in the Bluebook] and would  prefer that we not go down to 1 percent  The primary reason is that, while I would recognize the  uncertainty of December that Governor Partee outlined, the truth is that we will have limited  information on December 20, when we next meet, as to what the real ramifications of the entire  month will be, and much of our December emphasis will be on projections rather than on  actualities  And if our projections were to indicate that we have had the first two-month period  in which the M1 aspect of our aggregates is that low, it will be the first time in--I believe since  I’ve been here--that we’ve had anything close to that low, which would indicate that maybe  some of our actions have had some more real substance than we understand  And if it were to  result in going down a magnificent amount of 1/4 percent on the federal funds rate, I wouldn’t  get upset  "
573,1977-12-19,"  I think maybe we are getting too much into strategy right now, but it also  opens this opportunity  If the Senate Government Operations Committee would accept such a  proposal, it opens the chance that members of the Senate Banking and Currency Committee  would feel that their turf has been invaded, and they might start the type of judicial arguments  that would serve to delay even if not the [unintelligible]     You’re going to get it anyway       I think Governor Coldwell has expressed the concern that I have because  the question was the degree to which we would have a meeting and discuss long-range  objectives without coming to a final conclusion  Because I see us constrained in two ways--to  the extent we get a general consensus, or sense, or whatever you want, without formal action and  then have a telephone meeting later to take formal action, you’re obviously circumventing the  thrust of the court       12/19-20/77 - 27 -         And yet on the reverse side of it, I think, is that electronic communication has reached  marvelous levels but is not a substitute for collegial discussion of a serious material issue  And  by the time we hear Mr Roos say that he’s got a new telephone system and he can’t hear  anything at all, and by the time somebody at the Board drops a microphone or something like  that, I must say that the quality of substantive decisions that can be reached in that environment  is modest under the most polite assessment     And so I think we are facing a difficult decision to not circumvent the court but at the same  time follow our real decision, which is to collectively make the right judgment  And I think the  Committee needs to work very carefully now, when, as you mentioned a second ago privately to  me, maybe the answer is to try to adjust our meeting dates  But adjusting meeting dates--to meet  the whims of a current Chairman who might have a speech to make that week in the Congress,  you get various discussions backward and forward as to when they [in the Congress] want to  hold sessions; that might be done only if you had a clear cooperative spirit on the part of those  two committees; and never have anybody on the Committee die or have a birthday or something   It’s not going to be easy to solve those two problems      May I ask you a question about that?  To what extent would you weigh  the relative merits of a 1 percent[age point] federal funds constraint, versus a 4 percent  aggregates [unintelligible]  It strikes me that you have both alternatives      We have two tools and we have only focused on one; we have not  discussed the other       If intervention at the levels conducted by the foreign central banks in  recent weeks has been unsuccessful, what leads us to believe that anything appropriate by us  could be successful?     Well, I think we’ve got another aspect of the energy policy issue as well   I would agree that dramatic increases in the cost of domestic energy could precipitate economic  problems  But I think, at the same, the failure to do so is likely to precipitate economic problems  that won’t be as readily perceived and that won’t be as directly addressed  The fundamental  problem that we’re having to look at in our country is that the cost of energy is going to go up   It’s just a questions of how it is administered publicly  And perhaps if we were more realistic  about facing the problem and facing the consequences of a decreased rate of increase in the  standard of living or perhaps even a decrease in our standard of living, I think our people would  be more prepared to face that issue in a rational way than to keep hiding it under things that they  don’t understand as readily as they do the increase in the cost of energy     They don’t understand things like differentials in foreign exchange rates, and our export  policy, and the ramifications of protectionism  These are problems that the American public has  difficulty in understanding, even experts have difficulty in understanding them  But the  American public could understand the ramifications of an energy policy that related to the value  of the dollar and to their standard of living  I think they’d be more willing to address themselves  to a solution if we were more direct in our attempts to find them       12/19-20/77 - 40 -         Until that takes place, it’s my judgment that intervention on a level that’s greater than we  presently have embarked upon for purely short-term [management of a] disorderly [market] is  foolishness  Until such time as our country is willing to at least have some significant turn of  major policies, on which we could then have better foreign credibility toward our conviction of  sustaining the dollar, I think we’re wasting our resources and creating disorder rather than doing  the opposite       But they want to do it to the rest of the world as well     What is it, 15,000 jobs I’ve heard the figure quoted--     Or 115,000 jobs     The opposite side of that, I think, should be mentioned  There is a  school of thought that believes that much of the demand side of single family housing is a  product of the collapse in production that took place in earlier years; and that the increases in  equity of existing homeowners, together with this pent-up demand from the collapse in  production, has been able to sustain new house production at this price level  But soon [the  thinking goes], increases in nominal incomes and family formations and things like that will  begin to assert their long-term effect, and this present bulge may have overstated underlying  demand, and we may see ourselves unable to sustain final demand at this price level much  longer     The psychological factor as a financial asset is a major deterrent to that     This even is one of the arguments made for the higher participation rate  by women--that, [being] able to afford housing prices at these levels requires a two-earner  household in order to be able to have any prospect [of buying a house]--which encourages  women [to enter] the labor market       I think it’s unfortunate that we don’t furnish the other FOMC members a  table labeled 1-A in the Bluebook, which discusses the details of the time and savings  component  The Board gets them, and I think they have some information that is pertinent for  our policy discussion     The reason I bring it up is because I think it contains some information  that is pertinent, in my judgment, about the immediate course of the economy  I think it would  illustrate that the so-called passbook savings component [for] individuals is down significantly  below its previous level  And it illustrates that our potential for sustained final personal  consumption expenditures is likely to be good because people are apparently spending their  savings, or failing to save it  And I hear reports from some of my friends in that industry  indicating that at their branches, the lines with the people with the passbooks in their hands to  draw checks out is very significant in recent weeks     And so I think our prospects for a good strong final consumption are excellent, which in  turn will lead us into a good industrial production level and so forth for the early parts of 1978,  maybe somewhat like we saw for ’77  I also think that the prospects for capital expenditure are  as good as the staff has indicated, perhaps even better  We have to recognize that one of the  advantages we’ve gotten as a consequence of the changing of the value of the dollar is the  relative attractiveness of US investments by foreigners, particularly long-term investments,  industrial facilities, and things of this sort  I see that that will sustain us and offer increased  activity in the investment area     I also think that the change in the value of the dollar will produce a different perception as  to what capacity levels might be appropriate for us in this country  Heretofore, I suspect, many  of our multinational corporations have seen that their capacity levels in the United States did not  need to be expanded because of the potential for foreign capacity--which has been relatively  more slack than ours in my general perception--to meet this demand; and therefore US capacity  expansion was not as necessary  However, due to a change in rates, the cost of that foreign  capacity may be significantly increased and therefore encourage people to expand domestic  capacity at a rate that they hadn’t previously perceived to be necessary  So I think that will be a  plus in the capital expenditure side--perhaps even where we have not seen much, and that’s the  major new facility, the major new entity that will [provide] major increases in capacity,  particularly processing and things like that  I think, unfortunately, the situation in many of these  process industries, chemicals, textiles, and things of this sort is so dismal abroad [unintelligible]     In short, I would say that our economic prospects are good  Unfortunately, the  ramifications for political and social policy will not be easily obtained, going back to your labor  situation  It’s my judgment that we may be getting close to a real tightness in skilled labor,  despite the macro unemployment figures  I think we are getting very close to a tight situation in  that market for labor, which will mean that, as they say, the rich will get richer and the poor will  have more children  It’s a situation [with] tragic social and political consequences, [and] it may  pose some difficult economic choices and monetary choices for us as a consequence of this fact     12/19-20/77 - 54 -           Do we get a breakdown between industrial and commercial?  The  figures we see are just a gross of 70 thousand--     What does it tell us?     They have been growing on parallel paths?     How does warehouse get classified?  As commercial or industrial?       It is     I share the concern that was expressed by Governor Wallich about our  spread  However, I’m afraid our reasons have been produced by different circumstances, and  that is, our recent experience with the inaccuracy of the projections with which we’re dealing  If  I thought for a moment that our projections, which were the basis of our consideration, were a  little more accurate, I’d be delighted to move to a smaller range  But unfortunately, I find that  we base our policy conclusions for the short term on the projections, and the projections prove to  be wrong instead of the underlying circumstances to be wrong  So if we could find a way to  solve that, I’d be delighted to make a more narrow range of monetary aggregates     I do think that we’re faced with considerations this time that lead me to support a money  market directive  Because in addition to the risks of M1 we’ve faced, I think there is a  substantial possibility that in the year-end period, we would see our financial institutions, and the  banks that are covered by M2 in particular, issue a continued substantial volume of  nonnegotiable CDs, over $100,000, which, for reasons I never have understood, are included in  M2  But I think, given our decision to give equal weight to M1 and M2, we could get a high M2  as a consequence of that, which would encourage the Desk, with a miss in M1 projection, also to  have an M2 projection which would be distorted as a consequence of the credit demands that we  are having and the slow growth in the savings component of M2     So for that reason, I would encourage us to go to a money market directive  I would, to  that extent, though, support the lower ranges preferred by the Chairman for the M1 aspect of the  directive because I do think the consequences of continuing to tolerate ranges in the 9-1/2 range  over a two-month period are not appropriate at this time     May I respond, just briefly on--that was one reason for supporting [the]  lower range for M1 that a wider range for M2 would give you     Mr Chairman, I think there’s something very important for the  Presidents to know--to the extent that there is a problem, it’s not an FOMC problem  The Board  of Governors--it is my understanding of the law--has the right to specifically excuse the potential  conflict of interest which any of our directors may have and to specifically authorize them to  participate in a policy matter in which the conflict might otherwise be apparent     In other words, members of the Board of Governors have appeal only to the President of  the United States, whereas the Federal Reserve Bank directors have the right to appeal to the  Board of Governors, and the Board of Governors will be meeting, and if the issue becomes  obvious where we need correction, we have the power to correct it  So I don’t think it’s as big a  problem as the directors anticipate     To the extent that is necessary, I think we have the capacity to do   That’s--     Oh, I agree  But that’s one reason we don’t need to do it this afternoon     12/19-20/77 - 81 -        "
640,1978-02-28,"  Governor Wallich covered that in his testimony recently, Mr Chairman      To what extent do you try to unwind our position in periods of relative   calm?      I misunderstood  I thought you said there was relative calm for an   extended period of--      Do you perceive our function to be to make a profit [and not] a loss or to   counter a disorderly market?      May I ask a factual question?      As you acquire marks in your day-to-day trading, are they put into the   System=s account or are they used to repay [swaps]?      What would you consider a decent repayment?      Which priced drawing would you apply the proceeds to when you make   such a repayment?      This is a policy question that should be addressed as we [review] these   issues at the next meeting, so that we will know what the policy of the Committee is toward the  swap agreement       It is featured thus far in Ohio; however, the interest [in it] is expanding   nationwide at a rapid rate      I generally concur with the thrust of the staff analysis  If it could be   faulted, it would probably be on the inflation side  I would guess that as the year unfolds, the  translation of certain changes in food prices, which have been good news for the Agricultural Belt,  will become especially bad news to the consumer  Likewise, if the analysis of the slowdown in  single-family housing starts is accurate--and I happen to feel it is on target--the consequences will  be further increased pressures on housing costs, probably based on increased rents  Therefore, with  a sluggish increase in the supply of rental properties, you=re likely to see very significant increases  in gross rents, which will show up in the CPI--or whatever the new word is  I haven=t caught on to  the new concepts of inflation yet--that if we don=t like the old one it looks like we think of a new  word to describe it  At any rate, if you look at those two sectors of the consumer price question, I  think we=re in for some tougher periods ahead which, in turn, will impact on the general spirit of  confidence      I don=t think the fundamentals underneath the whole picture are that bad, though, and for that   reason I think the overall real GNP forecast is probably about on target  I=m not as pessimistic  about the automobile [sector] and other aspects [of the projection] because I do concur with the  [view] that, thus far, the consuming public seems willing to take on more debt and has a reasonable  degree of confidence  I=m afraid that our concept of employment is distorted by the aggregate  figures  It seems to me that what we have is a relatively tight labor market among the trained in  certain geographical locations combined with nightmare situations of severe unemployment in  other geographical locations and other sectors of the society so that, in the aggregate, we=re seeing  [the situation] as being worse than [it is] from an economic point of view  As a consequence, I  think those people who are employed and are consuming probably have a greater degree of  confidence than we are giving them credit for having, despite the increasing levels of debt  So I  would say net on that score that we will probably see a continued expansion  I do think the issue of  inflation, and particularly the dollar, should begin to have an impact on capital spending in this  country, and for that reason I don=t think we=re likely to be surprised by an expansion in that sector   We would all like to be surprised, I suspect, but I don=t think we=re likely to see it       Before I start, may I ask Mr Axilrod a question?  In your relative analysis   of M2, do you consider the present definition, which includes non-negotiable large CDs, to be  potentially subject to a substantial error because of the expansion of large non-negotiable CDs?       I bring that up, Mr Chairman, because as we talk about narrowing these   ranges as we go through this exercise, I think the uncertainties of our present definitional  imperfections, as I call them, is a subject we need to bear in mind significantly  I would endorse  the proposal that we stick with the [current] 4 to 6-1/2 for M1 and the 6-1/2 to 9 for M2 under the  circumstances  I think a half point reduction in M3, given the type of potential problem is more  realistic than a full one percent  I can perceive, frankly, a prospect that the thrift industry will be an  active participant in the CD market--perhaps to the degree we have not previously [seen]  And it’s  for that reason that I=m not sure M3 will degenerate to the extent that we are proposing       Over $100,000      Not yet  But if we get pressures on rates of growth in the thrift industry, I   can [conceive], particularly if the level of outstanding commitments stays large and the inflow [of  funds] is restrained, that [thrifts] may turn to this as a way to raise funds as an alternative to  borrowing from the Federal Home Loan Bank System  That would, of course, impact on [the M3       2/28/78           34  growth] rate  I think it=s important, as we communicate this to the world and to our Congress in  particular, that this not be perceived as a weakening of our resolve on the inflationary front  But on  the contrary, with the changes that we=ve seen in velocity and financial technology and so forth,  and particularly as the pressures of increased inflation are upon us, it is entirely possible that by  maintaining the present ranges we will have a very responsible monetary policy in light of these  conditions rather than irresponsible       How do you know the difference?      One question, Mr Chairman       2/28/78           42      This weather has produced such a substantial volume of float that our   capacity for issuing currency has been potentially impaired  Has any thought been given to  substituting agency securities for Treasuries so that we would still have additional leeway for the  issuance of currency?     SPEAKER(?)  It=s not legal      Excuse me, did I say the wrong thing?  I meant where we=d sell our   agencies and buy the Treasuries  Did I say the wrong thing?  I apologize      Has some consideration been given to some careful but nonetheless   deliberate shift in policy because of these restraints?      I think it is a policy question that the Committee would be wise to address  in a definitive way       I think we ought to be aware that Mr Holmes=s ego is probably highly   inflated by the procedure with which we have endowed him the capacity to manage affairs      I know he does, but at the same time it looks like every time he does well,   we want to make him do better  So I think that our focus on such an issue is not appropriate and, in  view of the intermeeting period being discussed, I think we ought to take alternative B  And to me,  the aggregates directive will accomplish the same result as the money market directive, because it=s  highly unlikely that in ten days we will have such wide swings in people=s perceptions as to  produce any difference       In our directive, we advise the Desk to take into consideration emerging   money market conditions including the “unsettled” conditions in foreign exchange markets  While  I would be the first to agree that they had been unsettled, by continuing to use that word are we in  turn continuing to remind the world just how unsettled they are?  Would we be wise to eliminate  that word and just say “including the conditions in foreign exchange markets”?       That strikes me as more prudent   "
660,1978-03-10,"  Another question  If the Treasury only has a billion dollars in resources,   is it unconditionally clear in our discussions with the Treasury that we would agree to use our  resources only so long as they continue to go 50-50 in activity?       No, but we don’t [strictly follow] such parliamentary procedures, Mr   Chairman  However, I would like to say that I don’t share the judgments expressed for this reason  It appears to me that the fundamental difficulty we’re having in this country today is a reluctance to  make some very nasty fundamentally political decisions in this area  If the Federal Reserve gives  the Treasury the indication that we would go forward when their resources reach an end and they  continue to procrastinate about the fundamentals through intervention techniques, it strikes me that  their resolve to make these nasty decisions will be weaker  For that reason, I would be strongly  against giving the Treasury any indication whatsoever that we would go forward other than 50-50  until their resources run out  Then we’ll talk to them about what we’ll do  It strikes me that that’s  a very important thing for us to do, given the nature of the domestic decisions that are going to  have to be addressed       A Treasury takeout or whatever it takes  But the main thing is that I don’t   think we ought to give the Treasury any indication or assurance that we will go forward beyond the  point where they are very active co-participants  I say 50-50, but I don’t think the ratio is  meticulously important  I think the concept that their limited resources will have to be measured  before they are squandered is a very important consideration       I’m not trying to suggest a mandatory percentage, but the fundamentally   equal concern I think is a very important consideration      Mr Chairman, I wonder if it might be wise for this action taken in this   interim meeting to reflect instructions to the Manager to take more consideration of conditions in  the foreign exchange markets than the directive might otherwise have stated--that that would be a  primary concern       I wonder if it might be wise for the minutes to reflect that the Committee   instructed the Manager to take more consideration of conditions in the foreign exchange market--to  that aspect of the directive--and less to that aspect of the directive in which the aggregates are to be  a basis of our operating policies       That’s the very point I’m alluding to  Rather than operating primarily on   M1 and M2 for the period until the next FOMC meeting, [I suggest] that we ask the Manager to  give more than normal consideration to the foreign exchange market and less to the aggregates  As  a consequence, therefore, the federal funds rate would be maintained [at 6-3/4 percent]    "
678,1978-03-21,"  Was there any comment about the fact that their oil now costs them less   as a result of our dollar exchange rate?       That was exactly my question     3/21/78              9      What is the difficulty of living with our present limits--we’ve been living   with them for a year--if we are going to come back to this question?      Why not live with our present ones before we change them?      That’s what concerned me about the proposal; the inference was that we   should become much more active      It’s my belief that we would be wise to sacrifice any other repayment   terms for retention of the loss-sharing because if that is reversed, the consequences are an  immediate doubling of our exposure  It strikes me that, with the level of exposure that we have  now and may end up having to continue to carry, anything that effectively doubles our loss  exposure in the consequence of funding it and then staying in that position is a mistake  And  alternative methods of repayment are not nearly so important as that one       Are there any prospects that the Canadians will want to draw [on] us?      I just wonder whether the next round might be with us      He can’t hear you, but the answer is no      I differ in the judgments that have been expressed  It is my view that if   we were to get the third month in a row of relatively slow growth in the aggregates this, first, would  be a signal to the international exchange market about the consequences of Federal Reserve  actions, which would produce a lessening pressure on the value of our dollar  Second, I would say  that if we got the third month of slow growth which is anticipated in April--that’s what we’re really  talking about--this would tend to bring in to more valid question how strong underlying economic  circumstances are  Further, I think that a change of 1/4 of 1 percentage point is not a major policy  change when it’s sustained by aggregate facts which would be known to the public, and for that  reason I would favor an aggregates directive  However, when it comes to the ranges, I would favor     3/21/78              52  the alternative B lower [limit] of 4-1/2 [for M1]  It strikes me that the top figure ought to be 8 not  9  We have just seen that the staff has proposed a major shift in the seasonal adjustment for April   What was it, 56 percent, I think?       In that light, if we kept the 9 and if the 46 projection for March stays   constant, this would mean that April could go to 134 percent before we’d see any change in the  Desk’s attitude  It strikes me that that’s too high, particularly in light of the seasonal adjustment  that we’ve already got  And while I realize bringing 9-1/2 down to 8 is still going to allow a  substantial growth in April, it strikes me that that’s the better course of action for that reason  I’d  say 4-1/2 to 8 percent [for M1]; the 6 to 10 percent I think is probably a reasonable projection [for  M2]; and I’d go with the 6-1/2 to 7 percent for the federal funds rate       I’d buy that, Mr Chairman, because we are in an environment in which   we may have a similar posture to what we had a few weeks ago, where our aggregates may tell us  one thing but circumstances beyond the aggregates may dictate a different response  I would say  that this is a very responsible way to handle it       Mr Chairman, I feel very strongly about wanting the Treasury to share   the burdens of operations on our part abroad  And I have been outspoken in that view  However, I  don’t see this proposal as being destructive of that objective  On the contrary, it strikes me that in  the event the Treasury were to make a loan itself to some other country this proposal--by being able  to replenish their funds with a warehousing arrangement with us--would enable them perhaps to  stay in as our partners in support of our position instead of having to refuse to [join] because [the  Exchange Stabilization Fund] doesn’t have any money  For that reason I would support this  I  don’t think this is contrary to the attitude of keeping their feet to the fire over on the other side    "
702,1978-04-18,"  Our policy, as I understand it, is to counter disorder  It would appear that  when the mark-dollar relationship goes adverse to the dollar, we buy $100 million  When it goes  favorably to the dollar, we buy 5 or 10 million [marks]  Why the difference?       Is there something fundamental that makes it disorderly when the dollar  goes down but makes it orderly when the dollar goes up?       Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think the first thing we ought to recognize is  that we have already done what you have proposed, [Ernie], and we have done it repeatedly  We  have not done it in the way that you propose it, but we made the fundamental step and have  repeatedly announced to the Congress and to the public that the policy of the Federal Open Market  Committee over time is to reduce the rates of growth of all the monetary aggregates as rapidly as  underlying economic conditions will permit  We have so stated  I believe I am correct, am I [not]?  And we have stated that repeatedly to the Congress  Now, I recognize that “as rapidly as the  underlying economic conditions will permit” is not in accordance with perhaps the [program] that  you propose--namely, that we would state targets and stick with them perhaps through thick or thin  or whatever happens  Even if we have to airlift the economy in the free world, we will do it  That  might be one judgment; it happens not to be mine  But that is something that each person could     4/18/78             11  make up their own mind on  Second, I do think that over time, unfolding events in the real  economy as well as unfolding financial events make the establishment of long-term mathematical  targets impractical  For example, if the Board decides to implement automatic transfers, obviously  it would have implications for rates of growth in M1 over a 3-year period       It strikes me that [there is a great deal of] unfolding financial technology in  the present environment--whether it be interest on demand deposits, electronic funds transfers, or  changed financial powers between one type of financial institution or another  It strikes me that the  only concept of liquidity in the economy that would be appropriate would be so broad as to not be  specifically or psychologically meaningful for the purposes that you propose       Mr Chairman, it was my judgment that it was a much more constructive  discussion than we expected to have       I share generally the views that have been expressed by Chuck and Frank   I do think that our focus on the GNP concepts of the economy may be masking some of the factors  simply because we get this rate-of-growth focus rather than some of the actual rates of current  activities that are taking place  For example, we focus on housing starts and what we really ought  to be thinking about is how much construction is being put in place as a consequence of what is  going on  In my judgment we are likely to have a substantial carry-forward in l978 even if the rate  of starts turns downward      I happen to be closer to Henry Wallich’s point of view about the concept of full employment  I think we are reaching full employment in many sectors of our labor force today  Even though the  aggregate numbers of people unemployed may be socially unacceptable, I’m not sure that  necessarily means that they are economically unacceptable  There is an important difference that  we have not faced  I think the consequences of an increase in employment are going to be to  sustain consumption  And it looks like the changes in our social fabric of who is employed will  sustain much more expansion in consumer credit than we had previously expected ever to be  sustainable  I realize that there are upper limits on that, but thus far it looks like they have not been  reached      I also think our prospects for fixed investment are going to be good  Unfortunately, I also  share the judgment that our inflationary prospects are dim  I see a general unwillingness on the  part of those people who [ought to] make some very nasty decisions in private and public sectors to  make them  And I am not pointing the finger at any one group  I am pointing the finger at all of us  maybe collectively when I say that I think the prospects of labor making those decisions of  moderation are remote if not ridiculous; I think the prospects of price moderation on the part of the  owners of enterprises that price their products and services slim; and I think the prospects of any  elected official in either party making those nasty political decisions that cost votes in order to  change structural inflation-producing governmental policies are beyond prospect  So, I too share  the concern that we could get a serious pickup in inflation as a result of people’s attitudes that  nobody is going to do anything and therefore I had better get mine before it gets out of hand  And  that will introduce the one element we have thus far not had and that is speculative activity, which  is the most destabilizing of all       To rise to the defense of the staff, you may project the exchange rates  intelligently; you just don’t have to do it accurately  There is an important difference       I would support leaving the ranges where they are and I do share the same  conclusion Chuck did about the consequences of doing so  For that reason, as we convey these to  the Congress I would hope that our message would emphasize what leaving them where they are  [means] in light of current and prospective economic developments for prices, production, et  cetera Whether we do that in Arabic [numerals] or in English, in either case the consequences are  for a substantially more restrictive monetary policy than has previously been the case--even with  the same [numerical] expression of the long-term ranges  I think it is important that we convey that  to the public at the time those ranges are put forward  I would like to ask just a factual question  I  believe that projections of bank credit are important, but which number are we going to use-- month-end or monthly average?  Would somebody on the staff tell me which one we are focusing  on?       Which one would you prefer we address ourselves to when we discuss the  issue at the table?       I just want to be sure       It strikes me, given our most recent experience, that this again is a pretty  restrictive monetary policy  In fact, it might be more restrictive than all these others put together   If we are serious about that as a goal of policy, rather than just a fallout of the other policy--     4/18/78             31       In that case, Mr Chairman, I would think that we ought to try to make that  consistent under the circumstances  It strikes me that if we are going to be serious about looking at  bank credit as an object of policy, then we ought to at least, to the extent we know how, have a  consistent set of numbers       It strikes me that that would be a wiser choice       I think that is the only answer  I believe that ultimately washes out when  you get through with it  I do think it is possible in our testimony to give descriptive phrases rather  than arithmetic ranges that would indicate the substance of the discussion of the Committee--that  the economic activity might be a little slower or that we see an acceleration of inflation or that  production is likely to slow  And maybe we can even use adverbs to describe the verbs, if I can put  it that way  But I think trying to get a consensus even on ranges puts us in an awful dilemma   Among other things, I would think that the consequences of such [a procedure] would be to impose  on each of us the duty to make personal and private arithmetic projections     4/18/78             36       I’d rather nobody do it, but considering the lesser of the evils, if I can put it  that way, I think it certainly would be appropriate for you  If you feel that under the duties of your  office you are going to be called on to make such [projections] you can be as extensively prepared  and as meticulous as you wish to be even in the form of saying “Mr Chairman, I’ll just submit this  for the record  Here is my personal private projection of what I think the economy is going to do”   I would not object to that if that is the way you prefer to do it  But I think it would be a mistake  for the Committee to have either a consensus or [something else] that focuses on arithmetic  projections       With regard to what you just stated, I would urge that in the testimony what  is presented on behalf of the Committee be in subjective terms to describe the [various] things that  the Congress proposes  It is only how specific you are in the ranges--       Mr Chairman, while the thrust of the policy that I would have in mind is  not substantially different from comments that have been expressed, I have a concern about making  dramatic moves based purely on expectations and projections  As much as I admire the work that  our staffs do, I just don’t think that the results have been sufficiently accurate consistently enough  for us to move monetary policy that strongly as the consequence purely of a projection  If we look  at the calendar, we see that the 99 percent is based on two weeks in April thus far  So I really  hesitate to do that  At the same time, having said that, I would think that if those projections prove  to be correct, we need to move against them  For that reason I would support 5 to 9 for M1, 6 to 10  for M2, and 6-3/4 to 7-1/4 for the federal funds range  And I’d have the Manager move to the  midpoint by May 1  Am I missing the Treasury’s date on that, Steve?       I don’t think 1/4 point is sufficiently critical, so I would go ahead to the  midpoint now  In other words, I’d rather err on the side of an increase       Aggregates directive       Yes, I wouldn’t object to waiting until after Thursday to see what this week  looks like  A whole week won’t--       Mr Chairman, I happen to share that judgment, primarily because so much  of the final action would be based on a projection rather than actual experience  That is what  makes me nervous--going 75 basis points between meetings as a consequence of only very little  additional knowledge than we have today  That is what concerns me  The bulk of it would be  based on the projections for the last three weeks of May       I am not sure that is consistent with that sentence    "
724,1978-05-05,"  I’d wait until the next FOMC meeting before we move further--to give us a  chance to review the entire fiscal policy at that time, recognizing that our better knowledge just two  days from now might well form a basis for doing something even beyond the 7-1/2 that is presently  under discussion  If all the facts fit together, they would support that position  But it strikes me  that [moving] more than 1/2 percentage point during the intermeeting period is not appropriate,  given the basis of the knowledge that we have on which we would be acting    "
742,1978-05-16,"  I’d like to endorse what Governor Wallich said because I do think we may  have a slight windfall now that we need to take advantage of; otherwise we may wish later that we  had       You said the Canadians are concerned that they might not be getting the  equivalent dollar effect of their conversions       I would say that, given the constraint put on the staff forecast by this  Committee’s projections of monetary growth, the staff forecast is certainly a rational one  I  personally doubt when the time really comes that the Committee is going to exercise the severe  constraints that we presently have imposed upon them  And for that reason the forecast is, yes,     5/16/78              21  based on their instructions but perhaps not their judgment as to the most likely outcome  I think  we’ve got some downside and upside potentials and for that reason our risks of being wrong in  substantial degree are perhaps greater than we have had before  On the downside, I can see a  sharper drop in housing than that forecast because the staff forecast has just a very modest drop in  actual current levels of housing starts and activity  As I remember, the average for the year is 175  million, which is still pretty high and probably is reflective of the real capacity of that industry  today  It looks like there is no way we can produce above 2 million with the present capacity level  without it just getting out of hand as far as supplies and materials  The other downside risk is that  if we get the types of inflation that have been discussed, I think all sectors of the economy could  have their confidence severely shaken and therefore retrench some  And the other thing is that we  could have a reverse trend in the value of the dollar, which struck me as one of the contributors to  our first-quarter reversal  There appeared to be a substantial multiplier effect of even the  psychology of that fact throughout the economy      I don’t think we are likely to get much lower rates of unemployment, and I do think that  given the circumstances we are getting very close to the bottom  There’s one factor that I haven’t  heard mentioned in that respect  As a result of the dramatic change in the role of women in the  economy, in many cases when we create unemployment we don’t mean that the family is without  income; we just mean today that one of the breadwinners is without a job  And that produces a  substantial difference in attitude toward unemployment, which you mentioned, Henry, and I think  we haven’t really understood the effect of that yet on the economy      On the upside, I would say that the chances of carrying forward at the present level of activity  are pretty good  People everywhere think that business prospects look good  It’s hard for a man  with a substantial backlog of orders to think business is bad enough to start worrying yet  I think  when the history book is written on this expansion, we will say that the previous expansions were  speculative in capital goods, in business activity, inventories, and commercial real estate, and  things like that  The one before that was built on mergers and acquisitions and speculation on  things of that sort  This one is probably going to be based on the speculative consumer  Now, if  you don’t think that is a fact, let’s point fingers around the room  Governor Coldwell still has his  house in Dallas, speculating on the future value, while he lives in Washington  Governor Lilly did  not sell his house in Washington when he went back to Minneapolis; he kept it because of the  increase in value  Governor Partee now owns two yachts       I just used that for illustration; people are buying recreation and residences  already  We are all speculating on real estate to a substantial degree and I think when we get that  behind us someday we will see the possibilities  I would on balance think that the prospects for ’78  are probably better than the staff forecast  That means, of course, that inflation will be worse and  that means that the risks for ’79, when sooner or later consumer confidence is shaken up, are likely  to be more severe than we are presently anticipating       5/16/78              22     How does the market currently view the disparity between the level of the  federal funds rate and the 90-day bill rate?  What is the market conversation about that disparity in  rates?       I think as we talk about ranges of growth--and focusing on M1 for purposes  of discussion--we need to recall that we did make a 56 percent change in the seasonal adjustment  so that if we compare 1978 against 1977 we are talking about roughly 24 percent for April, which  strikes me as being in the range of growth hard to excuse for just abnormal factors  It gets out of  hand  I also would agree that to rush pell-mell toward double-digit interest rates is probably foolish  and that, therefore, we will need to be more judicious in our use of monetary policy  At the same  time, unfortunately, we are in a period where the risks of a loss of public confidence, in my  judgment, not only will damage the economy but will exacerbate the underlying inflation that we  have  [That’s] because if the public perceives that there is no attempt to do something, then you’ll  get the negative reaction and things like that will contribute to it  So for that reason, despite the  risks, I think the Federal Reserve has to contain inflation or at least continue its visible policy of  doing what it can on the control of inflation  For that reason I see no choice in the face of the  monetary evidence that we have [but] to continue to increase interest rates to some degree  I think  the degree should be moderate and cautious  To be explicit, it’s my judgment that we should go on  to the 7-1/2 midpoint of a 7-1/4 to 7-3/4 percent federal funds range over the next month   Considering April and the consequences for the third quarter, if we had a zero rate of growth for  May-June we’d still end up with 6-1/3  As a consequence--       It was 19 in April       As I say, if it was zero, we’d still end up with a 6  So it’s my judgment that  particularly on M1, the [low] side of the projected 2-month range we ought to drop to 2  I’d say  zero but I think that’s foolishness; here again 2 is more realistic  In other words, what I am really  saying is that I think our chances of reducing the federal funds rate as a consequence of the  aggregates that come in should be very low  At the same time, I would prefer an 8 percent top on  that  I would buy the suggestion that 4 to 9 would be a realistic range on M2 in that respect        5/16/78              34   I do think it is time for us to face, and face seriously, the probability that the demand function  for M1 in relationship to real GNP is changed from what we expected it to be  And, therefore, we  need to readdress our ranges for M1 and make a significant change to adjust them to the real world  that we’ve now seen unfold over a sufficient length of time where short-term aberrations are less  likely to be the cause of it  I could even be tempted to go ahead and address it now as much to  remind ourselves as the Congress that you don’t have to wait three months before you face the  facts  However, in view of the regulatory changes that are anticipated, which will in turn influence  the results of the ranges, I think the smartest course of action would be to wait until our regular  period in July to readdress that question, hoping that we will have at least better insight or more  study  I think either one would be helpful, preferably more insight but in the absence of insight at  least more effort to gain insight  But at least [we ought to] address that question then so that we  can give consideration to the consequences of the regulatory action  So for that reason I would  defer it but I do think it’s time for us to do something, Mr Chairman       Your predictions are--       After the tax date       But it only has a one-third impact, given the fact that M1 is currency and  demand deposits--       5/16/78              41     Mr Chairman, you’ve introduced a new procedure that I suspect is not  going to serve us as well as that under which we have been operating--namely that we set a range  and then don’t use it until we have had another meeting       Well, I mean by that our practice  It strikes me that we had compelling  reasons to do that in the previous meetings  And as a result of the way we’ve moved, it strikes me  that at the present moment we would be better served to [go to] whatever midpoint the Committee  agrees upon and if we agree on the 7-3/4 top limit that we allow the Manager to go ahead and move  above 7-1/2 based on the aggregate figures without having to call another meeting  Otherwise, we  effectively have a money market directive because we have told the Manager don’t move because  of the narrow ranges that we have given in which he has discretion       Well, I differ with that judgment       What statistical event, then, would trigger the upper figure?       In that case, the projections would dictate an immediate consultation  because the projections are for 6-1/2 [percent M1 growth]       I don’t think we should       Larry, I think the question is addressed on page 2 of the draft on line 27--if  you get the formal [version] of the revised draft  It says “M1, which had grown moderately in the  first quarter, rose sharply in April”  Therefore, I think that read with the subsequent paragraph in  the directive will address the point which you just read       I think we need to clear it up, but I don’t think it has to be done today       Has a letter been sent to Congress?    "
768,1978-06-20,"  I don=t guess my attitude has changed much over that I expressed last  month  I=m perhaps more optimistic on the short run than the staff forecast would indicate, but  I’m not as optimistic over the long run  I do feel that we=re in the usual situation [in terms of the  attitude typical of] most North Americans  No matter how well you do, somebody wants [you]  to do better  That=s not bad; I=m not condemning that attitude, but we=re in that situation  economically where no matter how well we continue to do and how well we do in the current  quarter, somebody wants the next quarter’s figures to be good and strong, too  I think that=s  unlikely  However, I do sense a great deal of momentum going forward--perhaps more and more     6/20/78                14  momentum than otherwise one would expect  Sectorally, I think we are entering a period of  speculation as a consequence of inflationary pressures  It=s hard to identify  It hasn=t shown up  yet in business inventories--[at least not] that we can clearly identify  I think it=s obviously  reflected in consumer expenditures and consumers’ willingness to take on additional debt   Automobiles seem to be the best example of it  I would expect that trend to continue [going]  forward  And everybody talks about the housing sector, although we=re really only talking about  $100 billion out of $2 trillion, so you have to put it into perspective       Well, we=re talking about 5 percent of the total and we=re talking about a  reduction of maybe 10 percent of the 5 percent  So you really have to wonder whether you=re  getting excited about things that aren=t that significant in terms of the level of total activity and  that=s more my concern  If I had to push some arbitrary number--I couldn=t prove what I=m about  to say but if I had to guess--I would say that from the second quarter to the second quarter we  probably will see something in the 4 percent range, with the early part being stronger than we  expected and the latter part being weaker than we expected     I continue to be very pessimistic about inflation  First, I think we will do the proper thing  here, namely that we will look at the real economy rather than our arbitrary monetary rates of  growth  And I think that=s proper; anything less than that would be grossly improper  So for that  reason, despite our public relations campaign about monetary aggregates--and again I=m not   critical of that but we=re going to have to face the real world--I think that we will do whatever it  takes to make sure we don=t create a problem ourselves by arbitrary or numerical slavishness   We have to face the fact that that is not going to create any inflationary shock  Second, I think it  most unlikely, whatever the consequences, that we will see any major changes in fiscal policy  that will have an impact on inflation  Third, I don=t see the American public yet willing to pay  the prices that it will be required to pay to do anything substantive about this--whether it=s the  postal workers or many other groups     Let me just tell you one quick story  The Nebraska bankers were here, Roger  I asked the  roomful here who was willing to step forward and in their own bank and in their own way try to  do something specific about wage inflation and price inflation  There was not a single banker  willing to do anything, and in every case they said “we=re grossly underpaid”  If we once catch  up, then we=d be willing to be responsible  It’s the same story you get everywhere       Absolutely  The point I=m making is that there is no difference between  management and labor when it comes to “my ox is being gored”  They all have the same attitude  and for that reason I think--       Absolutely  We=re part of the problem, too  What I=m really saying is  that I am not optimistic that we’re going to be able to do anything  For that reason I think the     6/20/78                15  instabilities that will result toward the end of the year are likely to [remain] with us and it could  be costly       If I had to guess, I=d say 7-1/2 percent  Unemployment probably would  go up by the year-end       By the end of the year  If I had to guess, I=d say 6-1/2 because I think the  participation rate will go up but it will be difficult to maintain employment levels at the end of  the cycle       Do we get a raise if we=re right?     SPEAKER(?)  No, you get a cut if you=re wrong       I would concur that we need to go up [on the funds rate]; I wouldn=t move as  promptly as has been discussed  I would move perhaps over the next week to ten days to 7-3/4  instead of jumping immediately, as I got the sense was the others= inclination  I am concerned about  lowering the ranges from the point of view that that means a lower midpoint  And if the present  projection of about 9 to 9-1/4 percent for M1--and not too much different for M2--for the month of  June is correct, that means you would force yourself into [needing] a very weak July or an automatic  rise of the federal funds rate  It strikes me that that is not the sense of what I heard [people] say   Some of you said otherwise--that you wanted to consult before you made any other precipitous  action  For that reason it strikes me that by lowering that range you would force yourself into an  inconsistent position       Yes, but even then it strikes me that you=re running a danger in that sense   So for that reason I would be inclined to use the 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 and the aggregates directive  If  we=re going to use a money market directive, it strikes me that the top might well be 9 to 9-1/2  because I think if we have a July that runs 9 percent or better there=s a basis for genuine concern and  perhaps for further action  But if we=re going to use a monetary aggregate directive, it strikes me  that you force yourself [to act]  Did I express a preference, Mr Secretary?  I=m not sure I did  I=m  willing to go either way based on what the Committee okays as the top of the range       We=ve got the right words at the wrong time       This isn=t a change       I think we need to bear in mind that if our discussion this afternoon should  ultimately lead to significant reductions in reserve requirements, the consequences could well be that  our capacity to collateralize currency would be impaired  And that in and of itself could influence  our actions on something unrelated to that  For that reason I would hate for us not to take at least  deliberate action on the agency side, given the fact that the Congress is unlikely to act in a timely  fashion  I would agree, though, that doing something strong like a major reduction at this time is  probably inappropriate for other reasons    "
794,1978-07-18,"  I think mine has been answered but I’m not positive  Did the President’s  announcements yesterday about the United States energy policy change any of your energy  [assumptions] and the impact on inflationary expectations?       Let’s just say we can live with what he promised  Would that change any--       I will give you some end results and then I will explain how I get there  because I think we are in a situation where, unfortunately, annual averages don’t tell us anything  about the course we are really talking about  I would guess that real GNP growth will be in a range  of 3 to 3-1/2 percent, inflation in the 7 to 7-3/4 range, and unemployment probably in the 6 to 6-1/2  range      How do we get there, though?  It is my judgment still that we will see a third quarter that is  stronger than expected, primarily as a result of the carrying forward of the increase in personal  income related to the increases in employment we have seen in the second quarter  I would be  inclined to think that continued inflationary expectations will carry forward consumer buying at  least through the second quarter and maybe even through the third quarter and the beginning of the  fourth  I don’t see the impact of housing and contract construction taking place quite as severely as  some of you do  It strikes me that if we got the starts figure that we have today and the contract  figures, it will be a good while before the actual economic impact of those activities wash through  that result from the lower starts and lower construction that might take place     I don’t see that monetary policy is quite as stringent today as some of you do  I recognize it’s  having its impact; perhaps it’s only in combination with the increased inflation that we have that it  is putting pressure on financial institutions  I don’t see it as quite as severe as some of you do  I do  see the inflation situation getting much worse and having an impact  For that reason, while I think  we will continue to see a better second half for l978 than is generally anticipated, my guess is that  l979 will degenerate and go down much more sharply than in the staff forecast; it may be in the 2  to 2-1/2 range toward the end of that period  I guess on average [we may get] these figures but the  pattern certainly would be a stronger front and a weaker back end       Oil     7/18/78              19       Well, gentlemen, first I would urge that we not take into--       First, I would urge that we not take into consideration in establishing the  targets the prospective change in the regulations that might occur as of November l with regard to  automatic transfers  It strikes me that what we are really doing is continuing to set long-range  targets for the purpose of operating until we set another long-range target  We are far wiser to  continue to set long-range targets without recognition of any prospective change because whether  the change will take place is uncertain  And in an uncertain economic world, it is foolish in my     7/18/78              31  judgment to set a regulation into that picture, as uncertain as that is  We can certainly do so with a  reduced degree of uncertainty in October when this takes place     Second, I would urge that we not shift the basis of operations to M2 for all the reasons stated  I would urge us for goodness sakes to please let’s get to work and get these aggregates redefined  before the year-end so we can get some rationale restored to our policy  I’ve felt that way for a  long time and I am glad some of you have finally agreed with the great wisdom that I had earlier!     Third, it is my judgment that we cannot ignore the consequences of increased rates of  inflation  Therefore, it’s tragic but [true] nonetheless that our continued devotion to unrealistic  targets for M1 is foolishness  The present rates of inflation and the future prospective exogenous  forces that will sustain it, if not accelerate it, make it even more foolish  For that reason, I think it  is important that we go ahead and set a higher target range on M1  I would argue for [raising the  upper limit to] 7-1/2 percent  This implies increased velocity  And while I recognize Phil  Coldwell’s argument that the average velocity for previous peaks of the cycle is about 4 percent,  unfortunately, the most recent experience we had was 46 percent in the fourth quarter of 1973  I  would hope that we would not achieve the velocity we are proposing by achieving the relative  increases in interest rates that that period produced and the consequences that period produced  So  for that reason, I would argue for increasing the [top of the M1] range to 7-1/2 percent, keeping the  other ranges as they are today  And it is my judgment that not only can it be explained to the  public but that it should be explained to the public       I maintain my position       Correction  Some of the Governors were not interested       I would move up 1/8 on the federal funds range to 7-5/8 to 8-1/8, with  instructions to the Desk to go to 7-7/8 promptly  I think the ranges stated for alternative A or B--5  to 9 and 7 to 11--are satisfactory       I would argue that the operating considerations that you have outlined  probably are the best compromise for the diversion of the positions of the people on the  [Committee]  That is, shoot at 7-7/8 and recognize that you may miss it [within] about the range of  judgments that we have been discussing        All you have to do is have one week in July and you are in       If you put an 8 percent cap now, if it’s inconsistent, you’ll get a  consultation anyway  So you get the same result       I think the only discussion we ought to have is not whether the cost of  getting a secure line to New York is--       We ought to do that  The only discussion is whether we extend it  throughout the System  It is my judgment that [that decision] could well be made by all of you  collectively and individually to see whether or not you think spending $850,000 is worth it       You are arguing for not even putting in the secure line between here and  New York?

819,1978-08-15,"  I don't think I've changed my mind significantly  I still think we are  likely to have better growth than the projection for the balance of ’78 and probably worse than the  projection for the first half of ’79, but on balance the growth would probably be about the same  I  would say that if there's any news since the last meeting in my own mind it looks like we're going  to get less cooperation from organized labor on the inflation front and to that [extent] we may have  a slightly higher net result over the year than we expected, though not to a major degree  But  considering the present level, any increase is a significant increase and, therefore, probably  worrisome  If anything, I'm probably inclined to be up a 1/4, to maybe 7-3/4 on inflation by year- end  Unemployment probably will be up in the 6 percent range  It strikes me that we are likely to  continue to have some discipline in the manufacturing sector but the service and government  sectors are probably where we will continue to be in trouble--and probably worsening trouble over  the year  Therefore, the 30 percent of GNP that's in [those areas] will probably be adversely  affected       I would say that for the last two days--having been completely without  news of any sort for seventeen days--the labor question is the one thing that hit me since coming  back  It looks like the environment in labor is worse than it was when I left        8/15/78             10       Is this the second adjustment or the first adjustment?       8/15/78             13     Having argued brilliantly and eloquently but unsuccessfully for raising  the targets for M1 last month, I'd be satisfied with the 5 to 9  I do think we ought to increase the  range very slightly on M2 but keep the same midpoints  I would argue for 6 to 11  I am concerned  that if we have this [experience] we're talking about, we will pick up heavy demand in the next few  weeks for the big CDs that are reflected in M2, which will then show up in M2 in a way that  [unintelligible] because those non-negotiable CDs on certain types of banks are reflected in that  I  would [favor] a range of 7-3/4 to 8-1/4 [for the funds rate]  I frankly don't care if we stick with  7-7/8 or go to 8  I have never felt that an eighth of a point on the federal funds rate was worth that  much argument over one way or the other  We could go on to 8 or stay at 7-7/8; it would be  immaterial to me  I do think, because we have five weeks between now and the time we meet  again, that we may well have a situation in which we’d have a telephone meeting       Right       But in short, I'd want a monetary aggregates directive and a reference to  the international situation in the directive       It seems to me that if we want the Desk to actually use it as a basis of  decision, it ought to go in the latter part       Why don't we just leave out the adverb?       I think we're in a process [typical of] most finance committees  Every  member of the committee wants to add another condition to the loan, and that's a mistake  I'd like  to ask some questions because of the suggestions made earlier  How much yen is being traded and  how much is being bought by the Japanese now?  And in what proportions will these figures that  we're discussing impact on the marketplace?  [I ask] because my impression is that last year when  we saw $35 billion bought by others it didn't make that much difference  The magnitudes are such  that $4 billion may still be just idle conversation except for the psychological impact of it  I would  really like some information on what sort of magnitudes we're talking about       May I ask one more question in that connection?   To what extent will  our announcement of intervention make it possible for some major holders of dollar reserves to feel  that they can then make the currency shift to yen reserves with some more assurance that the  market will be broad enough to get out later if they want to?  Right now my general impression is  that many of these dollar holders are concerned about going into yen because the Bank of Japan is  the only basic support  And [they feel] that market is not broad enough for them to have the  possibility of getting out if they want to whereas if they see us come in, it may give them a type of  bail-out assurance That would encourage them to make the swaps that they're now not making,  which would exacerbate our problem       Well, I recognize that       I just wanted to discuss it because it strikes me that it's one of the risks  that we have to be very alert to--that we don't provide the vehicle for our own destruction  My  impression is that by careful structuring and some very nasty demands, if I might characterize them  that way--at least the Japanese probably would--we ought to go ahead       It's outmoded       That's what I thought       They have enough accounting problems now    "
845,1978-09-19,"  We've gone through a number of actions and announcements, and so   forth, and seen the consequences of them  Do you have a judgment as to whether or not future  actions of a similar character or scope would have any impact on the marketplace?  In other words,  I'm really asking your judgment as to whether or not we're about to run out of so-called  announcement effects and whether the only possibility we have is some more substantive long-term       9/19/78            2  solutions  Or would actions similar to those we've taken in recent weeks still have some impact on  the exchange market?       I don't have any basic disagreements [with the staff forecast], although   I'm inclined to think that the real growth is probably a little on the optimistic side  I'm inclined to  think that personal consumption expenditures may not grow as expected because of the flattening  of real incomes  I'm also concerned that while the economic effect of strikes has always been  generally considered to be zero--because you make up what you lost--I don't think we’re going to  see that in 1979  I wouldn't be surprised if strikes were a significant deterrent to economic activity  in the first half and have a real impact on the year as a whole  So, on balance, I'm inclined to think  it may be 10 to 15 percent less than the staff projection       No, that's right on stream, in my judgment  Again, it depends on what   the rest of the people around this table do to a certain extent  At this time I think in this  neighborhood is about where it belongs; 18 or 19 million wouldn't be bad news at all       Mr Chairman, I don't share the judgment of those who have felt that   money was exploding all over the place and that we are irresponsible and so forth  I think the study  that the staff did on the so-called M1+, or M1 prime or whatever the label is, shown on table B-9 is  very interesting  In fact, if you look at that table for a minute you'll see that within the past year,  through the first half of '78, it looks like that rate of growth was about 63 percent  I'll say 6-1/4 or  something like that  And then if you look at the projection on velocity of about 36, you get results  in the neighborhood of 9-3/4 to 99 versus a projection of nominal GNP of 11 percent  It [seems]  like we've been about on target and the trend has definitely been down in that concept of  measurement of money  So I don't think that we ought to be too self critical     Getting to the real point of the discussion here, though, I would favor an 8-1/4 to 8-3/4   federal funds range, going to 8-1/2 immediately  And on M1, I’d take 6 to 9 because I don't think  we can afford to have two months in the 10 percent range without adverse public reaction  But I  would take 8 to 12 for the M2 range and a monetary aggregates directive       It would be very helpful if the Manager would be explicit about how he   would operate as a consequence of unfolding events  For example, if the Committee were to adopt  6 to 9 for M1, it would appear to me that the midpoint that the Manager would look at would be  7-1/2  Therefore, if the results were higher than 7-1/2 on average, insofar as that half of the two  aggregates were concerned, he might be inclined toward raising, say, the 8-1/2 percent funds rate  within its range  If you look at the present projection, it would mean that October would have to  fall in the 5 percent range or less in order to keep M1 from dictating a move  And that might not be  the Manager's perception  Frankly, that's one of the concerns I have about our lower ends of these  aggregates ranges versus the higher ends, because we get mechanistic instructions to the Manager  as a consequence of picking these  Somebody commented that he'd be happy to have a lower  range I might be happy to see a lower result, but that doesn't mean that I'd be happy with a lower  range because it would force the Manager to do something completely different from what I want  him to do       9/19/78            34      Let’s ask the Manager to give us some perception in his own mind of   how he might operate under a 6 to 9 percent [M1] component   "
869,1978-10-17,"  Do you see any evidence of foreign official institutions changing their  reserve holdings in enough quantities to be of concern?       Is our withholding tax problem exacerbating this situation?       I was thinking about the other institutions       What would this do to the capacity of the Treasury to be our partner in  these intervention efforts, given the limited resources that they have to do it with?  If we went to a  full loss here--       10/17/78 7                  I just want to be sure the Treasury is still with us       I think things are looking a little better although, unlike Chuck, I would  say that on balance inflation probably looks a little worse  That’s because, despite the good crop  situation, I think our income outlook is for higher wages all the way across the board  I'm not  optimistic about the improvement in productivity that the staff is projecting  I'm more pessimistic  that we'll continue to see a very low rate of productivity  So on balance I'd be inclined to think that  while the GNP projection is about right, the inflation measures, if anything, might be on the slightly  low side  Unemployment probably will stay about the same       I would argue that the thing to do would be to drop M1  Several reasons  lead me to that  First, we do have a new system of projecting the aggregates and, therefore,  anything we do today is only going to [be in] effect, for all intents and purposes, over the next two  or three months as a long-range policy guide  And in January the Committee will have to  reestablish a policy guide for the future        10/17/78 32                Second, I have for a long time felt that our concepts of money on which we base policy  aren't properly reflective of the underlying purposes for which they were originally designed  because technical aspects of privileges of certain types of intermediaries have changed and,  therefore, our underlying purposes for measuring money this way have been distorted  And it is  my hope that the Committee will modify its definitions, not only of M1 but M2 and M3 all across  the line  It would be my hope that we'd go forth and modify those definitions beginning with the  new Humphrey- Hawkins concept of reporting--and have a good clean slate to start off      Third, as some of you may recall, it is my judgment that we have unfortunately gotten this  Committee into a public relations problem  Having chosen targets that are not indicative of the  relationship between nominal GNP and M1, we have been unwilling to adjust them--which a  reasoned judgment would lead us to do--because of the public relations consequences  And I think  dropping M1 is--pardon my language--the easiest way to go  [I’d go] out the back door instead of  the front on this subject and not just change it, drop it  Therefore, the public doesn't know whether  we did it or didn't do it and you don't have all these public relations [issues]   So I would argue,  when you add all those up together, that [we should look at] the M1 that comes closest to defining  the transactional concepts of money that M1 was originally designed to measure  With the number  of variables that have already been mentioned around the table--and every time somebody speaks  they mention another one I hadn't thought of--it strikes me that M1+ is the only reasonable one  I  think that's the fairest to the public, to the extent that the public has asked us to address this subject  in the intervening months between now and Humphrey-Hawkins, and this would provide a good  transition to a new concept       Would we assume ATS in M1 in testimony or would we--       What does that do to Mr Axilrod's projections of the rates of growth,  though?       Mr Chairman, let me emphasize that these are 1-year ranges; these aren't  for one quarter  Therefore, we have a lot of time to explain that we made a projection and we  missed       I would drop M1 entirely from the operational specifications today  I  would give M1+ a 3 to 7 range and M2 a 6 to 10 range And I’d have a money market directive  with an 8-3/4 to 9 percent range, going to 8-7/8 immediately  I recognize, gentlemen and lady, that  that's really picking at straws and I've argued against that for a long time  I'm rising above  principle       Yes       It's true that the FOMC is not in the habit of issuing press releases on other  people's business    "
