9065,2010-09-21,ROBERTSON,"  It’s a positive step  As one knows with the United States Senate,   steps have to add up to actual completion by vote or acclamation with unanimous consent, and   these steps can get tricky  But it’s definitely a positive step  "
9266,2011-08-01,ROBERTSON,"  Great  I think it’s appropriate to start exactly where the  President started last night  That is, although there’s an agreement in principle and  legislative language now embodies that framework, there are still some critical votes  to take place before any of the celebration or a sigh of relief is fully realized   I’ll come back to the floor situations in a minute  Where I’d like to start is with  the framework, and in particular, the mechanics of this agreement, for which there are  several important milestones that I think are going to be important in terms of overall  thought about where things are heading on fiscal policy  As far as the mechanics  goes, I did want to take note briefly about how the various leaders were portraying  this  In the document that the speaker put out last night, he basically outlined three  accomplishments from his standpoint  (1) it cuts government spending more than it  increases the debt limit, (2) it implements spending caps to restrain future spending,   August 1, 2011 4 of 53              and (3) it advances the cause of a balanced budget amendment  Meanwhile, Majority  Leader Reid put out a remarkably similar document today, but his touchstones were   (1) it extended the debt ceiling up to 2013, removing the cloud of uncertainty over our  economy, and (2) it makes a nearly $1 trillion down payment on deficit reductions   So that’s how they’re framing this deliberation today—and hopefully it will be  concluded today   Let me take a minute to explain the mechanics  It’s a couple-stage process, with  some interesting hallmarks; for those of you who know the budget battles of the  1980s and into the 1990s, you’ll see some familiar mechanisms  For stage 1, there is  an immediate-upon-passage $920 billion, roughly, deficit achievement embodied in  caps on the discretionary spending accounts, and there are a couple of important  components to that  In terms of the overall framework, it’s split between nondefense  discretionary and defense  There is a specific firewall between those two in FY2012  and FY2013 and then the firewall between those two comes down for the remainder  of the 10-year period  What does this mean in terms of overall fiscal reduction in  2012 and ’13?  Roughly $10 billion in spending cuts over that two-year period—$7  billion and then $3 billion  Of that, $5 billion comes from defense and what they’re  calling security-related accounts, and the remainder from the nondefense  discretionary   With this first phase, which is automatic upon passage and is focused on the  discretionary spending accounts, what happens in terms of the debt ceiling?  A two- step process there  Immediately, the Treasury gets a $400 billion bump-up in the debt  ceiling, which takes them into September of this year  The President then—although  I don’t know this for sure—would probably send a certification to the Congress,  before they go out in August, attesting to certain levels of debt ceiling within their  estimates for the end of the year  The Congress then has, I believe, 50 days to  disapprove of that certification  And he has a veto  And with that, the President then  achieves another $500 billion on the debt ceiling  In other words, the way they’re  thinking about this first phase is that roughly $900 billion in debt ceiling is pretty  much automatic   What happens from there?  This is where we come to stage 2 and what one thinks  about in terms of the overall components of this package  When you look at the  totals, you’ve got roughly $900 billion and change in the first phase—how do you get  to the roughly $21 trillion to $23 trillion that everyone’s talking about?  That’s  where stage 2 comes in  A special committee is established, which would be  composed of 12 members of Congress, evenly split between parties and evenly split  between the chambers  They have until Thanksgiving, November 23, to report back  to the leadership on an overall deficit reduction package of $15 trillion  Then there’s  a whole set of fast-track procedures in the Congress if, indeed, this super-special  committee does achieve a majority—and it’s a majority vote only—on a package   The Congress then has fast-track procedures in which they can vote on this by  December 23   August 1, 2011 5 of 53              So what could happen with that?  Well, the committee could fail, in which case a  whole process is then triggered; the committee could come up with something less  than the $15 trillion; or they could meet their goal—in fact, the Congress then  subsequently passes their package  If they report $15 trillion and the Congress  passes it, then the debt ceiling goes up by that amount as well  If they’re somewhere  between $12 trillion and $15 trillion, then the debt ceiling is increased to whatever  level that is  If it’s anything less than $12 trillion or they fail to do anything  whatsoever, then phase 3, which is sequestration, is triggered   Before I turn to phase 3, what’s on the table in terms of this joint committee?   Really, everything  It can be additional discretionary, it can be direct spending, it can  be mandatory programs, it can be revenues  As I have read the summary documents  today, it looks pretty much like however they want to configure it and can reach a  majority vote around somewhere between $12 trillion and $15 trillion  If they fail— and this is on a very short timeline, and in an intense political environment—then an  automatic sequestration process is triggered, one very much like the old Gramm– Rudman–Hollings provisions from the late 1980s and on into the ’90s  But there is  one other tripwire before you get to sequestration, and that is that both chambers of  the Congress are required to vote on a balanced budget amendment  And by some  miracle that I don’t think will happen, if they were to vote and send the balanced  budget amendment to the states, then none of this sequestration happens under that  scenario  Highly unlikely, but nonetheless in the package   So, sequestration  This is where everyone has mutual tension to try to avoid this  outcome  That’s a sequestration of roughly $12 trillion, 50 percent of which will  come from defense and the other from nondefense spending  This package—and this  is where a lot of the tension is today—is solely in the spending sphere  There are no  revenues contemplated under the sequestration, solely spending accounts  So,  50 percent from defense  If that were to be triggered, they’re estimating that would  be about $50 billion a year in defense spending, and the remainder would be made up  elsewhere  Now, there are some important safety net programs that are exempted   Social Security, Medicaid, veterans’ programs, and other essential services  Medicare  is included, but it’s capped at 2 percent, and maybe in the range of the provider cuts   And that’s it   What does all of this mean?  If you’re looking at this from the perspective of  those who want to protect spending programs, they have the ability in the committee  process to inject any additional revenues in that process  The other thing that a lot of  folks are pointing out is that all of this is scored off of the March CBO baseline, not  the alternative baseline, which assumes an extension of the Bush tax cuts  In other  words, we’ve set into motion and into law a budget framework and a spending  package that has no extension of the tax cuts after 2012  So somehow, somewhere, if  folks want to extend those tax cuts, they will have to create the environment and the  spending and revenue tensions to do that  And that’s no small amount  If you look at  the current services baseline, which is what this package is scored off of, revenues go  to 208 percent of GDP by 2021  On the other hand, with the assumption that the  Bush tax cuts continue and the AMT fix is agreed, the baseline would have gone to   August 1, 2011 6 of 53              184 percent of GDP  That’s a huge, huge difference, so that’s a tension  Obviously,  the tension of only having spending cuts sequestered in the third phase is highly  problematic from some standpoint, but it’s an interesting package where there are  clear tensions for both sides   So where are we?  They’ve been in caucus meetings in their respective chambers  and their respective parties since about 1000 this morning  I heard from Senator  Reid’s office before we came in here that they’re still expecting a vote in the Senate  this afternoon  It sounds like those who are objecting to the package in the Senate are  not expected to run out the clock in terms of the procedural hurdles, which is from  our standpoint very important, because they could drag this out well into Wednesday  if they chose to do so  So maybe a vote in the Senate this afternoon  So far, there’s  been speculation that the vote count is pretty strong in both caucuses  Mike Crapo  was on one of the shows this morning predicting about 30 Republicans  I would think  with Speaker Reid’s leadership, there should be a healthy vote there  The House— it’s anybody’s prediction  There’s a lot of work to do in the House Democratic  Caucus, and I think they’re still working on that    They’re expected to vote in the House this evening    I’ve been here, so I’m not directly watching the floor  But I   understand that the House is debating the rule for the debt ceiling  They’re expected to vote on   the rule at 410  Assuming that goes according to plan and the speaker decides not to pull it, they   have anticipation in the cloakroom that there will be a one-hour debate on the final rule  So it   could be—    Yes  "
9318,2011-09-20,ROBERTSON,  I’m prepared to do so  
9410,2013-10-16,ROBERTSON,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll start with the current  government shutdown and debt ceiling debacle, which are nearly at an end  There are  many ways to account for the tremendous losses from this episode  Jobs in the  private and public sector, consumer confidence, our international standing, a possible  and perhaps permanent erosion in the full faith and credit standing, critical  government data, and a calling into question of our systems of governance are just a  few of the many losses from this self-inflicted wound  But the even more remarkable  thing about this episode is that the proposed deal does not do anything whatsoever to  resolve our longer-term budget or fiscal-related questions  I’m afraid that when we  look back on this episode perhaps the biggest loss is that there were absolutely no  lessons learned from this crisis   So with that introduction, let me quickly cover three questions  Where are we?   What are the terms of the deal?  And what happens next?   In terms of the deal, it appears, if all goes to plan, that the government will be  reopened in the next day or two  A budget conference of some sort will be asked to  convene and to report back by December 13 to set in place the fiscal appropriation  and budget parameters for 2014  It’s probably worth noting that since 2010 we have  had eight such budget commissions, all of which have failed to produce much of  anything  In addition to that, the continuing resolution would be extended for fiscal  year 2014 appropriations until January 15  This will be done at basically the current  sequestration levels of $986 billion  Why January 15?  It’s an important date for the  formulation of congressional strategy because that is when the next round of  sequestration for 2014 kicks in, at about a $967 billion level  Now, that is roughly a  $20 billion difference, most of which falls on defense spending  So one would ask,  why all of this for $20 billion?  The answer to that is this number greatly diminishes  the real divide between the two chambers  And that was evidenced by the collapse of  the appropriation process earlier this summer   The Senate had been moving on a pathway that pretty much ignored sequestration  for the coming year and, consequently, targeted an overall level of government  spending about $90 billion above the House level  The House, while meeting the  targets, had its own problems, and they, too, sort of collapsed around themselves  earlier this summer because they were trying to make up for what it perceived to be   October 16, 2013 5 of 50    inadequate levels of spending in the defense arena by taking from all of the  nondefense discretionary spending paths  For example, the IRS would have had  about a 25 percent cut  Consequently, both the House and Senate paths were  troubled  They got nothing done  And, consequently, it rolled up into this morass  that we have had over the last several weeks  So they are now going to have another  commission—“conference,” if you will—that is going to look at this and report back  by December 13 in order to deal with the January 15 deadlines  So that’s on the  government spending side   The debt ceiling has been wrapped up into this—and we’ve got conflicting  information at this point, so I may want to update you as the meeting goes along—but  it appears that they are going to have a debt ceiling date of February 7  And because  of the extraordinary measures, the way those work, and the time of year at which the  Secretary of the Treasury will be exercising them, the extraordinary measures don’t  provide much benefit to the Treasury, extending the debt ceiling date from February 7  to probably mid-March  If this had been taking place after June 1 or September 1,  those extraordinary measures would have given a lot more leeway to the Treasury  Department because of the way the tools interact   Now, the unknown, and what we are checking our BlackBerrys about, is that  apparently they are still negotiating, and perhaps some of the McConnell language on  the debt ceiling has made its way into this agreement  Maybe that’s just for this vote  or it could be a more permanent part of the debt ceiling deliberation, and that would  be a big deal  Basically, what the so-called McConnell rule does is provide that the  President has the authority to raise the debt ceiling, and it takes a two-thirds majority  of both chambers to reject the President’s action  I find it hard to believe they are  going to do this on a permanent basis because that’s a pretty fundamental change   But it seems that something akin to that has at least made its way at this hour into the  agreement     Well, that’s an interesting thing   What started all of this in terms of this process were, of course, concerns about  the Affordable Care Act, and it looks like the final agreement has a very small  provision having to do with income-verification processes   So what’s next, and where do we find ourselves at this point in time?  I anticipate  that once the two chambers have legislative language, which is still evolving—that  the Senate will go first  They have an apparent understanding with the senators who  have been leading the Affordable Care Act efforts that those senators will not use  their parliamentary tools, their process tools, to delay the votes through cloture  motions  It sounds like the Senate will probably vote sometime in the early evening,  then allowing the House to act perhaps into the midnight hour tonight   October 16, 2013 6 of 50    The House Republicans are going to caucus at 300  That’s always an interesting  dynamic, so we’ll see what happens there  But I think we’re on a good trajectory—if  anything about this could be called good—to get this wrapped up probably sometime  this evening   The last element here is, what do these next three fiscal moments—December 13,  January 15, February 7 (that is, mid-March)—mean?  Probably not a great deal,  probably a bit more drama, particularly around the January 15 date when the  sequestration kicks in  And it could create a dynamic for a small package to emerge  where some relief is given for 2014 and ’15 on the sequestration, perhaps in exchange  for a few long-term entitlement provisions, but all of that is pretty unclear at this  point  So, with that, I think there is more fiscal drama to come    No  It means it will apply for this vote to get to February 7  So   when they hit the new “X” date in March, it will be a real vote, a real moment   October 16, 2013 11 of 50     Without having to, theoretically, vote for it    The only good news is that they sort of dipped their toe in the water   of a disapproval method  "
