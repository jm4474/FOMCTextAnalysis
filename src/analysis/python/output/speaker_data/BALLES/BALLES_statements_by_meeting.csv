1,1976-03-29,"  Tom, maybe I’ve missed something, but have you had any feedback of the  plaintiff’s complaining or commenting on the material that was excised?     Thank you   SPEAKER(?)  Mr Chairman, do I understand that we are appealing the 45-day lag?     Exactly     I’d like to pick up on the point that Governor Jackson just made, because  it also perhaps expresses in a sharper way what Steve Axilrod was trying to tell us a little while  ago--these tests of the predictive ability of nonborrowed reserves for M1 on a one-month basis or  a two-month basis obviously leave a lot to be desired because the margin of error is very large   But what we do know, because this has been pretty thoroughly tested, is that there is some  minimum span of months, probably between three and four, that you need on money supply data  so that these random errors on the monthly seasonally adjusted value begin to cancel out  And if  we were to look at our aggregates target as being some version of this smooth series, a moving  average of some number of months, three or four, then I think that the kinds of errors that Jack’s  paper came up with in 1975 would appear far smaller and far more [acceptable], and perhaps we  ought to run through that exercise  Jack, would that be feasible to do?     I’m fairly confident that we’d get numbers that would look far better than  the ones you came up with in a one- and two-month test     Mr Chairman, may I respond to Governor Coldwell  One thing that may  have been neglected here is the subcommittee’s recommendation that the Manager refrain, we  really mean that, we [unintelligible] kind of look through [non]borrowed reserves to the  aggregates  It would be the [responsibility] of the staff to make these linkages between the  [non]borrowed reserve range and the aggregates range the Committee decided it wanted  And in  this fashion we could at least pinpoint where the problems were     [If] the Desk [was unable] to get the [non]borrowed reserve range because of the federal  funds constraint, then the Committee would have full [unintelligible] fairly sharp path in the  decision to make in the context of the national markets and what our instincts tell us is good for  the economy and so forth     On the other hand, if the Desk did hit the [non]borrowed reserve target within the federal  funds constraint, but we weren’t getting the end results that we wanted on the aggregates over  some span of, say, three or four months, then the staff would have to reexamine its equations in  relationship to what level of [non]borrowed reserves would achieve the aggregates [target] over  some span of months  And I think that’s one real advantage of this proposal over the system that  we have now  We can’t quite tell whether it’s a federal funds constraint, or the multiplier, or  what it is that’s causing us to miss our target     3/29/76 - 34 -      Then we’ll be getting an analysis of lagged reserves  Is that coming out  too?  "
22,1976-04-20,"  I would like to ask Lyle a question  I understand that some of the  congressional committees have been doing the sort of alternative money growth assumptions that  you have in terms of effects on the economy  Do you have any idea how their results come out  compared with yours?  Are they using essentially different models?  What can you tell us about  that?     The only relevance to that obviously is the collected influence [on the]  thinking of both the staff and the principals, and it would be nice to know what these  Congressmen are being told by their staffs     Mr Chairman, I’d like to say just a few words about the first of the three  reasons that you cited for a modest reduction in the upper limit of the ranges of M1 and M2,  namely, the fact that we’ve got to be alert to the dangers of renewed inflation  This has to do  with what happened back in that period of 1971 to ’73, when one major industrial country abroad  really had an explosion in money supplies, which I think [played] a big part in world inflation  and also [unintelligible] very severely, in my opinion, in the United States in terms of the prices  of internationally traded commodities     As I looked at what’s going on in 10 major [foreign] countries, I was very surprised to find  out that, [although we] tightened up on our rates of monetary growth since ’73-’74, six of the 10  leading countries now have rates of [monetary] growth for the ’74-’75 period actually bigger  than they did back in the ’71-’73 period  To me that’s a danger signal that we may be setting the  stage, or that they may be setting stage, for a renewal of world inflation, which, if it occurs, will  certainly make it very difficult for us in the United States to keep our inflation rate as low as  5 percent     So, for those reasons, I would support a move toward lowering these ranges in modest  steps  I would be prepared to accept the particular specifications that you mentioned  If I leaned  in any direction, I think I’d lean in the direction of perhaps adding to what you had to say,  pulling down the lower end of the two ranges on M1 and M2 by 1/2 point as well  If we don’t do  that now, I think we can take a look at it in another three months, but I would certainly support at  least pulling down the upper end of the range     All this talk about 4 equals 8 reminds me, Mr Chairman, that I hope the  staff will in the near future carry through with what I thought was the decision at the last meeting  to start providing us with data that show both the levels and the growth rates of the Ms on a  moving average basis  That’s the way you got away from the 4 equals 8 problem, to use floater  data  And the more work my own staff has done on this, the more I’m convinced that that’s the  way to get away from these erratic random fluctuations month to month, or even week to week     But having said that with regard to the short-run specifications, one fairly strong feeling  that I do have is that whatever these short-run specs are, they ought to be designed in a way that  move us systematically within the longer-term ranges that we have debated and carefully  discussed this morning  And if they aren’t moving systematically toward those ranges, then I  think something is wrong  In other words I had a presumption that if we’re outside the range, we  ought to be moving back toward it within a one- or two-month horizon because we do have a  chance to examine these longer-term ranges every three months     With regard to the specific short-term ranges for the April-May period, I would come out  with alternative C specifications for M1 and M2 and the federal funds range of 4-1/2 to 5-1/2,  much for the reasons Mr Guffey and Mr Kimbrel have already discussed     Mr Chairman, I’d like to speak up in support of your proposal  I’ll have  to confess, even if it’s in heresy, but I don’t have this sentimental attachment to the  Memorandum of Discussion  And to put it bluntly, I even find it tedious and repetitious  I think  that with the expanded documents that the staff has proposed here, the public could be better  informed in more of the nature of an executive summary than this raw material of things--it  brings an awful lot of [unintelligible] in the workshop into the exhibition gallery  Even if we  weren’t under pressure to get rid of this, for the reasons that have been cited, I’d be in favor of  that anyway    "
50,1976-05-18,"  I share that problem     Excuse the interruption, Mr Chairman--     --but I was going to say that I shared your lack of understanding of certain  issues  In my case, I must say I fully support the proposal you made, but I just am mystified by  why the specifications are not a part of the policy decision  I know that was explained once--I  didn’t understand it then, and I’d like to be educated      Well, I’d like an executive summary education in two minutes     This is not an idle question  It seems to me with respect to the specs, the  specs are such an integral part of what we have talked about here, I am in doubt as to why it  shouldn’t be in the Record of Policy Actions     Art, what are those consequences--immediately reached--is that the  problem?     Okay, thank you  I’ll try to remember that     Well, I’d like to turn for a minute to the price outlook--this disturbing rise  in April of the wholesale price index  Even though a good part of it was in farm and food, there  was a broad-based increase, as you know, in food materials, manufactured products, sensitive  commodities, the whole bit  The immediate indication I see is that it’s going to slow down, but  what’s the staff view here on that outlook?       Well, I hope you are right  I’ve been hearing for months now from my  [Reserve Bank] directors--in [response to] the briefings we give to them, where our price outlook  is pretty close to the one that you cited here--that they think we are far too optimistic  They see  pressures developing across a broad front that are going to lead to higher prices in the industrial  sector and they say several things wage settlements that go considerably beyond what the staff  view seems to be within the System, efforts to reestablish profit margins that were run down  during the recession period, and what have you  There’s quite a divergence of opinion between  the gut feeling of our directors on one hand and the research work that’s done by our staff on the  other hand  That remains an unresolved question in my own mind       Mr Chairman?     Just to follow on a comment made at the last meeting, there seems to have  been quite a firming up of views with respect to drilling activity, that, while it’s still at a reduced  level, it’s definitely going to pick up at possibly [a] fairly substantial [rate] in the second half of  the year  We hear this both from the people in the oil business and from the bankers that they are  talking to with respect to financing      There seem to be a number of reasons involved  As near as I can  determine, the most important one is increasing confidence that the government is going to  exercise what elbow room is provided in the recent legislation with respect to authorizing limited  price increases from time to time  There also is developing some expectation that, when the  legislation expires, they may in fact be relieved of price control  There are a couple of other  things; one is that--     Mr Chairman, I’d like to set my remarks, if I may, in the context of a  memo I took the liberty of sending to this group on May 12  It took up the subject we discussed  at length in the March meeting of this Committee, which had to do with really fixing our  position, trying to get away from what we all recognized are a lot of random fluctuations and  statistical noise in any given week’s or any given month’s monetary data  The purpose of this  exercise was to determine what I call the basic trend in the monetary aggregates, taking  advantage of the well-known device of smoothing the series through a moving average  We  happen to use in this case a 13-week moving average     I appended several tables to that memorandum displaying graphically where the moving  average stands in conjunction with our most recently determined range of growth of the  aggregates for both M1 and M2  I have also incorporated into that what I thought was a very  useful suggestion from Steve Axilrod that we extend the latest actual weekly data, which the  Board forecasts by week, for five weeks ahead to see what that in turn would do to the moving  average  And based on that exercise it’s clear to me, just from looking at the figures specifically  on column 4 on each of these two tables, M1 and M2, that we have been moving consistently in  a bigger amount above the upper limit of our 12-month ranges, week by week, since early  March  The gap has been getting bigger and bigger, creeping up rather slowly    I’ve been impressed recently by some articles in the press--one was by Joe Slevin, I  believe, another was by Henry Kaufman--that sort of took the market to task for acting  irrationally in response to week-to-week fluctuations in the monetary aggregates, overreacting,  as it were  I was impressed when I saw the recently released report of the Bach Committee  [unintelligible] by the Board of Governors  One of their recommendations was that the System  do something to sort of alert the market to the existence of random or nonpermanent deviations  week by week or month by month in the trend of the monetary aggregates    I think one device by which we could do that is this smoothing device of the moving  averages  In trying to put to work my own personal view of what the basic trend is in the level of  the monetary aggregates, and feeling that we need some device for linking the short-term targets  to the long-term targets, I come out for this particular period [with recommendations] somewhat  similar to [those] that you make     A federal funds range of 5 to 6 actually is what I had in mind  I would not only support   your upper limit of  7-1/2 [for M1]--if anything I would shade that a bit since our long-term  range is 7 percent  Unless we do something now to hold that upper limit down in the  intermeeting period below the longer-term range of 7 percent, we may continue to move even     5/18/76 - 45 -         farther away from the range we have set for ourselves  If I had my druthers I’d put the upper  limit of M1 at 7 percent just so we wouldn’t drift further away from the upper limit of our  longer-term range  And if we were to make any effort to get back at least within the range within  say a two-month period, the lower limit would have to be 2-1/2 percent, 2-1/2 to 7 would be how  I would come out on the M1 range if we were to try to put this new analytic device to work     On M2, [I support] an upper limit of 9, simply because that’s the upper end of the longer- term range, and a lower limit of 5 because a 5 percent rate is what would return it to the upper  limit of the longer-term range within the month of June     This would all, of course, have to be subject to a federal funds constraint, and even though  I would recommend a federal funds range of 5 to 6, I would agree with you that we shouldn’t go  beyond another 50 basis points or to a level of 5-3/4 before the next meeting     I believe that you have correctly stated the case, we should move with all deliberate  caution in this upward adjustment of short-term interest rates  But unless we begin to do it now,  we’ll be faced with what Mr MacLaury said, that [with] a squeeze later on in the second half of  the year, we’ll have to really bear down on the growth of the aggregates  I’d rather do it a little  bit sooner and in less drastic moves than if we were to delay action now and be forced to take  more vigorous action at a later date  "
76,1976-06-22,"  Tom, you cast some doubt on whether Mr Reuss really has standing to  bring this suit  Is there any need to [unintelligible] to perfect his position to get standing, or if he  doesn’t have standing, who else might?  That’s the first question     Second question, this may be premature, but if you care to express an informal tentative  view, how do you think this thing might turn out--if you fail on the possible order for dismissal  based on lack of standing--just on the merits of the case  Is there any reasonable clear possible  outcome one way or another?     Mr Chairman, one other observation  I would certainly echo your remark  that the Desk carried out the operations with great skill in this period  I was on the morning call  for a good part of the period since the last meeting  One very definite impression I’m getting as  a result of having paid close attention in this past month to the daily operations, and I would like  to put this especially to Mr Sternlight, is that the market sometimes overreacts to our direct  purchases or sales in the market as opposed to purchases or sales to and from foreign accounts   They seem to read into it when we do direct market transactions [unintelligible] move on our part  to change the level of the funds rate     I wonder if we would get away from this, to some extent at least, if we were targeting on,  say, nonborrowed reserves rather than targeting on the funds rate itself  I think the market is  kind of overshooting in its reactions to your direct operations in the market as opposed to  operations with foreign accounts, and the market, I think, has to look on the defensive  operations       Mr Chairman, as far as the economy is concerned, I share the thought  that’s been expressed by several others around the table that most likely we are just seeing a  pause now and that we will experience, as the year goes on, pretty broadly based, solid, further  growth     And in that context I share what I think Governor Wallich was saying  Take the Bluebook  forecast of where we might be from an interest rate standpoint under the three alternatives, and I  would prefer to see a little rise in interest rates now rather than a big one later on  And therefore  it would not disturb me to see the fed funds rate climb up to 5-3/4 percent during this  intermeeting period  And given that conclusion, I would lean toward the full 5 to 6 percent range  on the fed funds rate     With respect to ranges for M1 and M2, I share the view that’s already been expressed by  three to four members that the top end of the short-term range should not exceed the top end of  our longer-term range  We’re already, from the standpoint of the level of the aggregates, over  the rates that we have set out for ourselves in terms of the 12-month target     In that respect, I would just like to refer briefly to an experimental set of charts that I  distributed last month and again this month to the members of this group, which is an effort to  try to relate our short-term actions to our 12-month target  We set these 12-month targets, as we  all know, to give ourselves a considerable degree of latitude in M1, M2, and M3  They are fairly  wide ranges that allow a good deal of flexibility, as I think is perfectly appropriate  And yet at  the same time, some of us have been making an effort to get a better tracking mechanism on  where we stand on the level of the Ms--through the use of moving averages as, in my view, a  best indicator--in order to get away from a problem you pose, which is 4 equals 8, that is, the  unreliability of any given month’s seasonally adjusted data       6/22/76 - 35 -           I think that we have a method for getting around that through the use of this filtering  device of smoothing the data through moving averages  [We use] the Board of Governors’ own  staff forecast of five weeks ahead as to where the Ms are likely to be  And the net of all of that is  charts that I have been using that show that we are above our own range for both M1 and M2   And I find it difficult, therefore, to support any short-term range which would bring us further  above the upper limit of a longer-term range that we ourselves set     So that’s my rationale for supporting an upper limit for M1 of 7 percent for the next two  months and an upper limit for M2 of 10 percent  And in fact, if we were to take the next step  that would bring our short-term targets within at least the upper bound of our longer-term targets,  we would have to have a lower limit for M1 of 2 percent for the next two months and a lower  limit for M2 of 5 percent  And if we were to follow those lower limits, that would bring us  barely down to the top end of our longer-term ranges by the end of July     I think that this Committee is still faced with an unresolved problem of how to limit its  short-term targets for this longer-term range  These charts that I’ve been playing around with are  an effort to do that  I’m not sure we’ll get there right away, but I see an unresolved problem in  [that] we are able to [unintelligible] month by month with what we set out for ourselves as a   [unintelligible] wide range of growth in the aggregates for a 12-month period ahead  And doing  a little forecasting, I suspect that what we’ll end up with next month is to forget the overshoot in  the second quarter  And if we do that without the second quarter as a base for the next 12  months ahead, and even if we were to make no change in the growth rate ranges of both M1 and  M2, we end up with something like $3 billion more of M1 by the first quarter of ’77     Or, to put it another way, by the time we get to the fourth quarter of this year, if we forget  the second-quarter overshoot, which I’m not opposed to, we would end up with year-to-year  growth of M1 of something like 58 percent from the  fourth quarter of ’75 [to the] fourth  [quarter of] ’76  Due to your last testimony on our longer-term goals, it seems to me that  58 percent in the calendar year of ’76 is a very generous, maybe overly generous, rate of  monetary growth in view of the fact that we have not gotten inflation down as much as I would  like to see it, and [also] in view of my personal hunch that, if anything, the rate of inflation is  going to get somewhat worse rather than better in the months ahead     Well, I think we ought to ask you, as the most successful forecaster of  velocity, Mr Chairman, what you think is going to happen  "
101,1976-07-19,"  Is the complaint invalidated on one standing but supported on another  standing of its government [unintelligible]?     Tom, I was wondering whether anyone had found out whether the lawyer  representing Reuss is doing so in his capacity as, well, a private lawyer for a private client, or is  he on the staff of the Banking Committee, or just what?     Well, I was wondering whether you thought--     Well, no, I was simply going to ask, if it turned out that what you’ve heard  is in fact true, that his salary is being paid by the committee, whether that might offer any  opportunity for us to sort of complain to other members of the committee and raise the issue of  the use of his time     If I may, Tom, I just have one other question  Could you share with us  any impressions you have as to the caliber of the particular individuals from [the Department of]  Justice that will be arguing this case?  I understand they will carry the ball in court rather than  you  Is that the way it works out, or what?     Sounds promising     Good     Mr Chairman, I would like to ask Lyle a few questions about the  monetary assumptions underlying the Board’s staff forecast  In comparing our own forecast with  yours, Lyle, I find they’re fairly similar up to mid-’77, but you begin to get some difference in  the second half of ’77  Our forecast is coming in considerably lower in terms of real growth, for  example, than yours  In the structure of the GNP accounts, it tends to show up principally in  things like personal consumption and inventories, but I think possibly one of the explanations  may be on the monetary assumption  Just as a point of fact, am I correct in thinking that you  were assuming a 5-3/4 percent growth path for M1?     Well, this gets to the principal point I was going to make  In our own  forecast, by the end of ’77, the increase in M1 velocity will be just a touch above its long-term  trend rate of 3 percent; for M2, it’s just a touch above its long-term trend rate of close to zero   And I gather your velocities are somewhat higher than that     Now, to be very frank about it, I think I would have to concur with the  Chairman’s observation at the last meeting, which was, if I recall correctly, Mr Chairman, that  we cannot expect the large increases in velocity to continue, and I come out with about that same  conclusion      Well, I think, to put this in prospective, I have to say my faith in  anybody’s forecast, including our own, [decreases] in geometrical proportion to every quarter     7/19-20/76 - 40 -   added to the forecast horizon, so I can’t really say that we have irreconcilable differences by the  time it gets to the fourth quarter of ’77     Mr Chairman, I find myself in substantial agreement with your  conclusions, mostly for the same reasons  I would like to refer to a set of charts I have taken the  liberty of distributing here to make two quick points     I think you put into focus very well the fact that over the past year, taken as a whole, our  growth rates of the various Ms have been either within or very close to the top of the range we  set ourselves  I think that the fact that we shift bases every quarter makes us look worse in  practice than we really are  That is to say, it doesn’t bring out the point that you made so well,  that we had been within our ranges over a period of a year     That point is brought out on the second page of this set of charts, which shows  [unintelligible] that we set, and growth ranges that we set going clear back to the beginning of  this whole exercise  There are a lot of lines that tend to be somewhat confusing on this set of  charts, but the net of all of this is that, preceding the overshoot that occurred in the second  quarter of 1976, we had two undershoots--we were well under the ranges for both the first  quarter of 1976 and the fourth quarter of 1975  That is one reason that I’m in favor of your final  recommendations as to the growth ranges  But I view the second quarter as being something of a  catch-up from the undershoots of the first quarter of the year and the last quarter of 1975     More to the point, this chart shows that we missed the range altogether-- we’re above it in  the second quarter and below it in the preceding two quarters  To the extent that we have a sort  of public understanding problem here, I think we would be better served sometime, certainly not  now in my opinion, to perhaps consider shifting to a fixed base of, say, the fourth quarter of the  year for the following calendar year     I don’t think this is the time to do it, and I am not recommending that it we do it now  But  if we had gone that route in the past--say, if we had set for ourselves the fourth quarter of 1975  as a base--[growth through] the second quarter of 1976 would cover a six-month period and  show a 56 percent increase in M1, close to the middle of the range, and an 111 percent increase  of M2, which is just a touch above the upper end of the M2 range       7/19-20/76 - 46 -   So, in terms of one of your guiding principles of simplicity, it might actually be easier for  the public and Congress, academics, to understand if we had a fixed base rather than a shifting  base     The other point I wanted to make just quickly while I have the floor and you have the  charts in front of you [relates to the] first page of the set of charts labeled M1  This is my  continuing concern, that the market is reacting perversely, sometimes irrationally, to our weekly  published figures of the seasonally adjusted data  One can find all sorts of illustrations of this   In this morning’s Wall Street Journal, for example, there is a story about the wholesale dumping  of bond inventories yesterday by dealers, at cut-rate prices, and the stock market was down  sharply, and all apparently because of interest rate fears  It doesn’t take much [to stoke such  fears,] because the latest weekly figures of money show quite a jump     To the extent that we can solve that problem, I think we ought to try  And I’m back to my  favorite theme here, hoping not to be a nag, but I think this is an important point  We need--in  my opinion--some sort of filtering device to put these weekly seasonally adjusted money supply  figures in some better perspective, and the only way I know how to do that is to smooth them  through a moving average device [unintelligible], what happened quite recently on the funds  rate     I’m referring to the figures we publish, Mr Chairman     I would publish the moving average to try to get away from what  happened yesterday, where the market reacted, in my opinion, in the wrong way to a single  week’s worth of figures  We’ve seen this repeated again and again and again  And I am hoping  that someday I can convince my colleagues around the table here to make some sort of device  that we can publish ourselves so that the market would understand that there are a lot of random  fluctuations in these weekly figures and, indeed, even in the monthly figures  We need a longer- term measure of where we stand in terms of levels of the aggregates     I’m glad to hear that, that’s exactly the sort of thing I am recommending   Not committing myself to 13 weeks as the optimum period, but that’s pretty close to what the  tests of statistical significance would show to be the number of weeks you have to have to  dampen random fluctuations to a point where they account for less than half of the observed  week-to-week movements     Paul, that’s exactly why I’d like to have us educate the market to not place  so much weight on what the very latest weekly figures show  I think they react irrationally to  that  We’re getting observations that are unjustified and disturbing     Mr Chairman I would like to take just one more minute to make a point,  and then I’ll be quiet  On page 1 of these charts, I would not for public purposes have the Board  [staff]’s own forecast with the five or six weeks ahead  I think it would be a very useful thing for  this Committee to see, and I think it raises a point that is worth a little thought     In June, the decline in the M1 growth rate occurred within the context of an overshoot in  the second quarter as a whole  The Board staff’s forecast of the weeks ahead on this page as  shown in the [unintelligible], beginning July 7 and August 4 it shows a very sharp recovery will  be occurring  And in that context I raise the question as to whether the recent reduction in the  federal funds rate, apparently in response to the [unintelligible] June figures is really the  appropriate response if one were to view the best measure of the level of M1 as the smooth series  of a 13-week moving average     Because once one incorporates the weekly forecasts, we have a forecast line here of what  the moving average itself would look like based on that forecast of weekly data, and the moving  average of the forecast of this also shows [unintelligible] upper end of the range  In short, I  would also raise the question as to what our response ought to be when the single month’s  figures come in on the low side without having the full context of this smoothing or moving  average device  That’s not something we need to settle today, but I would like to just lay that  thought on the table for future consideration when we have this kind of meeting that you  suggested     I agree     Mr Chairman, since I was about the fourth one, I guess, to follow  Governor Coldwell’s proposal for alternative B as written, I’ve really got to say something on  that federal funds range to the effect that a half point is, in my opinion, far too narrow  Those of  us who served on the Subcommittee on the Directive ended up with a pretty firm conviction that  overly close management of the funds rate was leading to these undershoots and overshoots   And I’d like just to see a better balance between the two  I’d settle for a 1 point spread, but when  it gets down to a half, I really feel very uncomfortable, and for some of the reasons that Governor  Wallich was speaking to this morning  "
151,1976-09-21,"  Mr Chairman, I’d like to make several comments and then ask a question  about the economic outlook that was presented by the staff  Generally speaking, I can accept  that outlook as being certainly a reasonable and plausible one, but I would also have to add that,  in my opinion, it probably has more downside risk now than we’ve seen in recent months, and  for several reasons     First of all, you mentioned, Mr Zeisel, with regard to the outlook as you briefed us on it,  that there were two principal risks--an extended auto strike and a renewal of stronger inflationary  pressures  Well, with regard to that first point, I think it’s quite possible that even if the strike is  short, it could certainly change the quarter-by-quarter pattern of the output of the economy  I’ve  asked my staff to do a little looking back into the record  In 1970, which was the last strike we     9/21/76 - 15 -    had, it lasted 70 days  That was the strike against GM, and it had a very noticeable effect of  cutting real output by an estimated 3-1/2 to 4 percent at an annual rate between the second and  the fourth quarters of 1970     Now, how deeply this Ford strike is going to cut into the output of goods and services  obviously is going to depend on the length  My staff took a look at the 1967 Ford strike, lasting  49 days, and that took nearly 2 percentage points off the growth rate of real output in the affected  quarters  It’s our best guess that a short strike, let’s say two to three weeks, would probably have  the effect of reducing real GNP [growth] by about 1 percentage point at the most, but if the thing  went on for, say, six or seven weeks, it could reduce real output [growth] in the fourth quarter by  2 to 2-1/2 percentage points     Now the only good news, I suppose, in this look at the record is that most of the real output  lost during the strike seems to be made up in the quarter following the end of the strike, but even  if that’s true, and if the strike, contrary to my hopes, should last longer than a couple of weeks,  we could have a pretty soft tone, I would think, in the economy during the first quarter [of 1977],  or the fourth quarter of this year, even though we might see a strong bounceback in the first  quarter     So one of the questions, I guess, that I would like to put to you if you’ve had a chance to  look into this is, what duration of strike would you consider to be of sufficient magnitude to have  a significant effect on the tone of the economy?     I’ll let you think about that for a minute while I go on with the second comment, and that’s  the outlook for inflation  I must say that most of our industrial directors at the San Francisco  Bank and its Branches continue to be skeptical of the outlook for inflation as you have outlined  it--and with which my staff is in essential agreement     Whether [the directors] will be right or whether the research staff will be right remains to  be determined, but at least as far as the psychology and the expectations in a number of segments  of industry [are concerned], they expect the cost-push pressures to be stronger and the price  increases to be more widespread than our research staffs are inclined to believe will be the case   And if nothing else, it indicates a frame of mind in a number of segments of industry that is  going to affect their actual decisionmaking processes, I think, whether it’s going to be on the  inventory front or on the capital front     So much for my comments, Mr Chairman, and if Mr Zeisel has any answer to the  question I pose on how long an auto strike would be serious enough, say, to cause us to bend in  our policy, I’d like to hear this response     Thank you     Mr Chairman, you have made me feel better already  There’s one  observation I’d like to make about this long list of favorable factors  I’m not sure how favorably  we ought to interpret the good indications of a coming upturn in capital spending, and perhaps  the staff has some input on this     What I have in mind is that I keep hearing, again from our directors in industry, that a  substantial fraction of this increase in capital spending is not productive in the old fashioned  sense in that it’s aimed at complying with environmental requirements  Whether it’s the  scrubbers for the utilities or whether it’s cleaning up the pulp in paper mills, they are spending  tremendous sums of money to comply with environmental requirements  Now this will mean  dollars pumped into the economy, but it might not mean the usual increases in potential for a rise  in output per man-hour that we’ve seen associated in the past with the rise in capital spending     I’m sorry, Mr Chairman, did you call on me?     The noise outside--I couldn’t hear  Well, I think at a time like this, while I  share the hopes of the economy coming up out of this lull, and without wanting to be a  Cassandra, I guess I’m a little more dubious than some around the table as to when we’ll see this  renewed strength  And where this comes out on the bottom line is sort of a visceral feeling about  it--if anything, err on the side of ease     The markets have been softening in terms of interest rates  I was glad to see this latest  decline in the prime rate  I think in view of what I consider to be a little bit of uncertainty in the  outlook, including, among other things, how long this auto strike will last and a few other things,  I would be tempted to follow the strategy now, [given] the uncertainties around the real sector of  the economy, to aim for a steady hand on the growth of the aggregates  As opposed to the  situation earlier this year, when, because of the changing demand function for money, the  disturbances seemed to be in the financial sector, it was more appropriate to call for a steady  hand on interest rates  I think perhaps the reverse may be true now     So, net net, I could accept the specifications on M1 and M2 that you mentioned, but if  anything, I would like to see, irrespective of what range we set for the federal funds  rate--whether it’s 4-3/4 to 5-3/4, which would be my preference, or whether it’s 5 to 5-1/2, both  centered on 5-1/4--a willingness of the Desk to lean in the direction of letting that rate move  down a bit in order to make sure that we continue to get the minimum growth in M1 that we’ve  targeted     Yes, that is our emphasis, Mr Chairman, and we feel that this is one of the  few areas where there is any discretion left on the part of the Federal Reserve System without  legislative changes     Mr Chairman, I didn’t catch that final key phrase, where you said with the  understanding that the Desk would what?     Fine  "
172,1976-10-19,"  I just wanted to make a brief comment, Mr Chairman, underscoring  Lyle’s conclusion that, all things considered, the risks are predominantly on the downside at the  moment  My comment is to the effect that I am seeing growing evidence of this among directors  of our Bank  They come from very large companies whose inventory planning is now quite  cautious as a result of what they consider a sluggishness feeding on itself and who are also  inclined to keep revising their capital spending plans in a downward direction or to at least defer  them until they see more concrete evidence of this pickup that the forecasting fraternity has been  promising     In short, I think this is an area that we need to keep a very close eye on because these  inventory plans and capital spending plans are not set in concrete  As we all know, in the real  world, they’re subject to ongoing revision and reassessment, and I think that’s probably the area  of greatest concern to me  what might happen if we don’t get some rebound in consumer  spending following the sluggishness of the past several months, what this might do to revise or at  least stretch out what we’ve been hoping for in the way of a fairly significant rebound in capital  spending and some improvement in the strength in inventories  I don’t think that’s necessarily     10/19/76 - 24 -   going to happen in view of the current skeptical attitude on the part of a lot of large concerns  At  least the ones that I’m familiar with       I wonder, Mr Chairman, if I could ask Lyle for some additional  clarification on this statement that he doesn’t think the present situation lends itself--I think he  used the word amenable  Lyle if the present situation is not amenable to correction by monetary  policy, does that mean--      I was trying to find out whether you meant that an extra dose of monetary  stimulus for some period like say six months, a year ahead would have no good effects, or if it  would be an inferior way of getting , or just what?  Because, in a nutshell, my staff did a  simulation using our version of the FRB-MIT model  And cranking in an assumption that, for a  year ahead, [there is] an extra 1 percentage point growth in M1 than we have had, they did come  up with different results     It showed some measurable increase in real GNP next year, to a growth rate of 59 percent  for the year instead of 47 percent  Showed the unemployment rate by the fourth quarter of 1977     10/19/76 - 28 -   ending up lower, at 63 percent, than it would otherwise have been at 67 percent  And with little  effect in that period on the rate of inflation  So that I would like to, perhaps this is not the point  to do it, but to examine this possibility of a one-shot short-term action in the way of extra  monetary stimulus that could be withdrawn so that we don’t get ongoing inflationary effects  from having done something to try to pick up the rate of capital spending and housing and  whatever  In other words, I’m not inclined to your conclusion, if it was in fact a conclusion, that  we can’t do anything meaningful  I guess I’m now back to the question that I asked you when  you clarified just what you had in mind       In the interest of brevity, Mr Chairman, and because I am concerned  about the uncertainties in the economy and the sluggishness that we’re witnessing, and until that  gets resolved, I would resolve our policy or any uncertainties somewhat on the side of a little  greater ease  And I think Governor Partee has already given my speech  I would come out with     10/19/76 - 41 -   that same set of specifications he was talking about, which was your numbers on Ml and M2   But I would associate myself with his views on 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 range on the federal funds rate,  with the aim of nudging it down in the near future--try to give a little stimulus to the economy if  only in a psychological and confidence sense       Mr Chairman, there has been one aspect of switching to a third-quarter  base that I don’t think has been fully brought out yet, and perhaps the staff could do the  homework on this and let us know in this forthcoming conference call in early November  My  impression--I don’t have the figures, even tentative figures, in front of me--is that moving to a  third-quarter base will in effect mean an upward drift in the base of M2 and a downward drift in  the base of M1  Is that approximately correct?  Steve?       Thank you, Steve  That confirms the general impression I had, Mr  Chairman, even though we don’t have the exact numbers worked out yet  For that reason, along  with the further reason that we had some inconsistency, I believe, between our target ranges on  Ml versus M2 and M3  As for an example, M2 has grown about 4-1/2 percent faster than Ml  ever since March 1975, and if you take the New York Bank projections, that’s going to continue  right on through March ’77  But the differential in the targeted growth midpoints has averaged  only 3 percent, and now it’s only 2-3/4 percent in the current setup  And I think we’ve got an  inconsistent set of ranges here     Well, this is the long way around this thing--the downward drift in Ml base and the upward  drift in M2 base that we will get by moving to a third-quarter base from a second-quarter base   And I think we can solve that problem by adopting Frank Morris’s proposal, which I now  associate myself with  Leave the whole thing unchanged       10/19/76 - 51 -   I’m very concerned about the announcement effect  The thing that got the headline last  time when you announced a lowered upper limit for both M2 and M3 was that the Fed is  tightening  What really counts is what we do within the range and not so much the range itself,  but we’d have a big difficulty in overcoming an impression among the public that we’re  tightening if we lower the upper end of these ranges because of this uncertainty in the economy  that I have earlier discussed  I would come out in favor of leaving the ranges unchanged this  time around    "
237,1976-12-20,"  Let me take a stab at this  I think I know what Ernie is talking about,  because under paragraph 1, point C, it says “any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank not  exceeding”  For a while, I thought that that “not” was an error, that it shouldn’t have been in  there  That particular word “not” doesn’t come into the full meaning until you get to paragraph  2, which says, on bigger transactions, the Manager has got to go up to the Committee or with  certain alternative arrangements  In other words it might make more sense, if this is what Ernie  was saying, I will suggest consideration of it--simply reverse paragraphs 1 and 2     May I ask a question, Mr Chairman, whether it would be appropriate to  put in this sort of additional explanatory preamble in document number one, Bob, [rather than in]  the revised authorization for the foreign currency operation  This is the document that deals at  some length with the parameters of such operations without ever mentioning what the purpose is   I don’t see that there would be any harm to a well-chosen paragraph in here of what the purpose  of it is  I would agree with Bob  I would feel happier, too, if that sort of rationale were in  document number one, provided that it doesn’t clutter up or cause any problems by being there     Chuck, I wonder if I could add something at this point to what Steve has  already said  It is true, I can’t object to anything in the way of the summary of the experiment’s  results [and], something that Steve has already alluded to, that we should have expected [them]   And I would simply like to lay on the table my thoughts, that had the experiment been  constructed somewhat differently, we might well have gotten different results  That is to say, we  have known for a long time that the month-to-month variation in the Ms is quite erratic  They  are riddled with random fluctuations that tend to be self- reversing     This has been a point that I have been emphasizing for well over a year now  If we had,  instead--and this is supported by some staff work--been trying to keep, say, a three-month  moving average of money of the various Ms at some level, I think we would have found  considerably less erratic behavior or unpredictability in the multiplier as compared with trying to  do it on a month-to-month basis  So I think that point is worth noting simply because it  underscores the fact that any instrument--whether it’s the fed funds rate, or nonborrowed  reserves, or any other measure of reserves for that matter--is never going to give a short-run,  month-to-month control over the level of the aggregates or the rates of growth  [That is] because  [unintelligible] built in very strong tendencies for the month-to-month changes to be quite erratic     12/20-21/76 - 26 -         in the Ms, [although] they do average out over a somewhat longer span--three or six months   Mr Kalchbrenner did some good work demonstrating that in one of the staff papers      I completely agree with that, Chuck  I am not criticizing the experiment  for how it was constructed; it was the only reasonable way of doing it  My only point is,  somewhere down the road, and I hope in further assignment to the subcommittee, we will be  asked to look at what the outcome might be on a simulated basis were we to move to, say, a  three- or even four-month horizon in our Bluebook rather than our present two-month horizon   It does contain within it a lot of statistical noise      Well, thank you, Chuck  In my supplementary comments, about a half a  page, I first associated myself with the supplementary comments that Governor Wallich had  made because I thought he put the case very well  I would simply like to stress that, at least as I     12/20-21/76 - 29 -         personally view it, I would think that this Committee would want to strike a reasonable balance  between short-term term interest rate stability on one hand and keeping the aggregates within the  specified 12-month growth ranges that we consider so carefully once each quarter  As I look at  the recent experience, I can’t avoid a conclusion that the pendulum may have swung too far  toward short-term interest rate stability at the cost of significant undershoots to overshoots for  extended periods in how the aggregates behave with respect to the 12-month ranges that we have  decided upon     With regard to the first of those two points, that is, the tendency toward perhaps a narrower  funds rate fluctuation in recent years, the statistical evidence as I read it does seem to support  that--there has been less variation more or less progressively as we’ve gone from ’73 to ’76   With regard to what I mean by significant undershoots or overshoots in our longer-term targets,  probably the most significant sustained undershoot was in the fourth quarter of 1975, just to  refresh your recollection, followed by the first quarter of 1976; in those two quarters, M1 grew  23 percent versus our 5 to 7-1/2 percent range  The next quarter, it grew by 27 percent [versus]  our 4-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent range  That was a six-month period, which I don’t think is  insignificant  [We were] not only below the midpoint, we were significantly below the lower  end of our target range  And as I look back on that period, that was one in which the federal  funds rate was declining, [but] not by very much--about 100 basis points in the first quarter and  about 50 basis points in the second quarter  And I suspect that if we had let that rate come down  a little faster, we might not have gotten the six-month undershoot in M1, which probably  occurred at a time that was not very fortunate in terms of the business cycle; that is, we were still  at a fairly early stage of the recovery pace     So, I am not arguing for constant stability and rates of monetary growth  That’s the last  thing I want because I am a strong believer in flexible policy  I do think that, since we get such  careful attention to the ranges of monetary growth 12 months ahead, and since those ranges  themselves are rather wide, rather generous, something does appear to be wrong when we, over,  say, a six-month period [are] well below even the lower end of that range  I would like to see a  little more attention given to keeping at least within those ranges that we have specified for  ourselves and at the cost of perhaps somewhat wider movements, not only day-to-day but from  one level to another, in the federal funds rate     I’m simply asking that the pendulum, as I would put it, swing closer back toward the  center of that dual objective of preventing destabilizing interest rate fluctuations on one hand and  preventing destabilizing overshoots or undershoots in long-run growth ranges on the other  I  think that completes my comments, Chuck--excuse me, may I add one more thing?     In view of that consideration, I was not terribly happy with the recommendation that we  not have a nonborrowed reserves target in our short-term operating specifications  But I  accepted that with a proviso that the Committee would pay serious attention to the second  recommendation which the subcommittee made  That second recommendation was that, in the  Bluebook, the staff include estimates of growth rates for the various reserve measures over the  ensuing six months [that are] expected to be consistent with the movement of the aggregates,  etc, and that there be an analysis in the Bluebook which evaluates the recent behavior of  reserves in relation to such expectations       12/20-21/76 - 30 -         In short, that we keep a very careful eye on the volume of reserves, preferably as measured  by nonborrowed reserves, so that we don’t allow ourselves, as I think we probably have in the  past, to get too concerned with freezing our funds rate in position at the [cost] of letting the  aggregates [move] considerably outside of the ranges that we have specified  Thank you      Mr Chairman, I wonder if I could bring the discussion back for a moment  to the report of the subcommittee  I want to emphasize that I did not dissent  Henry, as far as I  know, did not dissent  There were no dissents  There were two, actually three,  recommendations  Governor Wallich and I had some additional qualifications to our votes, as it  were, in terms of points of emphasis that we thought ought to be given greater attention in the  future  I think it would be unfortunate if the Committee as a whole concluded we have a split     12/20-21/76 - 35 -         report because we didn’t  And I think it would be unfortunate if the Committee as a whole didn’t  address itself to our recommendations  Perhaps not today in view of what President Eastburn  has said, but perhaps at the next meeting     There were two quite specific recommendations there  that the nonborrowed reserves not  be included in the short-run operating specs; and number two, that the Bluebook include certain  vital information about the past with respect to behavior of reserves vis-à-vis the monetary  aggregates  I would not like to see the Committee walk away and not pay any attention to these  two recommendations  Does that make sense, Governor Partee?  You are the chairman [of the  subcommittee]      I don’t either, Dave  And I think I’ve already expressed myself to the  effect that I hope that whatever subcommittee addresses the questions that are left on the table  would look at one very key proposal, and that is to lengthen somewhat the so-called short-term  horizon over which we now attempt to maintain some ranges of growth in the aggregates  [That  proposal would be] based on all the experience which shows that, if you go to, say, a three- month or maybe a four-month moving average of your money targets, you’re going to be a lot  better able to hit those than if you try to hit them month by month, because there’s such a lot of  random variation       12/20-21/76 - 36 -         But I don’t see anything in the adoption of these recommendations that would preclude  that sort of additional work  And particularly recommendation 2, that the Bluebook now contain  additional information, projecting for six months ahead the levels of various reserve measures,  and especially nonborrowed reserves, that would be consistent with our longer-term monetary  growth ranges      That’s correct      If I may interrupt, President Morris also joined in that in his remarks      Mr Chairman, I wonder if I could propose one final time, the question I  asked you several moments ago and so that the rest of the Committee members will know what  to expect  Is it your intention that there will be some further discussion and perhaps a vote on  these subcommittee recommendations at the next meeting of the Committee?  I say “next” with  the sense that some members apparently didn’t receive the report in time to really digest it  thoroughly for today’s meeting  I just happen to be uptight about unresolved loose ends  I want  to express my feelings--     Oh, I see  I’m sorry, I didn’t catch that  All right Very good  Thank you     I was wondering, Mr Chairman, how much you know about President- elect Carter’s hopes, possibly goals, in terms of getting both the unemployment rate down, I  think, to 6-1/2 percent in the coming year and getting real growth of the economy to 6 percent, if  I recall the figures correctly  Do you happen to know whether those are just hopes as opposed to  goals?  And further, has our staff addressed itself to what sort of package of monetary and fiscal  measures might be necessary to get that sort of extraordinary result?     Exactly  I would be glad to broaden that question  I know you stated the  whole case on that very well in your November testimony  The real thrust of my question is how  much pressure we are likely to see coming out of the new Administration and the new Congress  to achieve these--I don’t know whether to characterize them as hopes, targets, or goals--of the  Carter Administration for a 6-1/2 percent unemployment rate and 6 percent real growth  That’s  what I’m mainly concerned about--how much pressure [is] there likely to be?     The other thing that may help is--I consider the most helpful single sign is  Ralph Nader’s objections to the Cabinet appointments  They must be good  That’s off the  record     I would have to say, Mr Chairman, that everything Mr Guffey has said  about drought conditions and lack of snow--not only does it affect the ski resorts but also it  affects our supply of water and reservoirs for next season--it is equally as bad on the West Coast  as it is in his part of the country     I wonder if I might ask two questions, Mr Chairman, of Mr Sternlight   First, what his view is of how the market would now look upon or receive a further cut in the  discount rate by, say, another quarter of a point?  Since my second question is totally unrelated,  maybe you’d like to direct yourself to that one first     Oh, I’m interested in that--my own view of it happens to be that the  market would look on this as merely catch-up  My second question, I’m not sure that this would  be appropriate at this early date, but if it is appropriate, I’d be interested in the comment  How  the mechanics will be handled of this release of reserves with the latest cut in reserve  requirements, which, I might add, I was glad to see for a little bit of good it will do on the  [Federal Reserve System] membership problem  But there will be, what, $550 million released,  as I recall the figures, Peter?     12/20-21/76 - 57 -           I understand that  Having heard that comment, I guess I would still favor  a posture that would keep rates at about their present levels as far as the open market short-term  rates are concerned  And I say that simply in view of my own conviction that, while it’s  encouraging to have seen this rash of good economic news that came out in the latest monthly  statistics--as Lyle himself put it in summary--we can’t be absolutely certain  You have to have a  high degree of certainty that the pause has in fact ended  It probably has, but to some extent the  jury is still out, and I would prefer to resolve doubts on the side of ease       12/20-21/76 - 67 -         And I would certainly hope also that the so-called pause would not apply to the discount  rate  I think several people have spoken about that, and I would like to add my endorsement of a  further cut in the discount rate, simply in view of the fact that we have still a very important  [Federal Reserve System] membership problem with us  To the extent we keep the discount rate  a penalty rate over an extended period, as we have done, it doesn’t help the membership  problem, and it could be helped a little, I think, if we kept that rate closer in line with the open  market rates that we’ve already produced through the general thrust of our policy  And finally, I  would favor, for reasons that Governor Partee has cited, a money market directive  "
264,1977-01-17,"  How is this made known to the public?  Is this released?     Mr Chairman, I wonder if I could ask, in wrapping up on this subject, any  overall evaluation you might have of the combination of the IMF and BIS facility to the UK in  terms of the prospects of getting them out of their trouble  What the outlook is and how they got  these two major new facilities?     I was simply asking if you would care to give us your evaluation of the  prospects for the UK now that they have both the IMF and the BIS facility?     Thank you     Could I ask a question, Mr Chairman?  Would you feel you are able to  describe what the [Federal Reserve] Board is going to do with respect to the regulation on its  own?  The Sunshine Act--you’re not prepared to do that yet?     I’d like to ask Lyle a question about the velocity estimates that seem to be  implicit in the Greenbook forecast this time  With the 5-1/2 percent M1 growth assumption, it  appears that the velocity of M1 will be at the highest rate of growth in the third year of recovery  of any of the post-Korean [War] cycles--namely 58 percent versus the previous average in the  post-Korean [War] cycles of 34 percent--and about the same thing could be said for the velocity  of M2  What I am interested in is, on what basis did your staff, Lyle, say this velocity growth is  going to be this substantial at this [stage] of the recovery, when the normal pattern has been a  decline in the rate of growth in velocity of both M1 and M2 during the third year of recovery     That’s a good move, Lyle     Mr Chairman, in some of your earlier testimony, it seems to me, you’ve  done an outstanding job educating Congress as to the change in financial technology that’s going  on, and why M1, therefore, doesn’t mean as much as it used to  And in fact, if adjusted for  earlier conditions, [it is] perhaps as much as a couple of percentage points below where it  otherwise would have been if these changes in financial technology had not come about  That’s  one point I’d like to get laid on the table as a background for my own personal views as to what  ranges we ought to adopt     And the second key consideration in my thinking was one that Governor Jackson has just  alluded to, and that is, for some time now, we have had inconsistent ranges, I’m afraid, for M1  versus M2 and M3  The big overshoot we’ve seen in M2 and M3, we all know about, and I’m  concerned that that will continue to go on; and that really, to be consistent with our M1 growth  range, we have needed--for some time now--a higher range of growth for both M2 and M3     The third consideration in my thinking is that, for some time, my staff has been calling my  attention, and increasingly so in the very recent past, to the fact that, as they looked at the  historical record, M2 has now emerged as a superior measure of monetary influence on the  economy since about mid-’74, if you go back and make all the tests--from, say, 1960 to ’74  The  forecast of GNP through the third quarter of last year, using both M1 and M2--the M2 forecast is  now showing a lower error than M1  In short, I hope that, if you feel you can help educate both  the Congress and the public about that fact, [then] we perhaps ourselves [will pay] even more  attention to M2 than we have  Perhaps weighing it even more heavily than the 50 percent that  we’ve been giving it     Before I came in and heard your persuasive remarks--and I’m impressed by all of the  caveats that you’ve mentioned, about reaction to the Administration’s new fiscal package to  stimulate employment and a fear that we may be frustrating their objectives--I prepared a  different set of numbers that I think might get around the problems which you mentioned  And  that would be first of all to reduce the M1 growth range to 4 to 6 percent, based on another of  your good statements about how financial technology is changing  And if you agree with the  analysis that I’ve just gone through, to stress even more the importance that we now attach to  M2--to make those growth ranges consistent--to up the growth range of M2 to 8 to 10 percent,  and the M3, 9 to 12     So if we did all those things, we would be, on the one hand, seeming to reduce the M1  range--not seeming to, we would be--by half a point in both the upper and lower boundaries   But assuming a satisfactory explanation, at which you are very adept, of why we’re doing  this--in view of the change in financial technology and the growing importance of time and  savings deposits--we would be on the record as increasing by half a point the lower range of  M2--that is going from the present [range of] 7-1/2 to 10, [up] to 8 to 10  And with regard to     1/17-18/77 - 46 -           M3, increasing by half a point the upper range, going from the present [range of] 9 to 11-1/2, up  to 9 to 12     I’m equally concerned about the danger of inflation that’s been discussed at length around  here this morning  And I’m quite concerned that if we in this year ahead were to experience the  same sort of large overshoot on M2 and M3 that we had in 1976, we might well be setting the  stage for significant inflationary pressures by 1978  Well, for that rather complex set of reasons,  I would therefore suggest a possible alternative for the three ranges that I just mentioned     Well, a number of those who have already spoken have, in effect, given  my speech  In view of the sustained overshoots we had in M2--given my own strange sort of  view that M2 is probably a better predictor of what’s going to happen now than M1--I think it’s  time to lean against that overshoot a bit, and hence I would like to see the federal funds rate edge  up a little  And also because I am convinced that we should have a full-point spread in the  federal funds range, I would join those who are commending a 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 federal funds  range  But for the reasons that Governor Partee has already alluded to and my own concern  about not getting clear outside of our long-term ranges in the short run, I would favor the  alternative C specifications on M1 and M2     May I ask you a question, Mr Chairman, about that midpoint--how the  Desk is to determine that  I’m not sure what that means  "
290,1977-02-15,"  Since Mr Zeisel mentioned the drought in the West, I thought I might  pass on a few calculations that I had my own staff make in terms of what impact they see this  year  There will no doubt be disaster for a number of California farmers, but we have tried to  figure out what this will result in, in terms of costs  In view of the almost record low levels  we’re seeing as we move into a second year of drought, in [moisture content] in the ground, of  levels of water in the reservoirs, and snow pack in the mountains, they are guesstimating a  possible 25 percent reduction in the output of fruits and vegetables in California farms this year       2/15/77 - 17 -           The staff figures that fruits and vegetables make up about 31 percent of the cost of living  index; and that 25 percent reduction, unless offset by increased production somewhere else in the  country--the net bottom line result is about a 03 percent boost in the cost of living index for the  year as a whole  Does that jive with the agricultural expert that you talked to, Jerry?     I don’t know the answer to that question, Phil     I hope that’s right     I’d like to ask Mr Zeisel one more question in connection with the $50  dollar rebate program or, as the Chairman has more appropriately called it, a gift, by the  government to its citizens  Do you have any estimates as to how much you expect that sum to be  spent as opposed to saved?     I’m going to spend it  Seriously, I’m not sure yet  I’ll wait until I see it   We may not get it     I think I would agree with what Governor Wallich has expressed  I am  concerned with the constant outlook for the economy that I have, and keeping in mind the sharp  upward base drift we had in M2 last year, which was over $11 billion and especially strong in  the fourth quarter  [And] a concern Governor Lilly has earlier expressed, which I share, which is  the amount of liquidity in the economy  And in view of all of these things, I would come out  about half way between B and C, I guess, and I think Governor Wallich has expressed the  specifications pretty well     I would favor a federal funds rate of about 4-1/2 to 5-1/4 and would like, as Mr Black has  indicated, to pull the M2 range down a little bit to, say, 6 to 10  But my fear is that if we don’t     2/15/77 - 34 -           begin to lean against the bulge that’s in prospect, and in view of the very large overshoot in M2,  I’m quite concerned about the implications for inflation as we move into next year      I must say that I’m sort of attracted by Henry’s reasons for using the word  “target,” and I would be prepared to go with that  I caught up with this fairly recently  It’s an  interesting alternative to consider       2/15/77 - 37 -          "
317,1977-03-15,"  I’d like to come back to Jerry’s remarks on productivity and unit labor  costs and ask him a question  As I look at the pattern for last year, it’s somewhat disturbing if it  were to be continued into this year, in the sense that, quarter-by-quarter last year, the rate of  increase of real final sales changed pace as the year went along  Compensation per man-hour  didn’t really accelerate; it was growing at a lower rate during the last three quarters than the first  quarter  The quarter-by-quarter rate of gain of output per man-hour went downhill; in fact, in the  final quarter it actually was negative  And the net of that was that unit labor cost kept gaining in  terms of rate of increase, quarter-by-quarter; in the fourth quarter, it took quite a sharp jump  If  that were to continue, it’d have pretty adverse implications for 1977  I was wondering, taking  this mix of things--[output] per man-hour, compensation against unit labor cost--what you see in  the tea leaves for 1977     That’s for the year as a whole     Oh, I see     I guess we do in San Francisco, Mr Chairman  In tracking down the  somewhat less optimistic forecast that we have on real GNP--for example, the Board staff has 5  percent year-over-year, we have 43; Board staff has 62 percent gain fourth quarter-over-fourth  quarter and we have only 55--it appears that our staff is apparently assuming less stimulus from  the Carter fiscal package then you are here, Jerry  If I remember the numbers right, and I hope  that I do, my staff is guessing that only about 1/3 of the $50 rebate would flow immediately  through to consumer spending, and I gather that your estimates are somewhat higher than that  Is  that correct?     Mr Chairman, I think a good deal of public reaction and psychology in  the market place will probably depend on your follow-on remarks and how we will handle this  bulge in the Ms because of the rebates  You had some very interesting things to say about that in  recent testimony, about how we had learned some lessons and probably could improve on our  performance  And I think a great deal of reaction in markets will depend, perhaps, on how you  are going to testify on this the next time around, whether this will be May and--     I think that would clear the air quite a bit, and particularly if it came  through that, for the year as a whole, unless we see some significantly different change in the  business outlook than we do now, we would probably end up within the ranges that we  heretofore specified, the 12-month ranges     If that point got across loud and clear; and if the country pretty well understood that this  bulge--if it occurs, say, in the magnitude that Steve’s talked about in the second quarter--would  be offset in the third quarter, and [if it was understood that] for the year as a whole we didn’t  expect to accelerate the rate of monetary growth, I think that would be a healthy dampening  influence on inflationary expectations  That, in my mind, is the key to how the market’s going to  react to our moves       3/15/77 - 32 -           In getting down to the immediate situation, I would be prepared to accept your  specifications, with the further proviso that we might--if the acceleration begins in the Ms during  the March-April period, as Steve thinks it will--begin to lean against it a little bit by moving up  fairly quickly to that 4-3/4 upper end of this fuzzy midpoint range  If we don’t move a little bit  now, we’ll have to move much faster later on in a rather precipitous upward movement, and that  has bothered a number of people around the table, and it would bother me, too  "
368,1977-05-17,"  Since Ernie has brought up this housing boom situation in California, I  suspect I should say a few words on it  It’s obviously a very unhealthy development, and I     5/17/77 - 4 -           would have to also say it’s being somewhat encouraged by all the major banks in California  getting into a second mortgage business  That used to be anathema in the banking business, but  there is a great rise in real estate values in the residential field because of the population growth  limitation on available land, or what have you, in California     It’s not untypical for the prices of houses in suburbs to have about doubled in the last four  years  That suddenly gives people a lot bigger equity position, and the major banks in the state  are now promoting a second deed of trust at a 12 percent interest rate--take a trip around the  world or invest, send your kids to college, or do anything you like with the money  And I am  afraid a lot of people are taking this equity out of their present homes and using it for speculation  in other houses  We have seen instances in which this has been reported by several of our  directors, where, before the builder even has the houses up, he’s got all the sales completed, and  the minute somebody buys it they can turn around and sell it within 10 minutes at a $10,000 or  $20,000 profit     There’s something wrong with the pricing system  The builders themselves aren’t setting a  high enough price on it  But that sort of speculative bubble is bound to come to an end at some  point  And when it does come to an end, there is going to be a lot of lending institutions left with  some bad loans  Now, fortunately, some of our banks and some of the S&Ls have taken steps to  try to head this off  The Home Loan Bank increased its lending rate by a full percentage point  not long ago  Some banks are requiring that borrowers sign a statement that they will occupy the  residence or the house that they are going to buy, or not sell, within two years  There have been  a number of such statements     But unfortunately, like shoveling sand against the tides, speculative profits are so large that  a 1 point increase in interest rates or the requirement to sign a statement that you don’t move out  or intend to sell this property or intend to hold it for investment--people will sign those things  lying through their teeth  So we don’t know quite how to come to grips with it, but it’s not a  healthy development     My recollection, right off the top of my head, Mr Chairman, is that there  is not a single major bank that isn’t involved     That’s right  The prime lending rate on [mortgages] for good property has  gone up about a half point  But in response to your comment, Phil, I agree that there is nothing  new in this in terms of the principle  But what is [new] in my opinion is the intensity of the  speculation to get amateurs of all kinds buying these second and third houses, renting them out  for awhile, and hoping to make a killing  And, you know, as long as values stay up, that’s fine,  but if the values collapse, [there’s] going to be some people unable to service those second  mortgages, in my opinion     Yes     5/17/77 - 6 -             The second deed of trust  And it’s not just the banks, it’s the S&Ls, too,  that are doing it      It’s more pervasive in Southern California than in Northern California     5/17/77 - 7 -             Actually, it’s in Orange County [unintelligible], east of Los Angeles, but  it’s certainly not limited to that      Just a comment on the Board staff forecast, Steve, of M1 and M2  My  staff’s been keeping book on the accuracy of these things and found out something rather  interesting, I think  In the first place, we always filter out the noise in the week-to-week series,  as you know, by using these 13-week moving averages, and we incorporate your forecast  numbers into our moving average  But for the first quarter of this year, it was quite significant,  we thought, that the accuracy of the M2 forecast that you have was considerably better than that  for M1  Specifically, for the first quarter, the average error in the forecast of [the] M1 average is  at about 1/4 percent [relative] to the actual level of the aggregates, but for M2, only 7/100  percent  Now, so far, we haven’t gone back earlier than the first quarter of this year; perhaps you  have  I wonder if you would comment on any impressions you might have on the accuracy of  these forecast numbers which, at least at the moment, seem to indicate that a better job is doable  on M2 and not M1     5/17/77 - 23 -             That’s on a moving average       Mr Chairman, I find a great deal of merit in your proposal, both for the  reasons that you cited in your comments and because of the considerations in the longer term, as  you set forth in your recent testimony on monetary policy  But looking upon other things, the  fact [is] that, if anything, we have probably been a little too stimulative in the past  As you all  know, we’ve had some quite significant increases in the aggregates in 1976  M1 over 6 percent,  and M2 almost an 11 percent annual rate, and I can’t believe the full effect of that has yet pulled  through the economy  Aside from the real estate speculation in California and possibly  elsewhere, I was not one of the worriers today about the general economy  I consider it to be  quite strong for the balance of the year  And I think my principal concern is that the longevity of  this expansion may in fact be threatened by the strong inflationary tones we saw in the first  quarter of this year, only a part of which I think is temporary     I find it interesting to look back to, say, the January Greenbook and see the increases in the  staff’s forecasts for real GNP and inflation that have occurred since that time despite the  withdrawal of the fiscal stimulus by the Administration  And, if I can get in a plug for some  recent research work we’ve been doing, I think this upward revision might have been anticipated  if we had paid more attention to what’s been going on in M2  That is to say, this recent paper I  have circulated to all of you suggests that M2 is presently, and has been since early 1975, a better  predictor of income growth and of future price developments than has M1  And we don’t see  any signs of M2 growth slowing significantly  The first half of 1977 looks to us like it’s going to  increase at about a 10-1/2 percent annual rate     As far as the M1 figure is concerned, I think we need to keep reminding ourselves of the  work that Messrs Axilrod and Paulus have done in their memorandum of last November  suggesting, in effect, that M1 growth was really understated by all these financial market  innovations by about 2 percent and perhaps another 1-1/4 percent this year  It suggested that the  true growth of M1, if it had not been subject to these changes, would have been more like a 7-1/2  percent [rate]       5/17/77 - 30 -           In short, I’m of the opinion that we have been overly generous  I concur with you on that  point in our past policy  So that net-net, I believe it would be a mistake to let the federal funds  decline right now, and if anything, [we] can move it up in a cautious manner rather than let it go  down, with a view to keeping the aggregates under control, keeping them within our ranges, and  giving allowance to the fact that there are long lags, as you know, between the aggregates and  the effect on prices  And I think there was quite a bit of stimulus in 1976 and so far in 1977    "
405,1977-06-21,"  Mr Chairman, I would like to ask a question about the Board staff  forecast, mainly to clarify my own understanding of what’s been happening here  As I look over  the inflation forecast made monthly since the first of the year, we know it has been moving up  steadily, starting off with a forecast of 55 percent for the year, May to January  It’s now up to  62 percent  Over that same period, your forecast of real GNP has, on balance, remained  virtually unchanged, your January forecast being a 57 percent increase for the year, and your  latest June forecast being 58 percent     Given the fact that monetary policy has been roughly steady in this period, I guess one  would normally expect, with roughly constant monetary policy, the same projection for real  growth but increasing inflation  Something has got to be a balancing factor there  Are you  expecting higher velocity now than you were, for example, at the first of the year, or just how do  you get this result?     Well, net-net, I was guessing that what was happening was that implicitly  your velocity forecast has risen over this period, because normally you would expect a  combination of steady monetary growth and inflation to produce some reduction in real growth,  and yet you don’t have that  Am I interpreting your figures correctly?  You are expecting higher  velocity     I noticed that in the Bluebook  I thought it was awfully high     You have my vote, if you are going to vote today     I wanted to ask Mr Kichline a question, not on Bluebook per se, but on  related matters in financial markets  Just a comment  In the first place, I find it rather strange,  this dichotomy in the trend of business loans since the first of the year--New York versus the rest  of the country, among the big banks  Total business loans are up about 600 million in the  aggregate among the big banks, but New York’s gone down 2-1/2 billion, and the other banks  have gone up 31  I wonder if that’s got something to do with the recent downward adjustment  in the prime rate in New York  I am particularly interested in [whether] the staff has a view on  the dichotomy in the behavior of business loans--New York versus the other large banks  And  whether you had a view, secondly, on whether there might be a further narrowing in the present  differential between the prime rate and the commercial paper rate       Mr Chairman, in spite of some jawboning that we have gotten from  certain quarters, I feel personally pretty good about what we did in calming down the monetary  aggregates  I think that has worked quite well  We have reassured markets, as you’ve  mentioned and as Frank Morris alluded to earlier  In terms of the decline in long-term rates, and  in terms of the decline in the T-bill futures market, I would stay just about where we are and see  what happens for another month, when we get a peek at the August estimates     I’m basically fairly bullish on the economy  I recall somewhere here [at] the table last  month, maybe it was Mr Guffey--I know now to call this Guffey’s law--saying that the better  the economy, the more time we spend looking for problems  Despite the fact that you can  always find certain areas of risk, I think the economic outlook is quite bullish, and therefore I’d  be prepared to stay with alternative B on the federal funds rate  Like several others, including  Mr Mayo and Mr Black, I would prefer the alternative C specifications on the monetary  aggregates, and I would go for the aggregates directive  I’d be prepared to rise above principle  in this case  "
430,1977-07-19,"  Well, Mr Chairman, my question has already been anticipated by Bob  Mayo, but I would like to elaborate a bit and perhaps suggest something in terms of how we deal  with this matter in the future  Since we’re faced with a choice of alternatives A to D in terms of  the longer-term growth ranges of the aggregates today, I was wondering if the staff could, as a  regular part of this presentation in the future, and however imprecise these estimates might be,  give us some charts--as I seem to recall that we have seen earlier--on the implications of these  alternative growth paths, not just for the two variables that you mentioned, which would be real  growth and the deflator, but also on the unemployment rate  And perhaps not for just one or two  but perhaps even three years ahead, in view of the long lag that obviously exists, especially on  the implication for prices  Now perhaps you don’t think that’s useful anymore, perhaps there are  too many difficulties  But I’d like to get the staff views on why you have discontinued it--if my  recollections are correct that you used to do it     Well, thank you  I was sure that the staff had some views on this and was  undoubtedly doing some work on it  In our Bank, we happen to be convinced that, currently, M2  is a better predictor of the real economic variables than M1, and that was detailed in a paper  circulated recently  My own staff does do these calculations for one, two, three years ahead for  the alternative growth paths of the aggregates, and I for one would be very interested in seeing  how our work compares with that of the staff down here  Because that is really the key choice  we have to make today, I think, in terms of policy as among these alternatives paths  So if the  staff believes this is useful and feasible, Mr Chairman, I would like to suggest that it be a part of  the regular presentation so we can study their figures and look at them during the course of the  staff presentation prior to the time we get to the choice of the longer-term growth paths     What about--     7/19/77 - 14 -       Paul, I wasn’t suggesting every month  I was suggesting like once a  quarter, when we consider the longer-term ranges     Well, Chuck, I’ll say one more thing on this and then I will shut up  Does  that suggest to you, then, that this choice among alternatives A, B, C, and D, isn’t really a  meaningful choice?     Mr Chairman, I would thoroughly agree with the general proposition  about reducing M1, and for the reasons that you mentioned  I would also mention an additional  reason  About a year ago the staff did a very perceptive job in estimating the effect of financial  market innovations  As I remember, the latest figure shows something like a $17 billion shift of  funds into business savings deposits, NOW accounts  The staff, about a year ago, in the face of  great uncertainty, estimated about $13 billion; I think it was a darn good guess or forecast     It seems to me, as I look back on it, that we didn’t take that fully into account in our  appropriate growth ranges for M1 in view of these financial market innovations  So I think we  would have an especially good reason for lowering the M1 range at this time, and for the reason  I just mentioned     Therefore, where I would come out, joining the many others who have already spoken, is  an M1 range of 4 to 6 percent  And I would accept your prescription of leaving M2 and M3  unchanged at this time  But with a further proviso that, on the M2 range, we should really aim to  keep that growth within the range and preferably not above the midpoint, and avoid the  overshoots     I don’t want to prolong this, but I would like to give strong support to the  comment you made about looking at the short-run policy in light of the longer-run policy  I  think that’s very important, and we haven’t always done that as well as we might have  But  that’s something to strive for as we go     One quick question for Steve  Laying aside the possibility of nationwide  NOW accounts--which, of course, is quite uncertain as we sit here--but just considering NOW  accounts in the states where they are presently permitted and possible further shifts of business  deposits into savings--and alluding to my earlier compliments to you and Mr Paulus on the  guess you made a year ago of what would happen to M1 as a result--what are your feelings with  regard to the period ahead as to what further shifts there might be out of M1 into M2?     Fine, thank you     Right  The whole package     Mr Chairman     In the interest of brevity, Mr Chairman, I would support your proposal,  assuming the asymmetrical midpoint, in view of the sensitive conditions we have right now  "
458,1977-08-16,"  Well, by and large, as I reviewed the comments of the directors at our  various Branches, I get a mixed picture, which is not unusual  But I think it may be more mixed  now than I have seen in a while  My general impression is that business confidence is not quite  as good as the business statistics  There are elements of caution and concern that we’ve known  about for some time, of course, about the inflation outlook, about the full implications of the  energy program  And you get into companies that are in the public utility, the energy field, and  they are quite upset about developments and the uncertainties     The strengths that we see on the West Coast are in such fields as aerospace, housing  construction, retail sales  And, as an indirect indicator, loan demand in the so-called middle  market seems to be very strong across a broad front  All kinds of loans in the medium- and  small-sized banks  The weak parts of the economy in the West would be many segments of  agriculture because of our terrible drought conditions  Some slowing down in the pulp, paper,  and container business  As a leading indicator, according to one director, a number of lumber  mills on the West Coast are in trouble because of very high, rising labor costs  In fact, we got a  report last week that four lumber mills in Oregon are shutting down because of this  As I say,  it’s kind of a spotty picture, and a little more of a contrast type of situation than I would normally  expect at this stage of the business upswing     Well, they’ve had some whopping big wage settlements going along with  the rising prices     I gather that’s true     I think the Redbook comments would support that for our area     Out to June ’78, I think it’s almost 7 percent now      Mr Chairman, if I could piggyback on Bob’s comments here  I think he  has a very useful idea, as a matter of fact  He has referred to some of his experiences as budget  director  I recall a time when I was responsible for establishing and maintaining a tracking and  monitoring system for all kinds of loan and deposit components of a major commercial bank   And one way that the top management insisted that this be done is that--all these charts where  we had the seasonally adjusted data, we have right smack on that same chart the actuals  It was  of no consolation to know that deposits were rising at a seasonally adjusted basis but actually  going down--that was an actual decline in funds irrespective of what the seasonal trend showed,  and it meant a real need to raise money  That’s a key discipline--to match, just for example,  Bob, on the same chart, your unadjusted and seasonally adjusted figures  It gives it a hard-base  reality, and that’s one technique that we might use     Mr Chairman, just going back to the economy for a moment, my own  views correspond pretty closely to those of the staff  But I’m not really concerned about a  slowdown to, say, 5 percent real growth for the second half of the year following this  extraordinary rate of almost 7 percent for the first half because, I think all of us would probably  agree, that was unsustainable  Five percent is not at all bad when one looks at the long-term  historical record     I am concerned about the inflationary psychology in the market today  You made  reference to the Wall Street Journal today  I’d like to make reference to the lead article on the  front page as to the inflation outlook, particularly seen by various parts of the government  forecasting fraternity  The general thought is that we will have at least 6 percent, if not a bit  higher, going into 1978  I’d also like to allude to what I thought was a very important comment  that you made in your testimony on monetary policy, to the effect that, while we have reduced  growth ranges in the aggregates moderately, in a slow way, the actual growth rates have in fact  gone up somewhat  And unless we begin to take action here to play this game a different kind of  way, I expect we will see a continuation of that  My own feeling, as one objective we ought to  have, is to try to diminish inflationary expectations and also prevent long-term rates from rising  significantly, even if have to have a further increase in short-term rates     I’m still concerned with the longevity of the current expansion and the extent to which a  healthy pace of business capital spending; a healthy pace of capital spending by state and local     8/16/77 - 48 -           governments; and a good, ongoing rate of housing construction [will continue]--all of which  have somewhat tempered long-term rates  In the sense that we can keep long-term rates from  rising based on inflationary expectations, I think we will have made a real contribution to  stretching out this expansion     Getting down to what might be an appropriate thing to do at the moment, I think there’s  already been an upset, and I share the concern about overshooting our targets, whether it’s over  the past year or the present quarter  And as I look back on the record, I think we do have  something of a history of overshooting targets materially when interest rates are rising because  of a natural and understandable reluctance to push up the funds rate in the short run in small,  prompt bites to keep the aggregates within our ranges  And as a result, the aggregates move up  by an even bigger amount over a longer range     So in terms of the choices facing us today, I recommend starting off the aggregates with  the range in alternative C, although I would certainly accept your proposal [to] consider a lower  limit on M1 and M2 than [is in] alternative C  As far as the federal funds rate is concerned, I  would not go as far as the alternative [C] proposal, which was 6-1/4 to 6-3/4, but I would come  out, I think, for the proposed range of 5-3/4 to 6-3/4, centered on 6-1/4, not with a thought that  we move up there immediately, but move up there gradually until there is solid evidence that we  in fact are getting these aggregates under control  The danger continues to be an outcome which  would not offset the surges in April and again in July and thus end up for a longer period outside  of our ranges both on M1 and M2, which we have been over the past year and the past quarter     With regard to the discount rate, I am on the side of those that think a good solid case can  be made for action, and I would prefer to see it done sooner rather than later, like this coming  Thursday--that’s when I would have to make recommendations on [it]  I think closing the gap  partway between the funds rate and discount rate would certainly be an appropriate signal to the  market that we are going to reinforce the actions we’ve taken in the open market with actions at  the discount window to give some public signal of our attempt to keep the aggregates in the  target ranges--not overshooting     I think the timing is quite crucial now because we are in a little interlude here when we just  had a settlement date yesterday, as I understand it, for the recent Treasury financing, and it won’t  be too long in the future before we get another Treasury financing  So this would be a good time  to move  As to whether it ought to be 1/4 or 1/2 [point], I’m still kind of debating that point, but  I could go with either one     Ball is in their court?  "
485,1977-09-20,"  Jim, have you assumed a shortfall in the expenditures as estimated by the  Administration in the July review?  If I’ve interpreted the Greenbook correctly, you have an  estimate of a shortfall, and I think it’s around $10 billion  Is that about right?     Right     I would like to make a quick comment on this, Mr Chairman  As my staff  [members] looked into the causes and the nature of these so-called shortfalls, [they] found out  something that kind of surprised me  There have seldom, if ever, been shortfalls in expenditures  if you start with the--say, in this case, the July--Mid-Session Review  The well-advertised  shortfalls have come about during the course of the fiscal year; the Administration continues to  up its forecast of what it’s going to spend  So for that reason, we have some doubts as to  whether there ought to be an allowance for a shortfall based on the Administration’s July Mid- Session Review  In other words, we would assume that, in our particular way of looking at  things, government expenditures in fiscal ’78 might be as much as $10 billion higher than you’ve  allowed, although we haven’t taken into account this interest payment phenomenon     These farmers that have become millionaires, I might hasten to add, it’s on  a before-tax basis  In Idaho, where my wife happens to have some relatives on a farming  business, they are very concerned about how they are going to pass on their farm to the children  after the death taxes  It appears they may have to liquidate a part of the landholding just to raise  the cash to pay the taxes     I have several comments and several questions, Mr Chairman  I think  your point on real final sales being steadier than the GNP quarterly changes is a very good one  I  draw one additional conclusion from that analysis, and that’s that the trend of real final sales  may in fact be a better guide to policy than the quarterly changes in GNP as a whole as long as  we have these mini inventory cycles  And I conclude that we are experiencing another one this  year quite similar to the one we had last year--a very strong first half and then a weaker second  half largely because of inventories     Exactly     As far as the outlook is concerned, our staff in San Francisco has a very  similar view to that of the Board staff through, say, to the middle of ’78, but as Frank Morris  commented, we are somewhat less optimistic about the second half of ’78 for much the same  reasons that he cited--less optimistic about the strength of consumer spending and inventories in  the second half  Having said that, I don’t place an awful lot of faith in the accuracy of  projections when we get into the second half of next year     But I do want to make one comment generally in respect to the differences that may occur  within the [Federal Reserve] System, of the [Federal Reserve] Board versus the [Federal  Reserve] Banks in their forecasts  For some months, I have been noticing [among] our board of  directors on the West Coast a phenomenon that I’m not sure how to explain  It’s clear that, by  and large, our business directors are showing less confidence than the business statistics would  warrant  And whether it’s because of the factors cited by Mr Winn or what, I’m not sure--that  is, the concern over the energy program, tax proposals, and all that sort of thing     Whatever the cause, I think there’s another element that’s not yet been commented on but  may be worth a question and a comment by Mr Kichline and his staff  I assume that you  monitor the forecasts of the leading private economists and their firms  Fairly recently I have  noticed what is perhaps an unusual divergence of views among the private forecasters’ fraternity  versus the government, generally including the Federal Reserve  There are some outfits--not that  I place any credence, particularly, in their views--such as Chase Econometrics or what have  you--they are viewing a real stagnation if not outright recession for 1978  And I suspect that to  some extent this is having an influence on the thinking of leading businessmen     This came to my attention most recently just last week, when, in San Francisco, there was  the quadrennial meeting of the International Industrial Conference, with CEOs present of many  leading US companies--indeed, leading companies around the world  And the US heads of  companies were considerably less optimistic in terms of the expected pace in the US economy  than our staff in the System, and the chief economist for the Conference Board was considerably  more pessimistic, I might add, than our staff  And I was wondering, Jim, if you pursue this  matter to the point of identifying the specific factors that lead to this divergence of views   Because whether we like it or not, the private forecasting fraternity does have some influence on  the thinking of the heads of these companies, and hence on, oh, their general state of confidence  or lack thereof     That’s a good point, Paul  I think the commercial bank economists are  generally more optimistic than the economists working for industrial firms     Well, Mr Chairman, as I listen to this discussion, it seems to me that one  of the obligations that I guess we have as a Committee is to make some judgments about the  business outlook  It’s true that the headlines quite recently have featured a number of pieces of  bad news  But it also occurred to me--as I listen to the discussion, I share the consensus view  that we do expect a continuation of a fairly good rate of growth, say, around 4 percent, which  looks pretty respectable in terms of our long-term capacity to grow and our own long-term  history  So in that sense, I wouldn’t shrink from making policy news which we decide ought to  be made in any event, apart from what might be considered adverse short-term public relations  aspects in the sense of getting the public to understand what we are all about     Reflecting back on your last two appearances before the [congressional] banking  committees, putting the problems of monetary policy in the broader prospective; and in view of  your calling attention to the fact that, even though we gradually inched down the growth ranges,  it would take some 10 years to get to a point really consistent with price stability--and in the  meantime we’ve had an actual increase in the rate of growth of the aggregates; in that kind of  perspective, I am concerned along the lines that have been expressed by a number of my  colleagues so far, that we need to take modest further action       9/20/77 - 49 -   We all know the growth rate over the past year--M1 over 7 percent, M2 almost 11  And as  I look at the Board staff’s own projections as of September 8, going out to October 5, and  measure those against our own current 12-month targets, it is quite clear that M1 is well above  the upper end of our 12-month range by $2 billion to $3 billion  And it is very clear that when  we move into the next quarter, we’ll have an upward base drift of significant amounts, maybe $3  billion  As you look at the Board staff’s projections for M2, again through October 5, it’s clear  that M2 will continue very near the upper end of that 12-month range, so we’re going to have an  upward base drift of M2 as well     Now I don’t place any magic significance to our ranges for 12 months ahead; they are very  carefully thought about  But I do accept them as provisional targets that we ought to shoot at,  [unintelligible] unless we’ve darn good reason to depart from them  And I haven’t yet heard  such reasons  And furthermore, as I study the Bluebook, especially on page 6--what we would  have to do going into the second half of 1978 in order to achieve the present 12-month  ranges--I’m extremely skeptical that this Committee could or would crank down the growth rates  of either one, to about 26 percent for M1, or 62 percent for M2     Well, having said all of that, I think it gives strong support to the ranges that you propose  for M1 and M2, say 3 to 7 and 4 to 8  I’m concerned not what the lower end of our range is, but  the upper end  Because if we go up to what was proposed in some of the alternatives in the  Bluebook as to the high end of the range, whether M1 or M2, we continue to move further away  from what our 12-month targets are rather than taking modest steps to bring the overshoots back  in the range  I think the only point on which I differ a bit from you, Mr Chairman, is on the  federal funds range  I would prefer, as several members have spoken up here so far--Messrs  Mayo and Morris, as I recall--to go with deliberate speed toward a 6-3/8 midpoint within a range  of 6 to 6-3/4 based on the analysis that I have already made  "
511,1977-10-17,"  Mr Chairman, I wonder if I could break in here and pursue the same point  that Frank has been talking about, because it’s a question I wanted to raise myself  Last week, I  happened to be up in Seattle on business; I asked all the banks that I visited whether they’d seen  any signs as yet of savings flows decreasing, and the answer was almost entirely no  In fact, all  the banks up there are paying 4-1/2 percent on passbook except one bank that’s paying only 4   And strangely enough, all of the banks have a very relaxed view about their savings picture at  the moment, at least for the immediate period ahead, because they are convinced that if there  were interest-sensitive money in their passbook accounts, [it] long ago would have left     That is to say that savings and loans, and especially a very large mutual savings bank in  the State of Washington, have been aggressive over the years in going after savings accounts  So  the banks, at least in the Seattle area where I had a chance to quiz them, were not worried  I did  get a chance to talk to the head of the Federal Home Loan Bank in Seattle at a luncheon meeting  that we put on, and he reported to me in just general terms that they were beginning to see some  slowdowns now, some observable ones, in the S&Ls in his particular district     In terms of the question Frank asked, that’s a very difficult one  I have asked my own staff  to do some work on what the experience was on the West Coast in the last crunch  Which, of  course, may or may not be applicable at all to 1978, as we all recognize, studying the experience  in the West Coast, we do have some giant S&Ls that do go after very interest-sensitive money  from all around the country--as you know, a number of multibillion dollar S&Ls in California,  for example  The past experience would indicate, for what it’s worth, that a three-month  Treasury bill rate of 150 to 200 basis points over the S&L passbook rate appears to be a zone or  a trigger point that very sharply reduces the inflow of savings to the S&Ls  If that experience  were to prevail in the future--it may not--that would indicate a T-bill rate of somewhere between  6-3/4 and 7-1/4 percent as a zone where they really begin to feel something  Now, offsetting  that, of course, is the fact that they’ve got a somewhat longer average structure of maturities than  they did three or four years ago     But nevertheless, all things considered, I would simply want to observe that our own staff,  for example, is a little less optimistic than the Board’s staff on housing starts  We’re  looking--not that our forecasts are any better than yours--at about 18 million units in ’78 versus  19 this year  Your forecast is 197 this year and totaling up next year to 214  I did examine a  very recent set of forecasts among leading private forecasters published in Euromoney for the  last month--oh, 30 or so [forecasters]--and I think the average of those came out to about 183  million units in 1978  In general, I would gather that the private sector of forecasters are less  optimistic than you are here at the Board on this matter of what the level of interest rates may do  to savings and also to housing starts     10/17-18/77 - 21 -           Well, our staff forecast is very close to that of the Board in broad terms up  through about the middle of next year  We’re considerably less optimistic for the second half of  the year  And largely because of the reason I alluded to earlier, we expect a downturn in housing  to occur, principally in the single family--[unintelligible] apart by what will go on in the  multifamily  But nevertheless the total picture on housing is likely to feed back on purchases on  household durables and also on inventories, and that’s why our staff has, for the second half of  next year, a real GNP increase averaging less than 3 percent  I admit that the farther you get out  of this forecast horizon, the greater becomes the margin of error, but that’s just the way we  happened to come out     Mr Chairman, I was just wondering if Peter or perhaps later Steve might  be covering this, as to whether the staff has any insight on that very large surge of the aggregates  for the past period  What I’m getting at is, there seems to be a suspiciously strange pattern  developing on quarterly dates with the big surge in April, July, and October, and this suggests all  sorts of statistical problems, including the seasonals  Is this an appropriate time to raise that  question?     I’m glad to hear you’re as frustrated as I am in terms of explaining it  I’m  not really glad; I wish you had an explanation, which I don’t     Mr Chairman, as a lot of others around the table, I have found your 12  points very persuasive, especially with regard to the real economy being our ultimate goal and  also how we have to maintain credibility with the public  And I think you have been wise in  your testimony to follow the strategy of gradually lowering the growth ranges, indicating that  that is our long-term game plan to a point that is consistent with economic stability  As we’ve  all noticed, these ranges that we have, the 12-month ranges, are getting more attention now, and  especially when we overshoot them, as we’ve been doing recently--as we’ve seen in the recent  criticism coming out of two sources in the House Banking Committee, I guess it was Mr Reuss  and Mr Mitchell, [and it was] especially ironic that on the other side of the coin the Joint  Economic Committee has criticized us in effect for starving the economy for money     One of those two schools of thought has obviously got to be wrong  Or maybe both  But  in terms of my own view, I am leaning increasingly toward the belief that there is little if any  real tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, based on some work that has been done by  various sources, including our own staff  But any stimulus one gets from the supply side of the  economy, in view of expectations of inflation, gets quickly undone by reactions on the demand  side, with consumers saving more as a percent of their income when unanticipated inflation  occurs, spending relatively less, and that feeding back on orders and production and business  incentives to spend on plant and equipment     So all things considered, in view of the significant overshoots that have already occurred,  say, in the third quarter, or even for the past year, [and] that our new ranges will be occurring  from a higher base for both M1 and M2, I would come out net net for the specifications of  alternative B  But as in the case of Mr Kimbrel, I think I’d go a little step further as a preference  to lower the upper end of the M1 range to 6 percent instead of the present 6-1/2     Just a question to Chuck  One of the things that was very revealing about  your report, and I’m afraid too many of us have overlooked, is that when we give this equal  weight to M1 and M2, that in effect M1 really accounts for 70 percent of the total  I haven’t had  a chance, Chuck, to do the arithmetic, but maybe your [sub]committee can do this for us in one  of the options to consider  What sort of weighting would we have to give to M1 and M2 so that     10/17-18/77 - 56 -         in reality the time deposit portion of M2 was given equal weight with the demand deposit  portion?       Well, I’m not sure either, but if we were to go that direction, what we  would have to do is to give M2 2/3 weight, you see     Okay     Mr Chairman, in view of our deliberations today on the long-term ranges,  and reflecting back over the past couple of years on why we have overshot those ranges, and in  view of my own judgment that, probably as a net result we have provided too much monetary  stimulus, I am concerned about continuing to exceed in the future the 12-month ranges that were  agreed on today, because I fear that the greatest threat to longevity in the economy would be a  resurgence of inflationary expectations that would drive long-term interest rates up, which I  think would be far more serious than what has occurred in the short-term interest rate area in the  last several months  I say that because of what I view to be the greater sensitivity of housing  expenditures, and to some extent plant and equipment expenditures, if inflationary expectations  should push up long-term rates significantly     10/17-18/77 - 62 -         And I have been concerned for some time, and I make this point from time to time--the  Committee doesn’t seem to have any systematic way of getting from here to there in terms of the  2-month range versus the 12-month range  And that’s why I guess I’m unhappy about all of the  upper limits specified in alternatives A, B, and C with regard to the present time because, [in] all  of them, the upper limits would go beyond our 12-month ranges  I’ll grant that [in] any 2-month  period there can be fluctuations up and down that are more or less erratic and unpredictable, but  when we get into a cumulative pattern of exceeding the upper end of our long-term ranges, we  get into, after the fact, more monetary stimulus than some of us think is healthy from the  standpoint of preventing a resurgence of inflation     So I would make a plea for lowering the upper end of the ranges of both M1 and M2,  especially on M1, to make sure that we don’t get into a pattern within successive two-month  periods of overshooting what we had agreed on would be appropriate long-term ranges, given  the need of the real economy  And for that reason--and I think the fundamental issue is to what  extent the Committee is prepared to see some further inching up of short-term rates to head off  that future possible overshoot--I would prefer to see an upper limit on M1 and M2 of, say, 6-1/2  and 9, respectively, and a federal funds rate of 6-1/2 to 7  "
538,1977-11-15,"  Chuck, wouldn’t the market, wouldn’t observers generally very quickly  note the fact that we had changed the content of the directive, and [so] we might well be subject  to an accusation of deviousness--we have changed our procedures so as not to disclose as much  as we had probably decided internally  I can see a bad reaction to that     Mr Chairman, I think all the points that I had in mind have already been  said  I fully support using all avenues of appeal and certainly urge the [Sub]committee on the  Directive to put this out on the front burner, hoping we can have a full-scale discussion of it,  preceded by some staff papers, for our December meeting     Mr Chairman, reflecting on the staff views on the outlook, we continue to  be in general agreement, at least through the first half of next year, although a little dubious  about whether we’ll see as much strength in the second half of ’78     But laying that aside, as I have thought about what the key weak spots in the economy  are-- and we could tick off a long list--whether it’s the steel industry or agriculture or less  ebullient growth in capital spending than we would like to see, or whether it’s the state of  business confidence, it seems increasingly clear that none of these would really be fundamentally  helped by an easing in monetary policy  And your speech in Spokane is an excellent illustration  of that, showing the difficulties  As a matter of fact, an easing that we might engage in right  now, in view of these weak spots, might in fact have a counterproductive effect in aggravating  the difficulties if any easing were to generate a rise in inflationary expectations that drove up  long-term interest rates     It seems to me we have been especially fortunate in that [the] approximately 200 basis  point rise in short-term interest rates since spring has not carried through [to] the long-term rates   And if the long-term rates begin to rise, then I would really be concerned, in view of the impact  on areas of the economy we know are especially sensitive to that, whether it be housing or  whether it be capital spending by business  On the other hand, there seems to be no particular  reason to tighten right now  But it seems to me that, all things considered, we’re at a stage of     11/15/77 - 26 -         this mature expansion where the problems that many of us are concerned about, which have been  widely advertised, don’t particularly lend themselves to treatment by monetary policy     Steve, as I am sure is the case with you, one of the most frequent questions  that comes to me from directors and other interested parties is, what insights do we have in this  peculiar behavior of M1 during this year, with the surges on a quarterly basis not being offset by  subsequent declines  I know it’s a terribly difficult question  I am not really hopeful that you’ll  have an answer, but if you do, I hope you’ll share it with us     Mr Chairman, I liked your modification to the ranges of both M1 and M2,  1 to 6 and 4 to 8  Because, as I look at the Board staff’s projections of both M1 and M2 and then  average those out over the usual 13-week moving average, as I’m in favor of, it’s evident that, if  those forecasts should come true, we’ll be above the range on M1 and only slightly below the  upper end of the range on M2  For that reason, while I agree with the federal funds range  staying the same as it is, I think we may continue to be faced in terms of average growth of the  aggregates with being near the upper end or over the upper end of our 12-month growth ranges  "
563,1977-12-19,"  Mr Chairman?     I had hoped that we wouldn’t keep this GAO bill alive because we were  using it as a legislative vehicle to help solve the Merrill decision  After my session with you and  subsequently with all of the Presidents, the tone that we tried to communicate to our directors on  an active campaign is that [it’s] possible to get the Fed exempted entirely from the GAO bill   And we kind of meet ourselves coming around the barn, I’m afraid, if we are going to use the  same bill for amendment purposes to solve another problem  I’m afraid we are going to get our  goals kind of mixed up here  That bothers me a little     Okay      Mr Chairman, I was impressed by the thoroughness of the [Partee  sub]committee’s search for alternative solutions to the Merrill problem, and if the case goes  against us, which we hope it won’t, I think we are all going to learn a great deal  And I doubt if  we are going to find another final answer to all these problems as we sit here today  But there  are two things about this report which otherwise I find very thorough and convincing  I do have  doubts about one of them that already have been expressed, and I won’t go into any detail on  that  I would simply join those, like Governor Coldwell and President Morris, who would like to  retain the option of a wider federal funds range as we gain experience with market reactions, if  we are forced to release our directive immediately  My concern is, in a nutshell, that the narrow  range, a 1/2 point range [achieves] a minimized market reaction or announcement effect at that  moment, but the announcement effects will be magnified at a later time when we do have to  change the range     But my more broad point has to do with a statement on page 2 of the subcommittee report- -I shall just quote [from my] recollection, it’s in the middle paragraph  It says, “we don’t feel  that the court order itself should be taken as reason for adopting a basically new approach to  operations unless such an approach has clear economic advantage  Accordingly, the  subcommittee does not believe it desirable at this point to consider such alternatives as shifting  to a reserve target, a course which the FOMC has debated and experimented with and decided  against in recent years”       12/19-20/77 - 24 -         Well, I don’t have too much trouble with that phrase as long as that sentence says desirable  “at this point” to reconsider  But given the whole history of the [Sub]committee on the  Directive, and given the fact that committee number one [is] followed by committee number two,  and that the players change and so do the recommendations, I would like to just go back and  indicate briefly a few of the key points in here  According to my quick look at the history of  committee number one, when we presented stage 1 of our report and found out that this was  clear back to--     No, this is the Holland committee--was Holland     Committee number one of my experience, Chuck  That really was  committee number three, and it was Holland, Morris, Wallich, and Balles, I guess     Dane, for awhile; Wallich  Okay, there was a time when that committee, I  believe, was unanimous in the spring of 1975 in recommending two things  getting rid of RPs  [repurchase agreements] and proposing nonborrowed reserves  Well, when it finally came full  circle and we decided to conduct an experiment, I was very satisfied with the nature of that  experiment  I thought it was inconclusive  We discussed it at some length in the final session, I  think, in December 1976     What I call committee number one, when I was still on it, was inconclusive in a sense that  the work of the staff indicated that we’ve typically been dealing with that multiplier over a two- month span, [and it] was just too uncertain and you wouldn’t be really any further ahead with  using nonborrowed reserves  At that time I made a suggestion, and I still think it has merit, that  we ought to perhaps lengthen the period over which we try to achieve certain objectives  So, say  a three-month period, and as I remember, Steve indicated the multiplier becomes a lot more  predictable if you, in fact, move to a three-month span That is one of the areas in my  consideration, Chuck, that needs and desires some further exploration     To kind of wind this up, I guess what I’m really trying to say is, when the old committee-- one or three, as it may have been--that I served on made its final report, and this was in  December of last year, I made the point, expressing my own personal views--and I think this is  clearly of a majority view around the table as a whole--that the Committee should retain a  balance between interest rate stability and control of the aggregates; that there is a middle ground  we should achieve  But my own judgments were that the FOMC leaned too far toward the  interest rate stability goal given the experience up to the time  I formed that view, and that was  one of the things that had caused us to get into base drift and considerable overshoots as well as  undershoots from time to time     And I still feel that way today, that one of the inhibitions in achieving this middle ground  has been excessive concentration, perhaps, with too narrow a federal funds constraint and delays     12/19-20/77 - 25 -         in moving, even though, as you well pointed out, we have the long distance  There have been  times when we’ve moved too slowly, in my judgment, in adjusting the federal funds rate and  thereby leading to these overshoots of indexes     Well, just as a concluding point, I would urge that the subcommittee not close the door on  fully reexamining the possible advantages of a reserve target in a new climate that might be  created if we lose this Merrill case  One of the things, getting away from all the fine points and  technicalities, that have bothered me for several years and bother me even more today is the  perception among the general public, and especially the perception of the Congress, that the Fed  can and does control rates  Now, as we know, we can do that only in the most short-run sense  Inflationary expectations and demands for credit are, of course, the other big elements     And I feel we are just lending credence to that perception of our ability to control rates by  not uncoupling our actions [from interest rate movements], as I think one could do, by using a  nonborrowed reserve target  There was a staff paper that came out of the New York Bank a  month or so ago, from Dick Davis, that I found quite convincing on this subject  If we really  want to get the market and the Congress and others educated to the fact that, longer run, we can’t  control interest rates in the sense that they perceive it, there would be real advantages to moving  to a reserve target, even though I would personally hope that we always have a federal funds  constraint to go along with that      Could be  It’s a judgment, and my judgment is the other way     You are not exploring depth, breadth, and resiliency       Mr Chairman, just to remind the Governors, some of whom know this,  others may have forgotten it, the Presidents’ Conference, with the chairmanship of President  Winn, is scheduled to meet this afternoon and tomorrow morning, and I suspect that from our  standpoint, if we are to try to keep on schedule--at least I can speak for myself--I don’t think the  decision is very difficult  I hope we can finish it by 1 o’clock       I’ll buy that     Mr Chairman, for reasons you’ve set forth and which others have  repeated, I think your specifications are good  If anything, I would lean a little more toward the  view that Mr Eastburn expressed, but I could accept either one  It seems to me that this is a  pretty good time for us to be holding steady, and because of the great uncertainties over this  year-end period, it would probably be wise to adopt the money market directive     That has a great deal of merit, and I hope that you will pursue that signal     Mr Chairman, just one more quick question for Tom, If I may  I’m not  quite sure how we came out yesterday, as to whether today’s directive will or might have to be  published immediately if we lose the Supreme Court appeal     Okay, thank you  "
604,1978-01-17,"  Mr Chairman, I’d like to come back to the four essential fundamental   corrective measures that you talked about  I’m inclined to guess that unless we really succeed on  the second of the two that you mentioned--a successful anti-inflation program by the US  government--the other three might not work  That is to say that as long as there are differential  rates of inflation of considerable magnitude between here and other countries, it’s going to be  awfully difficult to get the kind of capital inflow that will offset our trade deficit  And in view of  that tentative conviction that I have, I wonder if you could hold forth a bit more on what you had in  mind in terms of getting a successful anti-inflation program of the US government, which I think  was your phrase       Well, I would just like to make a few comments, Mr Chairman, about the   Board’s staff forecast, which I find a very plausible one  It is somewhat more optimistic with  regard to the second half of this year and going into ’79 than that held by my own staff and in that  regard I share some of the views previously expressed by Governor Coldwell and I think by  President Eastburn  Just a word as to why we are somewhat less optimistic--to the extent of  expecting a real growth rate possibly under 3 percent by the second half of the year  It’s simply a  different view on how much effect the fiscal stimulus will have on consumer spending  That seems  to be the biggest part of the whole difference  A tax cut of around $17 billion is really not all that  big, even when contrasted with the $11 billion tax cut of 1964-65, which at that time amounted to  2-1/2 percent of disposable income  The currently proposed cut will amount to about 1 percent or  less of disposable income even before the social security tax increase, which would reduce it by  about one-third  So in short, our staff is not all that optimistic about getting as much bang-- consumer spending principally--as in the view held by the Board’s staff  Hence, we would be a  little less optimistic about the second half of the year and the early part of ’79       Mr Chairman, I too share your views about not letting interest rates drift   down at this time in view of the international situation  I also share Paul Volcker’s view that the  uptick that we’ve had may not have been inappropriate in view of previous overshoots  Based on  the discussion of the economy this morning and as we see the outlook, the specifications of  alternative B are generally satisfactory in terms of a federal funds range, with the assumption that  we would stay in the near term at 6-3/4 percent and not go up unless there’s a pretty good reason in  terms of threatening overshoots  Just to complete the picture, I would join those who view the  6-point spread as being too wide on M1 and I would like to see it come down perhaps to a 2 to 7  percent range, although I could live with the 5 to 9 percent on M2  And all things considered, I  prefer the monetary aggregates directive this time    "
631,1978-02-28,"  Just a comment, Mr Chairman  I guess it=s from the Board=s annual report   that the press picks up this news--that it looked like a $100 million loss last year in foreign  exchange operations  When I had my staff look into this, it turns out that much of that goes back to  the middle of 1971 or whatever, but we=re still amortizing some of the losses from that point in the  foreign exchange operations  I=m informed by my staff--and I checked here [at the Board]--that  there=s actually been a small profit in each of the last several years  The only reason I make this  comment is that it might be a little misleading the way the thing is reported  Whatever the basic  source of the information is, it leads to some misunderstanding among the public and the press  I  don=t know what if anything can be done about that, but I simply raise it as something that might be  looked into a bit       Right      Good point  It simply came to my attention because Table II of Bill   Wallace=s report had a line showing losses from foreign exchange in 1978, and I think the figure  was close to $100 million       Could you explain, Mr Chairman, for my benefit at least, what bridging   actions are?       Turning back to the general business outlook, Mr Chairman, I can be fairly   brief  Messrs Morris and Coldwell have pretty well expressed the view that we have  Even with  this fairly recent somewhat lower [projection] the Board=s staff now sees, we still remain a little       2/28/78           29  less optimistic about the second half of the year in particular, especially because we see a less  ebullient picture in autos and housing, even [relative to] the revised forecast that Mr Kichline  talked about  In autos, I think he said [the forecast was revised] down 150,000 to 105 million or  thereabouts [unintelligible] several months, something no better than 104 million of auto sales  On  housing starts, we=re still somewhat lower than the Board=s staff forecast  I think the differences  come up principally in the second half of the year  We would expect real GNP growth fourth- quarter-to-fourth-quarter of 4 percent, close to what Mr Morris talked about, which implies in the  second half of the year a real growth rate of less than 4 percent      I have been interested in some research that our people have been doing lately on what   constitutes the full employment unemployment rate  We know the CEA has come out with about  49 percent and [in light of] some of the work we=ve been doing reexamining some of those  assumptions, we would think that the figure is somewhat higher--perhaps 5-1/2 to 6 percent or  perhaps above 6 percent  Having seen a 10 percent increase in employment since the start of this  expansion, and with about 58 percent of the working age population now at work, it seems to us  that there=s a considerably large excess in the labor markets of usable types of  labor skills in the  economy  I don=t know whether “usable labor” is a viable term, but you get constraints on capacity  showing up in a number of lines now, at least in the West; certainly the aluminum industry is one  of those  I think this provides a real constraint on [the economy’s] ability to grow at somewhat  above normal rates than would have [been the case] in the past few years  In short, several  members around the table have mentioned that we probably will be facing a dilemma that may  show up especially in the second half of the year, with the economy going to shambles and signs of  a marked slowing in real growth and an acceleration of inflation on the other hand  That’s a  first-class dilemma for monetary policy       Well, I share the view expressed by some others already that the  announcement effects of these ranges are very, very considerable  And with inflationary concerns  in the air both at home and abroad, not to reduce the ranges--I think we all agree--would have some  very adverse effect on inflation expectations   Now, having said that, I think I=d agree with Mr  Kimbrel=s remark a little while ago that, at this point, it may be more important to hit the ranges  than to reduce them, in order to reestablish our credibility     In terms of the specific numbers, I would agree with your proposal, Mr Chairman, to leave   M1 where it is  I agree that M3 should be cut  I guess I would join the so-called prudent crowd  and cut only 1/2 point from both the lower and the upper limits  On the M2 range, I would go one  step beyond what you are proposing and shave that down by 1/2 point to a 6-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent  range  We=ve all got our variations on the same general theme here of getting some kind of  reduction and maintaining our credibility  We haven=t failed to shave the range on at least one of  the three Ms, I don’t think, every quarter since we first started  But one question I=m a little  uncertain about is what will happen if the [proposal to allow] automatic transfers from savings to  checking is implemented       We=ll have to address that at the time?  Is that your point?      Well, I just assumed that at that point we might have to readjust our view of   what=s feasible in terms of the ranges      Mr Chairman, I can=t help observing that occasional backsliding is perhaps   understandable, but to backslide ten years is a little far back to go      Governor Partee is playing out one scenario in which you may get a very   low growth in M1 in March if the coal strike isn=t settled  But I=d point out another possible  scenario  As I look at page 4 of the Bluebook and see the way money growth--whether it=s  nonborrowed reserves, total reserves, or the monetary base--has been accelerating, I can=t help but  feel, Steve, that sooner or later that=s going to catch up with us  Therefore, I share the view of some  others, including Governor Coldwell and I=ve forgotten who else, who said they felt there was a  good chance of March M1 coming in at higher than the projected 7 percent  It=s going to be quite  interesting to see, when we get to next month=s meeting, how those figures have been revised  But,  having said that, I still think there=s a great deal of logic in holding steady as we are, and for  reasons that have been set forth in detail, I would go with alternative B for this 3-week period with  a money market directive    "
669,1978-03-21,"  Mr Chairman, since we are on this matter of the foreign currency bond,   where does the Treasury now stand on that?      They’re on our books      I’d like to ask Henry what [his subcommittee] had in mind in the first   sentence of this paragraph on the scale of intervention, where it says “in the absence of more  fundamental policy by the United States”  Could you give us an illustration of what you had in  mind there?       Obviously, you can do the latter a lot quicker than the former      Well, if I can just pick up on Paul’s point, I think there is an answer  If we   go on the Hill vis-à-vis a Humphrey-Hawkins bill [that says] full employment is 4 percent  unemployment, there’s considerable evidence in my view at least--and Dave alluded to this earlier- -that inflation does cause recession, and recession causes high unemployment  Therefore, if you  want to avoid high unemployment, you avoid high inflation  High inflation, high interest rates, and  high unemployment go together and vice versa  The latest example of that surely has to be the  1974 experience  I have listened with great interest to what might be done across a broad front  here, not only on the foreign exchange value of the dollar but with respect to inflation  And when I  hear phrases like one of the fundamental policies that we need is an effective US government  anti-inflation program and consider what that might involve and what the prospects of getting it  are, I must say it’s a bit discouraging  It does some good, I’m sure, in some limited sense but  perhaps no more than a band-aid sense to have moral suasion and voluntary actions to slow down  price increases and wage increases  But when everything else is said and done, the most effective  thing the federal government could do, in my view, on the inflation front, is a counter-cyclical  fiscal policy  Yet the chances of getting that seem to me darn slim, in view of the size of the  budget deficits that are pretty much set in cement now  They can be changed of course to some  extent  But the message that comes through, much as I hate to say it--I have to side with Phil  Coldwell and maybe go one step beyond him--is in effect that if an anti-inflation policy in the  United States is going to start, it’s going to have to start around this table        Well, I share the view that all the specifications of the aggregates are too   high  In fact, by coincidence, I had put down the same numbers as Willis Winn  I’ll join him in  suggesting M1 in a 2 to 7 percent range and M2 in a 5 to 9 percent range  And for reasons that  have been set forth in detail, and that I agree with in view of accelerating inflation, I would make  the federal funds range 6-3/4 to 7-1/4    "
733,1978-05-16,"  Yes sir, I have two quick ones here--one a question and one a comment  The  question  Jim, you stated that you marked down your housing forecast somewhat because the  recent change in the Q ceiling wasn’t as big as you had assumed earlier, which I think was 50 basis  points across the board and in all the categories       All except passbooks  Why is it that you think the recent changes will not be  as effective in keeping savings in the thrift institutions and the banks as what would have occurred  under your assumption?       I appreciate the difficulty, Ed, of making that forecast here  All I can say is  that in sounding out the banks in our area, we expect a lot of action in the 6-month money market  certificate  The other thing, Mr Chairman, just quickly, is that Frank raised an interesting question,  I thought a crucial question, about what sort of non-inflationary rate of unemployment we can get  down to  There is another question that Willis touched on and I’d like to piggy back on it, and  that’s  How close are we to [a level] of capacity use that may itself generate inflationary pressures?  Some of the work done by our staff quite recently indicates--contrary to the usual view that we  don’t get inflationary pressures until we get up to about 87 percent capacity utilization--that  inflationary [pressures] begin at somewhere between 81 and 85 percent  A more refined analysis of  that [relationship] leads them to that conclusion  I was wondering if your staff here, Jim, has done  any work on that, which I consider an equally important area  And I think you touched on this, Mr  Chairman, in your testimony--[saying] that capacity is one thing but the cost of the capacity is  another       We’re going to send it out to everybody around the table, as a matter of fact,  for information and possible comments if they have any       Mr Chairman, our staff forecast is broadly consistent with that of the Board  staff going, say, to about the third quarter of the year  But from about the fourth quarter on and  running into early ’79, we are not as optimistic and for several reasons  One is the capacity  bottleneck factor that I have already mentioned  We think we are already there, in fact, in terms of  where it can go without generating further inflationary pressures  Based on some work we  published several months ago, we think we are already there in terms of how low we can get the  unemployment rate without generating some inflationary pressures  Our staff analysis, if I recall  the figures right, suggested that a range of between 56 and 63 percent is the range below which  you’d get considerable inflationary pressures  In short, translating this into GNP components, by  the fourth quarter and first and second quarters of ’79 we just see less strength in the economy than  the Board staff does  I detailed some of these figures in March, so I won’t repeat them again, but  it’s principally in consumption expenditures, especially in housing and other durables, and  consequently in business inventories  But I would also add what I think I heard Phil saying--that  it’s not all that bad  I think we’ve probably got to slow down based on the real growth capacity of     5/16/78              16  the economy [to avoid] generating a lot of inflationary pressures after a surge of activity for three  years now that very clearly has been above the long-term trend growth rate in the United States       All things considered, I think I would join those [who would] snug up a bit,  doing it very cautiously and for not the same reason that you mentioned  Looking down the road a  bit I am quite concerned about the further inflation risks from the cost-push side  I’m concerned  about the rejection [by] the AFL-CIO of the President’s suggested guidelines for wage behavior   I’m concerned about the implications for inflation [given] the extent to which I think we are  already at a practical full employment point  I’m concerned about the inflation risks coming from  what I think are capacity restraints in industry; for all intents and purposes we’re at a point where  any further use of capacity will build in inflationary pressures      I think that the Administration has come quite a distance, [with] prodding from you possibly   The President’s inflation message I might add was received with tremendous lack of enthusiasm in  the four Far East countries I was visiting in April  They looked [at it as] a lot of rhetoric with no  real cutting edge  About the only thing that helped the psychology in terms of the dollar were  actions that the System took and that the Treasury took in announcing gold sales  I’m hoping that  we’ll get some beneficial reaction to this latest scaling down in the way of a tax cut; nevertheless  the budget deficit will still be as big as it was in the past fiscal year  And Chuck, I think part of the  burden is still on us to go a bit further than we have already  Net, the bottom line I would come out     5/16/78              38  with is a federal funds rate midpoint of about 7-1/2 or a range of 7-1/4 to 7-3/4, M1 at 3 to 8, M2 at  4 to 9, and a monetary aggregates directive    "
758,1978-06-20,"  Is this the go-around, Mr Chairman?       In terms of the outlook, it=s terribly difficult, as I think we all recognize, to  really judge what inflation expectations are going to do, especially to the consumer sector   We=re somewhat less optimistic, frankly, than the Board staff  We=ve done something like  Larry=s people evidently have done; we’ve looked at the difference between the Board=s model  output and the judgmental forecast  I=m not saying that the model outlook is the thing you  should rely on  In fact, I=m glad you do apply judgment to the econometric forecast  But it=s  true, if we read the numbers right, that more than half of your increase in consumption spending  is a judgmental outcome and not what the model is telling you  In a nutshell, we=re less  optimistic about the economy starting with late this year and going into 1979  While this gets  into a lot of methodological detail, a part of the result stems from the fact that for a year or a year  and a half now my staff has been convinced that one gets somewhat better results, though not  dramatically better results, from forecasting the economy on an M2 basis rather than an M1  basis  We circulated a paper to this group, I think it was 18 months ago, to that effect and we=re  still getting similar results in the ongoing experiments     So, looking at the projection of M2, we come up with a somewhat less optimistic economy  starting late this year  To be quite specific about it, by the time we get into the first half of 1979,  the real growth the Board’s staff is showing averages 42 percent for the first half of the year   We have less than half of that, at 19 percent  And we think most of it=s going to be in the  consumption sector, with the principal explanation of that being that we=re afraid the inflation  expectations factor is going to cut deeply into consumer spending  There=s already been quite a  rise in the saving rate if we look back four or five quarters  I think what is happening in the  Board=s forecast, Jim, if we interpret you right, is that you=re borrowing some consumer spending  in effect by counting on the saving rate going down  We=re not certain that’s going to happen   That=s where I think the big differences come between the outlooks of our two staffs       Mr Chairman, I think I already covered part of the story in my earlier  remarks, but let me just go over a few figures quickly  As far as the last half of this year is  concerned, our staff has very little difference with the Board=s staff in terms of real growth, inflation,  and unemployment  The principal difference will show up in the first half of next year, as I said,  when we would show real growth of a touch under 2 percent versus the Board staff forecast of a  little over 4 percent  We expect less real growth--and I am going to pause at this moment to [note]  the reasons, which I didn=t mention earlier--in part because of the supply constraints both in terms of  skilled labor and really useable cost-effective capacity  We hear about skilled labor shortages all  over the country  It shows up in help wanted ads and complaints that I hear from directors about the  ability to get people to fill skilled jobs   In one sense I think we have been running at an  unsustainable rate in the economy in the first half of this year  And the constraints on the supply  side, both in labor and capacity, will be a factor at work in slowing down real growth in the economy  as we get into the second half and the first  half of 1979  Because we expect somewhat less real  growth than the Board=s staff does for the first half of next year, we show a touch higher  unemployment--61 percent to be specific for the first six months of next year versus the Board=s  staff forecast averaging 59  About the only hopeful thing that we see in this is that we may,  therefore, see less pressure on prices since aggregate demand will slow down  And our forecast on  inflation for the first half of next year would be about 1/2 point under the Board=s staff forecast of  69; we have it running about 64  Those are the highlights       No, I haven=t recapped this into Q2 ’78 to Q2 ’79, unfortunately  I=d have to  go back to the drawing boards to do that       Some of my colleagues happened to hear me say my glasses fell apart when I  came into the room this morning so I suffer from a little case of myopia and I guess I lean toward  short-sighted policies today  That was supposed to be a joke!  My main concern for at least the last  two years has been the lack of a systematic way of linking our short-run ranges with what we allege  to be our long-term goals  And I think we=re seeing another case of that now  I just don’t think it’s  going to be possible to ever get down to the midpoint of what we said we would do on the long-term  ranges, but that=s a subject for next month  At the same time, I feel very strongly that if we let the  aggregates run too strongly in the direction of an overshoot, it will feed back in a way that will really  harm the economy by even worsening inflationary expectations and everything that that implies for  the behavior of both consumers and businessmen  I don=t think there=s any choice but to tighten up  right now and I like some of these formulations I=ve heard, particularly Ernie Baughman=s, and I  would go right along with it 7-1/2 to 8 on the funds range, move quickly toward the 7-3/4 midpoint,  but bring down the ranges for M1 and M2 to something like 4 to 8 and 4 to 9  I think it=s going to be  easier to bite the bullet now when the economy is still performing very strongly than it will be by  later this year when I expect the economy to be slowing down somewhat       We ought to go to a 3-month range     SPEAKER(?)  Yes    "
784,1978-07-18,"  The question I wanted to ask Jim, Mr Chairman, has to do with the 6-1/4  percent M1 growth postulated here for the forecast period, which is through 1979  I don’t know  how you feel about it yourself, Jim, but we’re so concerned about the undermining of M1 in terms  of institutional changes, past and prospective, that we have great difficulty doing any kind of a  forecast based on M1  So we’ve shifted to M2, which we found in an earlier period is superior in  any event  In our judgment it’s getting more superior, probably  What assumptions specifically  did you make concerning developments on M1 subsequent to November 1, Jim?       I hear what you’re saying       Well, for some months now, Mr Chairman, my staff has been somewhat less  optimistic than the Board’s staff  I consider their--       7/18/78              12     I am not sure that we will be; that is still a forecast  It has to do with the  second half of this year and going into l979  I think the Board staff’s view was very well  articulated  It is a very plausible package and yet there are different scenarios, which I became  especially aware of over the weekend when I met with the ABA’s economic advisory committee  --the top economists from the major banks in the country  There was quite a divergence of opinion  within that group and I would say, Jim, that your forecast would definitely rank among the most  optimistic that I heard  There were some others among that group who would have been optimistic  but some were at the other end of the scale and, like Frank, were definitely expecting a recession      More or less by accident rather than design here, our staff forecast has come out with what I  would call a growth recession  Specifically, to nail down the numbers, we look for less strength in  real consumer spending than you do  We had it about flat from here out into l979 and the  underlying reasons for that have to do with the feedback of current and prospective inflationary  developments on consumer attitudes--especially coming down to the bottom line that we expect the  saving rate to rise somewhat  We expect the constraining influences of debt repayments relative to  personal income--take home pay--to begin to make themselves felt  If you believe that scenario,  then there is probably going to be some feedback on inventory positions with businesses  That is,  by the first two quarters of next year there may be a raft of orderly corrections of excess  inventories, especially at the retail level if real consumer spending does in fact flatten out  And that  could even have a bit of a dampening effect on real capital spending, which we expect to grow at  about a 5-1/2 percent rate through this year and into l979     As for where we come out on the bottom line as compared to your forecast of real GNP of up  4 percent this year, we are almost identical--just a shade under it  But for next year as a whole you  have GNP up 39 and we are at 27  If you take it from the fourth quarter of ’78 to the fourth  quarter of ’79, you are at 3-1/2 and we are at 19  That is just the difference in the assumptions and  that starts principally with consumer spending  We show less strength on residential and a little  less strength on business capital spending  And as a final element, our methodology differs from  yours Jim, in this sense  We have used the midpoint of the present M2 range as a part of our  methodology  Of course, you have more monetary stimulus now than you had previously because  you’ve got M1 at 6-1/4  To make our forecast fully comparable to yours, we would have to be  assuming a somewhat higher M2 growth, which I would not recommend  But that is one of the  reasons our forecast, I guess, is a little less optimistic than yours       Oh, it does?       Okay, if that is the case, then we don’t have inconsistent monetary  assumptions  But if this view of ours happens to be right, and who knows, starting about the fourth  quarter of this year we would show GNP rising about 27 percent and then quarter by quarter after     7/18/78              13  that going into 1979 we’d show 21, 16, and 19  That is, I would have to say, a growth recession   We think we can avoid an outright recession but I certainly wouldn’t rule out the possibility of that  developing  I have my fingers crossed on this growth recession of ours, hoping--and maybe it is  wishful thinking--that we can avoid an outright recession       Unfortunately, [the way] we slice things up is the third quarter of ’78 to the  third quarter of ’79  We haven’t--       We will do that; yes we could easily do that       Well, Mr Chairman, I would support the views that have been expressed by  Governor Coldwell and President Morris  I am one of those who is an M2 believer  Well over a  year ago we circulated a paper to everybody around this table that pointed out that prior to about  mid-l975 M1 and M2 moved closely together and, therefore, were giving about the same monetary  signal  And that was true, I might add, even in [times] of high interest rates like l974  [After] we  circulated that paper, with the subsequent monitoring that we have done, we are still convinced that  in these periods of divergent growth rates of M1 and M2, M2 is giving the better signal  It’s not  that it’s a [unintelligible] factor, but it’s giving a better signal of future GNP, real or nominal, than  M1  I would be prepared [to operate on M2] for that reason, and especially in view of all of the  uncertainties that are surrounding M1 behavior in the future  Frank thinks the coming on stream of  the automatic transfers will be pretty slow  I happen to think it will be a little faster, based on my  conversations with banks  But overall, M1 has become so contaminated--if that’s the right word-- by institutional changes, past and prospective, that I think we should move toward greater weight     7/18/78              28  on M2  And I would suggest 3/4 weight on M2, despite the reservations that Chuck has, which I  don’t share  As far as the ranges are concerned, I think a good case has already been made by  earlier speakers  Net net, I would leave them unchanged       May I respond to that?  I think the Chairman has an excellent opportunity to  spell out the fact of great uncertainty--and great disagreement as a matter of fact--in judgments  within the Committee on the behavior of M1 over this entire period, especially because of the  automatic transfers  Therefore, the significance of the M1 range is necessarily sharply diminished  for that reason  Deemphasize it even if we make no formal change in our 50-50 weighting just to  recognize the facts of life--the great uncertainty       Could I ask just a quick question of Chuck?  I am interested in why you are  so certain, Chuck, that M1 is going to grow at that 7-1/2 percent rate [that you mentioned] over the  entire period starting with the second quarter of this year       Mr Chairman, you are the one who is going to have to face the music       If I could just follow up  I, for one, would certainly be interested, if you care  to share your view with us  I assume everybody else would  I don’t think I heard you express your  view        Mr Chairman, I wonder if this would make any sense at all, even though I  discarded it in my own thinking  If you are going to raise the upper end of the range by 1/2 point,  for the reasons that have been set forth earlier, you could take some of the sting out of the  announcement effect of that by dropping the lower end 1/2 point at the same time and making an  impassioned speech about the tremendous uncertainties that lie ahead in M1, given the prospect of  automatic transfers and how that will turn out--in fact, whether it will turn out  And you could sort  of reduce M1 to a memo item type of treatment, which Frank Morris suggested       I will make this brief because my speech has already been given by several  here, especially including Mark Willes  I think we do need to have a link between our short-run  and long-term ranges  Unless we move at some point, we are going to have the overshoots  everybody has complained about this morning  Therefore, I would go essentially with alternative  C, but I would like to see the upper end of those ranges reduced by at least a point or so       Mr Chairman, I wonder if there is some possibility of beefing up the content  of the daily wire that all of us get in any event  Admittedly, it is after, rather than before, the fact,  but that would not preclude a one-day-later critique or whatever, if that could be done  Speaking  personally, that would be a perfectly adequate solution  I would feel pretty much the way Frank  has expressed himself, as long as we weren’t precluded from critiquing the [program] even if it is  after the event  My experience is that it has [not] occurred often but, when it does occur, it seems  important  I don’t see that we would be prevented from a little postmortem instead of a comment  prior to the time the program is imposed  And I don’t think much would be lost in the process       [Unintelligible] out of the Board then    "
811,1978-08-15,"  Well, I guess up to this point, I'm the great bear in the crowd  That may be  only incidentally related to having been chased by a brown bear in Alaska, which made me a little  more cautious than ever!  We've shaded our forecast down a bit from last month and are among the  least optimistic now in that our real GNP is 24 percent, inflation is 77, and unemployment is 61   The major differences in our forecast and the Board staff’s are much as I recited last time  We  expect the consumer spending drive to run out of steam  [People] have been buying in advance of  expected price increases; that's drawing business from the future  The ravages of both actual and  expected inflation will make themselves felt in consumer psychology and business spending plans  and will feed back on inventory positions  That in a nutshell is why we come out somewhat less  optimistic  And I guess I'll call a spade a spade; the numbers we have would actually constitute a  growth recession       The real weakness is in next year, when every quarter of real growth is  under 2 percent       Well, my general point would be that there is such a lag in the impact of  policy that even if we move now we probably couldn't head this off, and it would merely  exacerbate the inflation situation  I'm presuming that monetary policy will be about in the range  we've set for our 12-month ranges  And even if we ease up beyond that, it would have little  noticeable impact in the forecast horizon; it takes 6 to 9 months for the policy even to show up, in  my view in the real economy, and 1-1/2 to 2 years to show up on the price front       Mr Chairman, there's another aspect of this, which I'm not sure has been  fully covered  I hear increasing complaints from directors in a wide range of industries in our  District that it's just getting awfully tough to hire skilled labor  Another outstanding example is the  case of Boeing, which is undergoing a big expansion program right now--three new model planes  They've already hired 12,000 people and they are looking for another 15,000 and it's absolutely  messing up the Seattle labor market in a major way  They're hiring people away from every other  employer, including our Seattle branch  This is just one example  We get the same complaint from  San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and Portland  You name it; there's not a big city on the West  Coast where [major businesses] have not expressed a severe concern  This is helping to drive wage  rates up       What are your estimates for September M1, Steve?  I missed that       I find myself, Mr Chairman, very close to the views already expressed by  Messrs Coldwell, Volcker, Wallich, and Willes, so there's no point in repeating those arguments I  am concerned about having too high an upper end on the ranges  My staff has calculated that if we  were to adopt 5 to 9 and 6-1/2 to 10-1/2, during this 2-month period M1 could grow at a rate 2-1/2  percentage points above the upper bound of its long-term target and M2 1-1/2 points above its  upper bound  To me that's just a bad possibility  I think we are facing a crisis of confidence, and  not just in the international field; I see it developing internally within this country in terms of a  growing fear of inflation getting out of hand on the upside  And I think a small but prompt and  decisive move on our part would, therefore, be well advised  So I would share the growth ranges  of some of my colleagues or be down even a touch more on M1, 3 to 7 and on M2, 5 to 9  I would  settle for the 7-3/4 to 8-1/4 percent range for federal funds, moving promptly to the 8 percent  midpoint with a monetary aggregates directive       Well, Mr Chairman I guess my views are biased strongly against  supporting the yen as a result of sitting through a meeting of and giving a speech a little over a  week ago to the Japan California Society  Without going into gruesome details, the American  contingent there was in a state of deep distress and shock and dismay as a result of the     8/15/78             36  intransigence of the Japanese spokesmen for leading banks and businesses that we have to guess  reflects the government view  They were just not willing or apparently able to move decisively or  promptly in loosening up both tariff and non-tariff areas of their goods, saying that they need a  great deal of time to study all of these questions  I think that could be a move very badly received  in the American business community, as a matter of fact  There's a powerful case for doing  something against these other currencies  But if we were to do it at all, I must say I would want  tougher conditions laid down than just moving to a 2-1/2 percent discount rate and a stimulus  program of 4 [trillion] yen  I think they've got to move more promptly, especially on these non- tariff barriers and all the ways they have of keeping out American goods  Their trade surplus with  the United States is just fantastic and it's getting worse and not better    "
836,1978-09-19,"  Well, as has been the case for some months, we expect less real growth and   also less inflation than the staff does  We don't expect a stimulative effect on consumption from the  tax cut because of the social security offset, the effect of inflation pushing people into higher  income brackets, and that sort of thing  That's where our differences really lie       Yes, because we expect less real growth      One final comment but I'm afraid it’s not a very optimistic one  I'm not   sure quite what to read into George Meany's blast yesterday of wage-price guidelines, but it doesn't  sound very promising--       It doesn't sound very promising in terms of getting the cooperation of   labor      What I heard on TV didn't sound mild      I'd like to read a more optimistic interpretation, Paul, into that decline of   long-term bond yields  The wish may be the father of the thought here  But I'm convinced, as are a  lot of people, that inflationary expectations in fact have a great deal to do with the level of       9/19/78            20  long-term bond yields  My interpretation, perhaps wishful thinking, is that the market has  perceived the Fed as tightening up recently and, therefore, diminishing the chance of escalating  inflation and perhaps even raising the chances that it will peak out before the end of the year  And  markets, being very forward-looking, I think are taking this into account  Now, you can always  come back with other technical explanations--light calendars, this and that, and so forth  But I  would place the major weight on the explanation I've given       In the forecasts of interest rates that market people make, the peak ranges   from Lee Prussia from the Bank of America, who is expecting a fairly considerable decline in  short-term rates by the second quarter of next year, to some others who don't see that happening  even in 1979  I think the market prognosticators are about as widely divided at this juncture on the  outlook for rates and when the peak will occur--if there is to be a peak--as I can remember      However you have arranged this, please keep doing it will you?  [With] long-term rates   down, I say all good things can happen to the economy      This Committee continues to search for how to reach a soft landing   because I think that is our continued problem  We obviously have a real dilemma  A good many  of us have seen a slowdown in the rate of economic growth following several years of  extraordinary growth  But also many of us are concerned about the implications of what will  happen to both business and consumer psychology [and] the international market unless we get on  top of the inflation problem and show some signs of deceleration  [For] a couple of years from  time to time I've been proposing to this Committee that we ought to have some systematic way of  getting from here to there in terms of the short run to the long run  The way you get overshoots,  big overshoots, time after time, of course, is a month-to-month decision [not to take] draconian  [steps What] I had proposed in the past, which probably is too rough now, is that whenever you're  at or over the target ranges the upper limit of the band should be the upper range of the long-run  target  That would mean a 6-1/2 percent top for M1 now and a 9 percent top for M2  I'm not  prepared to go that far this month and thus I would compromise with something like 4 to 8 on M1  and 6 to 10 percent on M2 and go immediately to 8-1/2 on the federal funds rate with a range of  8-1/4 to 8-3/4 percent       9/19/78            28   "
861,1978-10-17,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman, I'd like to ask Ted Truman about the outlook that  he presented for the United States and other leading countries  One encouraging factor that I see in  your charts, Ted, is that in effect you’re saying that in 1979 you expect some convergence in the  growth rates of real GNP in the United States and its major trading partners  But what I didn't hear  you say, unless I missed something, is what you expect to see on the inflation front  [I ask]  because, going back to Scott Pardee's rather pessimistic report on the state of the dollar, it seems to  me that we won't really come to grips with the weak position of the dollar internationally until we  get a reversal of trends that have been under way for some years now--with real GNP growth  considerably faster in the United States [relative to] our major trading partners but also a  considerably higher inflation rate [here]  Now, if we could see some daylight at the end of the  tunnel--not only a convergence of real growth rates but also a narrowing of the spread between  inflation rates--that would be helpful  But I don't think you covered that  Could you give us your  view on that?       All right, I guess my next question then is  Are consumer prices really the  most relevant price gauge for measuring with respect to currency given the fact that there's a lot of  stuff in the CPI that doesn't get traded abroad?       Well, we see somewhat less real growth than the Board's staff, which has  been the case now for some months  But I would like to emphasize one factor that I have not heard  discussed, although I can agree with many of these views about the risk of less real growth than the  staff has projected  And that is that, based on a number of studies we have made, we see the  economy essentially at practically full employment, both in terms of availability of skilled labor  and even some unskilled labor, which has been touched on by a number of people including Ernie   In terms of cost effective unused capacity, we don't see as much slack as the staff figures here  suggest Therefore, we don't see the possibility of real growth over the next twelve months rising  beyond what our model tells us--2 to 2-1/2 percent--by pushing on the accelerator of aggregate  demand   At the same time, I'm much more--        Well, I think they need to be interpreted with great caution, given the sense  one gets just by talking to firms trying to hire people in today's labor market  I get this from my  directors all of the time; Boeing is having tremendous difficulties         They want to add 25,000 people to the payroll  [They are] hiring away  people at higher salaries from all sorts of local firms, including the [Seattle] branch of our Bank,  I'm distressed to say  The labor supply just doesn't seem to be there for firms actively in the  market, and that's going to be a constraining factor  And I think [it’s going to be] a factor leading  in turn to higher inflation just on the wage settlement side--on the unit cost of production side  So  I'm not any less optimistic than the Board's staff on the inflation figures; in fact it could be  somewhat worse  But I also see real growth being constrained by these limitations on supply   That's about where we come out       Well, first of all, Mr Chairman, I happen to come out with the kind of  recommendation that Steve started off with and that you spoke to  Keeping M2 and M3 unchanged  is my fairly strong preference  I think what the debate will probably hinge on is whether to keep  M1 and, if so, at what range and whether to add M1+ and, if so, at what range      I'd like to revert to Steve's analysis  At the risk of appearing ungrateful, Steve, after you  threaded your way through various mine fields here, the one thing that you didn't express a view  on, at least in your remarks or in the Bluebook, [relates to the weighting]  If we were to [have]  both M1 and M1+, with respect to day-to-day operations within the 2-month horizon there will  have to be some decision on relevant weights  And while I realize it's not a direct element in taking  up the 12-month ranges, I think we should keep in front of us the fact that if we do add M1+ and  keep M1, we are going to have to cross that bridge at some point  And I, for one, would be  interested in what options you would offer or what your views were on the relevant weights to use       In explanatory text?       I like very much what Henry Wallich had to say and earlier than that, Frank  Morris  I think in view of the uncertainty that we face in the near term on M1, M1+, etc, there's       10/17/78 48             still an argument to be made--and I won't bother repeating it--for just placing more weight on M2   And I think that 3/4 weight would be a good thing to do at this point  As far as the federal funds  rate is concerned, I'd come out with an 8-3/4 to 9-1/4 percent range, moving to 9 very quickly  And  otherwise I’d take the alternate 2 recommendations      Particularly at this time, Mr Chairman--alluding to a very important point that you made--I  think that we don't want to grind the economy down by very slow monetary growth and perhaps  precipitate a recession such as happened in '74  I think we're faced with an opposite kind of  situation now; inflation was worse then  We did in fact in retrospect, in my view, have much too  slow a pace of monetary growth when the brakes were finally landed on  But I think the objective  now ought to be to prevent a monetary explosion such as the type we've had in the last couple of  months--in August and September  I for one wouldn't lean toward the kind of monetary policy that  in fact triggered a recession the last time around and I don't think the majority of members are  talking about that kind of thing    "
887,1978-11-21,"  One observation  The November 6 letter from Bill Wallace to Murray  Altmann on the examination of the [System Open Market Account] had some numbers in it about a  loss on foreign exchange operations, showing that as $1217 million  If that is to be published ever,  I think it would be quite important to distinguish between losses from current operations in this  year [and prior periods]  Just by a phone call, we found out that it's only $27 million [this year]  whereas $105 million of that was the liquidation of the Swiss franc swap going way back to 1971       Well, that's fine  I just want to make sure, because otherwise it would by  very misleading       Jim, have you had a chance to look at the details in most of these  [projections by] private forecasters who are now forecasting on behalf of their clients a recession?  [In what sectors do they] expect this to come and why?  You said it's not going to happen and I  hope you're right  Nevertheless, there's that [unintelligible]  What I'm seriously worried about is  sort of a self-fulfilling prophecy       But a lot of corporations subscribe to DRI or Chase Econometrics or  whatever  As you well know, they are forecasting recession  My question was  Have you had a  chance to look at the details there?       Well, like Mark, we don't believe that business expansions die of old age  We do believe they die of riotous living and we've had more than a fair amount [of that] in the last  couple of years  I'm not going to rule out the possibility of a recession; I think it's a distinct  possibility We'll be lucky if we get through without one, with the distortions, imbalances, and  everything else that have been created by this inflationary surge  So I don't have a great deal of  confidence in the numbers that I'm going to cite for the third quarter to third quarter of about 2  percent on real GNP, 72 to 75 percent on the inflation rate, and unemployment of about 65  percent       Well, for reasons that have already been spelled out--and I won't repeat--if  the important bridging actions of November 1 are not sustained, we are going to lose the effect of  that and the credibility  I think we are under particular observation at home and abroad on that  right now  So for those reasons, I would put a cap of 5 percent on M1, 6 to 9 for M2, and 1 to 5 for  M1+  I favor 9-3/4 to 10-1/4 on the federal funds rate, moving immediately to 10 with an  aggregates directive    "
910,1978-12-19,"  This is sort of a belated question back to Scott Pardee  You referred to the  lecture that you got from the Bundesbank this morning, Scott       What do you think they mean by a credible anti-inflation policy?        Without repeating some of the comments that have been made by the four  preceding figures that I am in agreement with, I would stress that in my judgment--and I have been  arguing it for some months--we are and have been at practical full employment, both with respect  to labor and plant capacity  And I think that if inflation continues as it has been for some time now,  it will be a key problem in terms of a threat to a stable growth path  There’s not much we can do  about overshoots that have occurred in the past couple of years  They have occurred and there are  long lags, in my opinion, in the impact of policy and we are beginning to see [the effects] now   Just as in football, when in doubt, punt  So having said all of that, I think we are at the stage of a  cycle where if in doubt because of this inflation danger we should lean on the side of more  restraint  Now that the Board staff has reduced its economic forecast somewhat for the year ahead,  there is very little difference remaining between our staff and the Board staff and it’s not worth  going into what the fairly small differences are       The slowdown that we expect comes not only because of the distortions that have been  produced by inflation but also because we can’t continue a growth rate such as we have had over  the past year or two in the face of having reached a practical full employment point  I do  suspect--and it’s no more than that--that this strength we see in the fourth quarter, which is greater  than anticipated, and certainly greater than I had anticipated, is borrowing from business in the  future  I’m just getting too many signals that there is a mood out there in the country of “buy  before prices go up even further”  And to a limited degree that explains the surge of consumer  spending, especially on the big ticket items, but that I think is going to run out of gas sooner or later  and maybe sooner  And that further reinforces the expectation that we had that going from the  fourth quarter of this year to the fourth quarter of 1979 real GNP will be probably under 2 percent;  18 percent is what we show specifically, which is a bit less optimistic than the Board staff      Of all the imponderables we are trying to wrestle with today, I suspect the biggest one is the  confidence factor and how it is going to impact both consumer and business spending in the future  [Doing what] we can do to reinforce through our posture--as it’s perceived by the public, banks,  businesses and consumers, and especially by foreigners--that we are going to be resolute in  following a policy that will wind down inflation is about the only way we are going to get back to a  more stable economy  So in view of the uncertainties in the projections, both of real magnitudes  and the aggregates, and because inflation continues to be an unresolved problem that there is no  visible evidence as yet of it slowing down, I’d lean on the side of a bit more restraint         Mr Chairman, there is another aspect of this that I would like to spend a  minute on  Personally, I’m in favor of Chuck’s view that a more meaningful way of measuring the  change is from fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter rather than year-over-year  But another  consideration that would influence how I would come out on this has to do with the following   Under the current procedures, we’ve got a certain spread of percentage points [on the ranges] for  M1, M2, etc  On M1, it’s a 4 percentage point spread, with 2 to 6 percent; on M2, it’s a 2-1/2  percentage point spread--6-1/2 to 9  But in terms of actual operational ranges, in fact there is a  much narrower spread because it depends on our practice to update these targets each quarter  And  so the range, in practice, I think has been only one-fourth as wide as the 4 percentage point spread  on M1 and the 2-1/2 percentage point spread on M2  As far as I’m concerned, if we were to retain  the same practice of having these present percentage point spreads and go on for a full year, the  ranges would be far too wide for me to personally be comfortable with       [Given] the very short time available to think about this, I would suggest as a kind of  compromise that we narrow the ranges if we are going to go from fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter  to a 1 percent spread for M2 and 1-1/2 for M1  I’ll give you some illustrations  from 3-1/4 to 4-3/4  would have the same midpoint, namely 4 percent, as the present 2 to 6 percent range  An M2 range  of 7-1/4 to 8-1/4 for a year ahead, fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter, [has] the same 7-3/4 percent  midpoint as our present 6-1/2 to 9 percent range  But the issue I’m concerned with is that in  practice the 4 percentage point spread we allow ourselves for M1, and the 2-1/2 for M2 are not  really that wide because we update them every quarter  And I think we would have too much  sloppiness in the steering mechanism here if we allowed those same percentage point spreads to  exist in our specified ranges for a full year ahead        12/19/78          46        That’s a very good point; the cone gets wider as you go up        In any case, it comes up in February        I do too, Mr Chairman  And I must say, going back at least three years  ago, I have been harping on this lack of getting from the short run to the long run  And one time I  suggested a mechanical rule, which got sympathy but no action, and a number of other people  around the table have subsequently come up with various devices  But when everything else is said  and done, we really have had such big overshoots--or undershoots, as the case may be--because we  haven’t disciplined ourselves sufficiently on this Committee to get from the short-term to the  long-term [objectives]  If we can do that by a means other than a strictly mechanical rule, that’s  fine  But I think we have to do it by one means or another and, therefore, I support Ernie’s general  proposal that we leave the matter open for further discussion  I think it is one of the most important  procedural aspects of this whole shooting match       Before you do that, I’d like to strongly support that  Going back to the  predecessor committee on which I served and the ideas that surfaced, we had all sorts of  conversations about the instability you get in looking at a 2-month horizon  Not only the weekly  numbers but even the monthly numbers are 90 percent random fluctuation  In all the statistical  tests we made, you have to go to something like the 3-month average to get some idea of the true  underlying trend  I think this is a great step forward and I would recommend not to deep six it     "
935,1979-02-06," Jim or Jerry, in an otherwise exceptionally well  done presentation, I was startled by only one thing and that was your  figures with respect to the impact of fiscal policy You have a chart  that shows the full employment surplus for this fiscal year at $87  billion, which is a startling contrast to the Administration's high  employment deficit figure of $23 billion In fiscal 1980, the  Administration's so-called high employment deficit, based on a 51  percent high employment unemployment rate, is $ 8  billion and you show  a [full employment] surplus of $23 billion Your expenditure and  income figures are moderately different but not enough to account for  that vast difference I'd like you to explain that if you will    Well thanks, Jerry If you happen to have an  explanatory memo on the technical details--we don't have time to go  into it now--1, for one, would be very pleased to see it    It really does have a bearing [on our decisions]  because if fiscal policy is going to be on the restrictive side--and  you may well be right, I'm not challenging you--that obviously has  some implications for what we can do on the monetary policy side So  I'm going to be very interested in seeing how you got these different  answers   M R   PARTEE When you say '""change,"" Jerry you mean that  there's an improvement in each year from 1976 through 1980 You're  just bringing them up    I'll just send you that M2 [study], Mark Maybe  Frank will do the same thing    With regard to the business situation, our staff  forecast is quite similar to the Board staff forecast in broad  outline The differences are not worth talking about because they are  all within the range of the forecasting errors So we have no  problems there Given that essential agreement, the issue comes down  to the appropriate posture for monetary policy When I first took a  look at the Bluebook, Steve, I got quite a jolt I thought you might  really be arguing for what was in alternative B or even alternative A  But in summarizing the advantages and disadvantages of different  ranges here, I think you have landed by coincidence or mental  telepathy or something else almost exactly where I came out in  wrestling with this On M1 I would perhaps be inclined to go down to  the alternative B level, given the staff's estimate on the ATS  effects, which I have no reason to quarrel with and I know that's a  difficult estimate to make I could settle for either 1-1/2 to 4-1/2  percent as in alternative B or what you suggested, Steve, which was 2  to 5 percent And for much the same reasons, which I won't take up  your time to repeat, I think we would be well advised to come out with  the [other] specifications Steve ended up with on balance--and  considering what he called the PR effects or the Congressional  relations effects--6 to 8-1/2 percent on M2 and 7 to 9-1/2 percent on  M3 Among other things, Steve may remember that I tend to be one of  the doubting Thomases around the table on shifts in money demand  such a shift is plausible and possible; it may even be a fact But  the trouble is, as we all know, that we don't know for sure until     2 / 6 / 7 9  -21-    after the game is over Sometimes we are wrong and sometimes we are  right It‘s a difficult bet to make So, I concur with the way Steve  came out as a means of hedging our bet I think we would be well  advised to do that, particularly in view of Steve‘s remarks that if we  make too radical a downward shift in the ranges--even though policy  within those ranges may, and I hope will, remain relatively on the  tight side in view of the inflation problem--we could get some very  severe public reactions, setting in train a whole new set of  expectations of a credit crunch So that’s why I come out where I do,  Mr Chairman    Has anybody thought about ""tone and feel of the  market ?   CH?+IR"" MILLER No, we haven't thought of that  "
959,1979-03-20," Thanks a lot!    I’ll just pick up for a minute on the comment  that Dave made We’ve looked at these same numbers, Steve, and  frankly, we come out more on Dave’s side than yours We have here an  array of the different Ms going up to M7 And in a nutshell what the  facts seem to say is that they’ve all been decelerating since last  fall, though to varying degrees, of course Even if we look at the  latest monthly growth numbers on MI, which includes all these money  market funds, RPs, commercial paper, and so forth, the percentage  growth now is less than half--or at least it’s no bigger than half--  what it was last fall And in some cases growth is about a third as  big as it was last fall So I don’t see a simple tradeoff between,  say, M1 and M2 and something in M7   The bottom line is that this is a very difficult and slippery  area, as you well know, and judgments can differ looking at a set of  facts From my standpoint, I suspect that you may be overestimating  the shift in the demand for money I’m not at all sure it’s going on  to the degree that would seem to be implied by your analysis, and I  say that with all due respect Judgments can differ on these things  The alternative explanation is that we’ve simply been very stingy in  the provision of reserves I think some combination of those two  might explain where we’re coming out But as I say, if one looks at  the actual components of what goes into the so-called substitutes for  money, it’s true that money market funds have surged, but the RPs have  not They haven’t grown proportionately any more than they did in  1974 And the sum of those two has not grown proportionately any more     3/20/79 -9-   than it did in 1974, based on our look at the data S o ,  I have to  register some skepticism, to put it mildly, on the extent of the shift  in the demand for money It remains a judgment rather than a fact, as  far as I’m concerned    Your footnotes and documents say that it  includes both, Steve Am I wrong?    I hope Chuck has a king size bed because I would  like to crawl into it too! There is no sense in reviewing in detail  the way I come out because essentially I'm in agreement with Chuck's     3 / 2 0 / 1 9  -19-   analysis; we were apparently reading the same tea leaves If that  analysis is right, then the strategic problem for us now is how to get  a soft landing We can't stuff the genie back into the bottle as far  as inflation is concerned We shouldn't expect instant results from  the tightening that we've engaged in since last November 1 We all  know about lags in policy and, unfortunately, they seem to be longer  on the price side than on the real economy side So we're going  through that usual agonizing period when the bad news comes now in  terms of the damping the economy and the good news comes later--  perhaps as much as a year later--when monetary restraint begins to  show through on the price front The real danger at the moment,  therefore, is overstaying restraint   I fully understood and concurred in the moves we made on  November 1; in effect, since that time we've been targeting interest  rates It was done almost under crisis conditions because of the  potential for international economic and financial disruption at a  time when the dollar was going down like a rock But we've done that  and now we've seen some extremely slow monetary growth, even after  adjustment for ATS and NOW accounts and so forth And given the fact  that the staff forecast for money has been way over the mark for 5  months in a row now--and as Steve well knows I'm not being critical  because this is a very slippery business--I will bet you a drink or  dinner, Steve, that the actual March numbers will be about as weak I  suspect they will be down several percentage points from your present  forecast, as they have been in October through February So I am  getting an increasingly uneasy feeling about overstaying restraint and  I would begin to hedge our bets by a slight tilt toward a lower funds  rate, trying to get money growth back up a little closer to what we  declare to be our 12-month objective    My slight [tilt] was to 9-3/4 percent    Well, in my tilt toward less restraint--1  certainly wouldn’t call it ease--on the specifications I would land  somewhere between alternative A and alternative B Specifically, on  M1, the 4 to 9 percent range would be acceptable to me On M2, I  would make the range 5 to 9 percent based on my view that we shouldn’t  let M2 fall further below the lower end of our 12-month range That’s  why the 3-1/2 percent in the Bluebook bothers me And on the funds  rate, I would like to see a range of 9-1/4 to 10-1/4 percent with an  immediate move to 9-3/4 percent One reason in particular for tilting  toward a lower funds rate at this time is the point I referred to in  my earlier remarks about the consistent over-forecasting by several  percentage points on both M1 and M2 that has been going on for five  months now If that over-forecast continued in March, which is my  full expectation, we’re going to see some more very low numbers in the  growth of the monetary aggregates in the month of March That would  make a full six months and that begins to worry me We really have a  dilemma in the sense that the announcement effects could be  counterproductive both with respect to the value of the dollar and the  public‘s perception of what we’re up to But realizing that there are  lags in the impact of policy, as I continue to stress, and given my  expectation of a recession by the middle of the year, I think it’s now  time to begin to unwind this posture we’ve been in since November    A question first, Mr Chairman What is your  reading on the consensus view for the midpoint of the federal funds  range?    If we're talking about preferences, it's a  little too tighz for me I would say no    The aggregates directive is what I'd like and I  failed to mention that    Yes    Let me say something here because I realize we  have to have a compromise between those who feel the current proposal  is too easy and those who feel it’s too tight The one thing that  could be changed so I could go along with it would be to move from a  money market directive to an aggregates directive At least that  would--    Well--    Yes, that would make a lot of sense  "
982,1979-04-17," Thanks, Mr Chairman I always find it  difficult to disagree with Steve, particularly after such a lucid  exposition as the one he has just gone through I do have to quarrel  though, Steve, with the conclusion that Larry has already addressed  What is the evidence that money will rebound? Last month, you may  remember, I called attention to the fact that for the five months  running through February the Bluebook forecast has proven to be  considerably over the mark month by month for both M1 and M2 To add  a little interest to this debate--of course, it's always easier to be  a Monday morning quarterback--1 gave my own forecast in qualitative  terms And my guess was that given this consistent pattern the March  figures would probably come in significantly below what you were then  forecasting And with apologies for sounding like ""I told you so,""  your March forecast for MI was an increase of 57 percent and, as you  know, it came in at 75 percent I consider that significant There  was a better record on M2; the forecast then was 49 percent and its  growth now is said to have been 3  6  percent in March   To try to get my arms around what seems to be the problem, I  had my staff prepare a memorandum, which I have handed out here, and I  would like to take just a minute, Mr Chairman, to run through a few  of the highlights There has been this pattern now for six months in  a row, October through March, of a significant overforecasting of  money growth month by month That is shown on table 1 by months for  M2 and M1; those [variances] are in percentage points The average  overforecast for M1 for those six months was 51 percentage points and  the average overforecast for M2 was 2  8  percentage points, as shown in  table 1 Chart 1, which is on the next page, is rather revealing  These monthly errors are just bound to be big If anybody asked me if  I could do better than Steve, I'd say ""no I couldn't'' This is a darn  difficult job Usually what happens, though, is that large errors in  any given month will be offset by errors in the opposite direction in  the next month AS shown on Chart 1, about half of the time or in a  good part of 1975 and 1976 that is what in fact happened But when we  got near a trough in interest rates in the latter part of 1976 and     4/17/79 -9 -    into 1977, the errors were all on one side The staff was  underforecasting money, as shown by the black areas below the zero  line We got into a period of rising interest rates in 1978 and the  errors shown in the black shaded part were pretty much random From  late 1978 moving into 1979 the errors have again been systematic; they  seem to occur at or near troughs or peaks in interest rates   Therefore, Steve, I must say to you again, as I did last  month, that [I question1 the forecast in the April Bluebook, which  shows M1 growth coming in at 675 percent-this is assuming  alternative B and an unchanged funds rate--in May after 33 percent  [in April], for an average of the two months of 55 percent I  suspect that's going to be several points too high when we get the  actual numbers I'd say ditto on M2, where the Bluebook shows M2  growth in April at an estimated 75 percent rate and in May at a  projected 52 percent, for a two-month average of 6  3 5  percent I  think that's going to be several points too high Now, if that's what  the Committee wants to do, if that's the outcome we're looking for,  fine But we shouldn't walk into it accidentally I'm beginning in  my own mind to make some mental adjustments in deflating these current  [Bluebook] figures until I see evidence that money is in fact  rebounding at current interest rate levels I'm afraid the evidence  in the last six months gives me little comfort on that [score], Steve,  and therefore I suspect that we may be unintentionally, as it were,  leaning too hard and getting aggregate growth that in retrospect may  prove to have been our undoing My fear of this risk is compounded by  the fact that, contrary to the Board's staff, we expect at least a  mild recession beginning in the second half of this year Without  throwing in any detail, I expect it will probably be the classic  inventory-type recession, hopefully short and mild    Well, in short, Mr Chairman, those are my  misgivings And I say that with apologies to the staff because I know  this forecasting is a tough job  But when we detect systematic errors  that run on as long as these have, I for one feel that we've got to  make some mental adjustments This to me says that it would certainly  be a mistake to tighten right now by raising the federal funds rate  I think we can overdo that restraint and actually bring about a  recession, or exacerbate one that may be in the works in any event  I'm very leery about overdoing it on the monetary policy side I  think there are limits--and we've spoken of this from time to time,  Mr Chairman--about how much can be accomplished by monetary  restraint Therefore, without getting into details on the  specifications for the current period, I have a very strong bias  against tightening and possibly will make a case for a bit of easing    Well, I think your point is well taken, Chuck  I’m not a strict monetarist and I’m not a strict Keynesian either I  don’t know what that makes me--a non-monetarist and a non-Keynesian  Eclectic is one word I used that word recently to a friend and he  said Did you say epileptic? In any event, there is a plausible  case, and the staff has made it well, for a change in the demand for  money I am still somewhat skeptical that the whole outcome has in  fact been because there’s been a change in the demand for money  That‘s because we looked pretty closely this past month at what has  been going on in money market mutual funds--which have been rapidly  accelerating--and at RPs, which have been practically flat for some  months now And the two of them together have not been accelerating  [But that‘s what1 they’d have to do, I would think, to explain the  very sluggish growth in M1 and M2 I have a hunch that we may have  seen both the combination of some downward shift in the demand for  money and also, because we have been on a federal funds target--for  pretty good reasons starting November 1, given the international  crisis--the shrinking effect of that on bank reserves [ S o  I think]  the very sluggish growth in bank reserves, or in some ways even the  negative growth quite recently, also explains some of the outcome    Just to add briefly, Mr Chairman, to what I  said before, we should not have a dilemma, especially for those of us  who expect a downturn, hopefully mild, sometime this year and going  into early 1980 Intuitively, one is tempted, of course, to tamp a  bit harder on the credit brakes because of the recent news on  inflation Having taken a good hard look at what we might get out of  that, I doubt if an increase in the funds rate would really give us  any quick fix Certainly it wouldn’t do anything that I can see in  the foreseeable future to affect the things that have been especially  important in [causing] the recent increase in prices--namely what has  been going on in food and in oil And if we did increase the funds  rate at the moment, given the lag that I think exists between such an  action and [when] it flows through to the real world, it would be some  time in 1980 before that would have much of an impact Secondly, any  move toward a further slowdown in money--looking at the other side  now--I‘m afraid would simply exacerbate the recession that we probably  are going to see in any event The flattening out of retail sales for  the past three months in my opinion suggests, as was said earlier  around this table, that much of the growth in real GNP in the first  quarter, modest as it was, was in the form of inventory accumulation  And while inventories don’t appear to be out of line now, that  picture, as I‘ve discovered to my sorrow many times before, can change  very quickly if final sales remain weak The recent slowdown in  personal income growth and the heavy debt position of consumers  suggest to me that we can‘t look to the consumer sector for any real  strength over the balance of this year The trend toward austerity--  if that’s the right word for it--or less expansion in federal, state,  and local government spending doesn’t indicate that sector as a great  source of strength in the year ahead Although capital spending is  now a source of strength, in my opinion it’s simply too small and too  volatile to support any broad-based increase in final sales And I  expect before this year is over [such capital spending will] be  swamped by inventories going the other way   So given the outlook on the real side, to tighten monetary  policy further now would, I fear, seriously risk the repetition of  1974 In my view the Fed held interest rates too high, too long, and  certainly exacerbated that recession Finally, I would add that the  case for tightening to support the dollar is much weaker now than it  was several months ago in view of what we heard earlier in the report  from the Desk There was good reason starting last November to adopt  the [policy] that we did and I have no regrets about it Now that the  dollar is strong, I think there is more freedom to consider what we  ought to be doing in view of the domestic outlook So where I come  out is strongly against any tightening and with some leaning toward a  little easing That’s because of my personal view, as I said to  Steve, that his estimates of monetary growth will be too high on both  MI and M2 for the April-May period That‘s too much restraint for me  and I think it’s going to make the recession somewhat worse    Well, if we're expressing preferences for the  first go-around, Mr Chairman, I'd have to say I lean toward the specs  of alternative A as far as M1 and M2 are concerned I would not make  the federal funds range as low as is shown under alternative A; I  would suggest 9-1/2 to 10-1/4 percent And I would like to see some  easing within that range from where we've been for most of the past  two months or so    Excuse me, I forgot to add that I would prefer  the monetary aggregates directive Excuse me, Bob     4/17/79 -25    Yes sir    Well, I’m a reasonable guy    I’m sorry, Mr Chairman, will you say that  again?    Would you repeat that midpoint?    I said 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent    It was the specs of alternative A on M1 and M2    Yes    Mr Chairman, I would take the revised specs  that you indicated of 3 to 8 percent on M1 and 4 to 8-1/2 percent on  M2 I do it with great reluctance in view of the money market  directive, however That‘s my hang-up    1‘11 [change] to 3 to 8    No, but for the other reason    The money market directive    Yes    On balance, without going through all the  arguments, I have to join Chuck in opposing this  disadvantages outweigh the advantages I'm really concerned about the  point of departure being one which could fairly easily get us away  from countering disorderly conditions and into imposing an official  view of what the dollar '""ought to be worth"" That's a pretty risky  game and I don't think we're ready for it   I think the    No  "
1024,1979-05-22," Jim, we've had this unexpected bad news for the  first quarter in terms of real growth at about 4  percent It's  evident that real final demand actually declined and that what skimpy  growth we had was in fact in inventories In view of that and of the  weak news we've gotten so far for the second quarter for those series  for which we have data--1 don't think there's a single strong report  out so far that I'm aware of--what is the case for a bounceback of  real GNP in the second quarter? I must admit I'm getting pretty  skeptical This is a devil's advocate type of question, but there are  weak spots in the economy and that is spreading--    Yes, a bounceback    I wonder if I could ask first, Mr Chairman, for  a clarification by Steve to make sure I understand the ground rules  regarding how this money market directive would work within the  broader ranges that we’re talking about I’m not sure I got that    I thought I understood you to say, Steve, with  respect to your 0 to 5-1/2 percent M1 range that no easing would occur  until M1 got down to the zero    No tightening would occur, however, until M1 was  growing at around 5-1/2 percent I wish you hadn't called on me  first I could think about it    I've wrestled with Steve's compromise because I  have great respect for his recommendations When everything is said  and done, I do like a couple of things he recommended I like the  money market directive and the widening of the ranges But to be true  to my own convictions with respect to M1, I really have to be in favor  of a 1 to 5 percent range and on M2 5 to 10 percent The lower number  of 5 percent is with a view to not driving [M21 further below our  long-range target On the federal funds range, my preference would be  9-112 to 10-112 percent with an immediate move to 10    Some that are not acceptable to the clear  majority I have felt for several months now, and have so     5/22/79 -35-   recommended, that we should be edging down on the funds rate And I  think this time I've got to stick to my guns    No    I share Chuck's view I have real reservations  about going up to $2 billion, based on a very skeptical attitude  regarding decisions on what constitutes excessive movements one way or  another vis-a-vis what the market is saying I'd keep it where it is    That's a $1 billion total limit?    What are the amounts involved for Japan, Mr  Chairman?  "
1067,1979-07-11," Paul Volcker and Frank Morris have already  anticipated most of my questions, as a matter of fact, but maybe I can  ask the last part of my final question, Jim I'm also concerned about  the possibility of this recession being deeper and longer and more  severe than both you and my own staff are predicting Our staff view  is now pretty close to the one you have I'll challenge you with the  same question I asked them What is there in this current situation  and outlook that makes it different from the experience we had in  1973-74--that leads to a fairly mild recession instead of a deep and  severe one such as we had 5 years ago? In other words, how big are  the risks? Another way of putting it is What do you consider to be  the downside risks in your present forecast? What could go wrong?    Well, thank you That’s a good answer I guess  the one big imponderable I’m still concerned about is the confidence  factor in the economy None of us can really make a judgment on that  but my own hunch is that, if anything, the spreading uncertainty in  the minds of both consumers and the business community could lead to  somewhat worse results than we see here, but I can’t prove that    I'm reminded of sitting here in '74 and '75  through the deepest and longest recession in the postwar period and my  friend Mr Baughman kept raising the question, ""What recession?""    A s  a matter of fact, we didn't feel it as badly  on the West Coast as Messrs Willis Winn and Bob Mayo    In any event, as far as the national outlook is  concerned, despite my ""doubting Thomas"" type questions to Jim a little  while ago, I agree that the most probable outcome is the scenario of a  one-year long, fairly brief, and fairly mild recession But if there  are any risks in that, they're probably on the down side, in my view,  although I'm not quite as pessimistic as Frank [Morris]   Turning to the appropriate monetary policy in view of this,  my specifications would be very similar to those that Steve laid out,  with two qualifications I think I would go further than he would in  narrowing the ranges for the rest of this year for the same reason he  would narrow them We have half of the year behind us and unless we  do narrow the ranges, we would allow for the possibility of some  pretty extreme growth numbers during the second half of the year, as  high as 15 percent and as low as 5 percent or thereabouts S o  I think  there might be some merit in giving assurance to the market that we're  not going to go off the deep end in either direction To be quite  specific, for the second half of 79, I would like to see the M1 range  at, say, 3-3/4 to 5-1/4 percent and the M2 range at 5-3/4 to 7-114  percent I'm just carrying Steve's [suggestion] one step further  And as far as the rest of the specs that he set forth, while they are  a little different than the ones I came in with, they would be  acceptable to me    [For M31 6 to 9 percent, Mr Chairman    I'm not quite sure, Mr Chairman If we try the  tack you are suggesting to avoid specifying the numbers for '80, which  I would approve, what I can't really make a guess on--maybe you can  tell me--is whether the [Congressionall Committee will try to smoke it  out of you If they do, then you're going to have to face the problem  of the explanation of why it's 1-1/2 to 4 - 1 / 2  percent now and 3 to 6  or 3 - 1 / 2  to 6-1/2 percent next year I hope you can avoid the problem  but I'm not--    One other observation if I could, Mr Chairman?  For those who just look at the numbers and don't bother to read the  explanations, as clear as they might be, if we move to 3 to 6--if what  had originally been the majority view here prevails--[there will be]  those who are concerned about what the Fed ought to be doing to ease  things up during a recession And I assume the facts of the recession  no doubt will surface during the testimony We'd appear to be easing  without really doing so There will be some advantages in terms of  announcement effects for those who take a superficial view of what we  are doing just as it might have a contrary adverse effect to foreign  exchange traders who don't read the explanation That's the other  side of the coin    The only thing that might appear to be a little  queer is that we'd have a stand pat hand in terms of ranges--if, let's  say, Paul Volcker's and Henry Wallich's proposal were adopted--in the  face of a developing recession It might look a little odd    Amen    Well, I had a preference for the adjusted range  of 3 to 6 percent I would go along with anything that makes your job  of explanation easier, so--    Well, even though I dissented in May because I  wanted the funds rate down to 10 percent, I find myself in a position  now where I think the rate ought to be up to 10-1/4 percent That's  more or less fortuitous and it's because of the recent surge in the  aggregates The level of M2 is now near the midpoint and is forecast  to grow, as you know, at 8-1/2 percent over the July-August period  That should put it slightly above the midpoint And the M1 level in  June was below the midpoint but is projected to grow 42 and 49  percent in July and August, which if it happens--and I hope it does,  Steve--will bring it right to the midpoint by August I think that's  good; we need [growth] to get back up to those midpoints and that's in  part what tends to offset the fact that we have a recession going on  now   From that point on and within the ranges that we have  specified, I would argue two points very strongly [One is1 that we  ought to aim for those midpoints, in terms of having a moderate and  stable policy, steering a middle course between the dangers to the  dollar in foreign exchange markets on one hand versus the sagging  economy on the other hand And I would argue secondly, picking up on  a point I was glad to hear you make earlier, Mr Chairman, that we  ought to be paying more attention to M2 With all of the  uncertainties that we know have plagued M1, I guess I'm distressed by     7/11/79 -44-   the fact that in the formal directive we are still calling for about  equal weight to be given to M1 and M2 At least two years ago, we  circulated a paper calling for greater emphasis on M2 and I would like  to see that as a formal proposal at this time So, I‘m going to make  it I think we should start giving closer to two-thirds weight to M2  rather than the present 5 0 / 5 0  [to M1 and M21 Having said all of  that, the specifications of alternative I1 would be satisfactory, but  qualified by what I have just said    It’s clear I‘m out-voted     7/11/79 -48 -     I'll gulp and say yes  "
1133,1979-08-14," I'll approach it from a different way and make it a little more specific Would you care to speculate, Scott, on what good it might do vis-a-vis market expectations and psychology if we were to snug up a bit more on both the discount rate and the federal funds rate--in a range of 1/4 point to possibly 1/2 point?   Might I ask, Mr Chairman, given the pros and cons of all of this and what we've heard Would you care to tell us what your recommendation is on balance?   All right Thank you   I really wanted to follow up on the question you just raised, Mr Chairman Jerry, have you had a chance to do any calculating on what the automatic changes in fiscal policy might produce--that is, the revenue losses built into your economic model and the expenditure [increases] I think it's important to all of us I am certainly struggling to get a fix on how much fiscal stimulus we might get to cushion the downturn, in order to pinpoint the appropriate role for monetary policy in this period   Just another question quickly, Mr Chairman, on the fiscal policy matter Jerry, earlier this year you may remember we called attention to some startling differences between your projections of the high employment surplus and those of the Council of Economic Advisers They were much different magnitudes and even different signs Could you bring us up-to-date in a nutshell on where that stands today if you know?   Well, Mr Chairman, I find myself very sympathetic to the approach that you outlined in your assessment of the immediate and longer-run problems It might seem odd in a way since last May I was in the distinct minority that thought we ought to ease a bit in view of an impending recession, which our staff had been forecasting for some months My concern at that time [involved] what was going on in terms of interest rate levels and the effects in financial markets as well as the monetary growth record There had been a period of very slow monetary growth over a half year Now to my great surprise we have found just the opposite, with the summer surge in the aggregates That apparently calmed down in August, but again there's a very strong projection for September, which Steve has already reviewed for us So it seems to me that we have a credible reason for snugging up a bit right now and, therefore, I would lean toward what you were proposing, a conservative set of ranges and maybe an Alternative C type of approach for the period immediately ahead That's simply because the aggregates have shown such strong growth since April--August being about the only exception--and [that surge in growth is] coming at a time when there is great sensitivity about inflation problems and how [that affects] people's behavior and the position of the dollar  One of the reasons why I was probing on the fiscal policy side this morning was that, while we can't decide this today, in my own mind I have been trying to formulate what could be a longer-run strategy And it's based on an expectation that is yet to be demonstrated--that we will get a lot of fiscal stimulus, probably coming through a tax cut That's just a personal guess, obviously And while we talked about the high employment budget, I'd like to emphasize that in my opinion there is real stimulus in the real world from an enlarging deficit, which we are surely going to get on an NIA basis, perhaps of the magnitude shown in the Greenbook If we are going to get that kind of stimulus down the road from the fiscal side, whether we want it or not--and I think we are going to get it--it might be a good thing to cushion the effect on the economy I guess I'm now leaning more toward the view than I was in the spring that monetary policy may have to address itself principally to some gradual deceleration in the inflation rate, because if we don't get that accomplished, we will have an even bigger recession down the road  -25-    8/14/79   Mr Chairman, most of what you are suggesting as a possible position here I find--well, let me say acceptable I'd like to move a touch more promptly to 11 percent on the funds rate There's one caution I'd like to draw, and maybe I'll be a voice in the wilderness this month as I was last month We all agree that the aggregates are getting increasingly harder to understand In my view that's much more true of M1 than M2 I made the suggestion last month --but got no support, I'll have to say--to put more weight on M2 formally in the directive just for the reason that it is behaving less erratically than M1 I hope before the next meeting of this Committee to share with you an updated paper by my staff on what the recent behavior and experience with M2 has been It's really quite encouraging in terms of the demand function being pretty stable and coming back on track after departing in the first quarter, despite all the vagaries of Regulation Q and what have you The only specification that I dwelled on, Mr Chairman, was your very high range for M2 at 7 to 11 percent The projections of the staff for the growth of the aggregates in September are very high, bringing M2 especially up near the top of this range I think that's too high And if we're going to pay any attention to coordinating our short-term 2-month goals with our longer-term goals, I think we really need to bring the range for M2 down to a point where we won't continue to depart from the midpoint [of our long-run range] It sounds awfully radical but I'd like to suggest a range [with an upper limit] no higher than 9 percent--perhaps 5 to 9 percent on M2--just so we don't get increasingly off track from the midpoint, which is the provisional target that I personally would like to shoot at  As far as the fed funds range is concerned, I could go with the range you're talking about as long as we move pretty promptly to 11 percent If that is done, I think we should follow that up with an increase in the discount rate of a full half point And I'd feel more comfortable with an aggregates directive to make sure we don't let the aggregates get too near their outer bounds without triggering some action on the federal funds rate   Which directive, Mr Chairman? "
1162,1979-09-18," Mr Chairman, I don't know what credence we  ought to put in the rumors, and maybe we shouldn't even bring them to  this table One of my directors called up very excited yesterday  about a rumor that the dollar was going to be devalued, mind you,  sometime in October I suspect, but I don't really know, that this is  a pretty distorted view of what comes out of the press reports about a  possible realignment of European currencies from the meeting scheduled  this coming weekend Is there anything that we ought to know about  that or are you in a position to tell us?    Jim, you have a rather strange looking pattern  in the quarterly trend in the GNP deflator, if I've got the right  numbers here For this year it's 93 percent in the first quarter,  92 in the second, 81 in the third, and then it suddenly jumps to  103 in the fourth quarter There's probably an answer for that, but  what is it?    Could that be the entire [reason] as far as you  see it?    I realize that that's a factor I'm just  surprised at the magnitude--that it could swing the whole GNP deflator  by a point and a half I'm not questioning the figure; I'm just  expressing my surprise    Steve, I’d just like to deal with the first of  the three possible explanations that you gave If I heard the words  right, I interpreted you as saying that there has been some revival in  money demand    I realize that‘s a possibility I must say I’m  skeptical, though, as I look at the sharp rise we‘ve had in short-term  interest rates in that same period when the growth of the Ms has taken  place I would have thought that would have encouraged further the  use of RPs and money market instruments, and we know from the facts  that that did occur So I find it difficult to believe that that’s a  plausible explanation or a very solid one    I would, too    I was going to ask Nancy if that explosion in  currency is a part of the underground economy that she testified on    Until I see it, I guess I'm not going to believe  it I am concerned on balance that it may not have been bad that we  had a real surge in monetary and credit expansion because of this  recession But I think we may have overdone that in view of the  continued problem of getting inflation under control So I would vote  for a little snugging up    Well, I guess I could live with the ranges that  you proposed, Mr Chairman, if we had an aggregates directive When I  keep in mind that part of the proposal was a money market directive  that does bother me [I say that] simply in the sense that at some  point if we have any intent at all of coming within even the upper end  of the ranges we’ve specified--and I think we’ve got to do that if  we‘re going to make any progress gradually on inflation--we’re going  to have to do something to keep from moving farther and farther away  from both the midpoints and the upper end So I’d like to throw out  the possibility, while we‘re still in the discussion phase here, of an  aggregates directive to accompany these ranges that we’ve talked  about On the federal funds rate specifically, I would join those who  think we ought to set the range a little higher, at 11-1/4 to 12  percent    I‘m sorry, would you repeat the numbers?  "
1188,1979-10-05," Steve, if you have the numbers ready there, how  do the latest estimates we have on these different M’s compare to our  long-term ranges? Are we at or above the upper ends in both cases?    One other question, Paul Without trying to  probe into what the forward course of action might be that will be  discussed and decided upon tomorrow, is there anything we should be  prepared to do on very short notice after the meeting in terms of  contacting our directors?  "
1199,1979-10-06," I think there would be considerable agreement  that the kinds of steps that were taken last November were viewed as  bridging actions They were effective but, of course, they can only  be effective as long as some fundamental changes are being made that  get around to solving the problem One aspect of that, from the     10/6/79 -16-   standpoint of the Federal Reserve, is to do what is necessary to slow  the growth of the aggregates and to begin to bring inflation under  control Other elements, as I look back on it--and I‘m sorry that we  [as a nation1 haven’t made more progress--would have been to do  something more effective on the energy front and so on I think there  is a wide perception from the standpoint of the Fed’s responsibilities  and functions that there has simply been such excessive monetary  growth in the last six months that we aren‘t making any progress on  the inflation front Fred’s comment about Scylla and Charybdis coming  together is a very apt analogy, I’m afraid We’ve all been struggling  with this problem in that if we know a recession is probably in  prospect, we normally would want to ease [policy] somewhat Some of  us felt so strongly about that last spring that we dissented; the  record will show that we thought [policy] ought to be easing Since  that time inflationary developments and inflation expectations have  become even more dangerous   One definite advantage that I see in moving to this new  operating target of reserves is that it’s likely to result in greater  credibility in the marketplace [on the part of] a great many observers  here and abroad that we will do something more effective than we‘ve  done, say, in the past 6 months in slowing down the rate of monetary  growth That [growth] in a way has been good in that it [may be]  counter-cyclical but I think it has seriously damaged our ability to  control inflation   One thing that hasn’t been said yet--perhaps it‘s so widely  understood that it doesn‘t need to be said--is that the possibility of  using the kinds of reserve targets that are set forth in this memo has  been studied at great depth over a considerable number of years We  are not moving into this as if it were untested and unstudied; there‘s  an enormous body of research, including staff papers and very good  analytical delineations of the problems and so forth So I don‘t  think we are taking on something that’s new and experimental in the  sense that it hasn’t been very thoroughly examined When this subject  came up four years ago under a predecessor subcommittee of the current  subcommittee on the directive--and I served on that predecessor  subcommittee--I was in favor of moving to a nonborrrowed reserves  target then And that was not in a crisis atmosphere such as we have  today If anything, I think the argument for adding a reserves  target, with a considerably wider range of possible movements in the  federal funds rate to make it effective, is stronger now than it was  then, particularly in view of the explosive inflationary psychology  that we have today   So, on balance, I would feel very comfortable in moving to  the sort of approach that was set forth in the Axilrod-Sternlight  paper I fully agree with you that we shouldn’t go by a strict  mechanical formula I agree completely that we’re going to need to  give you and the Desk a lot of discretion if we get into this I, for  one, think we would make a real impact on market expectations by  announcing this new technique Obviously, we’d have to follow through  with some results, but I would strongly support the proposal for  moving toward the sort of approach outlined in the paper by Steve and  Peter    Mr Chairman, could I ask a technical question  of the staff regarding the right-hand part of the table on page 3?  You say, Steve, that the right-hand panel shows the fourth-quarter  growth rate consistent with a yearly increase in the upper half of the  long-term range I didn’t have a chance to do the arithmetic on this  Do you mean right at the upper end of the range or somewhere within  the upper half of the range?    That’s fine with me    I agree    I’d support that That’s good    Excuse me, Paul, are you talking about 11-1/2 to  15-1/2 percent?    Mr Chairman, may I make a strong plea that you  allow the rest of us to get in on this [discount rate action]? Some  of our directors in San Francisco were [pushing] strongly for [an  increase such as1 this in our last telephone meeting a week ago I  asked them to hold off until we could--1 did not say it in these words  but it’s what I really had in mind--get a coordinated package Is  there any reason that you see as compelling to announce it Monday  morning rather than in just a few hours? We can get our directors  together on Monday morning and I think it would look better if all the  Reserve Banks did [the discount rate increase] at the same time  "
1242,1979-11-20," No, from 13-1/2 to 13 percent    But it is encouraging   M R   PARTEE I did not know that a savings and loan did  that    Home Savings as well as Bank of America The  expectation with respect to the general economy as contained in the  Board staff forecast is quite similar to our staff forecast, which I  would generally describe as a modest recession by past standards  Obviously, there's a great deal of uncertainty surrounding all these  forecasts today But that's still, I think, the most reasonable  expectation And of course inflation still continues to be the  greatest danger here, as many of us view it I think one of the real  problems we are dealing with is the lags that are built into the  impact of monetary policy, which we've known about all along  Unfortunately they are not predictable Those lags are variable but  it is typical in a period of restraint that the bad news comes [first]  and the good news comes later, in the sense of an observable  diminution of inflationary pressures   The only bad result I see from our October 6 actions is the  very sharp rise in long-term interest rates Maybe the school of  rational expectations has an answer to [why that has occurred], Mark,  because I can't get an answer from anybody else, including my own  staff To the extent that those rates are influenced by expectations  of inflation I'm still wondering why--I'm totally nonplussed--they  went up instead of coming down I think that underscores the point  that many people around the table have already made, which is that  psychology is so darn important right now  articulated, the real purpose of our October 6 actions was to get  inflation under control by bringing about a deceleration of money  [growth] And we're being observed very, very closely on what's going  on there When there becomes a greater public awareness of what  happened in October--that there was a considerable deceleration in the  rate of [money] growth--and if the November figures come in as Steve  has projected them, that will add still further credibility   As you so well     11/20/79 - 3 0 -    So I think we're right in the midst of a great credibility  test right now and I wouldn't want to rock the boat by any major  change in the posture that we adopted with respect to the targets for  money growth by the end of the year [I say that] because I think our  credibility and hence our impact on long-term interest rates and  inflationary expectations in general will be messed up if we don't  meet those goals that we've announced Good or bad we have announced  them They are out there and we're going to be judged by them When  it comes down to the fine strokes between alternative B and  alternative C, I think there's not an awful lot to choose; we may be  involved in unnecessary or unproductive fine-tuning here But if I  had to choose between them I guess I would lean a little toward "" C  ""     May I ask you a question, Steve? You are  still, I assume, giving equal weight to M1 and MZ?    That disappeared?    What I was trying to get at is what you would  plan on doing if M1 came in below the 4-1/2 percent we targeted on and  M2 came in higher than the 7-1/2 percent How would you balance those  out in trying to construct your reserve path?    This is for November-December?    I might suggest, Mr Chairman, the possibility  of having this meeting on January 8 if that’s agreeable If we‘re  going to follow it with the Conference of Presidents, that takes  another day Is something wrong with January 8th?  "
1268,1980-01-08," Mr Chairman, going back to October 6th, I think you wisely recommended to us that we not put all our eggs in one basket in terms of operating on a reserves target but that we experiment for a while with multiple targets Now we not only have multiple operating targets, we have multiple intermediate targets in the various Ms I wonder after three months of experience how the staff feels--I guess I would like to ask both Steve and Peter--about whether it's now time to make some provisional judgments on whether this three-pronged set of reserves that you're tracking is proving to be useful or if you'd rather have one single target Another part of the question, going back to your remarks on lagged reserve accounting, Steve, and how it is complicating--I guess that's the word for it-- your job, is whether in your mind any case is shaping up for a move toward contemporaneous reserve accounting to make the monetary policy implementation more expeditious   Steve, do I assume your absence of any comments on the base to mean that you haven't really been paying all that much attention to it?   Unthinkable   Catch-22   I just wanted to say, Mr Chairman, since I was one of those who was rather unhappy with the then-proposed M2 the last time we met and discussed this subject, that I think the newly adopted M2 is a great improvement Certainly, the inclusion of small time deposits, which are now incorporated into the new M2, is going to have a great advantage, as I see it, of reducing the interest rate sensitivity [of M2] over the business cycle That's largely because the money market certificates that are included have offset the reduction that otherwise has been occurring in small time deposits And I feel pretty optimistic, as a matter of fact, because if we look down the road I think at some point we're going to get a further relaxation or abandonment--the sooner the better as far as I'm concerned--of the Regulation Q ceilings That ought to make the redefined M2 even less interest sensitive than it is now So, I for one am quite happy with the outcome and I thought I ought to make that clear, having raised objections to the earlier proposal   That's right   One more question or suggestion, Mr Chairman, if I may I think there's a big difference between what we publish and what we target I certainly have no problems with what is proposed to be published here, for those both inside and outside the System who'd like to experiment with different versions or measures of money I believe we ought to think pretty hard, though, about whether we want to continue to target four intermediate variables In the past we've had four targets Ml, M2, M3, and bank credit pro forma But in practice [our targets] have turned out to be M1 and M2 In practice we haven't really tried to control M3, and we have just observed what goes on in bank credit The Bluebook again sets forth in the various alternatives four different intermediate targets I have a strong feeling that that's about two too many I wish somehow we could find a way of narrowing that down to about two that we really use in practice, no fooling, as far as decisions of this Committee are concerned I'm not sure whether--   As an information variable, just like M3 is an information variable I would hope we could have some discussion of this tomorrow before we make even provisional decisions on what the ranges should be or what magnitude we ought to be talking about   Well, if I had to do it right now, I'd pick M2 for one of those versions I think having two variables as intermediate targets is really about all that is needed and all we can meaningfully handle   Since the hour is late, Mr Chairman, and since I don't really have any convictions but only tentative leanings at the moment, I'm not sure I will give a number either But I would like to refresh recollections by going back five years when we didn't have to have publicly announced ranges Subsequently, when we did announce them, we had a very unhappy result [after] proclaiming a long-run  -43-    1/8-9/80  strategy of gradual diminution in monetary growth That was about four years ago Psychologically, [targeting] gradual reductions in the ranges year by year was probably good; the actual outcome was just the reverse Nearly every year the actual monetary growth kept accelerating Whatever we do, we have to avoid that kind of outcome like poison, if we give any credibility to our actions of October 6 I think we need to stick to that long-run strategy and really make it work this time We need to diminish gradually the rate of money growth, however defined, and it's going to be more difficult as we get into these new definitions  So, with respect to the different alternatives that are outlined here, with the risk of making a pest of myself, I'm going to come back to the theme of whether we need all four [variables] I think we are getting the cart before the horse in a way, by trying to set numbers for four [measures] when we haven't really decided whether we need or in fact can control all four When I think of the new content of M2 and the huge amount of savings deposits at nonbank depository institutions--deposits that really aren't under our reserve influence--and when I think of the volume of money market mutual funds shares and so forth, like you, I begin to have some doubts about whether we really can control M2 It might be important information for us on which to base our other actions But if I were forced to give a provisional number for M-1A or M-1B as of today, I would lean to a midpoint of about 1 percent I'd like to reserve for a more definitive--   I'm sorry As you can see, I'm getting punchy; the hour is late Please don't record that I agree with your [suggestion of] a midpoint in the general area of 5 percent for either M-1A or M-1B I think the important thing is to demonstrate within the context of how serious this recession may turn out to be that, while we may have to depart temporarily from the reduction mode during the depth of the recession, the minute we get beyond that it is our longer-run plan to continue this gradual diminution [in money growth] in view of the strength of inflationary pressures   How about unambiguous? [Laughter]   I was wondering whether the staff has had any chance to [develop] even a preliminary view on the likely impact on inflation rates of this morning's announcement of the upward adjustment on the wage/price guidelines   Mr Chairman, as a number of people around the table have already noted, 1979 was a nonrecession year It's a bit of  -72-    1/8-9/80  a humbling experience in terms of our ability not only to fine-tune but to forecast As I recall your statements on the subject, I think it's to your credit that you spoke out and said that you weren't sure we were in a recession despite announcements coming from other high places that the recession began a couple of months ago and was already half over That's an interesting commentary on the state of the art of forecasting In any event, given that uncertainty about our ability not only to fine-tune but to forecast, it seems to me that inflation does remain the key threat to the longer-term health of the economy--to economic growth, employment growth, a sound dollar, and so on For all those reasons and without going into any more detail, I, too, would come out at this time in favor of alternative C "
1295,1980-02-04," I'd strongly support what Frank has said On the substance of the argument, I certainly join Steve; that's exactly where I come out Like Frank, I would also stress that it would be very risky in my opinion even to raise this outside the Fed until we get a membership bill passed because there will be some adverse member bank relations in a transition Secondly, I'd stress that both the banks and the Reserve Banks need a long lead time on this, longer than Steve thinks based on the impression I have from the staff memo I would think six months would be an absolute minimum When you think of banks in the West with statewide systems and 1,000 branches and so forth, it gets to be a very, very complicated system of reporting    2/4-5/80   Well, both for the banks and for us for the reason that Frank said Our data processing people within the Reserve Banks have been knocked flat by the tremendous number of changes in the current reporting series, by the cranking up of IBA, and by the marginal reserve requirements We have the possibility of a membership bill on the horizon, which will bring us a lot more institutions to deal with On top of that, all at the same time, if we try to plug in a very detailed, cumbersome, time consuming, expensive reprogramming effort and try to do it too quickly, I think we'll rue the day we did it I'll tell you this (1) I would hope that a decision would be made to move to contemporaneous reserve requirements; (2) I wouldn't even raise the issue unless we get a membership bill; and (3) then at that point, I'd make sure that plenty of study is given to lead time needs of both the banks and the Reserve Banks   Oh, you did? Now he tells me!   Mr Chairman, I would like first to turn to page 3 of this package of charts and ask a question to the staff and then make a comment On the calculation of the high employment budget you show for 1980 and 1981, Jim These are your calculations, I assume, rather than the official figures set forth by the Administration?   In other words, it's benchmarked at a 51 percent unemployment rate?   All right, thank you My comment is this Within the last couple of years our Research Department has done quite a bit of work [on this subject] In fact, we circulated a paper to the rest of you, just to share this view, giving an alternative noninflationary full employment rate, which we estimate to be somewhere between the high 5 percent [to] low 6 percent area, maybe centered on 6 percent That's based on a lot of detail I won't go into, but it [involves] all the factors going into the changes in the composition and behavior of the labor force I asked our staff to  -33-    2/4-5/80  make a computation of what the high employment surplus would be if one assumed a 6 percent unemployment rate, and it produces some radically different figures For 1980 the high employment budget surplus, [as calculated] officially by the Administration, is said to be $4 billion But using the 6 percent unemployment rate figure, we come up with a deficit of $20 billion Furthermore, off-budget financing, which as I understand it is not included in this high employment budget surplus calculation, would add another $17 billion So looking at it in this alternative way, I can see the possibility of fiscal stimulus to the tune of $37 billion even on a so-called high employment basis, defined as 6 percent in this calendar year And that, by the same reasoning, translates into a surplus of $12 billion in 1981 The reason I went through this exercise was to get a different view, depending on one's assumptions, of whether we have real fiscal stimulus or fiscal restraint or how fast we are moving from one to the other It nets out for this year, certainly in my view, to a pretty sizable fiscal stimulus rather than the restraint officially forecast And I think that has a pretty broad bearing on appropriate monetary policy   Yes In my calculation, it changes from a $37 billion stimulus on the high employment basis, which adds in off- budget financing of $17 billion and assumes a 6 percent noninflationary full employment rate in fiscal 1980, to a $12 billion surplus in fiscal 1981 Now that is quite a movement But it starts late this calendar year and [continues] into 1981   I'd have to turn to Mike [Keran] Do you have a figure readily at hand on what we assumed for normal growth of GNP? I am not sure we assumed [something on] that   Well, it falls out of the 6 percent unemployment assumption--a certain growth in the labor force, a certain growth in productivity, and that kind of thing   He may have a figure; I don't have it readily at hand We'll get it for you later   Turning to the other questions you raised, Mr Chairman Our staff forecast for the economy for this year is quite similar to the forecast of the Board's staff, showing a decline in real GNP from the fourth quarter 1979 to the fourth quarter 1980 of exactly the same amount, 21 percent We have the CPI going up by 111 percent from the fourth quarter to the fourth quarter Sir?   No, that's from fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter Our figures show in the fourth quarter of this year a rate of 97 percent That is our staff view; I am not that optimistic That is where our two staffs differ The Board's staff sees a continued rise in the inflation rate through part of this year; our staff has a more optimistic assumption that we're at or near the peak right now   Right, but I was thinking of their trend line on the GNP deflator, which is going up for a while Our unemployment rate by the fourth quarter of this year is almost the same as theirs; ours is 76 and they're showing 77 percent The difference in our views is that our staff is more optimistic with respect to a fairly strong bounceback in calendar year 1981, which I hope is right, up to growth of 4 percent plus, whereas the Board's staff is looking for 1981 real growth of only 26 percent I am giving the staff views of our Bank My own personal instincts are that we're probably going to have more inflation and less decline in real output than the research staff at our Bank expects That's based on pure hunch or instincts as to what is going on in the way of a semi-wartime economy here And my pessimism on the inflation rate--my view being worse than either staff is forecasting--comes among other things from what has been going on in long-term bond markets in this past month, which I find extremely discouraging People are putting their money where their mouth is really in anticipation To me that is a very dangerous signal of a rejuvenation of inflationary expectations And it is discouraging especially in view of our demonstrated good track record since October 6th in getting a genuine, observable, real deceleration in the money supply, which I had assumed would impact favorably on inflation expectations and hence on long-term bond rates Yet despite what we have done, we have seen a move in the long-term bond yield, which I view as a good index of inflation expectations, back up to a new high So I'm very concerned that we adopt a posture that is a strong signal of continued deceleration of monetary growth because that is the only tool we have to combat these recently renewed rising inflation expectations   No, sir I support your view 100 percent   I agree with those who have argued, starting with Governor Teeters and others, that in view of all the economic uncertainty, we do need a lot of flexibility as the year unfolds And for reasons that Chuck has just reviewed, I would support the idea of having a 3-point range As I often do when we get to this time of the year, I like to speak to the two faces of the ranges that we are discussing here The one face is the public reaction or the announcement effects, for what they are worth They may not be worth a lot, but I can't believe they have no effects at all I admit, as Ted Truman pointed out to us yesterday, that the public pays more attention to what we do than to what we say we are going to do But reverting to my earlier deep concern about an apparent re-escalation of inflationary expectations over the last month--[manifested] in various ways, especially in the rise of long-term bond yields to new highs, as I pointed out--I think there is a lot to be said for picking ranges just in terms of public announcement effects that are both broad, because as I have already indicated we need the flexibility in view of the economic uncertainty that lies ahead, and that would tend to ensure that we do in fact get continued deceleration in monetary growth Our record since October has, in fact, been very good on that But I am afraid that there's some skepticism among market participants and others that we may not persist One way of putting that skepticism to bed, or at least helping to diminish it, would be  -48-    2/4-5/80  to have upper limits on our ranges which even if hit would still involve slightly less monetary growth in 1980 than in 1979 For that reason, I would support alternative II with respect to both M-1A and M-1B because even if we hit the upper end of 6-1/2 percent in the case of M-1A, that would be less than the 68 percent growth of last year And even if we hit the upper end of the alternative II range of 4 to 7 percent for M-1B, growth would be less than the 8 percent growth we had last year And for the same reasons, I would choose the alternative III ranges for M2 and M3 The upper end of the alternative III range for M2 is 8-1/2 percent, below last year's 88 percent actual In the case of M3, the alternative III range of 6 to 9 percent is below the 9-1/2 percent actual we had last year So if there is any sense at all in what I am saying about the public perception of the maximum [rates of growth] we specify, assuming that under our new operating procedures we didn't exceed the upper limits of the ranges, those upper limits would involve at least a 1/2 point decline from the actual rates of monetary growth in 1979 As for whether we should target all four of these, Mr Chairman, I have grave doubts I think M-1A is still so influenced--or perhaps contaminated, to use a word my research staff is fond of using--by past and ongoing institutional changes that I personally would be prepared to drop it right now and put our faith in M-1B   Well, in short, I would like to make a pitch for targeting M-1B and M2 as opposed to targeting M-1A and M-1B, [as suggested] in the draft directive language Our own experience in the past has led us to place somewhat more confidence, in terms of the old definitions, in M2 as a predictor of inflation and real GNP Of course, it remains to be seen whether that is going to hold for the new M2 But based on some of the statistical tests that we've done, M-1A is certainly the least reliable predictor of real GNP of the four aggregates mentioned The differences are quite significant, and that's why I am somewhat disillusioned about M-1A We've tested it retrospectively and view it as a considerably poor forecaster of future real GNP That is the main reason I would like to drop it Those are my recommendations, Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman, just as a response to that I assume from the Bluebook, Steve, that these different alternatives were set forth on the assumption that we would not get nationwide NOW accounts   If we do get them, we'll obviously have to go back to the drawing board   Mr Chairman, this will just be--   Really, between the one or the other--   I want the top of the range at least moderately below   I would be interested in the vote on my proposal I didn't see a show of hands yet   My presumption, Mr Chairman, is that of course we would aim for the midpoint, but I would also very quickly add that in view of all the uncertainty we would want to be able to move either way, including to the top of the range I think we ought to keep that flexibility   That runs counter to a clear majority view about keeping a wide range   How many was that, sir?  SPEAKER(?) Six   Well, I tried, Mr Chairman   My next move would be to alternative III   This is a question of fact, Mr Chairman What impressions do you have as to whether the Congressional Committee considers the ranges as having a very strong implication that we'll move toward the midpoint? I haven't gathered that that was true in the past; we have ranges with the precise idea of being flexible In- house we may well aim for a midpoint But in terms of the Congress, is my impression wrong that they look on these as ranges we feel free to utilize fully depending on unfolding conditions?   There seems to be a feeling around the table here that if we adopt alternative III, we're struck with the midpoints I don't think we are, frankly   What's the purpose of having the range?   What was M-1A, please?   Just a comment on that, Mr Chairman The reason I was turned off by alternative II for M2 and M3 is that if we went for the upper end of that range, which I presume we could, that would result in no decrease at all in the growth rates of those two magnitudes for 1980 from what we experienced in 1979   What was the vote on the last one, Murray?   Mr Chairman, if it's your preference to state this as ranges of 4 to 5 percent and 4-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent, is the implication that the Desk would aim for the midpoint?   With the understanding, whether it's in the record or not, that we would in fact [aim] for the midpoint, I for one would find it acceptable My preference would be to be a little more precise in the instructions to the Desk as to what to aim for and recognize that we might not be able to hit it "
1340,1980-03-18," [Unintelligible] keep the level of borrowed reserves at about what we would hope to have it And to the surprise of most, if not all of us, the necessity of frequent adjustments just  -10-    3/18/80  didn't come along for a long time It looks as if perhaps February might have been the month when it could have been used The question, as you look back in a little post-mortem, Peter, is whether it would have made any difference Would it have helped the cause, so to speak, in preventing total reserves from getting too big, if we had done what we thought we would have to do on that October 6 game plan, which is to put the discount rate up?   One other question, Mr Chairman I would like to ask Steve something in this case, in conjunction with the Bluebook alternatives Steve, would it be reasonable or even feasible for the staff to attempt to estimate a level of the discount rate that would be consistent with the money growth targets?   Well, if I could, I'd just raise one more point In asking my own staff to review what went on during that February period, it seemed pretty clear to us that the staff here and in New York had done a fine job of guessing what the multiplier was going to be, what the total reserves should be, and what the nonborrowed path should be There was very fine work on that Yet the net outcome was that total reserves got out of hand on the up side for a while What I am trying to get to the bottom of, with the benefit of hindsight, is how you and Peter now think that could be headed off in the future   At times like this, Mr Chairman, regional differences do show up rather starkly West of the Rockies there are  -26-    3/18/80  precious few signs of any present or impending recession, particularly as our directors view [the situation] With the obvious exception of housing and autos, things seem to be moving along at a very rapid rate There is continued strength in consumer spending; it's almost hard to believe I believe much of that still reflects a ""buy it now before it gets more expensive"" approach Labor demand in defense- related industries and high technology industries such as electronics and aerospace is contributing to continued strength in employment in the District Loan demand remains strong at banks and, despite the recent flooding in California, agriculture all around the West seems to be in pretty good shape I think the difference between West of the Rockies and what Mark was reporting probably stems from the predominance of large branch systems around the West I know that in California our three largest banks are among the three largest agricultural lenders anywhere in the country And, of course, a good part of that lending is to agri-business, but they take reasonably good care of the smaller farmers as well--to the extent that we have some of those around the West, and we do Demand for lumber you'd think would be falling out of bed because of housing, and yet exports to the Pacific Basin area have made up a good part of that So, in short, while this may not be applicable to the national scene, our directors just don't see any signs of recession in our part of the country nor do they believe one is ahead for the regional economy With regard to the national scene, it's obviously a different picture   True Well, with regard to the Bluebook alternatives, I can't really add much to what has already been said All things considered, I would agree with much of what Willis Winn mentioned One more month like February and our credibility is going to be in bad shape We recently had the first of the ABA/FRB seminars, which originally was supposed to cover the subject of regulation under that plan that you encouraged us to get into We had, I thought, a very good meeting We had a number of people from the Board as principal speakers, some of the division directors and also Governor Wallich as a principal speaker on monetary policy We got quite a bit of flak as I remember, Henry There was quite a bit of skepticism expressed in that audience about whether we were going to stick to our announced target of ongoing restraint because of what those February numbers were showing--and they were aware of them by then--on the money supply Another month like that would really undermine our credibility a great deal, so I share Willis' view about doing something about the April bulge if we can And I think we probably should In general, however, I would go along with the specs in alternative B "
1363,1980-04-22," Peter, I'm very curious about what happened to the expected April bulge As you know, the Committee was concerned that it not be allowed to happen I'm not quite sure we were looking forward to a negative bulge Do you have any insights into what was going on?   You can't believe in anything anymore, can you?   I heard Chuck mutter under his breath that it might have something to do with the weakness in the economy   I don't know that I can add much to the comments of my three colleagues to my right except to say that I'm essentially in agreement with them It certainly took a great deal of courage for this Committee to let interest rates rise to these extraordinary  -15-    4/22/80  levels that we've seen, and I think that was the right thing to do I'm beginning to see encouraging signs, at least, that we've broken the back of inflationary expectations I think we should be equally courageous on the other side, while sticking to our monetary targets If that implies that interest rates are going to decline, that doesn't bother me one bit As far as the foreign exchange value of the dollar is concerned, I've never believed--and I don't think it's the view of this Committee--that some given level of the dollar is an objective in and of itself Obviously, we want to prevent disorderly changes from one level to another But as far as interest rates coming down being an implication of sticking to our present monetary targets, that certainly wouldn't bother me in the short run because of the extraordinarily high levels from which they'd be declining Our credibility would be badly undermined, as others here have said, if we abandoned the monetary growth targets and went back to some implicit view of a proper level of interest rates I think we can and should persuade the market that what we're doing is a steady state course here; and if one implication of that is declining interest rates, so much the better That will teach them that we can operate on both sides of this market Personally I wouldn't be very much concerned about the implications of declining rates in the near future if we stick to these present targets   Unfortunately, it hasn't worked that way over extended periods in the past, for example in the summer of 1979 and a good part of '76 and '77 We have a long history of sustained overshoots and undershoots, and that's what I think we have to guard against now "
1385,1980-04-29," This is John Balles, Mr Chairman I fully associate myself with Chuck's views, particularly given the fact that this big April decline follows hard on the heels of a March decline In view of that, we've got to view with considerable skepticism if not alarm, the projections that call for a revival of monetary growth in May and June I hope it happens But I think we've got to guard against it not happening at this point And really, to come down to the 13 percent lower limit we've set for ourselves would not disturb me since 13 percent in absolute terms is still pretty high "
1404,1980-05-06," Paul, this is John Balles I would go along with moving the floor down to 11 percent; I think we have to take [whatever steps] we have to take to get the money supply turned around But, having said that, I do want to convey to you the strong feeling that was expressed to me over the past week when I met with several members of our board of directors I've written you a letter, which probably hasn't landed on your desk yet, hoping and urging that you would find an appropriate occasion to make a strong public statement as to why we have not resisted this decline of interest rates [I'd urge you to say] that it does not mean we're [abandoning our] anti-inflation fight and to explain that it's to head off the unexpected and undesired absolute shrinking of the money supply In short, these directors feel that there's a great danger of a broad- based public misunderstanding of what we're up to that may be interpreted as an easing of our anti-inflation policy and may result in some bad effects on inflation psychology   Paul, would this be an appropriate time to spend a few minutes on the discount rate?    5/6/80   If we go down to 10-1/2 percent on the funds rate, that's going to make the basic discount rate a real penalty  SPEAKER(?) Yes, we'll consider that Thursday "
1424,1980-05-20," Mr Chairman, before we try to make a decision on ""B"" or something else, I'd like to ask a question of the staff Do you, Steve, or any of your colleagues, have a judgment as to the extent to which the special credit restraint program of March 14-- otherwise known in some sections of the country as ""Jaws II""--might be a very inhibiting factor in getting back to path? We have scared off a lot of bankers around the country [by] having them appear before Vice Chairman Schultz with their boards of directors and submit daily reports and all sorts of other things Unless we ""unscare"" them pretty quickly, I'm concerned that, while it's always hard to push on the string, in this case it will be impossible I've given you my view I was really asking for yours   If I can end my comment, Mr Chairman I suspect the March 14th programs--this is just an intuitive feeling on my part--have done the job that we hoped they would do, and that was essentially to break the back of inflationary psychology Therefore, I think those programs have outlived their usefulness and they will simply get in our way if we try to restore monetary growth, whether to the lower end of the range or the middle of the range by September or December I hope some very serious consideration will be given to how quickly [the economy] can unwind from those programs My instincts are to go along with the alternative B target and to get that restoration done more quickly than by the end of the year That's about the way I would come out But I fear that the credit restraint programs, unless visibly relaxed--I know you alluded to that possibility in public--are simply going to be one more inhibiting factor getting in our way "
1447,1980-06-05," I would certainly concur, Mr Chairman   On the West Coast the housing industry is still very much in the doldrums Some possible revival remains a hope and an expectation rather than a fact because mortgage rates haven't come down enough yet to really do the job   Probably at the 12 percent level, or 12-1/4   Not very much "
1470,1980-07-09," Mr Chairman, that was a fine presentation I have only two questions One has to try to put monetary policy in the context with the thrust of fiscal policy, and in the first section of your report you have a table on the federal budget and also one on the high employment budget My question has to do specifically with the high employment budget assumptions We've had some discussion of this before, Jerry, as you surely remember To refresh my recollection, what unemployment rate are you assuming here?   And this uses the official one?   Well, as you know, this calculation is very sensitive to differences in the unemployment rate assumption A lot of observers, including my staff, think that the non-inflationary full employment rate is somewhat higher than 51 percent and may be closer to 6 percent Have you made any alternative calculations? What would happen if you assume 6 percent, for example?   Well, by how much is the question, Chuck I'm trying to get some range of estimates here as to how restrictive fiscal policy is going to be and I doubt that it's going to be as restrictive, in terms of the level, as what the staff shows What I was trying to find out is what the level would be with a 6 percent assumption   Okay Maybe we can talk about that later   If I may, Mr Chairman, I have one more question It's related to the chart entitled ""Domestic Nonfinancial Sectors,"" the opening chart in the fourth section I'm particularly interested in the reality of what will be going on in financial markets in terms of federal borrowing, broadly defined The red bars on the chart show federal borrowings Did I understand you to say that that is on the unified budget basis? In other words, what I'm trying to get at is Does it include that very large and growing amount of off-budget activities--the mortgage pool, the government sponsored enterprises, and what have you?   It does include the off-budget?   How much bigger would the number be if you included the so-called privately owned, government-sponsored enterprises and the mortgage pools? I have a hunch it would be considerably bigger, but I'm not sure   That makes a difference, doesn't it?   Thank you   Mr Chairman, earlier on you raised the question of the Proxmire resolution and didn't get much of a response I was mulling over the opportunities as well as the risks of supporting that resolution and I would come out recommending that you support it if you're forced to take a position If at some future date the Congress goes down the road that you fear it might and begins talking about setting interest rate levels, we could resist that kind of resolution at the appropriate time To resist the current proposed resolution I think would be a mistake Such a resolution would strengthen our hand in terms of not following a usual vigorous countercyclical policy in view of the ongoing very serious nature of inflation   Yes, I think that would be wise The dilemma that you so well described earlier is going to come home to roost, obviously, in your testimony I agree with a number of other observations made around the table a little earlier that the markets, both domestic and international, are going to be extraordinarily sensitive to all the nuances of what you have to say And I think it is quite important to separate policymaking from public perceptions at this point because the impact of the announced ranges on inflation psychology and what is assumed to be the course of actual growth is going to be extraordinarily important I certainly agree that we  -40-    7/9/80  ought to resist any narrowing of those ranges, if you get pushed into speaking to that either in your testimony or in response to questions We should try to keep the maximum flexibility because of all the changes going on both in the economy and in financial innovations; with nationwide NOW accounts pending we are going to need that flexibility I am sure  You asked us to speak about assumptions on tax cuts and wage- price policy I am pretty cynical regarding the ability of wage-price policy, if it's continued, to do anything realistic to change the way the world runs If I were a betting man, I'd bet that there will be a tax cut sometime in '81 If we have an opportunity to speak to how it ought to be structured, I would certainly support the statements others on the Committee have made that we ought to aim for tax reform designed to stimulate productivity and capital investment and take the edge off the impact of high and rising payroll taxes My own hunch is that there is going to be little, if any, real restraint on the fiscal policy side in terms of the actual budget or even the high employment budget That's because if you look back at what happened to the unemployment rate during this period of expansion that ended last January, we never even got close to getting down to a 51 percent unemployment rate So I think that rate is very unrealistic when calculating the impact of a full employment budget That leads me to the conclusion that monetary policy is still about the only game in town in terms of exerting any anti-inflation effect But we are faced with the usual dilemma that there is a long lag between the time we move toward restraint and when it shows up on the price front, which may not be until several years from now  Having wrestled with whether or not to change the ranges, I think we would be well-advised just to keep the present ranges and not change their width either There would be too many problems to explain if we begin tinkering with the ranges for 1980; therefore, I would [support] the views already expressed not to fuss with them But, of course, in terms of policymaking in future months, we want to reserve for ourselves the right not to hit the present midpoints for all the reasons that have been set forth  With respect to 1981, I would also agree with the view expressed earlier by many other speakers that we should avoid getting overly specific and try to avoid getting pinned down to explicit numbers, especially in view of all the uncertainties connected with the impact of pending nationwide NOW accounts I favor keeping [our targets for] 1981 as much as possible in qualitative terms but I hope on balance that your testimony would imply, if not make explicitly plain, that in terms of longer-run strategy we are still working very hard at getting the inflation rate down, even if that involves more aggregate growth for next year than we may have for this year That's about all I have on that   Mr Chairman, I would like to emphasize what Governor Teeters said There's a real trap in setting M2 targets that we think we can achieve because, with these new monetary instruments, we can't As Steve just pointed out, M2 is loaded with [components] over which we don't have even indirect control--the money market funds, overnight Eurodollars, RPs, and what have you I think that's a real snare that we ought to be very cautious about   Well, we have a difference of opinion That's what makes horse races and stock markets   It depends upon how many nuts you threw into that waffle!   Paul, there's another phrase you might want to use and that is ""It's the present intent of the Committee""   Well, it is an opportunity, Mr Chairman, for educating the [Congressional] Committee about the long run "
1496,1980-07-25, San Francisco also   San Francisco is for 1/2 
1515,1980-08-12," How would you do it, Lyle?   What specific things would you like to see done, Lyle?   What would you do?   I would like to ask Peter a question at this point If we were to go along with the Banking Committee proposal to tie the discount rate to market rates, how do you see that affecting your ability to carry out the Committee's directive?   One can also be judgmental rather than automatic in a formula We could have a basket of rates but not reduce [the relationship] to a simple formula We could vary the relation between the basket and our rate if we wanted to go the tying route, I think   It seems to me, Mr Chairman, that we have a good news/bad news syndrome here today In terms of recent economic statistics as well as the updated and revised forecasts of both the Board's staff and our own staff at San Francisco, we see a better outlook for the economy and better news on the unemployment front But both sets of forecasts show a worsening picture on inflation   No I mean both staffs are now forecasting more inflation, less decline in real GNP, a shorter period for the recession, and less of a rise in the unemployment rate than they were a month ago   No   I find no quarrel with the general thrust of their updated forecast relative to where they stood a month ago It's better on the real side, better on unemployment, and worse on inflation To put our current recession in some perspective, for what it may be worth, we went back and looked at the behavior of prices during the last two recessions We looked at the behavior of the GNP deflator--and I had forgotten this, frankly--but it turned out that at the end of the last recession, the GNP deflator was no better than it had been at the beginning of the recession That was also true of the recession prior to that In fact for the 1974-75 segment, it was four quarters after the trough of the recession that the inflation rate, as  -17-    8/12/80  measured by the GNP deflator, hit its low point Now, if I look at what seems to lie ahead--if the Board's staff and my staff are correct that this dip in the economy will be over by the fourth quarter of this year and we will then be into the next expansion phase, as weak and anemic as it may be--to the [projected] GNP deflator by the end of '81, which is four quarters after the now projected trough of the recession, I get very disturbed indeed The Board's staff shows the GNP deflator still rising at an 87 percent annual rate My staff would be a bit more optimistic But that's an awfully high inflation rate to have at the beginning of the next expansion phase of the cycle  Also, with respect to the comments a little earlier on where long-term rates are headed, with special attention to the mortgage rate, I am distressed to see how high those rates are forecast to be But I am also convinced that we won't get those rates lower than that 12 to 13 plus percent for both the corporate bond issues as well as mortgage rates until we get the inflation rate down Obviously, long- term interest rates are very heavily influenced by both actual and expected inflation I think we have a real dilemma here   I'd like to present the case for alternative B The dilemma that I described earlier might be put in a little broader context If you remember, last spring quite a few of us were a little worried about the undershoots in the aggregates and the fact that failure to achieve [our objectives for] them might unnecessarily and considerably exacerbate the recession that was then under way I've been pleased, of course, by the catchup in the aggregates produced in the June and July figures--and they're pretty solid--and in the projected August figures I suppose part of what determines how one comes out here depends on one's reading of the tea leaves on the business outlook but also on the judgments one makes as to which M is the lesser of the evils in terms of its reliability as a predictor I have to say that on the outlook I came out much closer to the views Governor Gramley has articulated than the opposite view And with respect to M-1A versus M-1B versus M2, the research that we've done at our Bank indicates that M-1B is a better predictor of future price movements than M-1A Now, they're both obviously contaminated to some extent, but I think M-1B is less so than M-1A For that reason, and because of the failure to achieve any significant progress thus far on the inflation front--especially if one looks at the staff's forecast on where inflation will be by the end of 1981--I am very concerned So, all things considered--in view of the catchup we've now had on the Ms and in view of what I consider to be a less gloomy or, if you like, a more optimistic outlook in terms of the recession being shorter and shallower than we had earlier expected-- I'd begin to shade [money growth down] a little now Speaking for this year as a whole, I'd move broadly in the direction of aiming somewhere in the lower part-- certainly at or below the midpoint--of the range we have set for M-1B, which I would consider the most reliable of the three Ms for the moment That may change next year when we get NOW accounts But I wouldn't be unhappy if we reduced our sights a shade and tried [for growth in] M-1B at what we had said in July would be our target for the third quarter, which is around 8 percent So ""B"" or ""B minus"" would be the way I would lean, Mr Chairman  -31-    8/12/80   Yes I'd like about 8 percent for M-1B for the June-to-September quarter "
1554,1980-09-16," Jim's answer to your question, Mr Chairman, reminds me about a forecaster friend of mine who was quoted in the paper recently on the outlook as saying that he had a whole pile of numbers in front of him and they were all useless It is frustrating when one hears all the scenarios that could develop--the double-dip, the L, and so forth But cutting through all that, if one looks back three or four months ago and considers the divergence of opinion then, there may be a little more unanimity on what is really going on or likely to go on than there was earlier, for whatever that may be worth What seems to be showing through, particularly in comparison with the expectations of last spring, is that almost everybody would agree that the recession is going to be shorter than expected--that's the good news--and that inflation is going to be worse than expected, which is the bad news And I know a few that I would consider to be reputable forecasters who are forecasting a boom in 1981 And therein lies our real dilemma As I look at the Board staff's forecast on real GNP and the implicit price deflator and the unemployment rate-- and our staff forecast is not significantly different on any one of those--the inflation picture is certainly discouraging, particularly in terms of past cyclical experience You will recall that in the last recession the GNP deflator stood at 106 percent at the trough, the first quarter of '75 But a year later it was about half that amount We really made progress in the four quarters after the trough of the recession If one tracks [the progress] in previous recessions, [the pattern] is essentially the same The real dilemma for us on the policy side is posed by the inflation numbers we are looking at in this forecast, where one year after the presumed trough of the recession, which is the fourth quarter of this year, we still have an implicit deflator of 88 percent, an unemployment rate of 83 percent and a real growth rate of somewhere around 2 percent The question it poses is How much, in fact, can demand management do to change this? I'm not happy about what I consider a reversed mix of monetary and fiscal policy that seems to be shaping up; I would share Governor Wallich's feeling on that But as long as we have this kind of inflation outlook, which is certainly too high to be socially or economically acceptable--and ditto on the unemployment rate--it would be hard for me to favor a tax cut for the reasons that have already  -21-    9/16/80  been set forth I cannot support a tax cut in view of the outlook for persistently high inflation unless or until the federal budget gets changed in a way I don't think it is going to get changed I think we are stuck being the only game in town in terms of gradually bringing some pressure to bear on the inflation problem And as much as I would like to see tax reform, tax reduction net, I share your view that it's something we shouldn't encourage in the near future   I just wanted to ask Steve a question, following up on an observation you made a little earlier, Mr Chairman As you know, Steve, there have been some pretty large underforecasts in the Bluebooks we had at the time versus how things turned out for June, July, and August I just wondered what makes you so optimistic, as it were, that we are going to get very slow money growth in September?   I pretty much share the feelings expressed by Governor Wallich and Messrs Guffey and Morris in that ""B"" is the maximum that I would like to see us go We are all torn between the risk on the one hand of choking off recovery with too great a rise in interest rates and the danger on the other hand that we will make no significant progress on inflation My first preference would be to lean against the inflation problem a bit harder by what I would call a ""B-minus"" I wouldn't be unhappy if the specifications of ""B"" were reduced somewhat to avoid overshooting for the year as a whole, which I think we could come pretty close to given the range of error and how things go Dave Eastburn mentioned 4-1/4 percent for M-1B I had jotted down 4-1/2 percent for the August-to-December target That would give us growth of 56 percent in M-1B for the year as a whole, pretty close to the upper end of the range I think somewhere between ""B"" and ""B-minus"" is the lesser of the evils, considering the two different evils we have to avoid "
1578,1980-10-21," I just wanted to ask Scott about a very interesting development I noticed As I recall from the reports, Scott, for the first time since 1971 you've made some outright purchases in the forward market I was just wondering if in your view that kind of intervention in the forward market has any more stabilizing influence on exchange rates than outright purchases in the spot market?   In listening to this discussion, Mr Chairman, a question did occur to me that I wanted to ask Steve As you recall, a year ago when we got into this new plan, we all anticipated a need to adjust the discount rate with great frequency To our considerable surprise, at least to most of us, that turned out not to be true for quite some time In looking back on the experience since June, when we had this big surge [in money growth]--actually now June through October--do you have any feeling, Steve, that had we been more flexible on the discount rate we might have headed off some of the net overshoot in total reserves? I gather that what has really gone on is that the multiplier has worked out pretty well but we've come in with more reserves after the fact than had been planned before the fact; and most of that was accounted for by a higher level of borrowing than was in the plan at the start when we projected the nonborrowed reserve path What good would it have done, if you have a view, to have manipulated the discount rate more in this period?  -19-    10/21/80   First, I have just a very brief comment on the business outlook On the West Coast we have had little evidence of recession except for the housing industry and auto purchases and so on Given that this is the year of really cruel dilemmas, I was particularly interested in the views of two of our branch chairmen who happen to run big lumber companies and another head office chairman who is a big operator in the construction business Obviously, they have a direct interest in not seeing mortgage rates get so high that they cut off their own businesses We had a pretty extensive discussion of what the alternatives and the problems are Interestingly enough, all three of these guys came out expressing the view that we are really faced with a dreadful set of choices Either we price people out of the housing market temporarily through higher interest rates or, even worse, price them out of the market for the longer run through inflation And if their diagnosis is correct, they are willing to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune as it were by seeing mortgage rates go up at the present time, hopefully on a temporary basis, to get inflation under control  As far as the immediate economic outlook is concerned, our staff forecast doesn't differ too much from the Board staff's except that we expect somewhat more growth in the months immediately ahead All of us were surprised by the bounceback in real GNP in the third quarter; we underestimated that, and I'm hoping we may see somewhat more GNP growth in the fourth quarter But the differences between our staff views and those of the Board staff are not all that great I am getting increasingly concerned that the economy has been subject to some exogenous shocks that have the effect of increasing inflation expectations--such things as the Middle East war and the talk coming from both parties about big tax cuts either before, or probably more likely, after the election As people think about the implications of that in terms of bigger budget deficits, I think that has had the effect of increasing inflation expectations My real fear is that if we should have a significant overshoot in our targets for this year, we ourselves will become a source of rising inflation expectations  Now, looking back over the year as a whole, I think we've had until recently at least a pretty credible record That is to say the shortfall in money in the spring was one which we offset--in my view quite properly, and I was in favor of doing it--by efforts to catch up And through August I felt pretty comfortable about that because by August we had caught up and were roughly back in the middle of our ranges for the various Ms I'm quite concerned, though, about what has happened in September and October and whether we're building to an overshoot that we aren't planning on but which may occur in any event At the last meeting I called attention to the fact that it is very  -36-    10/21/80  troublesome, I'm sure, from the staff's point of view that for each of the months June, July, and August they initially had substantially underestimated how much monetary growth there was going to be I have that same fear now about October We have now had three estimates of October monetary growth, and each one has been higher than the preceding one And I fear that before the month is over we may have another outcome like September, in which case there won't be any hope of our coming even close to the upper end of our ranges So, given recent economic developments that portend some rebound from the recession, which is the good news, and given the persistence of the bad news that there has been almost no measurable progress on inflation, I'd be inclined to tilt more toward combatting the latter problem and would move toward alternative A Indeed, I think there is some merit in the [unintelligible] inflation that some people have spoken of So if there were an ""A plus,"" that would be my choice   What was your federal funds range, Paul? "
1603,1980-11-18," Mr Chairman, I wonder if I could ask Scott a question I would be interested, Scott, in your views on the divergent trend between the spot and the forward rates last month The dollar rose by an average of 11 percent against six major countries on a trade-weighted basis But the forward rate for one year went down by about 3 percent And the longer-term forward rate went down about 1 percent What do you make of that divergent trend?   Mr Chairman, only half in jest, I would like to suggest that this would be a good excuse to stop publishing weekly figures at all and to publish them about once a month I am more convinced that these weekly numbers create more mischief than they do good Is that doable at all under the Freedom of Information Act?   That would appear to me to be a viable way out of this trap, Tony   That's what I am concerned about Surely, there can't be anything that says we have to publish bad numbers We have been faced with enormous changes, such as social security changes and government pay increases and so forth, that have created real suspicion about the meaning of the numbers we are churning out, despite the best job that the staff can do I am sure that the staff is doing their best on these weekly seasonals, but they have to be the wildest, most unreliable things that we--   It's the market that is reacting to them, though, not us   One final point, if I may, Mr Chairman I have been impressed with the ingenuity of the Board's legal staff in finding ways around the date in the Monetary Control Act on which reserve requirements would have to be put into effect I hope they will exercise that same ingenuity with respect to our purported responsibility under the Freedom of Information Act to put out weekly money supply figures I hope that issue can be examined in depth   Mr Chairman, after listening to this dialogue, I wish we had the option of saying none of the above relative to ""A,"" ""B,"" and ""C,"" because there doesn't seem to be a good answer Broadly speaking, the dilemma that we've been faced with for some months has gotten worse In a sense, we are still the only game in town in terms of an anti-inflation policy Despite the election, if one looks at bond yields, inflation expectations haven't gone down The fact that the forward rate on the dollar has actually gone down may indicate that inflation expectations in the view of foreigners have gotten worse And while I continue to hope month by month, as does Steve, that these higher interest rates will result in some downward shift in the demand for money, I see a contrary trend going on I think we are going to experience more of it because the cost of long-term money is so darn high that there is immense incentive on the part of businesses to borrow short--that is, in the commercial paper market or through banks--and that drives deposits up So I expect this recent surge in business loans to continue  As I see it, the really damaging thing to the economy is the height of long-term interest rates, and I don't see how we are going to get them down until inflation expectations come down and until the budget of the new Administration gets sorted out, which is going to be a source of uncertainty Meanwhile, we have to worry about whether our monetary growth rates themselves are becoming a source of inflation expectations, as some of my directors and a good many of the professors at our recent academic conference think is the case In view of all of this, I think it is too late in the year to aim for ""C,"" which is a meat ax tactic; so the next less damaging [posture] would be to stay pretty much with ""B"" as Messrs Morris, Guffey, and some others have said I wouldn't want to increase further the ranges that we are shooting for Furthermore, I would not be inclined to narrow the federal funds range, as some people have [suggested] I think 13 to 18 percent is a viable range to stay with, given all the uncertainties that we face  -35-    11/18/80   I have a hunch that our Horatio at the bridge act isn't really going to change unless or until the size of that budget deficit comes down, however it may be done Until then, we're under awful pressure   You're getting whacked, Mr Roos!  -52-    11/18/80   Paul, are we meeting here for the planning session? "
1647,1980-12-05," Paul, this is John Balles I would just like to be [a devil's advocate] for one minute It's not clear to me what we gain by [this] course [Why not] increase the upper limit instead of just telling the Desk it is permitted to exceed it for a week? Is it substantive or procedural or are there public relations aspects to this in terms of the public record later on or what? I don't quite understand this "
1667,1980-12-12," John Balles That sounds good to me  SPEAKER(?) I would buy that, too, this morning  SPEAKER(?) Okay   This is John Balles I wonder if I could ask Steve a question If you adjusted the original ranges for M-1A and B that we had, based on the 2-point spread that's developed instead of the 1/2 point you [previously] assumed, what would you say the revised ranges would be, Steve? "
1684,1980-12-18," Mr Chairman, Tony's statement has rather anticipated a question I was about to raise Ted Truman's paper was useful and interesting as far as it went But what I was hoping to find and didn't see--and I wanted some discussion around this table as a minimum if not a study paper--was something on the fundamental purposes of our intervention In Ted's memo, on the top of page 2, he sets forth three types of reasons for intervening The traditional aim, prior to 1978, of heading off disorderly conditions characterized by abrupt intra-day changes or wide spreads in bid and ask prices; a bit more than that--countering disorder, characterized by so-called  -12-    12/18-19/80  cumulative exchange rate changes that tend to feed on themselves; or thirdly, the disorder characterized by substantial exchange rate movements that carry rates to levels that are judged to be unrealistic in light of fundamental economic factors I gather, Tony, we have been more or less in that third mold since the crisis of November 1978 and the $30 billion support package that was put together at that time I'm really skeptical about making judgments that are counter to what the market is telling us Who makes those judgments and on what basis? I guess I'm being a devil's advocate here I think there's an awful temptation to substitute judgments for market forces The key question, since the dollar is in the very opposite position today from what it was on November 1, 1978 when it was very [weak], is whether this very broad intervention, which in my view is at least semi- pegging within a range, is still justified Is it necessary? Is it doing something positive for the national interest? What are the costs related to the benefits?   Well, first of all, I fully supported that November 1978 action, Tony I'm not questioning the need and necessity of that What I am somewhat skeptical about is whether we still need the same scale of resources today and ought to be [intervening as actively] in view of the strength of the dollar I'd make one other comment, if I can get it in here I have a suspicion, and that's about all it is at this point, that these foreign exchange operations may have more of an impact on domestic monetary policy than has been realized I mean that in the following sense I think we probably all view the exchange intervention operations as being in an aggregate sense, sterilized--that they aren't doing anything one way or another to affect the grand total of member bank reserves What we do on one side, we offset on the other side But by the same token, to the extent this intervention, this leaning against the wind to moderate the rise in the US dollar without affecting current monetary policy--if that should be the aim--succeeds in keeping the dollar below the level it would otherwise reach, then it follows, based on a study we're now doing but haven't completed, that it must also keep the level of US interest rates below what they otherwise would have been relative to interest rates abroad I'm talking about the size of the gap The size of the gap will be smaller either because US interest rates in an absolute sense are somewhat lower than they would have been or foreign interest rates are higher than they would have been And the reason I think that has to be the case is that the difference between the spot and the forward value of the dollar, based on our studies, tends to be very close to the US/ foreign interest rate differential One can track this, and it has been tracked by different people around the System, including the Board's staff as well as our staff And since that difference between the spot and the forward value follows very closely the two interest rate differentials, thus depressing the spot relative to the forward value, then our interest rates must be depressed relative to those abroad That is, the interest rate gap will be smaller  The next point in this line of argument is that, as we've tried to study what has happened to the demand for bank credit and the growth of monetary aggregates this year, we're beginning to believe that the fluctuations in the demand for business loans in this period have had a pretty considerable effect on the monetary base, the multiplier, and ultimately the target aggregates And if that view is correct--that the business community wants to stay out of the bond market when rates are exceedingly high as they are now--and turn to the banking system, as they've done massively, in demands for bank loans, they create the deposits and create a need for required reserves two weeks down the road We have to move in and supply the required reserves And to the extent that that business loan demand is based on the level of interest rates, and to the extent that intervention has, as we suspect, somewhat lowered the level of US interest rates, then the demand for bank loans gets even stronger, if there is any interest elasticity there at all  In a word, we have a suspicion that intervention keeps rates lower than they otherwise would have been and increases loan demands to higher levels than they otherwise would have been and probably results in more demand for money than would have been the case in the absence of [the intervention] In short, if this view is correct--and it still has to be confirmed by some more work--then intervention is not neutral in terms of its impact on domestic policy  -14-    12/18-19/80   I'd welcome comments on that suspicion It's not even a hypothesis yet   First, it is fairly obvious that the winds of change are blowing hard If the Administration proceeds, for example, with its widely publicized plan--I don't know whether it's a trial balloon or what--for possibly declaring a national economic emergency, we can hardly make firm decisions, and I know you don't intend to today, on 1981 targets We don't know what steps that plan might involve I suspect we will know a lot more when we reassemble in February about what lies ahead in terms of other parts of economic policy of the new Administration  My comments first on the near-term outlook I suspect we have already loosened some powerful potions of restraint; and I would expect a mild downturn in the first half of 1981, as does the Board staff Our staff does as well, although we are not quite as pessimistic in terms of the decline in real GNP as is the Board staff  -37-    12/18-19/80  But I suspect we are in for a decline and that it's too late to avoid it One thing, unfortunately, that we didn't see in the downturn earlier this year was any progress at all on the inflation front And that has to be a source of great concern Hopefully, as has already been expressed, we won't be the only game in town as we move into 1981 It could strengthen our hand somewhat if we got some better performance on the fiscal side  Moving to the various options that are open on which M to look at, this is a real horse and rabbit stew, and I don't have any magic answers But I do have some thoughts on which are the least undesirable, I guess   I'll give you the conclusion and then the supporting arguments All things considered, I would look mostly to M-1B The reason is that I think it's going to be less sensitive to the shifts out of demand and savings deposits than M-1A When we look at the New England experience, we find that in the aggregate--this may not be true case by case, as Frank has pointed out--that about two- thirds of the funds going into NOW accounts came from demand deposits and one-third came from savings On the basis of the national ATS experience, today it appears that about three-fourths came out of demand and one-fourth out of savings Based on some work we have been doing--   If you are talking about the national ATS experience, that's from the study we have done in our shop   The whole country   Yes, it does It will We'll be glad to share how we got there I don't have the time to get into the details now, but that's the way it looks to us We've also have been doing some work with demand for money equations based on data that go through 1979, which we are also about to circulate to the staff of the Board and the Reserve Banks And it looks to us as if the split will be more like 9/10ths out of demand and 1/10th out of savings These updated money demand equations give considerably different results than the ones that have been used heretofore by the Board staff And we'd be anxious to share the technical evidence with you and get your judgments on it  In any event, based on what I have seen so far, I'm leaning pretty strongly toward the view that M-1B is going to be more reliable by a considerable margin than M-1A By the same token and for the same reason that Frank stated, I am very suspicious about placing much reliance on M2 The big jump shown in the [M2] range in the Bluebook apparently Steve has based on what is expected to happen to interest  -38-    12/18-19/80  rates in 1981; at least that is my guess And, of course, what will in fact happen to interest rates is highly conjectural at this point I'm afraid we're in a situation where, with this big expansion we have had in the content of M2, that aggregate is going to be very interest sensitive In the days when we had the old M2, some of you may recall that I argued quite strongly on a number of occasions that M2 was a superior target to M1 I can no longer say that because of the interest sensitivity we have in the new M2; that's because it now includes money market mutual funds, for example Now, with regard to the ATS and NOW account issue, I don't think that source of uncertainty is as serious as some might believe, and I would come out pretty much where Frank did We can monitor the actual growth of the NOW accounts We can set ranges, which I think is what he was suggesting And I believe that's one of the options set forth in the Bluebook--that we abstract from the NOW account growth and then monitor the month-to-month developments in NOWs We could set the target within the range [for the year] based on incoming evidence on how NOWs are actually growing in practice   I'm not sure that we couldn't ask for information from a sample of banks, for example--   Well, Paul, it's better than nothing And the alternative is nothing   Yes, please do   Just to wind up my comments, I'm going to be interested to see if someone else can come up with something better than M-1B And I'd be willing to listen to the arguments for a reserve target Obviously we are choosing among the lesser of evils, and it's going to be a very difficult year Coming back for one more comment on the very near term As I said, I think we have already set loose some powerful forces of restraint and that is obviously showing up in key sectors of the economy like housing and autos And we've simply already missed our announced targets for [1980] I wouldn't take any Draconian action at this time to try to get back within them in a near-term timeframe In terms of the period immediately ahead, I would recommend the specs shown in the Bluebook under alternative B for November to March, and I wouldn't let the federal funds rate go any higher than 20 percent, which is where it seems to be right now   I don't think it tips our hand It just says if it happens, it happens and we won't resist it   Mr Chairman, because of the expectational effects, when will these minutes be published? Will they come out a month from now irrespective of whether we have a meeting [in January] or what?  -72-    12/18-19/80   That's an important consideration   Just right   Even for the long run, too   I'll mention that I'd go back to 25 years ago and add in tone and feel of the market and operate in bills only  -88-    12/18-19/80 "
1710,1981-02-02," Steve, are the X-11 program and other seasonal programs still showing about a 3-month span of time in which to suppress these random movements so that trend shows through? That was my recollection, but I haven't looked at that in a long time  Mr AXILROD They keep perfecting those programs, President Balles, and I'm not sure what that is   First of all, Mr Chairman, I would like to say that this whole study was quite impressive--it produced some very useful results--especially given the time constraints that the staff had to wrestle with, not to mention all the exogenous shocks [to] the economy as the year went on that they had to try to sort out My question at this point, Steve, is with respect to what I consider one of two parts of your summary memo You point out various options that the Committee might adopt if it wanted closer control over money You  -23-    2/2-3/81  mentioned adjusting the nonborrowed reserve path more quickly, using the discount rate more actively, and this rather extreme proposal with respect to the discount window--either to close it down altogether or open it altogether The latter option is pretty far out, so I'd like to concentrate on the first two I'd ask you in your judgment which one would be the more promising, since you have been so much involved in having to construct these paths That is, do you think it would be more feasible to adjust the nonborrowed reserve path more quickly and by greater amounts, or would you recommend that we do what we thought we were going to do in October of '79, which is to adjust the discount rate more actively?   Well, if I could pursue it just one more step As you reflect on our experience since October '79, if one had the opportunity to do things all over again, so to speak, and do them differently, would you recommend with this benefit of hindsight that we might have used the discount rate more actively? Or are you relatively satisfied with how things came out?   I know   Okay, I withdraw the question   Two minutes   Maybe I'd better keep it for after coffee   I'll try to do it in 90 seconds It seems to be a tough day here! Some of you have coffee  -29-    2/2-3/81   In Steve's summary of the key findings of this study, one of the points he made was that should the Committee desire closer monetary control than we had, let's say, in 1980, one of the prices that will have to be paid for that is greater interest rate volatility We've been doing some work, which if it continues to hold up under the test of actual experience, would offer a more hopeful outcome Dave Lindsey referred to the San Francisco money market model; during the lunch break I'll distribute a short 4-page memo that summarizes some of its key findings I'll just give a thumbnail sketch of it here Our model in effect provides some evidence that we would not get as much interest rate volatility as conventional money demand models would indicate if we were to aim at closer monetary control The reason, of course, is that the conventional models all have money demand as being quite interest inelastic and demand for bank reserves the same way Hence, we have to move interest rates over a wide [range] in order to get some results What we have done is to plug in the behavior of banks into this model, and bank demand for reserves is based on their own profit-maximizing actions In seeking to finance their loans in the least costly way they will adjust offering rates on managed liabilities; in their dealings with the public in doing this, transaction deposits are affected The bottom line is that we find that the demand for money and also the demand for bank reserves is more interest elastic than the conventional models would show   More interest elastic   The proof of the pudding, of course, is in the eating And it did happen that in 1980 this money market model incorporating the behavior of banks gave a much better fit in predicting both M-1A and M-1B The word of warning, of course, is one already given by Steve earlier That models work in some years and don't work in others So, it remains to be seen whether the favorable results we got in 1980 will hold up in 1981 and beyond Secondly, our findings indicate that this special credit control program of 1980 and all the stern talk of Vice Chairman Schultz that went along with it-- and maybe because of that stern talk--did have quite an impact on the behavior of bank loans And, in turn, that goes a long way in explaining these volatile movements of the aggregates  Well, I think the two most important implications of our staff study are (1) that closer monetary control, if we are right, would lead to noticeably less interest rate volatility than implied by conventional models; and (2) that many deviations of the monetary aggregates from target, which are usually attributed to a shift in the  -30-    2/2-3/81  money demand function instead can be caused by money supply shocks induced by such factors as volatility in bank loans The first conclusion suggests that we shouldn't let concerns about unacceptably large interest rate variability prevent us from responding perhaps more aggressively than we did in 1980 to deviations of the aggregates from target And the second point suggests that we should be less willing to accommodate such deviations because they often reflect money supply shocks and not always money demand shifts But, as I say, we'll distribute this at lunch time so you can read it and study it I hope you will find it worth taking a look at   I essentially agree with Chuck Partee on the reasons for staying with nonborrowed reserves as the operating target In practice we simply didn't or weren't willing to move the funds rate around The additional comments made on that same subject by Frank Morris and Bob Black I find myself in agreement with, too   Paul, I'd agree certainly with your conclusion that, especially given lagged reserve requirements, there's no practical way to get to a penalty rate But having agreed with that, I'm not at all certain that we--   But having agreed with that, I'm not convinced, as yet at least, that we need to have as big a gap as we see presently or have seen in recent months between the discount rate and the funds rate Maybe, especially with the benefit of hindsight, we ought to  -41-    2/2-3/81  dwell on whether it would have been feasible to close the gap somewhat I think that's a rather practical question because as we look back on 1980, in a technical sense, most of the misses on the aggregates came from overshoots or undershoots of borrowings that were not quickly or fully offset in the nonborrowed reserve path To some extent a more active discount rate policy of keeping at least closer in touch with the market might have headed off some of that I raise that as a question rather than a conclusion   I'd like to say, Mr Chairman, that I am intrigued by Governor Partee's suggestion I hope it will get some serious consideration I would not be in favor of dropping the range altogether, and that would be a way of getting out of the appearance of having a range I think it would give us a great deal of flexibility and we could make the decision meeting-by-meeting as to whether the [checkpoint] should be 300 or 200 or 400 basis points   I agree   May I ask, Mr Chairman, whether you're inferring that in your view we could get along without a range then?   There's a long lead time   That's because he doesn't know the facts of life   Right   Is there anybody around the table who remembers how things worked prior to 1968 with regard to the jiggles?   And the next question is who is not at least strongly--   Mr Chairman?   Could I say just one fast word? When the Board does consider this matter, I hope it will give serious consideration to Bob's proposal Among other things, it certainly would eliminate the frantic settlement dates that we would have under a one-week reserve period That would greatly diminish the burden on both the Reserve Banks and the reporting banks, if we could get what are said to be the advantages of CRA I view them as being moderately promising But to do it on the one-month basis rather than an every week basis I think has an awful lot of merit It certainly deserves more consideration in my view   Particularly in 1981 it would be pretty risky to bear down on just one aggregate But could we perhaps consider simplifying the family? I'm not sure, for example, whether as we go into 1981 it will still be necessary to track M-1A We know there are going to be some very massive shifts out of it because there already have been at least some It's going to look really weird to set up a target abstracting from changes, given what may show up in reality   Well, I guess differences of opinion make stock markets, horse races, and forecasts I lean toward the side of being a little more optimistic than the Board staff, showing a bit more real GNP growth and a bit less inflation for the year But [the differences] are certainly within the normal range of judgmental things that have to go into these forecasts I was mainly interested in asking Jim what he would consider the greatest point of vulnerability in this forecast Do you share my misgivings about any forecast now in view of the ongoing uncertainties about the new Administration's economic program and what it might do both on the spending side and the tax side? Is this forecast of yours, for example, very sensitive to significant changes in the tax rates or [government] spending levels? I don't know myself how to do a solid forecast in view of those uncertainties   The one thing that I find rather scary is the possibility that the tax reduction will come well in advance of the expenditure cuts, if the cuts come at all On that matter, the very first chart in the final set of charts that you presented shows federal borrowing relative to GNP Could I just ask whether the assumptions underlying the lower half of that chart assume tax cuts and expenditure cuts or what? And does it include the off-budget items?   Well, I'll just provide a quick little interesting piece of perspective here My staff checked some recently published forecasts by a number of major nationally known outfits such as Wharton, Evans, Michigan, UCLA, Townsend-Greenspan, DRI, and Chase I was surprised to find out--maybe you guys already knew it--that our Greenbook forecast is at the pessimistic end of the scale That is not to say that it's wrong, but it does show the lowest real GNP and the highest inflation   Well, like almost everyone else who has spoken here, as far as the takeoff point I certainly would use the actual growth rates for M-1A and M-1B that we achieved in 1980 and not try to correct for base drift With respect to M-1A and M-1B, alternative I is what I would support It does give credence to that very important perception problem that you've mentioned We at least have in mind, abstracting from shifts, a 1/2 point reduction on those two ranges I share Jerry Corrigan's misgivings about the M2 and M3 ranges being a little on the high side under that alternative I As I look back on a table here showing the differences month-by-month and cumulatively between M-1B and M2 for last year, it turns out that there was a 3 percentage point spread, bottom line, net It did fluctuate over the year; it bulged in the spring and since August the difference has varied between 2 and 3 percentage points I'd be prepared to be generous, based on last year's experience, and allow M2 to grow by 3 points more than M-1B Adding 3 points to the M-1B alternative I range would bring that to 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent versus the figures  -124-    2/2-3/81  shown under alternative I for M2 of 7 to 10 percent I'd be fairly strongly inclined to reduce that a bit It would have one advantage, among other things, of adding some credence to our gradual slowdown in the sense that if we specify a range of 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent as compared to the actual growth of 98 percent last year, at least the upper end of our range would be a touch under what we actually achieved in 1980 For much the same reason, I would reduce the M3 range by 1/2 point from the 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent shown under alternative I  In terms of how to display the actual results versus the results we would announce, abstracting from [shifts], I think the first point is absolutely viable--that we do have something comparable to last year As for how we get a translation device [for explaining] what is actually going on versus these ranges, abstracting from changes, it seems to me that some possibilities have been offered I'm not prepared to recommend this yet without some more staff study and some comment on feasibility by Steve, but in the Bluebook there are two very interesting charts following page 9, which simply give the ranges abstracting from changes and those including changes Based on my conviction that a picture is worth a thousand words, I'm simply suggesting the possibility as we go down the road month-by- month of showing those kinds of charts to the public as a means of explaining how to get from our announced ranges to the actual reported numbers I'd put the actual reported numbers in the context of the sort of chart device that is used in Charts 1 and 2 following page 9 of the Bluebook   Just a quick question, if I may, to help me make up my mind This is a question to the staff, Steve Have you seen, or do you have any opinion about, the assertions in the financial press by some commentators and money watchers that the December drop was not a real drop--that financial institutions were misreporting to us? The [alleged] scenario is that both banks and S&Ls were getting cranked up to issue NOW accounts, which weren't legal until the first of the year, and were making moves internally to take things out of savings accounts but hadn't yet classified them as NOW accounts and were calling them in reports to us ""other liabilities"" I don't know whether that has any merit in reality I'm asking you   I thought you might have had a chance to look at the trend of the so-called other liabilities that came in   Well, with that uncertainty, I guess I would come out where several others have already, between ""B"" and ""C""   15 to 21 percent   The only thing that isn't quite clear to me at least is what the Manager will understand he's to do, if, as, and when the borrowing assumption goes considerably off from the $13 billion "
1759,1981-03-31," You started all this!   Mr Chairman, I would like to make a comment and ask Steve some questions These figures on adjusted M-1B, of course, are going to be the great guessing game of 1981 There has been a lot of solid analytical work done at the Boston Bank and by the Board staff on what happened in earlier periods when NOWs were introduced and so forth We have some survey data already We intend to do some more surveys Yet I, for one, Steve, end up with a feeling of a little skepticism about how much we solidly know I'm told by my staff, whom I have had looking into this, that if we took at face value the survey data that came in from the banks and the S&Ls for January and February and assumed that about the same results prevailed in March that prevailed in February, we'd end up with something like a weighted average for banks and S&Ls together of 82 percent of the source of NOWs being demand deposits and the balance being non- transaction accounts That is in a bit of contrast with the best judgment of the Board staff It came out in the Greenbook, for example, that in January 80 percent of the NOWs came out of demand, and the figure for February and March was 75 percent Using the figure that we came up with of an 82 percent weighted average as a rough estimate for the first three months of the year--and I don't say that I have complete certainty on that either--rather than the [Board staff] figures I just cited, we would come up with a 52 percent annual rate of gain, seasonally adjusted, for M-1B from December to March, versus your figure of 32 percent In other words, it would be a full 2 percentage point difference and the level of M-1B would be $2 billion higher   December to March And we would, in fact, be fairly close to the midpoint [of our target] It's just a word of caution that, from my standpoint at least, I would feel a little safer if this Committee for its own deliberations had in mind a range of possible outcomes rather than a pinpoint figure, because at least at this point in time, I don't feel we have enough information to have a solid figure that's measurable to the extent we do for a lot of economic statistics and so forth Having expressed my misgivings, I am turning to you, Steve, to see if you can reassure me or tell me that things are better   Maybe I could pinpoint this a bit more Is my understanding correct--I got this from somewhere--that you judgmentally shaded down somewhat the survey data that came in from the institutions, at least for January if not February, in terms of the percent they reported as coming from demand deposits?   The only other comment I wanted to make on this, Mr Chairman, is that some of these fine and really well-designed analytical studies that were done, say, with respect to the New England experience, lead to a conclusion that probably about two- thirds of the source of NOWs was demand deposits and the rest was from savings and so forth We have a feeling that that might not be applicable to the United States as a whole in 1981 We see that a very large number of respondents to the surveys, contrary to what I understand was the case in New England, are permitting minimum balances to be held in various forms of savings instruments, such as passbook accounts, money market certificates, the 30-month small savers certificate, etc At least in the West, the largest banks and the largest S&Ls, in fact, are permitting those so-called minimum balance requirements for NOWs to be held in savings instruments, which I understand contrasts somewhat, Frank, with what had been the experience in New England If that practice should prevail as we continue to keep this under observation during the rest of the year, it might lead to a greater proportion of NOWs coming out of demand deposits and less out of savings So, there is the possibility that the present methodology could be understating the adjusted growth in M-1B But I think that needs some more study   I can only speculate that the extraordinary increase in velocity of M-1B, as reported based on the adjusted figures, could not have been so big if the adjusted figures should have been adjusted higher We get those sorts of interactions going on So I, for one, just have to express some skepticism All I'm doing is trying to find out how solidly we know what the adjusted results are And, if anything, I have a hunch--and that's all it is-- that perhaps we should be addressing--   Yes   Vice versa, Bob   Mr Chairman, in terms of these alternatives, I too would favor ""B"" for many of the same reasons that have already been cited But I do have one question Perhaps I am the only one around the table who doesn't understand this, but I wonder if you would repeat what you believe to be the significance of the federal funds range associated with ""B"" We've had an extensive discussion--   My further question, Mr Chairman, would be with respect to the telephone conference call on February 24, when I happened to be out of town and wasn't able to participate It was decided, as I remember from reading the memos, that there would be no change in the official funds rate range at that time But was that also meant to imply that the Desk was free in some sense to come in with an actual federal funds rate lower than the officially specified range? If that is the case, is that also what is suggested with respect to this future period? That's what I'm trying to get some clarification on   Well, to take an extreme point of view perhaps, I would want to know why it wouldn't make more sense to have a federal funds rate range centered pretty much around where we are now   Well, to take an extreme view, which I'm not necessarily proposing here Since the recent fed funds rate has been around 14 percent, if we want to allow some room both on the up side and the down side for the Desk to operate without the necessity of a consultation, we might specify a range of something like 11 to 17 percent to go along with ""B""   If there's some flaw in that argument, I wish somebody would point it out to me; there may be a flaw   Mr Chairman, without getting in a long digression, do you have any feel as to whether Mr Fauntroy's bill on money market mutual funds has any chance of passing in the near future? That could have some bearing on the growth of M2  -53-    3/31/81   Oh, really?   Where are we now on the borrowings? "
1784,1981-04-28," John Balles, Paul Am I understanding correctly--   Paul, this is John Balles I was just going to ask a couple of questions It is my understanding, and I'm asking for    4/28/81  confirmation, that this is the first time the shift-adjusted M-1B figures would have been published   The one thing that's worrying me is the point that some of you will remember from past years when we got into this seasonal adjustment problem It is what Arthur Burns used to call the 4 equals 12 problem The different techniques are all equally valid but yield different answers I'm just wondering whether by publishing the new seasonals we're adequately going to guard our flank, so to speak, by pointing out that the seasonals are a matter of some judgment   Certainly, these published seasonals will be for weekly as well as for monthly [data]?   This is John Balles I would add my support to that proposal I would also want to keep a careful eye on that discount rate in case we [get the] higher funds rate that appears to be in prospect "
1805,1981-05-06," Paul, this is John Balles I think Tony Solomon just made a very good suggestion Without confusing the market we could say something about raising the range specifically, sort of undoing it I think I would like a more explicit statement than you read that we are eliminating the upper end of the range until the time of the next meeting They would understand the federal funds range-- "
1824,1981-05-18," It's obvious that there are very strong crosscurrents around the country We see this in the West as well The lumber industry, because of the housing industry, is flat on its back On the other hand, we see the opposite extreme in office building construction, for example, which is [experiencing] real boom conditions in San Francisco, Los Angeles, etc Agriculture, our leading source of income in the State of California--I guess it's now the biggest agricultural state in the country--is doing very well I don't hear of any signs of collapse there despite the high cost of credit to farmers Aerospace, electronics, and so forth are still going along very strong In short, what continues to amaze us is the resilience of the economy despite high interest rates I share your feelings that, looking back over the past couple of years, the often advertised coming of a recession or slowdown more often than not has not materialized And I suspect, if anything, we're underestimating the strength of the economy I would look for a better 1982, for reasons I won't take time to go into at the moment, than forecast by the Board's staff   It's about the same as around the country--poor   Not as yet, because all these variable rate proposals haven't really had a chance--   --to take effect in terms of restimulating the industry But I think when those do get underway, that will have a beneficial effect   Well, I will just piggyback on Fred's SOB story with one I find extremely instructive Two  lumber companies One is a great big one and one is a small one And if there's any industry in the country, along with autos, that should be screaming for relief from high interest rates, it seems to me it would certainly be the lumber industry Yet both of these guys are foursquare for solid monetary restraint, enough to get the job done in bringing inflation down When their quiz them on how they can support this kind of restraint in terms of what its doing to their business, the explanation is along the following lines They have two choices, both of which are bad, but one is worse than the other One choice is to price people out of housing temporarily through high interest rates; the other, as they put it, is to price them out of housing indefinitely and permanently through ongoing double-digit inflation So, even looking at their own long-run self interest, they favor monetary restraint and are not ready to throw me out the window or out of my job--if they could--because of what we are doing to their businesses I find that rather instructive   No, but the small lumber company is surely making no money   It will be a while, but they're not facing bankruptcy   I wonder if I can just ask one more technical question of Peter Can you bring me up to date [on your procedures] when you find borrowings departing from assumptions? As I recall, the last time I heard this discussed you said that in the following period  -22-    5/18/81  you adjust by only half of the undershoot or overshoot, which doesn't seem to be working out all that well, as far as I can see Is that still the practice?   There are a couple of things, Mr Chairman, that have led me in the same direction as Mr Solomon and Governor Rice We're beginning to wonder--and it's obviously speculation rather than proof yet--whether we aren't witnessing some downward shift in the demand for money, along the same lines as occurred in the 1975-76 episode, because of the institutional changes affecting business deposits with this surge in money market mutual funds Some simulations we have been doing over the past five months show that M-1B is now well below the level that would have been indicated by historical demand relationships, and I'm really beginning to wonder whether there hasn't been a downward shift I don't know what studies you have been doing on this, Steve But if that is going on, and I suspect it might be, the shift-adjusted range that we have set for ourselves could actually give us more expansion than we counted on when we picked out the range at the beginning of the year, even though we are now, as of April, in the middle of that shift-adjusted range And that leads me to lean more toward ""C"" than ""B""  One thing that gives me real pause about coming out there is what Governor Gramley as well as Steve and the staff remarked on earlier today Namely, it seems to indicate that we'd have to keep interest rates at a very high level for a very long time We need some real weakening in the economy in order to hit even the midpoint of our shift-adjusted M-1B range But, again, our staff has been doing some work on the differences between the liquidity preference model of interest rates and the more traditional loanable funds theory  -29-    5/18/81  of interest rate determination And the net of that is that, except for the very short run, interest rates are going to be determined more by credit market conditions than pure money demand equations [would suggest] This leads us to conclude that it's distinctly possible that we can get a slowdown in money growth this year from last year, along the lines of the midpoint of our shift-adjusted range, without keeping interest rates that high that long, and to a point where we would see somewhat more real economic growth in '81 than the Board staff [has projected] and almost about the same real economic growth, close to 3 percent, in 1982 Admittedly, a lot of this is conjectural and one might even say speculative; but taking both of those reasons together tilts me toward alternative C   I think it would be less confusing if we followed what Tony suggested by putting in 2 percent and dropping the words ""or lower"" "
1848,1981-06-17," Mr Chairman, this is John Balles In talking with Lyle here, I'm trying to recall whether our published minutes for the [March] meeting indicated, as I seem to recall, that we would be putting more weight on M2  SPEAKER(?) Yes   Is that [recollection] correct?   The only reason I bring this up [unintelligible] scrutiny with our current policy [Unintelligible] in spite of the fact that M2 is [above its] range [unintelligible] end of June    6/17/81  probably will take some of the sting out of the fact that M1 is coming in weak "
1860,1981-07-06," Starting at this table!   Well, for a more optimistic scenario Our staff has recently gotten into this treacherous business of forecasting interest rates and they come up with much lower rates by '82 and going on into '83 than the Board's model That reminds me of that old story about a tough question in an economics exam where the student wrote ""God only knows what the answer is"" The professor came back and said ""God gets an A and you get an F"" Without going into a long harangue on methodology here, the Board's model is this large structural model As I understand it, there's a lag of about 4 years between money and prices By using a much smaller model with about a 2-year lag and by using a loanable funds theory of interest rates rather than the traditional liquidity preference theory, we get more real growth, less inflation, and lower interest rates That's really rather startling Specifically, as opposed to, say, a 16 to 17 percent level for the 3-month Treasury bill for this year and next year, we would show the Treasury bill rate coming down to about 9 percent in '82 and going down to about 7 percent in '83 As I say, God only knows which model is right, but I wouldn't--   We get more real growth and less inflation   We're using the same assumptions as the Board's model   No As I understand it--and we'll get beyond my technical knowledge pretty fast here--one of the things that's keeping interest rates very high in the Board staff's big structural model is the need for a big increase in velocity In our particular way of looking at the world, we get a quicker decline in inflation by reducing the rate of monetary growth in each of the last 2 years As  -22-    7/6-7/81  you remember, there has been a slight decline in the growth of M-1B and there apparently will be a bigger one this year That reacts faster in our way of looking at the world in getting inflation down; hence, interest rates come down faster   Yes, without trying to be overly precise   Well, one of the things that we are assuming has happened, and I think the Board staff has arrived at the same conclusion, is that there probably has been a big downward shift in the demand for money so far this year We have the same ingredients working that we had in '74 and '75 when we had big institutional changes--remember that corporations and municipal governments could get into savings accounts--and extraordinarily high interest rates At that time we were [registering] an all time new record as well And of the various episodes of history in which we have thought that there might have been a downward shift in money demand, the 1974-75 experience stands out as one of the more likely episodes We're guessing now that the same thing has occurred this year   And will continue   Basically I'm in favor of what I call the KISS approach Keep it simple, sir   Your opening statement, which has been supported widely around the table now, was that there's much more to be lost than to be gained by tinkering with these 1981 ranges In fact, I don't recall that we've done a midyear correction heretofore If that's wrong, I withdraw the comment   The latitude with the present ranges seems to me to be adequate for the balance of this year With respect to the alternatives for 1982 set forth on page 14, I would go for alternative I for M-1B, which is to drop the range by 1/2 point, but I find it difficult to buy any of those alternatives for M2, M3, and bank credit A number of people have spoken on this so far, and I would come out bottom line the same way, to leave those ranges for the broader aggregates the same as they are now However, I would begin formally and more explicitly, following up on what Lyle said, to give more recognition to M2 We have done that in a very subjective way in our recent published directives We can all recall the time when we went as far as saying we would give it equal weight That has been some years ago now Perhaps it needs to be discussed at some length how far we go in the formal sense in giving more recognition to M2 If you look at the spread between M1 and M2 over quite a long period of time, it bounces all over I have a table--Bill says he has one too--that shows that over the last 20 years that spread has averaged about 3-1/4 percentage points The 4-1/4 point spread which is shown on page 14 between the midpoints of M-1B and M2 just seems to me to be excessively high Coming in somewhere around the historical average spread of 3-1/4 points would justify leaving the M2 range at 6 to 9 percent for next year, which is where it is now One of the reasons I would lean more toward M2 in a formal sense in our policy deliberations is that I have some skepticism about M-1B; I don't share Frank's view completely, but we are dealing with a very tricky animal in the shift-adjusted M-1B And at least for next year, that gives us perhaps good reason to place more weight on M2 As a number of others have said, I wouldn't be unhappy at all if we dropped M1-A altogether and do it right now When we get into the short-run specs, the June- to-September period, I'd like to say more about leaning as aggressively against undershoots as overshoots, but that discussion comes up later   This platter of choices is almost enough to give us indigestion Reverting to what Bob Black had to say in his opening remarks yesterday about the June 17th conference call, I share the view that the weakness we accepted was a little more than I had in mind at the time But after last year's M-1B growth of 6-3/4 percent, if I recall the adjusted figure, the 3-1/2 percent lower end of the range, if that's where we're going to end up this year, is an awfully sharp deceleration The only way I can justify that in terms of not pushing the economy over the brink and creating a serious recession is the evidence, reasonably persuasive, that there has been a downward shift in the demand for money I think it would be a great mistake if we ended up the year under that 3-1/2 percent lower limit, even given what seems to be going on in terms of a downward shift in money demand But to hedge my bet to make sure that we don't undershoot for the year as a whole, for the June-to-September period I'd lean more toward the alternative B specs, including the [associated] federal funds range, than I would those of alternative C Again, I would like to raise the issue of whether we should at this time explicitly place more emphasis on M2, which I would favor   Updated seasonally   I have a question on that Mr Chairman Obviously we're making some provisional statements on the 1982 ranges, but at what point in time do you foresee our moving to the actual M-1B as compared to the shift adjusted?  -86-    7/6-7/81   I can see us going on forever and ever ignoring what the actual is   What was the rationale, Mr Chairman, on the three-point spread, just so we understand that? "
1899,1981-08-18," Peter, one question I'm curious about As we look around the country--certainly in our District and I believe nationwide--there's virtually no bank paying the surcharge, as you know What I can't quite figure out is why the federal funds rate can get much above 18 percent As it goes to 19, 20 percent, it's rather curious, isn't it, that a few more banks wouldn't step in and incur the surcharge?   The money desk managers get brownie points for not incurring the surcharge, but they're not given demerits for paying a point or two above the surcharge That's a rather curious world   In a recent update of some of our staff work, we seem to get the results that M-1B is a better predictor of prices and that real M2 is a better predictor of real economic growth It seems in a way that we have the best of all worlds undershooting M-1B and overshooting M2 I'm trying to inject some optimism in here But having said that, I'm really very suspicious of those results Number one, I would associate myself with Chuck's comments in that I think we went a step too far last time in making M2 a constraint on M-1B, and I would like to revert to at least the equal weighting that we used to use I'd also like to ask Steve if the time may be close at hand when we should be going back to the drawing board trying to put some flesh on the skeleton that you mentioned on the point that we really ought to be aiming at a transactions account I couldn't agree with that more In principle, that's clearly what we ought to do Has enough time elapsed in your opinion, Steve, to be thinking about redefining the content of these aggregates, as awful as that proposal may sound?   Well, if the Chairman's suggestions on how to treat money market funds were adopted, would that at least help alleviate the problems of--?   Mr Chairman, is there any prospect of that getting adopted?   On that score, Paul, even in the most extreme case--if all our sample surveys were off and it turned out that in practice 100 percent of NOW accounts were coming from demand deposits --the actual M-1B is almost smack in the middle of our range for the shift adjusted M-1B   Yes   My point is that even if that were true, we're not in bad shape   You asked for some comments on business conditions Just to give you a thumbnail sketch as far as the West Coast is concerned--Governor Gramley really put his finger on it a little while ago for the whole country--we have big geographical differences and big industry differences I would underscore that by saying that the crosscurrents that exist on the West Coast are just about as strong as I have ever seen Our lumber and forest products concerns are in very poor shape, obviously, and they are just screaming for some kind of relief The auto industry, of course, is in very bad shape as it is around the rest of the country In pretty good shape are companies that are active in defense work, energy companies, and commercial construction in some of our bigger cities Electronics firms are going strong and the aerospace business is in stable condition right now, neither going uphill nor downhill In California, agriculture, the biggest single industry--about a $14 billion industry--is under an extremely serious threat from the Mediterranean fruit fly It has us all pretty darn concerned, with the recent action of Japan, for example, of putting an embargo on our exports of fruits and vegetables California supplies about half of all the fruits and vegetables in the country The rest of you might find prices going up a little if we don't get this problem under control It's a very serious problem I don't know if it's going to get licked or not   Not absolute declines; we see a severe tapering off of the rate of increase   In California we had that court decision called Wellenkemp which precluded the enforcement of due-on-sale contracts There is a lot of creative financing going on; it's the only thing that's keeping things alive at all--[that and] the assumption of old, low rate mortgages   Mr Chairman, I'd just like to raise an important technical question In this material that was passed out called the general paragraphs, in the operational paragraph on page 3 line 57, I hope the language there is a mistake It says ""provided that growth of M2 remains at the upper limit""  ""about""  Okay, if it's still ""about,"" then there's some leeway   Okay, otherwise we would be taking--   That might be a good idea   Paul, as an alternative to putting it at line 44--  -51-    8/18/81   I was going to suggest, Mr Chairman, that if we want to add an extra sentence that would call attention to artificial distorting factors in M2, we might slip it into the sentence that now begins on line 58 ""It was recognized that shifts in NOW accounts would continue to distort measured growth in M-1B and""   Just add a phrase there that M2 may be similarly distorted by recent developments in new savings instruments Insert a phrase that we would then follow an operational reserve path to be developed in light of evaluations of those distortions "
1926,1981-10-05," I just wanted to get Peter's thoughts, if he has any, on what happened to M-1B shift adjusted in the last two weeks, in that it suddenly fell out of bed and gave us an unexpected, at least to me, 4 percent decline Earlier in [September] it looked as if it would be coming in close to 2 or 3 percent   Well, maybe I should ask Steve   We also see evidence that soft spots are spreading, and it's not necessarily limited to small business In the Pacific Northwest, of course, there has been a long period now where all kinds of small lumber mills have either closed their doors permanently or have gone on indefinite furlough, but things are spreading now even to the commercial side in the aerospace business Employment is down noticeably from where it had been at its peak earlier in the year Big aluminum companies are cutting back These are suppliers for housing, automobiles, and so forth Even some of the bigger companies are reporting capital spending cutbacks Agricultural prices--and agriculture is one of the big industries in California--have been dropping partly due to a slippage in overseas demand because of the strength of the dollar We get fairly  -11-    10/5-6/81  widespread reports from our directors about further slowdowns in retail sales This pretty much confirms the prospect that we've been looking at for some time now of a soggy economy I'm not sure it adds up to a cumulative serious downward spiral, but it's enough to give some cause for concern   It really is I think with one exception all of our so-called problem banks are in the state of Oregon And that's a direct feedback from the very high unemployment rates, the closings of these lumber mills, and so forth   Well, Mr Chairman, before we get into my specific comments on the alternatives, I'd again like to raise the question I brought up last month, which has to do with the relative weighting of M2 and M1 Yesterday I was asking Peter and Steve whether they had any particular insight about what looks to be a sudden very sharp collapse in M-1B Steve made a very germane comment --I think we've often noticed this before--that these monetary aggregates may be telling us something about spreading weakness in the economy One never knows that until well after the event In any case, I would again like to refer to the way we used to give about equal weight in a judgmental sense to both M1 and M2 It seems to me that over the past several months, with the way the proviso clause has worked, there has been a risk of what I would view as overemphasis on M2, and I would hope to get back to a more equal weighing of those two [aggregates] If we don't, we may have a real problem--at least in a public relations sense and possibly in an economic sense--of letting M1 go down too far  -31-    10/5-6/81   At the moment, yes sir   I didn't express myself on the alternatives earlier, Mr Chairman But I do want to allude to what I thought was very interesting work that the Board's staff has done on the likely downward shift that is taking place in money demand Our staff was taking a look at that and pretty much concurs What that says in practice, to me at least, is that observed M-1B may in fact be about where we are in terms of the effects of money That takes some of the sting out of the apparent undershoot in shift adjusted M-1B But having said that, I would hate to see us fall further behind in the transactions component In view of my hunch that there has in fact been a significant downward shift in money demand, I would be in favor of alternative C to get us up to the lower end of the range for shift adjusted M-1B by year-end Again I would urge that in following those paths we ought to give equal weighting, as I mentioned earlier, to both M1 and M2   Paul, I understood a while ago that you were leaning toward putting a numerical target in for M2, with cautionary language following it   If that were done, followed by the cautionary language that evaluation of M2 would have to be made in light of all savers, etc, one way the directive could handle it would be at the end of the last paragraph that calls for consultation when the funds rate is persistently outside a range to add a phrase ""or if M2 growth is substantially higher than currently projected"" So, consultation would be triggered [either] by the departure of the funds range persistently from whatever range we end up specifying or by M2 growing faster than the numerical target, if one is put in "
1951,1981-11-17," Just following up on your comment, Steve Earlier in the year, of course, we did have that M2 constraint as we all know, but at the October 6th meeting that proviso clause on M2 was dropped and we set sort of independent paths for M1-B and M2 It was my impression, and you probably have more recent data than I've been able to look at, that in this latest period since the October meeting both M2 and M1-B have fallen below the path we set Is that true?   Well, in view of the fact that we apparently have fallen below the paths set at the October 6th meeting on both of the Ms, I was a little curious about Peter's remark about the very small upward adjustment made in nonborrowed reserves I think it was pretty darn small Do you happen to recall the amount, Peter? Wasn't it about $60 million?   Out our way we happen to have a big worldwide engineering outfit called Bechtel Engineering and they've just had some publicity about a brand new kind of business they're getting into They think there's a great future in it It's called decontamination and decommissioning from nuclear power plants   Maybe we should have George's boys take a look at our problem with the Ms and see if we can get some decontamination and decommission! I was kidding Dave Lindsey that if I were his boss, I'd give him an assignment to answer the question ""Will the real money supply please stand up?""  What I have to say today is that I'm torn between Lyle's point that we don't really know what these Ms mean anymore--and I am very sympathetic to that--versus my feeling that we want to avoid a procyclical monetary policy As I look back over the last couple of years, we took very positive action in focusing on a gradual deceleration of monetary growth I think that was a bold action and  -20-    11/17/81  we had a lot of guts in letting interest rates rise to unprecedented levels in carrying that out And I guess I would be a little uncomfortable if we weren't symmetrical on the down side But given the recession we're now in and our guesses as to how long it will last, it wouldn't bother me to see interest rates come down somewhat further I'm considerably influenced in that by the real risks I see of this downturn getting more serious than the staff projects, although I can't really disagree with their forecast But the risks are there; we all know about them There are very serious risks in the thrift industry, extremely serious recessions--and that's the only word for it--in the forest products industry and the auto industry, and there is a cost-price squeeze going on in agriculture To the extent that we can give them some near-term relief, lower rates, it would simply head off the risks coming from those sectors of converting this present recession into a major contraction I'm hoping that we'll avoid an actual shrinkage in the money supply such as we had in the mid-1970s And while I certainly wouldn't want to see the extreme fluctuations in interest rates that we witnessed in 1980, I don't see very much risk of that happening in late 1981 and early 1982 Maybe I've been brainwashed by being too close to the forest products industry, but I recently appeared on a panel discussion along with Henry Reuss and they were ready to hang me in effigy, Mr Chairman, instead of you, maybe as your proxy   To Henry's credit, I'm glad to say that he supported what we have been doing He said it was necessary and was what just had to be done That was a pleasant surprise; I didn't have to fight with him But I'll tell you, I do have to fight with the builders and the forest products people who say they are bleeding to death or hemorrhaging They say What can you do for us? And do it soon because if you don't do it soon, it's going to be too late   End of story   I'm concerned in formulating this directive, Mr Chairman, that it certainly will appear odd that we have adopted the alternative C specifications at a time when we know the economy is worse And that leads me to join those who have spoken up in favor of alternative B It's a minimum of what I'd like to see   Does anybody recall how we handled this a year ago when we went through some gyrations in order to get the monetary growth rates cranked down so that--   I've already sent one "
1977,1981-12-21," It used to be that second perhaps only to Texas, the West was fairly recession proof, but that doesn't seem to be the case today Looking around for some elements of strength, I have been hard pressed to put my finger on them Alaska is the only one of our nine states that still seems to be adding to payrolls Nonresidential construction, which has been very strong, is still above a year ago but the growth is definitely slowing And across a wide range of areas there is developing weakness or a going downhill, even in the aerospace industry, on balance, strangely enough Lockheed just announced getting out of the production of the 1011 They are hoping to pick up something in defense orders The semiconductor high-tech business that had such a strong growth trend has turned sour Some of the semi-conductor firms from Silicon Valley and elsewhere in the West are having extended shutdowns because of excessive inventories Even Boeing, which has a huge share of the commercial airline market, is getting increasing numbers of cancellations There is more competition from the Airbus, etc, and even though they are rolling out a couple of new models in the very near future--the 767 is about to come out and the 757 is expected a year later--their sales are definitely down and so is their employment So, it is hard to see the bottom being reached in the near future The trend is still downward across a pretty broad front  -15-    12/21-22/81   To pick up on what Fred said about credibility and going back to Steve's comments on it, we recently had our full academic conference with about 35 professors from all around the West  -22-    12/21-22/81  who specialize in money, banking, and monetary policy research, etc While there are all different points of view and schools represented, from various degrees of monetarists to Keynesians to a few supply siders, the one overwhelming conclusion that they arrived at when we solicited their advice on appropriate ranges for money growth in 1982 goes right to the credibility problem It translated specifically into a recommendation from that group, for what it's worth, that it would be a serious blow to our long-term credibility if we didn't follow through with something like the provisional ranges we announced last July--that is, at least a fractional reduction as a part of a multi-year program to get the rate of money growth down and, hence, the rate of inflation So, that came across loud and clear  The other point I wanted to make, having supported Steve's view on the vital nature of the credibility problem, with your permission Steve, is to take a contrary view with respect to the 3-point range that we provisionally decided on for M1 in July for which you have again argued cogently here today Looking back at the July minutes, just to refresh my own recollection, we considered three alternatives for M1 Two of them involved a 2-1/2-point spread between the upper and lower [ends]; the third one, which we adopted, had a 3-point spread And for reasons that were set forth by Steve, it has been the usual Fed policy to widen the range of long-term targets when we perceive increased uncertainty in the economy Now, that made sense as I thought about it under our former operating procedures, which had in effect tended to accommodate changes in money demand more or less automatically In fact, I think the big problem in those days was that we accommodated too much, which is probably the main reason we changed the procedures But with the new approach that has been in effect since the fall of 1979, and particularly with our record this year--and I might add that we got plaudits from this academic group for what we had done in 1981 [whereas] last year we had a lot of scar tissue as you might imagine and you have heard that yourself--we are doing a better job of keeping within our target ranges and that has [helped] the credibility problem We don't automatically accommodate changes in money demand I suspect most of us are uncertain about money demand in 1982 For example, our staff thinks, and I tend to share this view, that if anything there is likely to be a further downward shift in money demand in 1982 But that could be wrong In the Bluebook Steve brought out the possibility that it could go the other way And to allow for that possibility, since we really don't know which way it is going to go, I would argue that, if anything, we ought to go back to the 2-1/2-point spread for the following reasons If money demand should shift downward, obviously the effective money supply is going to be greater than the actual observed money growth; on the other hand, even though I don't expect that this will happen, if the demand for money should shift upward, then the effective money demand of course will be less than observed money growth Net, bottom line, if we are uncertain, as I am, about what might happen to money demand next year, I think we should narrow the range of possible effective money by narrowing the range of observed money growth, which is the only thing that we can control So, at this moment, without hearing other views, I am leaning toward going back to that spread of 2-1/2 points that we had before   Well, if I had to commit myself today, I'd go for 3 to 5-1/2 percent instead of 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent, but that is just provisional until we have had a lot more discussion   3 to 5-1/2 is 2-1/2 points   Yes   No, all my remarks were on M1-B at this point   Oh, good   I have just a couple of comments, Paul I share Frank's frustration on knowing what money is these days He proposed a new Committee on the directive A couple of months ago I think I spoiled Steve's whole day by suggesting that maybe first and foremost we needed a major restudy of the monetary aggregates And that is why I was so glad to hear Governor Teeters say that we are going to do something about money market funds early in the year Could I ask a little more about that? For example, Steve, we know that some of the investment houses are arbitrarily adding to observed M1-B either 10 percent or 20 percent of money market funds on the assumption that some of these must be transactions balances I would like to ask the question whether our look-see is really going to zero in on what percentage of these [funds] are turning over at the rate of normal transactions balances I think we really need that kind of study before we need a Committee on the directive, Frank   Mr Chairman, one more observation I'd just like to remind you that back in the mid-1970s we had one of the several Committees on the directive--some of us at this table served on it--chaired first by Bob Holland and later by Chuck Partee We took a long, hard look at optimal control, working on the ultimate variables and not using money as the intermediate target And the net of that was a dry hole It just didn't prove to be doable in practice So, despite all of our frustrations about what money is, how it behaves, and what should be in M1 and M2, it is still the only game in town as far as I am concerned Some of the academics--and it is a real minority--are urging us to target on real interest rates or to target on nominal GNP They get little, if any, support from their peers That came out loud and clear in this recent academic  -45-    12/21-22/81  conference that I mentioned yesterday Despite the frustrations about the money supply--will the real money supply please stand up!--I think it's the only hope we have   Say them again   How about M1?  -52-    12/21-22/81   Right   Generally I come out in favor of ""B+,"" about halfway between those two revised numbers, starting with November [as the base] I share the concern that Lyle and some others have expressed that this recession might be worse than the staff is now forecasting If there is an error, it is likely to be on the side of the recession being deeper through the first quarter than both our staff and the Board's staff have suggested And for that reason I would agree with Bill Ford on the federal funds rate range I'd prefer to see the bottom of it as low as 9 percent, and I would not like to see us strongly resist the decline in interest rates that would accompany a really soft economy So I'd accept either 9 to 14 or 9 to 15 percent on the funds rate range And as far as the borrowing assumption is concerned, $350 to $400 million would be okay with me   UFOs!   Well, there is virtue in the Chairman's proposal We've missed every short-term path this year by a considerable margin and I don't know why we should insist on misplaced precision when we will be lucky to come even close to the intermeeting path, if the past record is any indication   Tony, the present directive calls for M2 at an annual rate of around 11 percent So what is different about this?   Yes   Now that this has been decided, I wonder if I can return for just a second to your comments a while ago that I found very interesting, to put it mildly, that once we had decided that the only real operational decision this time was the borrowing assumption, we could now deal with the cosmetics That brings to my mind the question Why don't we in the Bluebook, Steve, have some more analysis on this borrowing assumption that goes with the various alternatives and its implications? This is a very key part of what we decide at a meeting And I, for one, would like to see some text, analysis, and recommendations Is there some reason that it is not desirable or what?   Even if you had not made that comment, I was still going to bring this point up There is a hidden variable running around loose here on these borrowing assumptions   And I would very strongly urge that we get something on it in the text in the Bluebook, unless I am missing some reason why they don't do it   Henry, I was never suggesting that we ought to put the borrowing assumption in the published directive as part of the specifications I was urging that there be more analysis and sets of assumptions about different borrowing levels as part of [the Bluebook] for the benefit of the decisionmakers   Can you possibly remember what you said back in 1976? I couldn't "
2005,1982-02-01," I'd just like to ask Jim a question on these fiscal policy assumptions In the Bluebook, of course, a discrete range of alternatives was set forth--strategies one, two, and three, depending on whether we follow the high end, the midpoint, or the low end of the specified monetary growth ranges On the fiscal policy side, Jim, I wouldn't know of more plausible assumptions to make than those you have made here But having said that, how the federal budget will really turn out is in my view one of the big uncertainties now I'm just wondering whether you experimented with any alternative scenarios on the budget and how sensitive real growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation are to different scenarios   Another question on your tighter fiscal policy assumption How did that translate, if you did this, with Mike Prell's chart on the Treasury borrowings and the percent of total funds raised? The chart shows that percentage shooting up to 40 percent by 1983 Would we get any significant relief under that tighter scenario from the crowding-out phenomenon that I'm quite afraid of?   Well, I don't really have any answer, Mr Chairman I do have a couple of questions that I thought I might try on Steve We couldn't find any good reasons for this explosion we've had in NOW accounts in the Twelfth District Our banks weren't very helpful in throwing any light on why it has occurred; it just seems to be happening Maybe it goes back to the thought that you expressed; it could be a belated reaction to interest rates having fallen late last fall It could be increased liquidity preference in a period of uncertainty The more I mull over why it's going on, the more I just have a hunch that we may be asking the wrong question in a sense I recall a debate around this table some years ago in the mid-1970s--I can't remember exactly when it was, perhaps 1976 or 1977--when we were agonizing over an excessively rapid and unexpected rate of monetary growth and why it was occurring I think it was Chairman Burns who    2/1-2/82  said at that time Well, it's very simple; we've been putting too many reserves into the market And I wonder if that isn't really the basic answer when everything is said and done   Well, taking the whole period of November through January, Steve, when we had this very rapid growth, net, do you have an impression of how much of it was due to changes in multiplier relationships? Does that explain very much of it?   It suddenly grabbed and the question is why   Well, in searching for possible answers here, I have another question I'd like to raise with Steve In each of the two years, Steve--in 1980 and 1981--when we have had a convergence of the federal funds rate and the discount rate, and the funds rate even has gotten down to a bit below the discount rate, that was followed by some very rapid monetary expansion, as we all know With the benefit of hindsight, looking back on that period between the November and December FOMC meetings last year, total reserves were almost on target They were a little above But the nonborrowed reserve level was raised quite sharply, by almost $200 million And that  -25-    2/1-2/82  undoubtedly had the effect of keeping the interest rates down because if we hadn't raised that, borrowings would have gone up And I suspect, as I look back on our feelings in December, that most of us would have viewed that as not a very opportune time to be letting the federal funds rate rise, which would have been the result if we had not increased the nonborrowed reserve path I'm just wondering if maybe we aren't falling back into the trap of intuitively trying to keep interest rates down at a time when it seems logical to do that and then paying the price for it later on when we get this delayed reaction of sudden very sharp expansions in monetary growth, as we got in both '80 and '81 A companion question would be With respect to that major study of our operating procedures that you headed up, as I recall there was a recommendation for more frequent changes in the discount rate As I look back on it, we haven't really done that either Well, those are just a couple of thoughts as to some deeper factors that might be at work here in these sudden surges of monetary growth I'd like your reaction to that   Yes, that's a point   Well, Mr Chairman, I have had a few second thoughts since both our July '81 meeting and also our preliminary discussion of this in December And at the risk of being a troublemaker, I do feel fairly strongly that we ought to bite the bullet on the inconsistencies among the M1, M2, and M3 ranges, specifically by increasing the M2 range by a full percentage point over what it was last year and the M3 range by a point and a half I've set forth in a brief memo the rationale and the advantages that would have, along with upping a bit the lower end of the M1 range With your permission, I would like to have it distributed so that people could see what it's all about and see what the ranges look like But that is the bottom line   Yes, I'm suggesting, for reasons set forth in this very brief memo, that we ought to increase the lower end of the    2/1-2/82  [tentative M1] range to 3 percent instead of 2-1/2 percent, keeping the upper end at 5-1/2 percent Very briefly, the reason is that, as I looked back to last July, we hadn't known about the weakness now emerging in the economy We had expected--I think more than we do now--the prospect of a further downward shift in the demand for money, and that downward shift seems to have slowed pretty considerably Whether it will resume and go on in 1982 remains to be seen But given the fact that we now are in a fairly serious recession that we hadn't really anticipated in July, and given the fact that the demand for money is no longer shifting downward as much--and maybe not at all--as compared to last summer, and given the fact that a 2-1/2 percent lower band would seem pretty Draconian right in the middle of a recession in terms of public announcement effects, I believe we would be better advised to use a 3 to 5-1/2 percent range That would have the virtue of being uniform across the board; the upper end, the lower end, and the midpoint [of the M1 range] would all be 1/2 point lower than our 1981 range And this would continue some credibility in our longer-run anti-inflation approach of gradually cranking down the growth ranges every year If we were to hit the midpoint of the 3 to 5-1/2 percent range that I'm proposing, which is only a presumption, the growth would be 4-1/4 percent And 4-1/4 percent is a pretty healthy decline from the actual observed M1-B growth of 5 percent last year So, although I supported the tentative decision last July for the 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent range, I've changed my mind for reasons I've just set forth on M1  On M2, it gets a little more complicated The composition of the M2 and M3 aggregates, in terms of the portion that is sensitive to interest rates, has really changed dramatically, as we all know My staff calculates that as recently as the end of 1978 assets yielding money market rates of interest comprised only 8 percent of M2 and that that's up to 45 percent now The interest-sensitive portion of M3 at the end of 1978 was calculated at 21 percent and it's now up to 54 percent We knew this last year, but we didn't really do anything about it We decided for reasons the Committee felt satisfied with-- and I didn't object because I thought it was a good idea--to keep those ranges down more or less for public reaction purposes We didn't want to be in the posture of raising the M2 and M3 ranges But as we all know, the actual [growth] last year, certainly not to my surprise, was considerably over the ranges that we set forth for the year A final word--   It just seems to me--if we're willing to bite the bullet in terms of what might be a reaction among the general public or superficial observers of our policy that we are going to be accelerating monetary growth--that a range for M2 of 7 to 10 percent versus the 6 to 9 percent we've been talking about tentatively and a range of 8 to 11 percent for M3 instead of the 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent we've been talking about would simply be more realistic I personally    2/1-2/82  consider the likelihood of strong inflows into these interest- sensitive broader aggregates to be great in a year when there's a good prospect, as we've heard from the staff today, that interest rates are going to continue at pretty high levels throughout the year I'd just hate to get in the middle of the year and then--   I don't necessarily think it will be more pronounced, Paul, but I don't think it could be diminished any in terms of rates of increase in these aggregates Some of us brought this point up at the meeting the last time If the staff forecast is correct, as I understand it, it implies a continuation of pretty high interest rates throughout 1982 And that's why I would just--   The presumption is that M2 and M3 in the future will continue to be more sensitive to interest rates than they were under the old definition   Yes, the growth rate would go down   Well, it's simply the huge proportion that is interest sensitive   Well, there are some things that aren't in either M2 or M3 such as Treasury securities  SPEAKER(?) But those rates are--   Well, I'd like to ask you, Mike, you are taking out the institution only money market funds but aren't you putting in the retail RPs? What about their elasticities?   Coming back just for a minute to the facts, we do know for a fact that M3 grew by 114 percent last year   I'd agree   Well, just very quickly, since we are still in a recession, I would go along with your proposal, Mr Chairman, but with a strong plea or caveat as the case may be that we take such actions as are necessary to avoid the big overshoots that we had on the [monetary growth] paths we set at the November meeting and the December meeting   I wish I did too   I'll vote for that  -81-    2/1-2/82   Well, Mr Chairman, what do you think could really happen between now and the next few weeks that would cause any tentative decisions today on ranges for the whole year to be changed?   Have we ever rebased before? I am trying to recall   It is not a good idea   I would be concerned, Mr Chairman, about the boomerang effects of creating that [specter] of further possible change and all the uncertainty that may [foster] The Fed watchers will be going right up the wall and looking at us every minute instead of every hour If, when we first talk about those ranges, we say they may be subject to near-term change, somehow that does not strike me as a very stabilizing influence in terms of expectations   Absolutely   Our problems remind me of a definition I recently heard of diplomacy It is usually the choice between the undesirable and the unacceptable   Well, some of us had a different view yesterday I have not changed my mind, but obviously those of us who felt that way appear to be in a minority   I third it   That happens to be a Monday "
2033,1982-03-29," Well, Mr Chairman, my question was going to be much the same as Frank's Maybe I'll still ask it Jim, in view of the concluding statement in your presentation about the rather grim outlook for the federal deficit and what that implies for the level of interest rates, to what extent does your forecasting model-- judgmentally adjusted or not--take into account how the high level of real interest rates, from which nobody can really see any near-term relief, might inhibit or even abort the recovery that we would otherwise expect to have? That's my number one worry these days   All right Thank you   Basically, in the Twelfth District, without going into a lot of detail and more doom and gloom, we figure the economy slipped further into a recession this month It's not just the forest products industry Unfortunately, it's almost all the other major industries we have, including aerospace, where commercial orders are down more than defense orders are up, electronics, nonferrous metals, etc But, really, what I'd like to do is to come back to a question I raised with the staff yesterday and ask it once more, hoping that they are wiser than I am I raise this in view of the fact that I have a couple of speeches scheduled this week up in the Pacific Northwest for audiences likely not to be terribly friendly  -30-    3/29-30/82  given that the unemployment rates are as high as 25 percent in some counties in Washington and Oregon mostly, but not entirely, because of the forest products industry The $64 dollar question, of course, is What in the heck is keeping those interest rates up in spite of the fact that we've had great success in bringing the inflation rate down? For a couple of years now I have been more or less promising these same people that if we got the inflation rate down--bit the bullet and persisted in tight money policy--the interest rates would come down sooner or later Well, they certainly haven't come down as yet So, while I have my own explanation, I don't consider it terribly convincing even to myself I'd like to hear how the staff would answer that question What is keeping those real interest rates up there despite the fact that we've had very marked success, with more success on the horizon, in getting the inflation rate down? If you can help me, I'd be grateful   It's like a hit over the head with a 2x4 or something!   And that budget policy is too loose    3/29-30/82   Well, I'm sure you realize that this is one part of the country where they're just really screaming, pleading, and begging for relief on the interest rates before they have all gone down the tubes, with 40 percent of Oregon's lumber mills being closed and probably closed permanently It's the kind of thing that led AuCoin, the Democratic congressman from Oregon on the banking committee, who is not always hostile and is sometimes friendly towards the Fed, to get behind one of the resolutions to force the Fed to do something He is getting tremendous pressure from his constituents, and it's that kind of thing, Paul, that may lie behind--   Well, Mr Chairman, as I listen to this dialogue and debate, one thing seems to stand out loud and clear as far as many of us are concerned And I think Frank expressed it and others followed That the observed money supply has really overstated the effective money supply, given the fact that so much of the growth since November has come in NOW accounts and in OCDs Therefore, I would join those who would not be in too much of a hurry to lean against that kind of bulge In responding to the tactical question that Steve posed to the Committee of how long we can continue to let M1 run above its range for the year, if this bulge had come in regular demand deposits, I'd be on the other side of the fence But since it didn't and since the April bulge will be equally mysterious for a while, I would not be in any hurry to lean too hard against it until we have more solid information as to what we're really doing I expressed myself pretty forcefully earlier on about the urgency of getting real interest rates down We can't do much about long rates That is going to have to be a solution that depends on some major efforts to get the budget deficit down But I think we can do    3/29-30/82  something in the short run about short-term interest rates And I'm really quite concerned that in the immediate future, unless these short rates come down, we are going to be inhibiting seriously if not aborting a prospective recovery Where all this nets out is that I would lean somewhere between ""A"" and ""B"" in terms of what we ought to be doing in the March-to-June period And as others have suggested, I'd place more emphasis on M2 in view of the low visibility that we are going to have on the meaning of the M1 figures, particularly as we move into April As I say, I'd not be in too much of a hurry to get back within that range until we get better information on what the true effective money supply is, based on its changing behavior [and] content   Steve, that's just the grand total excluding the extended borrowing?   Okay "
2058,1982-05-18," Maybe we better [adopt] one fast!   Mr Chairman, although we obviously could make a good case for preventing disorderly conditions in my opinion, just looking at the other side Is there any risk of our being accused of a bail-out of private dealers or whatever?   If it did go that route, Paul--Chapter 11 or whatever--is there anything that we can really do?   Well, I can add to the doom and gloom if we need any more, which we don't   It used to be that some of the bad news from the Midwest could be offset by what was going on in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts We haven't heard from Bob [Boykin] yet but I have to say that as far as the West Coast is concerned, we're no longer recession-proof We have very widespread weaknesses in all sorts of key industries It isn't just forest products and it isn't just home building; the weakness has now spread to aerospace, semi- conductors, commercial construction, nonferrous metals, etc As one example, at Boeing, which I suspect is one of the strongest aerospace companies in the United States if the not the strongest, employment a year ago was at 75,000 people It is now down 2,000 from that level and is expected to go down another 8,000 That's a measure of the extent to which the commercial side of the business is down far more than the defense side is up About the only recent strength we've seen is in sales of electronic equipment  Summing all of this up, and pretty much agreeing with what Lyle had to say, it strikes me that even though business confidence is  -17-    5/18/82  an intangible and immeasurable, it is really worse than the business statistics It's worse than what we might expect in terms of patterns of cyclical recovery And that is really bad news I'd say that among our five offices, about a fourth of our directors, including the bankers who see spreading loan delinquencies and problem loans or non- performing loans, are now so concerned that they're proposing that the Fed either operate at the top of its monetary growth ranges--and some would say we should go above those ranges deliberately for whatever period is necessary--because of the cumulative damage being done to all sorts of business concerns and individual consumers by the high level of interest rates They are as worried as I've seen them in my 10 years on this job   Since I was on the daily morning call for most of the days since the last FOMC meeting, I just want to make a brief observation I think we gave the staff an unusually challenging assignment for all the reasons you know about, including the seasonal problem with M1 in April, etc From my perspective, I want to say that both the engineering and the execution under Peter and Steve and their staffs was just really great There were some nervous moments, at least on my part, around the middle of the month when the projections showed a 14 percent rate of increase in M1 in April and a 12-1/2 percent rise in M2 But, fortunately, that calmed down as the later projections were revised downward and we came in almost smack on target for April, which was an extraordinary and fine achievement  -24-    5/18/82   I might add, Frank, that one of our largest S&Ls on the West Coast just announced a sweep account and it started at a $2,000 minimum balance So it isn't limited just to banks   Well, I guess I ended up as tail-end Charlie, today Did I?   I'll try not to repeat some of the views that have already been expressed because I agree with a number of them I would like to go back to Mr Axilrod's analysis That suggests that perhaps we should extend the strategy of allowing a bulge in M1, much as we did in April, and that because of the possible increases that may have occurred in precautionary balances, because of the recession, etc we should in effect give more emphasis to M2 We agreed in April that we would [accept an overshoot on M1] provided that M2 stayed essentially close to its target for the year Of all the different options that we might choose that's the one that appeals to me personally as making the most sense at this time All of us are extremely anxious, of course--if we knew how to do it--to get interest rates down The question is How can we, in fact, do it? I'm afraid my perception is that there is probably more of a risk in big overshoots in terms of getting inflationary expectations up again, and hence interest rates up, than the risks we otherwise would run That was more or less confirmed in my thinking at the meeting last week of the Committee on Investment Performance where we talked to three insurance companies and five investment counselors who handle our retirement fund I asked each one of them their explanation of why nominal rates are staying so darn high in view of a very significant decline in the actual inflation rate The answer was pretty much the standard one about the fear that these big deficits will at some point result in the Fed monetizing a good part of these deficits again, recreating inflationary pressures, and thus double-digit interest rates reappearing  Coming down to the bottom line, in view of the conflicting pressures on us, I would favor alternative B for M2, but I would be prepared to be a little more generous on the M1 side depending on the unfolding evidence of this continued buildup in precautionary balances As Messrs Black and Guffey pointed out, however, that $800 million borrowing assumption could be a little too generous to keep M1 from getting too much out of hand on the up side The work that we've done in our Bank on the short-run effects on M1 of the rate of bank loan growth suggests that we might need a higher level of borrowing-- say, around a billion dollars--to keep M1 from growing too fast As far as the federal funds rate is concerned, I would join those who would broaden the range just to make sure we have all the bases covered I would suggest a federal funds range of 11 to 16 percent   What did you say on the federal funds rate? "
2083,1982-06-30," I wanted to ask Jim Kichline a question on page 2 of the package of charts, which deals with the Federal budget It comes as a surprise in a way that you and your people are looking at a much larger deficit in fiscal '83--some $60 billion larger   It's $60 billion--actually $62 billion--greater than in the official budget resolution I have a couple of questions on that I don't doubt that we could see an outcome like that, but is that view widely shared among independent analysts, so to speak? If it is, it will have a certain bearing on expectations, psychology, and everything else   I see My fear is, and I'd like your opinion, that that in itself is going to be a factor damping any possible future decline in long-term interest rates or delaying such a decline and holding those rates up longer Is that a warranted fear?    6/30-7/1/82   Is that right?   Thank you In addition to the question I had, Mr Chairman, I do have a comment Ed Boehne has in effect already made it for me I have been hearing essentially the same kind of talk from a very wide circle of businessmen and bankers in our District They are more worried than I've seen them worried in my adult life about the spreading risks of bankruptcies for a great number of    6/30-7/1/82  institutions that they would not normally consider being on a problem list I'm tempted to follow the same strategy that Ed has already mentioned--I guess that's strategy 2 in the Bluebook--and have a temporary easing of our monetary targets If we're going to do that without generating fear that the Fed will embark on a permanent accelerated program of rapid monetary growth, midyear is about the only time we can do it and get away with it in the sense that we concurrently could combine a modest upward move in the 1982 ranges by 1/2 point or so with a retraction of that for 1983 on a provisional basis--despite Governor Teeters' well stated comments about all the problems of setting forth 1983 ranges If we did that, we could head off, or at least minimize, the dangers of announcing a change in an upward direction from our original 1982 ranges That was my provisional leaning coming into the room Ed has already stated the reasons for it and I'm still reserving final judgment on that until I've heard a full-scale presentation of views, pro and con, from the other members   I think she means we've never changed--I don't believe we have--by making a midcourse correction in a range tentatively announced in July for the following year We have never changed that   That's the kind of inflexibility that has bothered me also   Paul, do we know why Lopez Portillo is so opposed to going to the IMF?   What is the revised number, Steve?   I indicated yesterday in the preliminary go- around that as I look back a year ago or even six months ago at what we were expecting and forecasting, it's clear that the economy is in poorer shape in terms of real growth and unemployment and that we're better off than we had hoped on the inflation side That's really the basis on which I rationalize my departure from our longer-term program of gradual diminution of monetary growth I feel now that we deliberately ought to plug some countercyclical considerations into short-term policy, that is, for the 3 to 6 months ahead And it's on that basis that I am in favor either of announcing an increase in the 1982 range or permitting a modest overshoot, maybe up to a point The difficulty with not announcing it or at least saying that we're going to tolerate an overshoot is that if we have an overshoot and the market doesn't hear us say anything about not correcting it, they are going to assume that we will correct it And that sets up expectations of a tighter policy in the weeks and months immediately ahead They will be anticipating some action by us to tighten up again So, we're in somewhat of a box on that score, Mr Chairman If we don't decide to increase the '82 range formally, I think we have to go in the other direction, which a number of people mentioned yesterday and which I also find satisfactory, of indicating rather explicitly that we do anticipate some modest overshoot and thus by that action remove anticipations that we are about to tighten That would be particularly true if the markets see a close to double-digit increase [in M1] in July, which I gather is not out of the realm of possibility, Steve, based on both the--   --income tax reduction and social security payments If we saw close to a double-digit increase in M1 in July and didn't say something about tolerating an overshoot or increasing the range, I think we would have set up anticipations in the market of a very near-term Fed tightening that could cause interest rates to go up significantly And that would be a very dangerous thing to allow to happen right now Well, in a word, I'd come down, bottom line, in favor of alternative A, with the borrowing assumption that would be consistent with that--maybe in the $700 to $800 million range  -49-    6/30-7/1/82   No   It was provided that M2 was essentially within its growth range for the year, Steve   Excuse me, Mr Chairman, we really haven't come to grips yet with the point Jerry raised earlier How do we, in our directive or instructions to the Desk, finesse this July bulge? I was reminding Steve, who compared it to April when we faced that bulge because of the tax payment matters, that we phrased things in a way  -77-    6/30-7/1/82  that we would tolerate a considerable bulge in M1 provided that M2 was approximately within its growth range for the year So, the figure we pick for M2 may have unusually important consequences   Well, that's what I'm trying to find out What is the intent on that?   Okay, all right "
2110,1982-07-15," Paul, this is John Balles In thinking of the proposal Tony made, I'd like to piggyback on it and perhaps offer some language in the sentence that we're talking about simply by referring to the phrase you used ""In view of present uncertainties the Committee also indicated it was tentatively planning to retain the same ranges for 1983,"" etc   I agree with Chuck as well   John Balles, Paul There's just one little fine point here that you might want to consider I like the way the language is now and it would be acceptable to me as it is, only fine- tuning it a bit In the second half of the sentence that reads ""and would tolerate for some period of time growth above the target range should unusual precautionary demands for money and liquidity arise,"" would you want to consider saying ""continue to arise""?   That would be better in my view because the word ""arise"" implies that there are not yet any "
2127,1982-08-24," Well, on this interest rate matter, I guess it's time for a little school of contrary thinking I don't look on it as trying to explain why interest rates have come down so precipitously and dramatically since early July I think the mystery is why they didn't come down a heck of a lot earlier If one looks back over decades at the relationship in this country between the inflation rate and interest rates, particularly short-term rates, there has always been a close correlation with only a short lag up until this recent episode So, I look on this recent decline as being a long overdue decline because we have had dramatic success in getting the inflation rate down and interest rates, particularly short rates, just didn't come down along with it The relief that we are now getting on the interest rate front is desperately needed from the standpoint of all kinds of businesses and depository institutions I guess I would worry later on if, as, and when interest rates begin to go up again And I would certainly want to take advantage of opportunities to nudge them down and to keep them down right now because of what I consider to be the growing cumulative damage being done to all kinds of businesses and depository institutions by this high level of rates But I'm not at all convinced personally that interest rates are necessarily going to go up just because business may strengthen a bit That would be a normal cyclical pattern But we've had such an unusual relationship between the depressed level of economic activity    8/24/82  on one hand and a very high level of real rates on the other that I don't think a rise in interest rates is foreordained by any means That may be wrong, but that's the way I feel about it right now  We do have in the short run a perplexing problem of monetary control with the discount rate clearly out of touch with open market rates Often in the past when that has happened, we've had somewhat of a loss of monetary control; it can lead either to overshoots or undershoots, depending on which historic episode one looks at If we tried arbitrarily to peg the federal funds rate in some narrow band, there would be a couple of alternatives for dealing with this One would be just to lower the discount rate dramatically, but that has announcement effects that might be quite unfortunate if the public felt that was a signal that the Fed was caving in and that we were going to start monetizing these big government deficits and have a sustained period of monetary acceleration Another alternative, instead of bringing the discount rate down too sharply, is to bring it down in a series of gentle 1/2 point moves; I'd be inclined to do it that way myself But I would also accompany that by a widening of the federal funds band This is where I guess I'm going to be rather radical now As long as we have the problem that we have right now, I would like to see the funds range widened from the present 5 points to about 8 points Specifically, in this current situation, while I'm in favor of the monetary specs of alternative A, I would like to propose that we consider widening the funds rate band to 4 to 12 percent instead of the 7 to 12 percent proposed in the Bluebook That would admittedly get us into a situation where the funds rate moves over a much wider area than the market is used to We'd have to try to educate the market and explain to them why we're letting that happen But by bringing down the discount rate gradually as well as widening the funds rate band, we can keep money under control and prevent either sustained overshoots or sustained undershoots   Did you see Lindsey Clark's article in The Wall Street Journal this morning?  SPEAKER(?) Yes   It leaves the Fed alone   It says, in effect, ""Leave the Fed alone and don't mess around with them They're doing a great job""   Well, I think the market would read more into the narrowing of the range than most of us would want read into it And I think we'd be going the wrong way in any event   Yes I'm in favor of a broader, not a narrower, range  -33-    8/24/82   Could you clarify please, Paul, how you phrased that? It was ""unusual volatility"" in what?   I think there's a lot to be said for that We have lived with this 5-point range now for some time Has it been a problem in the last six weeks? If it was, it has not been notable to me I still wonder why you want to narrow it   The trouble is ""credit conditions"" is an undefined term The market will want to know what we mean I'm not even sure we can agree around the table what we mean   It may be a good compromise   Excuse me, what are the Ms we are voting on?   Okay "
2163,1982-10-05," Well, coming at this confidence factor from a little different direction, since as we all know both consumer confidence and business confidence do play a key part in what really happens, and both I'm afraid are quite weak today I was wondering, Jim, if you have given any thought--and I'm sure you have--to the likelihood that we may see a triple-dip recession What probability would you assign to that, if you really had a chance to think it through?   Jim, one other question, if I can follow up on that As we look back to, say, last spring--I haven't really checked the record so this is strictly my recollection but it is reasonably    10/5/82  clear--your forecast, our forecast, and most private forecasts were confidently expecting an upturn in the third quarter Month after month has gone by and we haven't seen it; I still don't see it It's still a forecast and not a fact Do you have any insight into what has delayed that widely expected and anticipated upturn?   I wonder, in the final shot at this To what extent, in your opinion, do the still unprecedentedly high levels of real interest rates explain some of this weakness or failure to recover?   I'll wait for your words of wisdom   Where is that now--in M2?   Yes  SPEAKER(?) Universally   Mr Chairman, since we're on this subject, if I can jump in here for a minute, one proviso I would make in my general support of your proposal is that we breach a second tradition here, if we are going to drop the M1 target temporarily Normally, is it not    10/5/82  true, Murray, that the minutes of this meeting would not be publicly released until the December FOMC meeting?   After the November meeting I don't think we can wait that long   I think we need to get out this information PDQ   Okay, I agree completely I'm glad to hear that because to do otherwise I think would be very, very risky   I have one other question, Paul Did you intend that this be the entire part of the operational paragraph--that is to say that we would have no mention of a federal funds rate range?   Right When you are ready to discuss that, I think we ought to get that settled because if we create too many revolutions in one directive, we're surely going to shake up the marketplace   I'm not sure what the better part of wisdom is; but if we stay silent on the federal funds range, that would really be a major break in tradition   I have an operational question, Paul For those of us who are skeptical that M2 is going to grow as fast as 8-1/2 or 9-1/2 percent, given the way that the money market funds are slowing down and so on How is the Desk going to operate under the directive as it stands here? Are they going to be targeting on 8-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent M2 growth? I just want to make sure it's a workable directive from the standpoint of Desk implementation   Yes  -56-    10/5/82   But, Steve, haven't money market funds actually been shrinking in the last few weeks?   That's the phenomenon I had in mind What happens if that trend continues?   Because of all the uncertainties, I would just suggest a possibility--I'm not sure it will solve anything--of an even wider range than the 8-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent shown here [for M2] But if we did that, it would make it tougher for the Desk to construct a reserve path, I would think   Would you tolerate a little nit-picking-- editorial, not substantive--on your first paragraph?   Following the dash in the first sentence, ""in the very near term by investment of funds in maturing all savers certificates,"" one doesn't ""invest in""--   The word ""in"" is out of place there Maybe it should be ""reinvestment of funds now in"" or ""from"" [all savers certificates]   I have one other suggestion, which is just a matter of reversing emphasis, I guess In the next full sentence beginning ""The probable difficultiessuggest that substantial weight not be placed on,"" I'd rather say ""suggest little weight be placed on"" Or we could say ""little, if any"" I don't know how strong we want to be on that since we have ended up not specifying anything for [M]    I might drop ""substantial"" In effect, what we're doing is placing no weight, if we don't have [a target]   We don't have a target I'm just trying to make the words for the first paragraph consistent with the absence of an M1 target    10/5/82   That would be good ""less weight""   ""Less"" would be a good word in the sense of clearly implying less than we usually do   ""Less than usual""   In that second paragraph the first sentence ends with a phrase ""in the light of current economic conditions"" Wouldn't there be some other part of the old directive that stresses how poorly the economy is doing now?   It's the second paragraph at the end of the first sentence The last phrase is ""in the light of current economic conditions""   My point, Tony, is that the phrase ""in the light of current economic conditions"" as it stands there is a very neutral one and, in my mind, too weak I would like to see something like ""in light of the currently weak economy"" or whatever, unless that is going to be made clear somewhere else    10/5/82   That's what I thought   I do too   And put in instead ""are leading to""   Put it in  -68-    10/5/82 "
2188,1982-11-16," Paul, I found the [DIDC] announcement in this morning's paper fascinating Would it be premature to ask you whether in your opinion we will end up classifying these new accounts as M1 or M2?   Mr Chairman, looking back over the last six months, it's a little unnerving to witness the failure of prosperity, which was supposed to be right around the corner, to emerge Laying aside political figures, as I recall, Jim, there have been respected people in the forecasting fraternity who were predicting that an upturn would begin as early as last May or last June One month after another after another right down to the current one, as we know, that has failed to happen Looking back, can you put your finger on any particular factor that has produced this outcome? I'm thinking that despite the tax cut for business last year and despite the October '81 and July '82 cuts in personal income taxes and all these wonderful things that were supposed to get us off onto a new road here, [recovery] keeps eluding us Looking back, I wonder why   I happen to agree with that, Ed I didn't want to put words in Jim's mouth I think that's the way it came out, though The key factor, I think you said, Jim, was the interest rate impact particularly in the business fixed investment area and the export area Is that correct?   Just to reinforce what Governor Martin was saying on housing, the forest products industry, one from one of the biggest firms in the West, say that there indeed have been signs of a little pickup Translating that into what it means for 1983 as a whole, they are still pretty bearish in the sense that 13 million would be about as much as they are looking for in new housing starts And in a broader sense that industry is still in the doldrums because of what the foreign exchange business is doing to log exports; that is a very, very severe blow And finally, the pulp and paper business, which is another important leg of that industry, is really in the doldrums So, at least in our forest products firms, I don't find any great optimism these days  If I could finish with a question, Mr Chairman, I'd like to ask a question of Ted Truman, at the risk of repeating what perhaps already has been said, which I didn't understand In view of what has happened to interest rates in this country, with lower nominal interest rates at least, is there any good reason you can think of why that darn exchange rate is not only hanging up there but getting stronger?  -15-    11/16/82   I come back, Mr Chairman, to your excellent statement on the balance of risks, and that has me in a coin-flipping stage, I guess I join everybody around the table in wanting to get interest rates down as fast and as much as possible, but hopefully keeping them down And that's the hang-up In a day or so, I assume, Murray [Altmann], the directive from our October 5th meeting will be published and at that time the public will know of just one more key thing that they don't already know, and that is that we set a range of 8-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M2 and M3 [growth] at that time They won't be too scared because the October M2 that has just been published shows 8 percent and that's so far so good What they don't know and what we do know is that in October M2 was considerably higher than the path plotted by the staff I'm afraid, given the low assumption on M2 that the staff made for October, that if we get a continuation of accelerating M2 growth in November, which clearly seems possible--I think I heard Steve say that--we could be in [danger] of letting things get out of hand on the up side  Personally, I'm glad that we did in fact have the rapid M1 growth of August, September, and October, and that we got [interest] rates down in a rather dramatic way But I'm a little afraid that we may begin to get some perverse reaction in the long-term bond market This is always a judgment call, and judgment will differ around the table, but I begin to worry a bit--not that one swallow makes spring-- about the articles I see such as the one on the front page of today's Wall Street Journal in the ""What's New"" column The article said that officials of OMB and Treasury are beginning to worry now that we will see higher interest rates, higher inflation, and higher unemployment if the current monetary and fiscal policies continue There are fears that the Fed's monetary policy has become too expansionary, [as reflected by] the fact that the money supply announcement yesterday was received poorly in the bond markets and bond prices went down So far I think we've been lucky--not lucky in one sense because we have deserved what we have gotten, which is very good treatment--in the sense that our [monetary] expansion over the last three months has been accompanied by a downward drift in long-term interest rates in particular I wouldn't want to overdo it; I wouldn't want to overplay our hand and carry that too far As you said Mr Chairman, we just can't throw caution to the winds And it's difficult to judge when you're overplaying your hand I would join several of those who have already spoken in favor of tugging on the reins a little and, therefore, going with alternative B   Mr Chairman, I have one other point to make on this directive I'm a little concerned about the phrase in the opening paragraph that reads ""the reinvestment of funds from maturing all savers certificates and the public's response to the new account directly competitive with the money market funds mandated by recent legislation"" The latter half of that statement really flies in the face, I think, of what is said on page 7, paragraph 9 in the Bluebook It is made pretty clear in the next to the last sentence of that paragraph--and I agree with what is said there--that the new money market account will only have a small [quarterly] effect on M2 when it becomes available in mid-December for the simple reason that it is not going to be around long enough in the fourth quarter I tried my hand at writing a slightly different version of a directive I don't know whether this will help or hurt the cause The bottom line is to take out that phrase in the current proposed directive which reads ""the public's response to the new money market account competitive with money market funds mandated by recent legislation"" I agree it is going to be a big problem when we get into the first quarter; I don't think it's a problem for this quarter   Yes   Well, I was talking about both I happen to have some copies of this here for distribution Maybe the easiest way, if it could be helpful, is to distribute them The main burden of the message is that it backs away a little from what we said last time There is still uncertainty about M1, but not as much as last time The opening sentence is that the specification and behavior of M1 over the balance of the year are subject to fewer uncertainties now than at the last meeting in October You may not agree with that, but that happens to be my view  SEVERAL No way!  -48-    11/16/82   I ended up the first paragraph by saying ""Nevertheless, the difficulty of interpretation of M1 still suggests that less than usual weight be placed on movements in that aggregate and more than usual weight be placed on M2 during the current quarter"" In order not to scare the heck out of everybody, I was wondering what we would really tolerate in M1 In the second paragraph, after noting whatever range we decide would be appropriate for M2 and M3, I'm toying with the idea of a proviso clause for M1-- ""provided that M1 does not exceed x percent over the same period""   Well, you name it   And meanwhile all the telephones in the building are tapped!   If I could respond first to Bob's concern If I dissent or somebody else dissents, that would come out immediately before the explanation came out as to why others had voted the other way The way our minutes of action come out now--if we can keep them in that abbreviated form, not citing individual views--I could see the directive plus those minutes of actions being published on very short notice And in my view--you might not agree--that would take care of the particular problem you were mentioning   To return to the various points that Nancy is making I sent around a memo generally supporting her proposal, as you may remember It has occurred to me that there is another reason for supporting immediate release, but originally I was reluctant to put it in writing I'm even reluctant to mention it now, but I'm going to nevertheless It is bad enough to have leaks of the type we had, say, in The Washington Post on October 8, but even worse in my opinion is the risk of a leak we may never hear about And that is somebody with access to our policy record feeding it to a trader, an investor, or whatever If anything like that ever happened and was disclosed, that would be such a major black eye to us that it would make the leaks recently pale by comparison  -62-    11/16/82   I hope you're right, Lyle I'm not all that positive myself For example, though I don't have all the numbers with me--I wish I'd brought them--and I'm not sure how much they would prove implicitly what happened, my recollection is that the very day after our last FOMC meeting, Wednesday, October 6th, there was a major rise in bond prices and stock prices   Yes, exactly   And I'm adding 2 and 2 and getting 4   Yes, sir   Not if we don't talk to them "
2214,1982-12-20," Absolutely And even worse, Nancy, though I don't have the exact numbers in mind, the proportion that is going into apartments is now pretty big in comparison with single-family homes, and therefore builders are using a lot less lumber and cement and so forth So I think one really has to disaggregate those figures to understand what is going on I agree with you that [the housing situation] is not really as optimistic as it appears   Well, in the far West, things are continuing to slide downhill I can tell you why if you want to know, but I'd just as soon not It's the same old story Forest products are in a bad slump, and electronics and aerospace, which are two of our strong growth industries over the long term, are in a big slump Boeing's sales are at the lowest level in twenty years It's one [industry] after another like that, and we see no signs of a turnaround as yet in our economy   They are getting some, but it is in long lead time items, and it's not nearly enough to counteract the enormous number of cancellations, on planes particularly   Like Bob Black, I certainly thought that Steve and his associates did a fine piece of work It is a really systematic, in-depth examination of the pros and cons of different options It is a bit frustrating I'm sure, Steve, to have done all this work and not come up with any positive clear-cut view, but that is in the nature of these things We are faced, I believe, in the short run here with a lesser evil in a way I'm a little less optimistic than you are, Mr Chairman, about the possibility of knowing considerably more by February than we do now, and I'd just like to suggest a couple of reasons why this uncertainty may go on for a while You know better than I that the DIDC may drop another shoe, so to speak, at some point between now and midyear in the form of Super NOW accounts for business I'm not sure to what extent that might change the behavior of the aggregates, Steve Perhaps you could comment on that when I get through, please  Another thing that may continue this uncertainty a little longer than perhaps is indicated in the paper is that there is some indication--I think I just read it in this morning's Wall Street Journal--that the standard money market funds are beginning to fight back now And that certainly is just the opening gun in a battle that may go on for quite a while The specific instances that you probably read yourself this morning were with regard to Fidelity and Vanguard funds, both of whom have made arrangements with banks to shift their funds to a bank in case the customer insists on a bank-type money market account Fidelity is hooked up with some bank; I can't remember what it is  SPEAKER(?) Continental   Oh, Continental And Vanguard is going with the [Bank of] Boston, I believe Heaven knows what this is going to do, with the amounts showing up in M1 and M2 So, I just don't have a feel as yet as to how long this uncertainty will go on But I certainly agree with what I think was your conclusion, Steve, that it would be premature to dismiss M1 forever On the other side of the    12/20-21/82  coin, I feel it would be premature, using the words that Bob Black started off with, to commit to returning to M1 That [wording] would be a little stronger than I would be prepared to support But I agree with Bob's concluding comments that we certainly ought to make it clear that we will be prepared to re-examine M1 when the dust is settled and very possibly return to M1 as a target  Meanwhile, my very, very tentative instincts tell me that if Ml doesn't settle down and start behaving in a way that has a predictable demand relationship and predictable effects on the economy, the nonborrowed base might be the thing to look at much more closely But I think it would be a mistake to move to something as esoteric as the nonborrowed base just for some interim period if there's any hope at all of M1 finally settling down in a way that we can use it The problem of explaining the nonborrowed base to the general public, the Congress, and so forth would, I think, be very formidable Meanwhile, I think you have come up with a good--in my opinion, the best--interim solution, which would be to stay with M2 for some months ahead and see what happens to the behavior of Ml   May I ask a question, Lyle? With regard to your statement that you consider M1 to be a very dangerous instrument, was that in this interim period ahead or more or less indefinitely?   I agree with you then   We'll all reserve judgment   We seem to make our mistakes scientifically now!   Mr Chairman, you raised a question of whether we should all be using the same monetary assumptions That's a pretty important guidepost for us to decide on one way or the other It might be advisable, or at least helpful to me at the moment, if we could turn to the staff for a minute on this chicken and egg problem You have a forecast, obviously, for 1983, as does my staff And it's based on some provisional assumptions as to M1 growth, abstracting presumably from shifts in M1 because of these new deposit accounts I think that is what the Greenbook said Could you clarify, Jim, how you handled the monetary assumptions for the 1983 forecast you have?   I was just a little concerned, Paul, that there might be a booby trap out there for you if you're questioned on this range of forecasts of the Committee   If it turns out that we're all using different assumptions on the growth of the Ms, it could be a little awkward   I liked your idea about asking Steve to try to formulate the framework within which this whole thing could be presented I'd simply like to suggest that we wait to get that before deciding whether we need a meeting in January Maybe he's so good at it we won't need the meeting or we could settle for a telephone call   That sounds like a real good deal!   What is the legal basis, Mr Chairman, of our moving in at the last minute, so to speak, on these loans to the three countries you've mentioned and standing in a superior position to private banks? I have a recollection that that has been challenged legally But I'd like to get brought up to date on that   Yes I thought some private banks were challenging us   Yes   Well, I think my clarifying question has been asked twice now I gather that the alternatives set forth in the Bluebook on page 6 would be consistent only with alternative one of the directive, which you don't prefer   You said M1; did you mean M2?   Just to nail that down once more, how many points off the M2 numbers in the Bluebook?  SPEAKER(?) Three   Okay Thanks   At the risk of muddying the waters, Steve Would there be any virtue in an alternative that abstracted altogether from shifts and then left us with an option of adjusting for it ad hoc as we got the evidence?   I think that clarification would take care of the problem I was worrying about, Mr Chairman "
2241,1983-01-14," Steve, you might be interested to know that at our board meeting yesterday the bank directors from all around the West were pretty unanimous in the view that so far the Super NOWs have been essentially a nonevent Banks weren't promoting them very heavily nor were customers very interested, and not much was going on   We were counting on you!   Steve, John Balles I have a bit of anecdotal evidence from a California bank president's group that I am meeting with and talked to last night A number of banks on the West Coast and maybe around the rest of the country, as you know, have been offering premium rates on their MMDAs As a result, they're having trouble [lending out] that money profitably, so they have plenty of incentive for the moment to let their big CDs run off They are trying to find ways to put all this money in the MMDAs to work   Not according to them   Well, Paul, just a reaction to these figures Steve has been reporting The one that surprised me, at least based on what we thought might happen when we were looking forward at the December FOMC meeting, is how much M2 seems to have been impacted    1/14/83  here It's certainly more than I had expected I find that Steve's evidence, which is admittedly and necessarily somewhat rough, is fairly persuasive in the sense that certainly to some extent M2 has been impacted and that, therefore, the target that we had set for the December-to-March period probably needs some upward adjustment   Well, Paul, I would certainly agree with that I guess where I would come out--to put it a bit differently--is that I would be reluctant to act too quickly here to clamp down   John Balles I agree with what has just been said both by Ed and Frank "
2258,1983-01-21," Paul, did I understand you to say you did not contemplate another call next week? I wasn't sure "
2266,1983-02-08," There's no policy significance, Mr Chairman, in my occupying the St Louis seat   If I may, Mr Chairman, I have a question on each I would ask Ted Truman, and perhaps you already told us, Ted, and I didn't follow it, so could you tell us again if you did before What is going to cause the dollar to depreciate in '83 and '84? That's a very crucial assumption in this forecast   Well, that's a very tough question to answer and I was really wondering what the international staff here thought and  -15-    2/8-9/83  whether there was some assumption or view that they had with respect to relative movements of interest rates here versus abroad and relative movements of prices here versus abroad Do you care to comment on that?   Thanks, Ted The reason I was probing on that point, Mr Chairman--if I remember my own staff's analysis--is that about 40 percent of the drop in real GNP in '82 came from a deterioration in the net export sector So, this is really terribly crucial to the outlook   Mr Chairman, I have one other question, if I may, and that's related to the financial aspect of the fiscal material If I could, I'd like to ask Mike Prell a question about a chart in this area, the first chart in his section on the federal government share of total credit flows This is a technical question, Mike Does that include or not include off-budget deficits?   The other question is, I guess, more analytical and substantive Is there a risk, not recognized perhaps in our Board staff, Bank staff, or [Committee] members' forecasts here, that we really are sailing into uncharted seas with this huge proportion of the total pool of credit--the bulk of it--absorbed by the federal government? I'd like to know your answer My hunch, Mr Chairman, is that that supports your degree of skepticism about whether in fact the recovery is in the bag There are two things that could upset that recovery the depressing effects of interest rates that are still pretty high both on a nominal and a real basis compared to historical levels, and secondly what might happen when such tremendous shares of credit get soaked up by Uncle Sam in periods of economic expansion I'm worried about the crowding out phenomenon Is that something I should worry about?   Generally, along with Governors Wallich and Partee, I feel that, yes, we do need to have some kind of monetary targets The key questions, of course, are what degree of emphasis and what range we should use, etc Taking a leaf from your book, Mr Chairman--you mentioned that we could have made the same economic forecast in the spring of '82 that we're making now and that the thing blew up on us--I would caution that the big surprise that we've had since our December meeting may be that M2 was the aggregate that was hugely impacted and that Ml wasn't That isn't necessarily settled in cement, though; that could change I'm not sure why or how or when [this might blow up on us] but, frankly, I would reserve judgment as to whether the relative stability that we see in Ml, which is a big surprise, is in fact something we can continue to count on Although I would like to see Ml included--Steve has given us both the pros and cons of doing it--I would be cautious and at a minimum defer judgment until the spring of the year, perhaps in April, about whether we're going to have an Ml target for 1983 at all I would add another thought--maybe piggybacking, if that's the right word, on Steve's point--that there's a good case to be made for using the first quarter as a base for M2 The same logic that led him to that conclusion would lead me to the conclusion that if we are going to use Ml, we perhaps could consider the first quarter also as a base for the year even though there haven't been any big changes, net, so far   Mr Chairman, if I could have one final shot at this I could accept what you're proposing but I would again call your attention to the remarks, which I interpret as a warning, that Steve just gave us that Ml could spring to life and the Super NOWs could spring to life That's why I thought a little while ago and I guess I still feel that a more conservative or safer approach would be to do the same thing for M1 that we've talked about doing for M2-- using a first-quarter base--so that we could make sure that this apparent approximately zero net effect in the different accounts will continue through this quarter I hope it will   Mr Chairman, for us to try to ponder overnight Which approach do you find easiest to use vis-a-vis the public, the Congress, and the financial markets--basing on the fourth quarter, basing on the first quarter, or some of both?   May I ask a question, Mr Chairman? Could I just ask you to review quickly what you said on Ml? I'm not sure I--    2/8-9/83   I thought you had already passed it   Mr Chairman, I would like to make a pitch for the 4 to 8 percent for several reasons As I understand the Board staff's projections for the first quarter, Steve, Ml is expected to grow at a 5 percent rate, roughly, for February and March Our San Francisco money market model, which we started with last year, is projecting about a 10 percent growth in those two months Time will tell which projection is--   A 10 percent average growth in February and March And I would hate to see us get trapped in a posture where too low a range would force tightening and produce a premature rise in interest rates in view of the uncertainties that I feel about the solidness of this business recovery Therefore, I would hedge my bet and go for 4 to 8 percent on Ml   Mr Chairman, there's one other--   You know, 1976 was 11 percent   ""Estimated"" is good, yes   What advantage would there be of that, Mr Chairman? I thought initially we were aiming at substituting a broader measure of credit than the narrow bank credit measure which had been affected by the degree of intermediation or disintermediation or whatever I suspect we might be getting too many targets   The more I listen to this discussion the more I wonder whether we are on the wrong foot here Is it really the degree of weight that we want to emphasize or is it the appropriate range of growth that would be the thing to concentrate on?   Well, that's right; the two are opposite sides of the same coin in a way   True   There's a different problem too On page 3 we talk about total domestic nonfinancial debt and on page 4 we talk about credit flows We know that we mean the same thing; I wonder if readers will   We could just call it ""debt expansion""   Just to make my own point clear, in response to Bill's comments I agree that that has been the strategic mistake we've made in the past, but I don't agree that we have already overstayed ease I think we need a little more ease; that's where our judgments differ   Mr Chairman, I'd be worried about not putting in the aggregates at all, although in some ways it's tempting not to do so But in not putting in any short-term targets it seems to me the discontinuity between what we're saying for the year as a whole    2/8-9/83  and what we would say for the two months ahead would just be far too great And I suspect the market would be very concerned, upset, and worried, speculating about what we were really up to unless in some loose way at least we continue to pay some attention to growth of the aggregates   Could you please read that again, sir?   Yes Just so we'll all know, Mr Chairman, has the date of your testimony been set yet? "
2329,1983-05-24," Mr Chairman, Bill Ford and I both happen to have the same question, we just found out Jerry, you referred to the fixed weight deflator The Board staff forecast officially, at least in the version I see here, uses the implicit deflator Just referring to the first quarter of the year, with that implicit deflator rising to a 58 percent annual rate and the CPI and the WPI either flat or declining, we are getting major different signals now on what is    5/24/83  really happening on the inflation front So, our technical question to the staff, Jerry, is Which of these different indicators of price movements do you consider to be the more meaningful?   One more question, Mr Chairman I certainly share the feeling around the table here that the business outlook is clearly better this time than at the time of the last meeting It's certainly true in the West I'm getting a little concerned, though, about the inflation outlook and whether it will be as favorable as the staff forecast has it I'd like to turn to you again, Jerry, on that one Our staff is not as optimistic as your people are I hope you're right I understand that your forecast for the deflator as we get out into the balance of this year is dependent on some improvement in productivity which seems to be fairly significant--about 3 percent growth, if I remember the figures correctly   3-1/2 percent Also, if my recollection is correct, that's pretty high in the range of historical experience; if not, tell me so I'd like to know what makes you so confident that we're going to get this good accomplishment in productivity; I hope we do, but it's apparently essential to getting this good outcome on the inflation front that you people are predicting   I don't really disagree with what has just been said, Paul, but I am a little concerned--and I'd like to hear your view--about what the market's reaction is going to be if we in fact come in this month with a 24 percent increase in Ml, as the Bluebook suggests We're going to have a hard time convincing markets that we're not off to the races and an overexpansion of money I think, Paul, that we will have to do something more than just sit   I think the case for a touch of snugging up has been pretty well set forth here already by, among others, Chuck and Jerry And I won't take the time to repeat those arguments I do fear that if we let this upswing in the economy get too far ahead of  -28-    5/24/83  us in terms of regenerating inflationary pressures or expectations, we will live to regret it I don't think we've ever made mistakes, or many mistakes at least, in the past by being too easy during recessions I think our mistake historically has been to hang on to ease too long after the upturn is underway I would be concerned about just plain market reactions to the announcement of a 24 percent increase in M1 in May; I think we might get a bigger case of bond yields rising than we did after that little flurry following last Friday's announcement We may not think that there is much content in M1 but I'm afraid the market may not be as convinced as we are That's one of the psychological problems we're dealing with And for those who are hasty to condemn Ml as having no informational content, I would raise the same question about M2 It too is a different animal than we used to have and we'd be ill advised to forget that Coming down to the bottom line, my snugging would be defined in terms of perhaps a borrowing assumption of $300 to $350 million, just leaning a bit in the direction of ""B minus"" but certainly doing nothing very drastic   I don't know, but there might be some who would view this snugging up as a way of either heading off further increases in long-term rates or helping to bring them down That has to be the key thing Let's not kid ourselves that the funds rate is going to make or break the economy What's going to make it or break it is the trend of long-term rates   That affects foreign borrowing--the whole business   I don't view it as inconsistent, Henry, because I happen to believe that long-term rates are heavily influenced by expectations of future inflation   I strongly support Lyle's diagnosis, which I think is first-rate We do have internal dynamics of a business expansion going on here; and part of the history is that when that goes on, we get price movements associated directly with it And that's my fear--that we may be in the process of getting a greater  -40-    5/24/83  inflation rate than the Board staff has forecast, even though they have a lot of logic and plausibility on their side History would argue the other way And that's what I would like to see us heading off at the pass by a little snugging up starting now   That's in alternative I, Paul, if you just want to borrow the language in the middle sentence there It's the part in brackets   That sounds good   If I may be so bold, Mr Chairman, to answer that question You may not agree with it, but let's not forget, Roger, that this directive will be released right after our July meeting but before the Chairman's testimony and hence the Fed watchers will be really studying that directive to see what nuances they can draw from it I think it's a particularly important statement   You've muddied the waters  SPEAKER(?) Making him another God "
2364,1983-07-12," Jim, I'd like to ask a question, if I may, on the federal government share of total credit flows, which was [depicted in] the lower half of the first chart that Mike Prell referred to I believe that has quite a bearing on the outlook for interest rates, real and nominal My question specifically, Mike, is Do you have anything in here other than the unified budget deficit? That is, have you included off-budget deficits and mortgage pools and guaranteed loans? Just what is in this measurement?   All right, thank you   I'd like to ask Jim another question or two about the first page of his charts, the lower panel that dealt with interest rates Do you care to share with us, Jim, your explanation, or rationale if you have one, of the underlying cause of this rise in interest rates shown for midyear up to the fourth quarter and then a decline by the fourth quarter of next year? That's a tough one   I appreciate your sharing those thoughts with us I gather, based on your remarks, that you share to some extent the view that long rates are influenced considerably by inflation expectations And yet the pattern that we see both in your chart as well as in Appendix I in the Bluebook shows short rates and long rates generally moving up and down together If you look back a few years, the [unintelligible] doctrine was that if we could convince markets that we were going to pursue anti-inflationary policies on into the    7/12-13/83  future, we would reduce inflation expectations and have downward pressure on long rates The thing I'm agonizing about the most, and I guess a lot of people around the table are, is What in the heck has caused this serious increase in long rates since the middle of May or for about 2 months now? Have inflation expectations worsened or are we in a new era where if short rates go up, the arbitrage effects are going to cause long rates to go up right along with them irrespective of any changes or lack thereof in inflation expectations?   Well, that's right And it comes back to a point made in that first chart that Mike Prell showed that the percent of total credit flows being taken by the federal government, as projected forward a year to the fourth quarter of 1984, apparently isn't going to come down nearly as much as it usually does following an economic recovery We have this new structural deficit in there that's keeping that share up Is that the way you'd interpret it, Mike? And that, in turn, could have an effect of keeping interest rates up, I guess   Mr Chairman, I'm having a hard time trying to reconcile what I thought were the central conclusions of the staff studies made here at the Board plus staff studies at our Banks with what I think I am hearing from Steve and some of the skepticism about how much reliance we can have on Ml--whether or not we should reinstitute it as a target for monetary policy and return to giving it equal weight I just wonder if I could raise a few questions to [assemble] some facts or at least some judgments, Steve Am I wrong in thinking that your findings pretty definitely show, now that we have the history of this period since the introduction of MMDAs and Super NOWs behind us, that on balance M1 has not been distorted--that the ins and outs just about offset each other, contrary to what most of us thought would happen a year ago? So, if I'm right on this, we can no longer take the position that one of the reasons we should deemphasize M1 is that it is being influenced by these institutional developments and new accounts That's the first question   Well, I think Preston asked the question I had in mind In other words, your conclusion--it is mine and if you disagree, Steve, I hope you would say so--is that what we have seen is the surge of money responding to the drop in interest rates, and that's not a shift in demand for money but a moving along a given demand function If that is true, based on the experimental Board models that you unveiled for us at the last FOMC meeting and on work that we've been doing at our Bank, I end up judgmentally concluding that the demand for money has not really shifted in any basic sense relative to income and interest rates in the last couple of years If that's true, then I am forced to conclude that from this point on we need to put more emphasis on the growth rate of Ml Now, if that is wrong, tell me why you think it's wrong   It's down 1/2 percentage point each year  -28-    7/12-13/83   Alternative III makes a lot of sense   I think that's a very good point, if I can break in and support Chuck's position on that Moving to the alternative II range for M1 shown in the Bluebook for the balance of this year would make a lot of sense, because that range of 7 to 11 percent would accommodate about a 6 percent growth rate or a little better in Ml from June to December which, according to our San Francisco model at least, would provide sustained economic growth and no increase in inflation We'd come in with over 5 percent real growth, based on our models, for both years So, I would feel a lot more comfortable, and I would think we might defuse some of the market fears about what we're up to, if we were to adopt that We realize what has gone on this year so far in Ml and we can't undo that; that would be totally unrealistic I think we should defuse some of the market fears about what we may be doing by forthrightly coming out for a range of 7 to 11 percent, which in my view would accommodate the approximately 6 percent growth rate in M1 that we happen to think would be about optimal for the balance of this year and through 1984   Yes, a little better than 6 percent That's shown on page 6 in the Bluebook in the final column to the right   Eleven percent for the year would allow 6-1/2 percent from June to December   That's a good idea   Paul, is this suggestion both for '83 and '84?  -47-    7/12-13/83   But was it for both years? Is that after rebasing 1983?   The latter half will be about 6 or 65 percent   Mr Chairman, I'll come back and support the words of caution that Lyle threw out here, wisely in my opinion, a few minutes ago We are not debating the course of policy; we're debating broad ranges that have a public announcement effect and certain  -84-    7/12-13/83  perceptions To go up to 5 to 9 percent in combination with what we've already done--or let happen--in M1 this year because of some very unusual circumstances, I think has some real risks of adding to perceptions that the Fed is giving up on the battle against inflation I would be very leery of that I'd rather live with some inconsistencies that we can straighten out or worry about later on This is, after all, just a tentative, provisional indication of our 1984 plans subject to the usual more thorough review around yearend or early next year   This would be from June or the second quarter?  SEVERAL Second quarter   Amen   I'll support that   I thought we already had decided down a point on credit   No, they've stopped the borrowing now; they have repaid the whole thing That final week before the consummation of the mergers it got up to a daily high of $960 million and a weekly average of $800 million We gave them a week after the consummation of mergers to repay the whole thing and they have done it   Yes, really raised the funds in the market to do it We didn't want to have a disruptive situation, so we talked about cranking it down to about $300 million a day And they paid off late last week and got it down to zero  -93-    7/12-13/83 "
2391,1983-08-23," I saw at least one press report that indicated the initial intervention by the Treasury was unilateral and did not involve coordination with any foreign central bank I was just going to ask, Tony, if it's a fair question Is that true or not?   Well, as usual, the press got things screwed up   Yes, I have one, Mr Chairman I'd like to get Peter's perspective on the new wrinkle added--or should I say reintroduced--at last month's meeting of the Committee, which was to pay attention not just to borrowing but to excess reserves as well In other words, we were going back to a free reserve or net borrowed reserve concept if I understood that correctly Just from your perspective, how if at all does that new wrinkle affect your ability to carry out the Committee's instructions or goals?   The reason I raised that question, Mr Chairman, is that if you go back and look at the history of the relationship of excess reserves to the economy, it appears to me at least to be trendless and erratic I would have to judge that any sustained move to instruct the Desk to follow free reserve or net borrowed reserve targets would be counterproductive, and I would advise against it   Pay your money and take your choice, I guess Personally, I'd have more faith in just following the borrowing   I have a healthy respect for the forecast produced by the Board staff In light of yesterday's discussion, I feel it necessary to ""fess up,"" as it were We [in San Francisco] do have a significantly different forecast, though not for this year, where we come in very close to the [Board staff] forecast By the    8/23/83  time we get to 1984 there is a difference that I feel compelled to comment on I'll try to explain very briefly why On real GNP, the Board staff reduced its forecast for the end of '83 to the end of '84 fractionally this time They were at 42 percent in July and they're at 4 percent in the latest revision; so, they're down fractionally We had already been higher than they were in our July forecast, which was a 51 percent increase Our staff, rightly or wrongly, has now upped that to a 58 percent real GNP gain fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter In trying to track down the differences--because what I expect every time from my staff is some explanation or attempted reconciliation of differences between their forecast and that of the Board staff--it gets down to the basic methodology The Board staff has a model that's driven by M2 and we're old fashioned enough to be back to using Ml The reason I feel compelled to comment on this is that I have in front of me a chart that shows the relationship between M2 and personal income going back quite a ways It tracked pretty well up until 1978 when all these things began to happen to rates paid on various components of the Ms Since that time any relationship between M2 and income is just invisible In fact, they quite often go in opposite directions We have some faith that we're about to see a restoration of normal velocity patterns in Ml   Yes, except obviously for 1982, when it just fell out of bed and was hopeless What we're expecting--and it's a forecast not a fact--is that we're in the process of seeing the restoration of the normal velocity trend in Ml which, if realized by the fourth quarter as we forecast, would mean a considerably faster growth of the economy going into 1984 Our specific monetary assumption is that for the balance of this year Ml will grow at the upper end of its range and that as we move into 1984 it will grow in the middle of the 4 to 8 percent range I think your forecast, Jim, was based on M2 in the middle of the range both for the balance of this year and next year So, it's simply the difference in methodologies All sorts of details, of course, would have to be explored, but just in a gross sense that's why we come out with a different forecast Since we have stronger real growth, we have less unemployment Time will tell which of these views is correct   It's a little more than the Board staff has Specifically, they're expecting 43 percent this year, fourth quarter- to-fourth quarter, versus our 51 percent; next year they're at 44 percent and we're at 52 percent  SPEAKER(?) What about the interest rates?   We don't forecast interest rates We don't know how   We assume velocity will approximate its historical growth rate more than what we saw in 1982 I'm not sure--I don't think anybody can be, Henry--that it's going to come back right    8/23/83  on or somewhere around the historical average, but it's certain to bounce back and be reasonably similar to what it used to be--up 2 or 3 percent a year   I like mine better   Steve, may I ask What is your velocity forecast or expectation for Ml for the fourth quarter?   The historical average was how much higher?   True, but is that a fair comparison? That is kind of old M1 with--   What I'm trying to get is What would be the comparable figure of the old Ml velocity given the new M1 content? Would it be 3 percent or 2 percent or what?   I'm just trying to smoke out, if we can, what Steve meant by ""velocity is recovering but it will remain low"" I think those are the words you used   I'll start an argument here, just so that we can have something to do between now and lunch time   Based on the San Francisco money market model, we do not share the view that Ml is in the process of slowing down Therefore, that leads me to wonder whether the 10 percent funds rate is going to be enough to contain Ml anywhere near the path that we have set for this quarter We've already overshot as it is and I would expect some further overshoot based on our analysis That leads me in the direction of at least ""B-"" if not all the way to ""C""   I guess I'm quarreling about whether ""existing degree of reserve restraint"" is in fact what we need or whether we need a bit more restraint   That's right We have two choices We can put our confidence in the forecast, which may be wrong, or wait to see what happens, in which case it may be too late "
2419,1983-10-04," Mr Chairman, I'd like to add to what Ed just said I think there are some signs on the horizon already of this crowding out It's true that housing starts nationally continued to go up in August, but in the state of Oregon, for example, there was no increased production of lumber even in the face of that Sales were made out of fairly high levels of inventory at the plant level and at the retail level, and that's because they expect the corner to be turned in the near future They look at such things as what is going on in the sales of new single-family homes, and in that area there were declines two months in a row--in July and August The lumber industry feels that that becomes a harbinger of what is going to happen in the near future to housing starts Once a housing start is under way, of course, [the builder] has to complete that house So, even though the demand may be weakening in terms of ultimate purchases, housing starts continue to look solid for a while But I think this indication that sales of new single-family homes are already starting to decline, down two months in a row, is a concrete sign that the squeeze is being put on that industry by high interest rates   Well, things do seem to be going very well overall And yet in the spirit in which Lyle Gramley raised the question, I wonder Is Murphy's law--Murphy's law being that if something can go wrong, it will--going to operate? I travelled around 5 Pacific Basin countries in the last month and one of the questions that kept recurring very frequently--to which, admittedly, I didn't know the answer--was Are we going to get through this next 12 to 18 months without some sort of a major financial backlash or crisis as a result of the LDC international debt problem? And for those of us who weren't around at the IMF meeting I just wonder, Mr Chairman, if you or someone else can fill us in on what seems to be the picture with regard especially to the manageability of the international debt position of particular countries south of the border   I agree, Pres, and that's why I raised that issue for some discussion here   Mr Chairman, I have a great respect for Steve's analysis In fact, his report was so interesting that I wish to ask him if he would provide us with a copy of it so that we can study and digest it Until I've had a chance to do that, I wouldn't want to make any immediate response or rejoinder other than to say that his conclusions leave us with a considerable dilemma The bottom line on his conclusion--that it's premature to place much more weight on Ml at  -24-    10/4/83  this time--is somewhat contrary to the paper that I distributed following our last FOMC meeting The dilemma that I see is that the Board staff's response to our paper, which has not been circulated to the rest of you yet, pretty much agreed with the second major proposition in the paper that I distributed Here's a quote from a paper from Steve that was prepared [by Board staff] and had to do with the fact that there is no discernible relationship in recent years between M2 and M3 on the one hand and future income on the other ""Indeed, there does not appear to be any significant statistical relationship between M2 and nominal GNP"" So, perhaps it's appropriate to be cautious about saying that we can restore faith in M1 or put it up higher in priority in terms of our goals But at the same time, let's not overlook the fact that we've been dealing with two other intermediate targets, M2 and M3, and putting more weight on those for quite a few months now And I think all of us knew, or should have known, that there was darn little relationship between those two particular intermediate targets and the rest of the economy So, M1 may be far from perfect but the alternatives are even worse And that's the dilemma Pending the chance to really cogitate and think about Steve's paper, I'd prefer to defer any other comments or rejoinder until I've had a chance to do that But I congratulate him on the excellent work that he's done here   Well, if I may I think we probably both agree, Steve--if you don't, say so--that the main reason for the precipitous drop in Ml velocity in '82 and the first part of '83 was a parallel decline that took place in both inflation and hence in interest rates And bottom line, our expectation is--and admittedly this is a forecast and not yet a fact--that the slight improvement that we've seen in Ml velocity in the second and third quarters is about to become more than slight as we go into the fourth quarter In fact, our forecast for M1 velocity in the fourth quarter is about a 4 percent increase If we're right, and time will tell, we are really on the verge of Ml  -25-    10/4/83  bouncing back to a point where it can be used and would be superior to M2 and M3 But, as I say, that remains to be seen   I would agree with that, Governor Wallich In fact, one of the main thrusts of the paper that I distributed was that, in our view at least, demand for M1 has not been unstable in recent times--that what we witnessed in '82 and in the first part of '83 was not a shift in the demand for money but a movement along a given demand function as interest rates came down and people wanted more money That's not the same as a shift in the demand for money; that's moving along a demand function And therein, I guess, lies one of the differences in analysis between us and Steve   Well, one of the things that I found fascinating about the technical paper that was distributed was that the Board's staff found fault with the way we had computed interest elasticity going back to the mid-1960s, but there seemed to be no disagreement in the two methods that your staff used leading toward a conclusion that  -26-    10/4/83  interest elasticity had shown virtually no change The interest elasticity of M1 has shown virtually no change following the introduction of NOW accounts in January of '81 and Super NOW accounts in January of '83 I was quite impressed by those flat lines That was one of the things that we had concluded that the introduction of NOWs changed interest elasticity   Weren't there a lot of quarter-end pressures in that?   How about ""intended for recent weeks""?   Paul, I'd like to support the proposition made by Governor Martin a little while ago that if we have a chance to probe toward a little lower rates, we should do so for the reasons he set forth, which I find not only cogent but very worrisome   Mr Chairman, this dialogue here--   Mr Chairman, in terms of whether we probe one way or another, it is at least my sense that we would be probing  -38-    10/4/83  toward a little lower rates only on the condition that the Ms come in somewhere outside the range shown in alternative B If anyone was making a different proposal than that, I didn't understand it   So, we aren't talking about making major overt moves to accelerate the rate of monetary growth, which I agree would be untoward We'll never get to 1984 if we have a big LDC debt crisis in the fourth quarter of 1983 I think we have to deal with these things one at a time I'm not talking about any extreme measures, but a shading in favor of easing a bit in the immediate future if we can, given the behavior of the aggregates   Would you say that again please? "
2444,1983-11-14," My question pertains to Chart 18 on the baseline case I want to precede that by saying that the reason I was so impressed with this presentation is that it's a very useful device for reminding us that an interaction goes on between the monetary side and the real side of the economy and getting these outcomes for almost all the variables we're looking at With respect to the particular baseline case, in light of the fact that some of us here--I at least-- think that the velocity of Ml is in the process now, or soon will be, of returning to a more normal historical pattern, I was wondering if you've done any experimenting with what growth in Ml, or indeed other monetary measures such as growth of total reserves, for example, might be consistent with the outcome that you have in unemployment, inflation, and real GNP?   I'd like to come back just a second to this inflation expectation problem that, as you said, your model can't incorporate As I look at today's Bluebook and the structure of the alternatives there between alternative A and alternative C, the interest rate levels projected show the T-bill rate going down to the 8 to 8-1/2 percent range under alternative A with a slight drop in long rates And in alternative C the T-bill rate is up in the 9-1/4 to 9-3/4 percent range with a slight rise in long rates My question is Given the dramatic drop in inflation we've already had, what is holding interest rates up at those levels? Might it not, in fact, be inflation expectations?   I'd rather not wait, but if you have an answer I guess--   I'm sorry   And a large part of the deficit is financed by imported capital, which is what is going on right now   Mr Chairman, I wonder if in this review at the next meeting we could have the advantage of having sent to us the text of the staff's views given in the chart show today so that our own staffs may work on an analysis We'll see if our [unintelligible] and weigh them a little   That's right   We need some harp and string music here!   Well, Mr Chairman, I continue to be impressed by the differences in the strength of an aggregate like real GNP, which is looking strong, versus the reports I hear around the table and the conditions I witness in our own District industry by industry Basically we have both great strengths and great weaknesses Perhaps that is what one expects in a recovery that is less than a year old Certainly, if you disaggregate the economy, you get a marked impression that things are not going well across the board; some things are going very well indeed and some things aren't going so well It's only in some aggregate sense that the economy is continuing to move upward But I'm beginning to get concerned about some of the distortions that are taking place in some key industries, despite overall growth in employment and production--in areas such as construction, trade, finance, services, and so forth The drop in housing starts that we had last September of some 15 percent is really beginning to feed back into the forest products business now, and the recovery that had taken place in the state of Oregon clearly has stalled Unemployment is rising again In our aerospace business, our country's biggest company has continued to reduce its payroll up until very recently But there is some good news there because they have just gotten a heavy inflow of new orders for commercial aircraft New orders in the last month or so have been greater than all the rest of 1983 put together and the backlog of unfilled orders is now rising And that's, of course, good news for the Pacific Northwest   It's a combination of domestic and foreign in the commercial field I'm not talking about the military areas now The other thing, which is disturbing in the sense of representing some real distortion in the structure of production in the country, is that we have important agricultural economies in the the western region-- California, of course, being the country's biggest single agricultural state--and I keep hearing many of our directors sing the blues about what the high value of the dollar is doing to export markets This ranges all the way from log exports to Japan to cotton exports coming out of the central valley in California to a good part of the rest of the world So, even though yields on a good many agricultural crops are reaching new records, the markets for these products are lousy and that's a direct reflection of the value of the dollar on the exchange markets I think we ought to keep these kinds of things in the back of our minds as we assess the outlook, [knowing] that not all of reality gets captured in things like real GNP   It depends on which commodity you're talking about, Governor Rice   My information, Jim, is that the wheat crops around the whole country will be at a new record level by a big margin and that the foreign demand for it just isn't there and the farmers are very worried about price prospects Does that jive with what you hear in your District, Roger?   Well, I guess I'll take on the role of the school of contrary thinking for about the third month in a row, just so we don't get too complacent What I'm referring to, Mr Chairman, is the move we made--with which I agreed at the time and which we all know about--to deemphasize Ml and to pay more attention to the broader aggregates There was good reason for doing that We also said to ourselves, I think [the record] will show, that when and if Ml began to behave more normally again, particularly in terms of velocity, we would reconsider whether more emphasis ought to be put on it A couple of months ago--specifically in August--I circulated a paper that had a couple of key conclusions One was that the broader aggregates, M2 and M3, looked to us to be highly unreliable as a forecaster of income, prices, or anything else for the last couple of years Ml admittedly wasn't perfect but it was a lot better than the alternatives had been in the past, and I expect it will be again in the future once we get a revival of velocity looking somewhat normal We were forecasting in our Bank at least that that would happen by the closing months of this year, and that forecast looks better than ever now It is pretty much expected--I see similar figures in the Bluebook--that we will have a strong rise in velocity of Ml in the fourth quarter And for that reason I'm again suggesting that we not wait too much longer before putting Ml back as one of the primary intermediate targets, along the lines it used to be, simply because I have such a big distrust of M2 and M3 telling us anything  We went through a big recession and now have a strong recovery, and we hardly would have noticed it from what happened in the behavior of those broader aggregates I recognize your point, Mr Chairman, that the recent slowdown in Ml has to be viewed against the background of the strong growth earlier and the fact that we did rebase in July Having said that, I'm not sure I'd be comfortable with seeing another month or two of very low growth in Ml just because it seems to be coming back on track in terms of behavior, including velocity behavior now Our San Francisco money market model would not suggest any major move and I too am against a major move in policy at this time But I would suggest a modest move toward nudging that funds rate down at least 50 basis points in order to get a little stronger Ml growth in the remaining months of this year and bring it by December at least a little closer to the midpoint--though it would still be under the midpoint--of that 5 to 9 percent range Frankly, I'm skeptical about whether we're going to get the 7-1/2 percent growth in November-December mentioned in the Bluebook, given the recent level of the federal funds rate So, in a word, I would be in favor of moving toward the specifications of alternative A in order to accomplish what I just outlined  -54-    11/14-15/83   Well, that's right, Chuck I didn't expect to change many minds today, but one of the reasons I wanted to raise this flag of caution here is that, as I look back at the 11 years I've been sitting around this table, I think the mistakes that we've made have been ones of intuitively trying to look through the intermediate targets to the economy as a whole, while officially we never did, if you wish, target real GNP and even interest rates That has led us more often than not into a pro-cyclical monetary policy And it was one of the reasons that the Chairman proposed to this group in October of 1979 that we get off our interest rate stabilization in the short run and onto monetary targeting I think what we really have been doing in the past year de facto is targeting interest rates, and I'm afraid that again that will lead us to some pro-cyclical monetary policy if we keep it up too long   Well, I would never have proposed that we follow it in the last year, Tony, because we did realize in a timely way that something funny was going on in velocity and were wise enough to offset it It would have been a disaster if we had not let Ml increase by 8-1/2 percent in 1982 instead of the targeted 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent in view of what in fact was going on in its velocity and the big drop that we had first in inflation and then in interest rates We are convinced, and I think a lot of people around the table would be too, that what happened was that the opportunity cost of holding money dropped very significantly with that drop in interest rates and, therefore, more money was demanded It wasn't that the  -55-    11/14-15/83  demand curve was shifting but that the amount of money demanded moving along a given curve was going up, given the fact that interest rates were coming down   Mr Chairman, perhaps I should defer; my question has nothing to do with current specifications I would like to ask Steve a question about our meeting yesterday after you get through this Pardon me   It would have been a very peaceful meeting except for me; I'm sorry about that  -62-    11/14-15/83   Have a telephone call "
2476,1983-12-19," That's a good point, Chuck I would ask the question If we went back to the approximately equal [weight] scenario that we had some years ago, that would not take care of all of the problems we're raising, would it? It might take care of what-- half?   I guess I'll resist the temptation of asking, Mr Chairman, why we decided to go back to CRR in view of all of this But passing beyond that, first I'd like to associate myself with the view that Ed Boehne expressed so well Just because we have CRR doesn't mean we necessarily should revert to Ml as the primary intermediate target However, I consider it personally a rather fortunate piece of timing in that I'm convinced--as some others are around the table, though many are not--that we are in the process of witnessing a new behavior of Ml where it's going to be more reliable We're beyond that stage where velocity dropped in that unprecedented manner in '82 or early '83 and, therefore, we now can begin to rely more on Ml, as we used to do If that's the case, and it happens that it has come along just at a time when we could have some automaticity in Ml--not complete in my view--then some automaticity would not be damaging; it probably would be desirable I wouldn't want, as Si Keehn said--I think it was you, Si--to go fully automatic But I think it's time we went partly that way I come out, bottom line, in much the same way as Si Keehn and Ted Roberts and Bob Black did   Tony, could you speak up a little louder please? Some of us can't hear you down here   Sometimes, Mr Chairman, it helps to get outside of one's own group and kick around these kinds of problems with a few knowledgeable outsiders, which we did at our Bank earlier this month at a conference on monetary targeting and velocity That was held in view of the major, unprecedented decline in velocity in '82 I'm just going to give a few highlights that I think may be of interest to this group A number of people who are in the room were at that conference or participated in it, including Steve, who was our lead-off speaker, and Frank, who chaired the panel I made some remarks and we had some professors making remarks and so forth One of the things that I found particularly interesting about that meeting was a comment by an official of the Bank of Japan who looked at what was happening in monetary targeting across a number of countries in different parts of the world Very briefly, he concluded that in those countries where regulations--especially on deposit interest rates--have been binding, the financial innovations [aimed at] getting around those regulations had a really major distorting effect on the various monetary aggregates used in those countries On the other hand, he set forth a class of countries that had deregulated in the face of rising inflation and interest rates and found that there had been much less distortion in the monetary aggregates in those countries I found that cross-country analysis really quite interesting because it seemed to me to be consistent with the US experience In particular, in our own country we look back at 1974 and 1975 when there was a great deal of financial innovation, if you remember, [to get] around the regulatory ceilings on interest rates Ml was badly distorted There is no doubt that that was about the time that I became a proponent of M2, but of the M2 of that day But in this more recent period of 1982 and 1983 when, as you know, we had considerable deregulation and it was proceeding quite rapidly, it's our view in San Francisco at least that Ml was quite little distorted on balance The big distortions, to our surprise in a way because we expected the opposite, came in M2 and in M3  Another thing, as far as I'm concerned, that came out of that conference was something of a compromise point of view, I guess, on what did happen to Ml during that period in 1982 when its velocity was dropping by an unprecedented amount When everything is said and done there really have been two basic explanations here and among the academics as to what was going on Perhaps this is a bit oversimplified, but one explanation is that it was a business cycle phenomenon--the build-up of precautionary balances and that sort thing, which in turn caused velocity to decline The alternative  -48-    12/19-20/83  view, which we lean toward in San Francisco, is that the big drop in velocity was a direct response to the major decline in the rate of inflation and hence the major decline that occurred in market interest rates in the latter half of 1982--that that in effect caused the opportunity cost of holding money to drop sharply and led to not a shift in the demand for money but an increase along a given demand function in the amount of money that people wanted to hold in relation to income Well, whichever one of those explanations might eventually win men's minds or whichever of those explanations is true, the real point, as I thought about the conference and its aftermath, is that the phenomena to which they were referring are over That is, the recession is over; we're coming out of it We don't expect another big drop in inflation and interest rates, as much as I would like to see that--something that could cause velocity to drop I don't see a decrease in the amount of money demanded on the horizon either But that reinforces my belief that we're well on the way toward [returning to] the more normal behavior of Ml that we had historically  In view of that background, I come out bottom line in much the same way that Messrs Black, Roberts, Keehn, and Partee have here I would restore Ml to more importance, perhaps even primary importance I have to say that I'm getting a little nervous about our credibility being undermined in the academic community and among serious students of money and monetary policy by our continuing officially to set M2 and M3 targets because they know as well as we do what some have already mentioned around the table here that M2 and M3 go on like Old Man River at about the same rates of growth almost irrespective of whether the economy is in a strong upswing or whether it is in fact in the middle of a recession I'm not against having some extra targets we're almost bound to hit The best thing I can say about M2 and M3 in terms of keeping them as targets is that they're almost impossible to miss I guess that's not without some merit compared to a target that jumps around But, frankly, I wouldn't give very much weight to them I think the more we continue to do so the more we're going to undermine our credibility out there where it counts, or at least in some areas where it counts  Specifically, I would go in the direction that was implied in the Bluebook that perhaps it's time to reduce the spread of the M1 range from the 4 points that we now have You all recall that many years ago a spread of 2 points was par for the course I don't think we need to jump down that far that fast, but I would urge consideration of reducing that spread to 3 points At this time I don't believe we're trying to make final decisions, Mr Chairman, but certainly I would not at this moment want to see that 3-point spread centered any higher than 6 percent and might even favor aiming at a 5 percent midpoint If we're going to have a 6 percent midpoint, which is about the most I would go for, we could consider a range of 4-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent, if we were willing to adopt only a 3-point range rather than a 4-point range It's not without precedent that we have ranges that have a fraction of a half We did that just a couple of years back, so that wouldn't be a particularly troublesome innovation In terms of M2 and M3, I guess I really don't care I could take what is in the Bluebook or some of the modifications that [have been suggested] here because I don't think they mean much They don't indicate what is going to happen in the economy; we have very little control over them So, for all the reasons that I've talked about today and that others have talked about, and in light of the paper I  -49-    12/19-20/83  circulated to you a couple of months back, I think the time has come to restore M1 to at least equal weight, if not more   Not yet   At the risk of being accused of looking at the hole rather than the doughnut, I would quickly like to repeat something I said last month--Chuck is smiling--that these [unintelligible] looking figures on the macroeconomic statistics are not capturing all of reality My deputy chairman came back from a recent meeting of the Conference of Chairman and Deputies and according to his tabulations there were 6 to 9 Districts that reported distinctly spotty trends in the economy Yes, indeed, a lot of things are going well But a lot of things aren't going well, and they're concentrated in areas such as agriculture, export industries, and so on So, on a broader basis, my own reading of the economy is that there is not really much risk of a major significant reacceleration of inflation Therefore, I would come out similar to the way that Governors Martin and Teeters and Partee have come out I think it would be premature to snug I would be in favor of alternative B and would like to see that borrowing assumption no higher than $650 million The hoped for turnaround in M1 is still a forecast, not a fact And if it proved unfortunately not to be an accurate forecast, I would begin to get a little more worried than I was last month   No I said I would not like to see it any higher than $650 million as the initial figure   I'm having trouble hearing down here, Mr Chairman "
2502,1984-01-30," It probably was a good answer What was the question?   I was going to ask a question on the same subject, as a matter of fact, but with a little different slant, Jerry The anecdotal evidence from some of our directors, which of course isn't definitive, has been pretty constant in recent months When I quiz them about the capital spending outlook they say that there still are great inhibitions--the high cost of money, in particular--to spending on long-lived assets I was wondering whether you have any breakdown in the fixed investment data between the equipment side and the plant side The impression I'm getting, which may or may not be accurate, is that a good deal of this surge in spending has been on computer and business equipment and so forth rather than on basic new capacity, which requires additional buildings and plants Do you have any breakdown on that series?   That's very interesting The bulk of the increase is going to be on the so-called equipment side, then?   Well, we might as well go from one extreme to another here, from Morris to Balles I would like to speak to the  -22-    1/30-31/84  desirability of restoring M1 as one of the aggregates we target-- possibly going back to the old equal weight we used to have for M1 and M2 I'll be brief about this because my reasons for recommending this haven't really changed since last fall when I circulated a paper to all of you comparing the performance of M1 and M2 Very briefly, and perhaps over-simplified, the conclusions I drew were that the demand for M1 has remained surprisingly stable through this recent period of financial deregulation, whereas the demand for M2 as a matter of fact has become progressively more unstable It's true, of course, with respect to M1 that we had this very sharp and unexpected decline--a very surprising decline--in its velocity in '82 and even early '83 In our analysis that decline was not caused by a shift in the demand function for M1 but was a direct outcome of the decline in inflation and the corresponding and later decline in interest rates So we have had an increase in money demanded because interest rates were down and the opportunity costs of holding money were lower I think a significant piece of evidence that this was not a shift in the demand function for money but a move along a curve was that the velocity of the [broader] monetary aggregates also declined in 1982 I don't think that would have happened if the problem had been solely one of instability in the demand function for M1  Another thing that I would like to point out is that the variability of M1 velocity to which Steve referred indirectly is actually a bit less than the variability of M2 velocity Our staff, using the figures in Steve's excellent memorandum of January 23, compared the standard deviations of one to another and found that the standard deviations of the annual growth rates of M1 were actually a little less than was the case for M2 So it's all well and good and proper to point out, as Steve has done in his usual thorough way, that there are residual problems remaining with M1 A good part of it now consists of Super NOW accounts that may have some interest elasticity On the other hand, what are the alternatives? Looking at the alternatives, two things clearly stand out to me One is that M2 really has lost any meaningful relationship to future income That is to say, M2 in recent years has grown at a steady 8 to 9 percent rate a year whether we had a strong, booming economy or whether we had a deep recession We never could have anticipated either one of those two from the growth rates of M2 that preceded it Though I wouldn't put all my bets on M1 by any means, I do think, given the point that Steve made about the velocity of M1 now seeming to have turned in an upward direction even if moderately, that the sharp inflow of funds into Super NOWs has tapered off and we have a fairly stable slow growth rate there So, I would recommend restoring M1 to about equal weight and I would subscribe further to the point that Steve made that if we are going to restore M1, we probably should consider reducing the width of the range to 3 percentage points That would mean something like 4-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent, giving it the same midpoint, if you wish, as alternative II   Paul, I'd like to suggest that in order to avoid the kind of problems we had last July--or at least as far as my Bank is concerned, I'd just as soon not have a copy of the directive that is sent to New York In fact, I've already told my economic adviser I do not expect to notify him of what went on here in this meeting today And I think the rest of you might abide [by that] and do the same thing If we just kept the directive--   What really blew it last time was the fact that the copy of the directive that went to New York was sent to all Reserve Banks And then all sorts of people, including clerks and secretaries, handled it   And when the GAO came around, we had to have all those people interviewed I strongly [recommend] that the directive not be sent until after you testify   Well, the [New York staff who need to know] are sitting here They know what the directive is It's up to them, of course, whether they need it in writing   Let sleeping dogs lie "
2529,1984-03-26," I'd like to support that, Tony, because I found myself in the same position as Roger We have three people in the research department who are actively engaged in research and analysis of policy and I would not want to take any one of those off My first vice president is on the list to receive the Bluebook now under the [current] authorization, although he never in practice gets it The only time he would look at it would be an overt occasion when he    3/26-27/84  substitutes for me at this meeting or, alternatively, when he would participate in a conference call when I was out of town or otherwise unavailable, or on occasion when I'm out of town and he has to handle a telephone conference on the discount rate, as Roger mentioned So, if we could somehow get that exception you're talking about carefully controlled but built-in to avoid the necessity of formally notifying the Secretary every time I'm out of town, it would surely help We would treat it as a true exception, not just a routine everyday access to the FOMC Class I materials   Well, that's exactly--   I'll speak to that I think it's a good idea to get it early because we do have people at the Reserve Banks--whether it's one, two, or three--who spend a good deal of their time on analysis of policy options and so forth As things now stand, if the Bluebook doesn't come in until Sunday, they never do get a chance to read it or provide input or advice to the principal who comes to the meeting, at least in my case   Well, they can; it's just better if they know all the nuances and the considerations that are in the Bluebook I think they would benefit from knowing those before they render advice And on the other point, Mr Chairman, Norm knows we have had some real horror stories in terms of security in getting this material to the West Coast It wasn't just a matter of it not arriving but a matter of it getting lost in the mail It was out there floating around and we didn't know where it was and Norm didn't know where it was We finally retrieved it after extra copies were sent out to us He and I were both very, very much concerned about the security problem of it just getting lost in the mail because of this unreliable weekend delivery service I'm very nervous about that   Once a year   Mr Chairman, I have a request that may be too delicate for you to comment on--I'm not sure--but I'm going to read it anyway I'm scheduled in early April to give a talk to a banking association for foreign trade, as Chuck knows They tried to get him and had to settle for me In any event, the point may come up at that meeting in terms of comments that have been made in the press that you have had a role, and maybe a leading role, in urging the banks to reduce the interest rate that they are charging these troubled Latin American countries If that question comes up, is it true or not? What should I say? No comment? I don't know? Maybe?   It was That's the article I was referring to   That's surprising, because I know that at least at two of our big banks on the West Coast  those at the top level have stated that they feel concessions ought to be made on interest rates I wasn't aware that the people who show up at these meetings are taking a different view   I will try to make this very brief The business statistics in the West are quite good The aerospace industry, which I don't think anybody has commented on, is very strong Boeing is adding workers back after cutting back for two years in a row Electronics demand is strong in Silicon Valley One curious thing I've noted is that business statistics are better than the business attitudes, at least among some of our directors And that requires a word of explanation Housing and lumber, of course, are so important in the Pacific Northwest that I think some of the pessimism of the people in that industry is based on their lack of faith in the sustainability of the uptick we've had They see interest rates about to rise even more and they fear that will just cut off the resumed demand that we've seen in recent months in housing So, they really are not holding their breath waiting for a sustained uptrend in that area On the matter of what is going on in the mortgage area, in the West we find that almost half of the mortgages made last year in California, Nevada, and Arizona, which is the area of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, were based on adjustable rates That, of course, leads right back to where the risk has shifted That may be the salvation of the housing industry if it keeps up and borrowers can continue to be encouraged to go along with adjustable rate mortgages You asked about agriculture and that's awfully difficult to say anything about now   In that case I won't add to the pessimism that has been [related] that there is the overhang of previous debt and that some agricultural borrowers are having real trouble I think I'll stop at that point   Several people commented yesterday to the effect that the potential for inflation accelerating down the road is now increasing, unfortunately Certainly, the work that we've done in our Bank strongly supports the same conclusion that inflation begins to accelerate as we approach the unemployment range of 6 to 7 percent or the operating capacity range of 80 to 83 percent And I fear that may be down the road So, for that reason I also would come out in support of alternative B and would suggest a borrowing assumption-- since it isn't listed in the Bluebook table though it is listed in the text of the Bluebook--of about a billion dollars That would seem reasonable to me I think we should not shrink from letting the funds rate creep up to 10-1/2 percent in the near future for starters, and I would hope that it wouldn't have to go much above that But I think we are going to have to do something more than we've done recently to slow down the generally rapid thrust of all these aggregates, especially M1 I was glad to hear Steve's remarks--and perhaps I'm reading more into them than he meant--but it almost sounded, Steve, as if you're ready to take M1 off probation, which I would welcome   I think that makes eminent sense, Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman, apart from the possibility that you may for some reason I didn't understand release this prior to the normal time, I don't understand what all the fuss is about By the time the directive comes out at the normal time it is all history The next meeting has already been held The May meeting would have been over by a week Am I missing something?   May I ask one question just so we don't misunderstand the new ground rules here on access to this material? Do I understand now that we are not to inform even our economic advisors of the numbers in the directive? This is for the Presidents only? "
2557,1984-05-21," Mr Chairman, if I may, I would like to ask Peter a question about this movement of interest rates Peter, given the two factors that you cite for causing the rates to go up--that is, the collision course between private and public credit demands and the fading expectations of some closing of the deficit gap--do you see any particular reason why long rates should have gone up more than short rates since our last meeting? My own hunch is that, based on past performance, it would have been the other way around   Out in the West, the picture of strong spots and weak spots really hasn't changed at all since I reported on that at the last meeting I continue to be mystified, I guess, by the fact that business confidence for some months has not been as good as the business statistics The thing I wanted to call attention to this morning is that even prior to the Continental Illinois crisis, I had gotten some very strong protests and indications of concerns from small and medium size banks--particularly those represented on our five boards of directors--about the policies of the FDIC The concern is what those policies will do to the availability of bank credit among the community banks or regional banks, given the modified purchase and assumption cases, which have meant less than full coverage for uninsured deposits in a number of small banks that have closed down in our District The fear of these bankers is that they will begin to lose deposits to the large banks--that whatever customers they had with deposits of more than $100,000 will run to safety now I'm afraid that fear has been considerably exacerbated by what is going on, for obvious reasons They understand why it had to be done in the Continental Illinois case but they aren't much consoled by the thought of what it will do to them As a result, their confidence in their ability to supply local credit needs in the future is considerably shaken   Since I come from earthquake country, I'm used to aftershocks, and I think we may well see some aftershocks from the big increase in interest rates we've had since the last meeting We may see some aftershocks from widening concerns about LDCs and about the posture of thrift institutions, not to mention Continental So, while basically I would start with alternative B, I would be hopeful that we could have the flexibility that Jerry Corrigan recommended and be able to move If we had to move away from ""B,"" I would think it would be in the direction of ""B plus"" I think this is a time when we should err temporarily on the side of more liquidity than our long- term game plan would call for in view of all these financial fragilities "
2581,1984-07-16," I have another question on the exchange value of the dollar Some analysts believe that this recent action to eliminate the 30 percent withholding on foreign-owned US securities    7/16-17/84  is cause for a renewed surge of funding for the United States to take advantage of Is that likely to change your forecast of a 15 percent decline?   It's hard to pinpoint the precise reason why our staff forecast is a bit higher than the Board staff's on the inflation rate for next year But I think it probably has to do with our estimate that as we get into 1985 we will be approaching or at the point, both in terms of the capacity utilization rising and the unemployment rate declining, where in the past we typically have seen an acceleration of inflation   This is a technical observation, I guess, Mr Chairman If I remember your most recent testimony correctly, you at least--and perhaps the Committee--are on record as saying that M1 is still on probation I would think that before this meeting is over we ought to get that question settled as to whether it is or isn't In terms of public understanding at least, the record should show whether  -21-    7/16-17/84  we're still placing primary emphasis on M2 and M3 or whether, in fact, we're going to restore M1 to its prior position   In deciding between alternatives II and III, I'm influenced by our staff's forecast of velocity for the coming year We expect it to continue to show a significant rise--certainly above the less than 2 percent that the Board's staff has forecast After all, the first half of this year is up, with a 4-1/2 percent annual rate We look at it on a quarter-by-quarter basis; we've had three significant rises in velocity and we expect that to go up further in 1985 Who is right, of course, remains to be determined But based on that and based on our views of long standing here that we really    7/16-17/84  need to restore M1 to at least its former position--I agree with Bob Black on that--I would come down in favor of alternative III, using the 4 to 7 percent option   Mr Chairman, this is an observation about what we've done in the past I've just been asking Steve what the record shows My recollection has been that whatever targets we set at midyear, we very seldom--in fact, I thought never--changed them He has come up with one exception, in recent years at least, and that was in February of 1983 when we apparently did depart from what we'd set in mid-1982 I don't recall [why] In any event, for whatever reason, I never quite understood why we didn't allow ourselves the flexibility that at least in theory we ought to have But the record shows that when we've adopted a set of targets in July, we apparently have felt compelled for some reason to go along with those again in January in almost every case   I generally support the position you outlined, Mr Chairman, although my inclinations are to lean toward tightening because of a fear of inflation down the road I'm also very much concerned about avoiding any rocking of the boat in the near future if we can avoid it So I come out for ""B"" with the proviso that Governor Gramley added "
2610,1984-08-21," Mr Chairman, so everybody will be up to speed on the FCA situation, it's quite likely that they will be in to the window this week, though not in a big way in the sense that we've been pressuring them hard to get lots of collateral with us and all they have come up with so far is $2 billion And that is all very large denomination commercial real estate loans We have a team analyzing and evaluating this on a crash effort basis but initially, if they do request accommodation, we're going to take at least a 50 percent margin on that stuff and may never go above that margin So, for collateral reasons, we couldn't go above $1 billion right at this moment And it's doubtful that they are going to be able to get much more collateral into our Bank--at least this week I might add that none of it, of course, is eligible commercial paper It's all large denominations of commercial real estate loans So, it won't help that particular aspect of [our collateral] problem   Well, that's an issue I've raised and I hope we will get a firm answer to that pretty quickly We may need it It's under discussion now, I understand, but I don't know what the answer is We did raise the issue of whether we could lend to the Home Loan Bank based on collateral promissory notes that they have from their customers FCA has been scrambling hard to get billions of collateral into the Home Loan Bank; that's where they put their big effort But even there they may run out of gas, in terms of acceptable and available collateral We hope to avoid the loans [to] the HLB itself; it would make many less waves in terms of all sorts of things if we could lend to FCA, but we are exploring direct loans to the Home Loan Bank as a fallback position We've asked our staff along with the Board's staff to explore the legal and other aspects of such loans   Tony, that's totally inaccurate That New York Times story was especially bad yesterday about their losing only $200 million and that most of it was retail In fact, in the last 4 or 5 business days the net loss has been a half billion dollars a day on average and the great bulk of it is in these jumbo accounts   They lie very well   Yes   In two days they lost between a hundred and two hundred million just in retail accounts   Overall, I've been pretty well satisfied with the posture of our policy In view of the ongoing strength of the economy in most, if not all areas, I think it would be premature to ease overtly On the other hand, I'm particularly aware on the West Coast right now of the fragility of our financial system and what the repercussions could be of another major institution in serious trouble--and this time possibly involving outright losses to holders of uninsured deposits Unless or until that situation clarifies, I would be reluctant to see anything happen to push the federal funds rate up higher So, I come out favoring alternative B but along with four others who have already spoken on the subject, I also would be in favor of reducing the borrowing level to $800 million and would favor additionally the so-called symmetrical directive   As a matter of fact, I wanted to ask Steve whether that July figure is for real--that is to say meaningful--or whether it might be a seasonal problem "
2659,1984-11-07," Have you checked it with [Jimmy] the Greek?   In the Twelfth District, the pace of economic expansion really has slowed dramatically We just haven't seen the bounceback in sales that is reported in some Districts One thing that is going quite strongly in our District is nonresidential construction; in some of our leading cities it's almost of boom proportions But it's certainly clear that the reduction we've seen so far in mortgage rates has been insufficient to prevent both the construction and the sale of new homes from falling further That's a weak area And as I've been reporting for a long time now, the strong dollar and the situation with foreign imports are hurting a good part of Western industries such as forest products and primary metals, and that is reducing the overall growth of manufacturing employment to a crawl The agricultural situation is pretty grim in a good many of our states In sum, I think the balance has changed toward the engine stalling here If the plane is still in the air, it's about to make something worse than a soft landing I agree with much of what was said by Governors Martin and Rice and Presidents Keehn, Boehne, and others Monetary policy is supposed to be flexible and I think the time has come to err a bit on the side of ease unless the situation clarifies   I'd just like to ask Steve a question about the use of his phrase ""searching for hypotheses"" here in view of the unexpected and unwelcomed decline in M1 in October, which seems to be getting worse If there had not been a downward shift in money demand, are there alternative plausible explanations such as that we didn't provide enough reserves?   In view of what I perceive to be the weak spots in business that could be spreading rather than about to improve, and given the sustained undershoot in M1 since the middle of the year, I am getting quite concerned about that problem The well known volatility of M1 on a monthly basis begins to wash out when it has had a weak performance for four months I take no comfort in the fact that M2 has been rising steadily because it did so preceding the last major recession that we had I would be ready to err on the side of ease for a while and if that proves to be too much, we can always correct it later By and large the one alternative that to me at least would be unwise is alternative B, since that anticipates a borrowing level of $700 million and an expected federal funds rate of 10 percent In sum, I would be happy to see alternative A or possibly halfway between ""A"" and ""B"" And if we were to go for ""A,"" I would be a little cautious in going down to a borrowing level as low as $400  -36-    11/7/84  million right away; I would prefer to start at about $500 million for much the same reasons Governor Partee has already set forth "
2684,1984-12-17," Peter, maybe this is the wrong time to be raising the question, but sometime before we get through here I'd like to have somebody on the staff explain, if they can, what seems to be going on in M1 with this latest big drop of over $7 billion Are we looking at seasonal problems, reporting problems, or don't we know?   I would like to speak up in favor of some degree of automatic response, as Steve set forth a good case for it in his paper In fact, the whole paper was a badly needed new look at our operating procedures in the sense of some general dissatisfaction by many of us--with the benefit of hindsight now--with how the second half turned out in terms of our money targets and interest rate levels and similar matters I would have to say, though, with respect to our current operating procedure or even the amendment to it that you are proposing, Steve, that I think we're still going to be subject to all the weaknesses that we found way back in the 1960s with respect to free reserves Any given level of borrowing or any given level of free reserves is compatible with a wide range of interest rates, a wide range of different economic outcomes, and a wide range of possible growth in the monetary aggregates That's what we experienced so many years ago I'm afraid we're still working with a tool that has those built-in disadvantages So, while I personally would be in favor of going along some sort of semi-automatic route of the type Steve described, I think we also ought to consider, as an alternative to that, some semi-automatic targeting of nonborrowed reserves, which is after all closer to what we're really trying to control--the monetary aggregates as our intermediate targets We don't need to get back to a full automatic pilot Even if we were to go back to nonborrowed reserves targeting, we could also introduce some semi-automaticity simply by making judgments as to the degree to which the nonborrowed reserve path would be varied in response to a deviation of money from path I'm pretty much convinced at this point that that kind of approach would be superior over the longer run than something hooked on the borrowing target [The latter approach] most recently, as well as many years ago, has demonstrated the kinds of weaknesses that concern many of us   Well, I'd like to concur with Steve's assessment of what has been happening to M1 recently There is never any indicator that's going to be perfect I think M1 has exhibited some stability recently, more than it did in the earlier period But whenever I hear this criticism of M1, I have to ask What are the alternatives? And the alternatives--such as M2 or M3--are even worse as far as I can tell And the worst one of all in my personal opinion is the ""look at everything"" approach, which generally leads to confusion and indecision and action that is taken much too late  -19-    12/17-18/84  There's a tendency when one looks at everything to fail to distinguish between the leading indicators and the current indicators and end up not doing anything right So, given the alternatives, I would still come out for putting more emphasis on M1 than many of you I think that will guide us better than these others   Is 3 percent enough? Probably not Is 3 percent likely to be what we achieve? I think my staff would agree that that's probably the best we can hope for, given the present circumstances The reason I take that view is that we do have some  -52-    12/17-18/84  barriers to getting higher than 3 percent in growth Just yesterday when the huge current account deficit of--what was it?--$32 billion for the third quarter was announced, the Secretary of Commerce again pointed out, to his credit, that the real cause of this strong dollar against the huge trade deficit was the federal budget deficit Unless or until something is done about that, I'm afraid we're pretty limited in our ability to bring down exchange rates and to eliminate that great source of distortion in our whole economy I continue to feel that we're not capturing what the whole problem of the US economy is by simply distinguishing between a 3 percent versus a 4 percent economic growth rate for next year There are sectors of the economy --and we're all aware of them--that simply haven't participated in the upsurge of 1983 and 1984 and prospectively for 1985 That's true of many kinds of agriculture--as has already been observed around the table--most parts of the mining industry, and the whole forest products industry And many types of manufacturing that either compete against imported goods or that rely heavily on export markets haven't participated in this prosperity; they wonder where the prosperity is There's so much I'd like to see done in the US economy, but as several people have already observed--Lyle Gramley among others--we simply don't have all the variables under our control And those variables have to do with the huge size of the federal budget deficit for starters That has been exacerbated further, I'm sorry to see, by the tax reform proposal, which has now placed an additional element of uncertainty out there in the business community I keep hearing, quite recently now from our own board of directors, that greater uncertainty hangs over the outlook for business capital spending and for certain parts of the housing industry, especially second homes which, if this tax reform goes through, would lose some of the present tax benefits in terms of deductibility of interest It's frustrating in other words, Mr Chairman, to want to do better and to think we could do better than 3 percent but to realize--which is where I come out--that we don't have our arms around all the problems in the sense of having the controls at our fingertips  In terms of what we ought to do on the ranges for next year, I am a strong believer in M1, as I think you all know, and because of the undershoot in M1 we've seen thus far this year I think there is a possible case for rebasing even though it has been very unpopular around this table so far Simply put, it would permit us to bring down the ostensible range of monetary growth for next year because we'd be taking off from a higher base That is, a 4 to 7 percent range would be appropriate in my view only if we were to rebase I'm concerned by the fact that I think the drop in interest rates, which I welcome, will have the effect of reducing the velocity of money in 1985 Unless we're prepared to offset that, we could have an unintentionally restrictive effect on the economy, as was the case to a much larger extent in 1982 when we were too slow to recognize what was going on in the very sharp drop in the velocity of money that year So, if we were to stick with the fourth quarter as the base for ranges for next year's monetary growth, I would certainly hope that you would make it clear in your testimony that we would aim for the upper part, if not the upper end, of that 4 to 7 percent range I would be a little happier if we could rebase and have a higher takeoff point for the 4 to 7 percent If we don't do that and we're going to use the fourth quarter of this year as the base, which now seems  -53-    12/17-18/84  likely given the views already expressed, then I too would favor, as some others have, moving to a 4 to 8 percent range  With respect to the world economy, I just don't know how much further we can go than we have already in encouraging strong economic activity abroad [through] this tremendous surge of imports we've had in the United States That has been good for other countries; it has been perfectly bad for a lot of our own industries And I for one am going to start worrying more about the health of our economy at home in 1985, in view of at least the four major depressed sectors I've already talked about I think there's a real limit on our ability to do something about bringing down those exchange rates and interest rates without some major risks of over-expansion on the monetary side Coming back to what Jerry Corrigan and some others have said That 4 percent inflation outlook is not exactly the best of all possible worlds; I'd like to see the inflation rate somewhat lower than that over a period of several years ahead I come out, bottom line, that while I recognize all of these things I'd like to do, I'm afraid that until federal finances get straightened out we're pretty much limited in our ability to do what many of us would otherwise like to do   Well, I generally support your proposal, Mr Chairman I'm generally in accord with the comments made by Governors Martin and Partee I think it is time, as Ed Boehne has described it, to push the ease button again I would remind you that at our Bank, at least, we expect this recent decline in interest rates to show through in an actual negative number for velocity As well as one can guess this, we think we might see negative velocity for the full first half of 1985 That would not surprise me Therefore, I don't think we should shy away from what would otherwise appear to be an unusually large jump in the M1 numbers during that period of time In fact, if there were a mood to go toward alternative A, I would even lean in that direction   Amen "

2723,1985-02-12," I have a couple of questions, Mr Chairman Two of the most difficult things to forecast, as you know, are what will happen with the Federal deficit and what will happen to the dollar I was just wondering if you did any sensitivity analysis in terms of alternate forecasts, supposing that there's no depreciation of the dollar and supposing that there's no action to reduce the Federal deficit   Well, I want to make a comment on the general outlook We're essentially in agreement with the staff forecast In fact, our numbers are very close except that we're a little lower on inflation We have 37 percent, mainly because we only expect a 4 percent decline in the dollar rather than 8 percent, but we would only be half as wrong I think the staff forecast is quite plausible and I have no quarrel with it I do want to say, though, that I think Chuck Partee put his finger right on it The aggregate statistics look great but an awful lot of the economy looks sour I don't ever recall a period in which there was such imbalance in the economy as we're witnessing right now We really have two economies going here; it depends on what business you're in None of our directors buys and sells GNP; they buy and sell other things And if they are in the defense business, or aerospace, or electronics, or in some capital goods industries, they are doing great But if they are in mining, agriculture, forest products, and so forth, they're doing lousy To add to what Bob Forrestal and somebody else mentioned--that the Midwest is not the only place where agriculture is in trouble--two of our biggest banks are having problems right now and are under surveillance, in large part because of bum agricultural loans Just so you don't get the wrong idea on that, it's not only bum real estate loans There are bum farm loans and big chunks of very bad real estate loans; even the agri-business [unintelligible] At big banks in California agriculture is a problem I agree with Bob that it is not a local problem  It's time to be optimistic as we look at the aggregate statistics and I feel optimistic in that sense But only at our peril, I think, should we ignore some of these other factors, which sooner or later are going to come home to roost Going back to Henry's remarks about there being no relation between the age and the health of an expansion, I would simply add that most expansions in my recollection have come about because of a combination of inflationary pressures and rising interest rates And those are the things that right now certainly could trigger what looks to be a sound expansionary trend and [turn out to] be unsustainable developments that could quickly come to an end I feel good about the general prospects for 1985 and I'm beginning to wonder how much longer we'll live with these big problems hanging over us One or more of those problems could push us over the cliff before 1985 is over, but I don't think that will happen That's more likely to occur in 1986   Well, mine is the same as Bob Black's I think a good alternative to rebasing, which has its problems, is the flexibility [unintelligible] the parallel line idea that we've seen in the Bluebook   I did have one comment, Mr Chairman You said you'd get around to the idea of the parallel lines rather than the cone   But my point is that if we don't rebase, we should do something else or I think we'll have a big problem with M1 appearing to be over its range for a good part of--   Well, Mr Chairman, I for one would agree with you; I'm not worried I would be worried, except for the expectation of the Board's staff--with which our staff agrees--that the velocity of M1 will probably be down in this current quarter and maybe for the first half of the year, and that it will be up in the neighborhood of 1 percent for the year as a whole That's an excellent reason to run above path right now and maybe for a good part of the year It is going to make us look a little silly every Friday in that chart showing the level of M1 in relation to the cone for the year that The Wall Street Journal prints The same thing is in the San Francisco Examiner and heaven knows where else around the country Those who don't look at it carefully or don't remember all of your fine testimony, say ""Aha! The Fed is off the money [target] and is overshooting again""   Velocity is down   I second that   Well, Mr Chairman, as we all know, these ranges serve many masters One of the masters is the general impression of the public as to our long-run game plan--which has been expressed so well by you over the years--to reduce gradually over time the rate of monetary growth and get it down to noninflationary levels For that reason I think it is important, if only symbolic, to lower the upper end of that range a touch Going down to 4 to 7 percent, however, brings up the problems that I talked about yesterday and that Governors Martin and Partee ran off very well today, so I won't repeat what those problems are As I mentioned yesterday, our staff forecast shows money running considerably over the upper end of the 4 to 7  -41-    2/12-13/85  percent range for a good part of the first half of this year based on the present level of interest rates To keep that from happening, our staff thinks we would have to get a very considerable increase in interest rates That is on the assumption that the velocity of money is going to be declining during the first half of the year Putting all that together, I would come out in favor of a 4 to 7-1/2 percent range Although a case could certainly be made for 4 to 8 percent, I would prefer the 4 to 7-1/2 percent simply because of the public perception that we are gradually making some progress in reducing the upper end of that M1 range And it is my understanding that the financial community certainly pays a lot more attention to M1 than they do any of the other Ms I share President Guffey's views on M3 and total credit it probably doesn't make much difference But I would adopt the M2, M3, and total credit ranges of alternative I, simply to get back to reality a little That would be the total picture I would recommend, Mr Chairman   I would too   That's because velocity went up 4 percent, Mr Chairman   If you believe it's only going up 1 percent this year, then you have to allow for more growth of money I think it's--   I said if you think it might That's what I'm assuming ranges are for to allow for realistic possibilities We're not committed to go to the upper end by setting it 1/2 percentage point higher, but it allows us to in case that develops, as our staff and the Board staff seem to think is likely If it doesn't, so much the better We're not committed to going to 7 or 7-1/2 percent Governor Wallich raised the question Why are we increasing our ranges? My answer to that, Henry, would be that it appears to us that the demand for money is increasing and one should allow for that in the determination of the ranges If we don't, I think we'll get the kind of results we did in the first half of 1982 when we tightened up at a time that, in my opinion, we should not have and we drove the economy into a deeper recession than might otherwise have been the case And it was because, in my case at least, of a belated recognition that the velocity of money was declining I don't want to make that mistake again   Well, Mr Chairman, the same factors that influenced me on my views on the long-term ranges are coming into play, particularly in the short term here My view, and I hope it is correct, is that we're experiencing an increase in the demand for money as a direct reflection and delayed reaction to the drop in interest rates in the latter part of last year To slow money down from the rapid growth rates of December and January would require a considerable increase in interest rates, which I don't want to see, particularly in view of the precarious situation of agricultural loans, international loans--the whole shooting match Therefore, for this period and this period alone, I would come out in favor of alternative A for the short-term specifications   How about ""some limited""?  -54-    2/12-13/85   Mr Chairman, would you consider adding some words to the directive, such as you talked about a little earlier, to indicate that conditions might arise where we wish to be above that limit?   That would take away a lot of the uncertainty and speculation and guesswork in the market   Mr Chairman, one thing that might help--   Mr Chairman, one thing that might help all those who are worried about the 7 percent ceiling would be what you  -58-    2/12-13/85  propose on the matter of the so-called parallel lines or the bands My concern, specifically--because we have a money market model which gives results very similar to those of the Board staff's monthly model--is that the model shows money growth for some months ahead at double-digit rates To keep from getting that, we estimate we have to put short-term rates up at least 200 basis points or thereabouts But if we were to adopt the bands, that would take care of the problem early in the year--in the sense that we would be above the cone but not above that parallel line   And that would help   I'd settle for that   Sorry, Mr Chairman, but are there some words in that--we don't have it in front of us--that say something about being above the cone or whatever?   Oh, I see now   There is only one hand up, Mr Boykin's   And with a Volckergram "
2750,1985-03-26," Well, it has been made pretty clear, Mr Chairman, that in some ways trying to describe the economy is like the blind man trying to describe the elephant It depends on what part of the beast you have hold of I don't think we should be too surprised about what's going on in the world, or at least in the United States these days, in the sense that some academicians over the years have made it pretty clear that in an open economy, which we have, and with floating exchange rates, which we have, and with few if any inhibitions on capital flows, which is the case, that over time the stimulus coming from a fiscal deficit will be offset largely by a deteriorating foreign trade situation That pretty well describes what has been going on now for some time in the United States The weakness in industrial production and the weakness in manufacturing employment that we are seeing simply [unintelligible] that domestic adjustment for our foreign trade weakness I suspect we're going to see more rather than less of that The judgment really comes down to what one thinks is going to happen in the remaining months of this year Just in the time of the 6 weeks since our last meeting our staff has become somewhat more pessimistic than the Board's staff; they wouldn't be surprised to see a second half in which the GNP is growing very slowly and may possibly even be flat The basis for that rather pessimistic conclusion is the judgment--with which one could easily quarrel, and I assume the staff here would quarrel with it-- that the dollar will continue to be strong Their judgment is that it is not going to weaken appreciably and that the foreign trade situation will continue to deteriorate Now, as I said, that's a judgment that is controversial, but that's why our particular staff forecast this month is markedly less optimistic than last month and less optimistic than the Board staff's forecast  Having said all that, I don't really believe that there is an awful lot that we can do through monetary policy that we haven't already done We have been pretty generous in the provision of monetary and credit growth I don't think there is an awful lot more we can do to run an expansive monetary policy to cure this enormous imbalance that you and others have so well described on the fiscal side The bottom line is that I would be one of those to say this is no time to rock the boat It's not any time to be squeezing down on monetary growth, and I also wouldn't be in favor of trying to accelerate beyond what we've already done I would feel comfortable  -17-    3/26/85  with coasting along near the upper end of this band, as we have been, for the balance of the year   Well, Mr Chairman, I think the case has been pretty well made that we have all these uncertainties and that there is really not a compelling case, if you consider alternatives A, B and C, to make any bold moves Contrary to our usual admonition of ""Don't sit there, do something,"" I would recommend the opposite approach this month ""Don't do something, sit there"" I'd vote for ""B""   I supported ""B"" as stated, Mr Chairman "
2774,1985-05-21," Mr Chairman, is there some sort of ""need to know"" test?   Mr Chairman, reverting for a moment to the similarities and dissimilarities of the Board staff's forecast to our staff's forecast We have similar views on the outlook going through the fourth quarter of this year in a number of major areas including consumption, capital spending, government spending, and inventories Where we differ, and where our staff turns out to be somewhat less optimistic than the Board's staff, is with respect to our expectation that imports will be up somewhat more because of the recent behavior of the dollar and that housing will be up somewhat less than the Board staff's projection because of the weakness in disposable income So, even though our two forecasts tend to converge, ours is up a little from last month and the Board staff's outlook for real GNP has been revised downward this time from last month We are still significantly lower for the year as a whole, showing a 2 percent real GNP gain, fourth quarter to fourth quarter, versus the Board staff's view of 2-1/2 percent Whether it is 2 or 2-1/2 percent, it is still going to be a pretty weak year I share the view that we are experiencing already--and are likely to see more of it as the year goes on--a pretty sluggish economy operating below its potential, in large part because of an enormous distortion and imbalance that has already been touched on, particularly relating to the impact of the huge federal deficit and the high dollar and the import surge that has resulted from all of that  Like Si, we recently had our meeting of our council on small business and agriculture in response to your suggestion We got a whole earful of bad news and I, too, was surprised by some of the anecdotes that we heard For example, one of the small business firms represented was a very small manufacturer up in Oregon, which is outside the Portland metropolitan area It turns out that they export a good deal of equipment all around the world; more than half of their business in fact is foreign We really got some graphic illustrations of what the high dollar has done to this small little business We found similar illustrations from other representatives of small concerns that were there Contrary to conditions in your District, Si, or yours, Roger, where the family farm still predominates, as you know in the West it is the large scale farm that predominates And even representatives of those agri- businesses were singing the blues and gave some pretty graphic illustrations of how bad business was, not just because of the high interest rates but also the strong dollar Cotton is one of the major products of our agriculture in California and traditionally about 80 percent of it has been exported You can imagine what the high dollar has done to cotton exports; that particular business is in big trouble  Based on the latest information we have, nearly all of the nine states in our District experienced an increase in unemployment fractionally; and in the latest month for which we have data for total employment, it actually dropped a bit Electronics, which had been one of our stronger growth industries for some years is now flat; manufacturing has been rather weak except for defense spending; and lumber is still a disaster Aerospace is the one industry still going fairly strong On balance, adding up all these strong and weak areas, it is clear that the weaknesses predominate and that we are seeing in the West what we are seeing in the national statistics a pretty  -10-    5/21/85  sluggish performance Therefore, when we get around to the policy discussion, that would be the reason I would like to err, if we are going to err at all, on the side of ease   Just a word on this matter of M1 showing growth above the band I think we're all aware of the fact that there has been a change in the pattern of velocity here, probably stemming from deregulation and what that has done to the interest elasticity of the demand for money In any event, our staff felt at the time of our February meeting, and still feels now, that we're likely to see a decline in V1 of approximately 1 percentage point for 1985 as a whole So that influences my view of what the appropriate growth rate of M1 is Because of that decline in velocity that seems to be going on, I'm not concerned that we are courting inflation or a reigniting of inflation in the near term  With respect to the specifications, I would be in favor of the federal funds rate associated with alternative B of about 7-3/4 percent and borrowing in the neighborhood of $300 to $350 million The San Francisco money model, given those and other inputs, would expect the growth rate of M1 to be more like that shown in alternative A If it were 7 percent or a bit higher, that would be all right with me in view of the losses in the economy and the view I expressed earlier today about tilting in the direction of ease until we get some better balance back in the economy So, as I mentioned, I would favor alternative B   Mr Chairman, there seems to be some misunderstanding as to what the level of borrowing is that we set forth with respect to the different alternatives, especially with ""B"" I would ask Steve--and I think the rest of you might be interested in the answer--whether, as I understood it, the level of borrowing he was talking about in the Bluebook assumed that all the so-called special situation borrowing with respect to thrifts would be treated as other extended credit So, that is not as fluky a number or as unpredictable a number as it might otherwise be That is the understanding, is it not?   How about ""the recent""?   Even better might be to say 6 to 7 percent for M1 and M2 April to June and 7 to 8 percent for M3   I'd be concerned, Mr Chairman, about moving up to $400 million I'm afraid that might push the funds rate up I would not like to see that happen "
2798,1985-07-09," Mr Chairman, I have a question, if I could, to ask Jim With respect to this overall forecast, Jim, how do you think it will be affected by the threat--or the prospect, as the case may be, depending on the standpoint of the viewer--of tax reform?   Well, with regard to the outlook, our staff is also somewhat more optimistic than the Board staff, starting with the second half of this year and running all through 1986 We would expect, starting with the quarter we are now in, that the growth rate of real GNP would be something over 3 percent and that 1986 would come in at 34 percent Certainly, we are not great optimists because somewhat over 3 percent isn't exactly something to write home about in terms of rates of growth, but at least it is not quite as bearish as the Board staff's forecast, which may still turn out to be correct I  -13-    7/9-10/85  am just giving you what our staff thinks The differences, with which I concur, seem to be that our staff is expecting a somewhat stronger picture both in consumption as well as in business capital spending, in large part because of the lagged effects of lower interest rates and greater availability of money and credit Time will tell whether this modestly more optimistic view is right or not   Mr Chairman, I would like to set forth the case for rebasing--and I think there is a pretty good case for it--and then ask Steve a question Admittedly, the circumstances are different now than they were in 1983 and the technical justifications for the rebasing may be somewhat different, but I think it is still pretty solid We have had extraordinary circumstances here; in part, the rapid growth that we had in the first half of this year in M1 could be viewed as a catch-up from unusually low growth in the second half of 1984 Certainly, in the case of the San Francisco analysis, the drag on the economy caused by the net imports was much bigger than we had anticipated That, in turn, has depressed activity and required, I think, an extra surge of money to take care of it But given that set of biases or set of preconceptions that I have and given the tough job that you have--you would have to explain to the Congress and hence to the whole world why we are rebasing or raising the range--I would like to put a question to Steve If it is putting you on the spot, Steve, just say so In terms of the adverse risk of either raising the range or rebasing--adverse in the sense that it might cause some people in the country such as savers, investors, and so forth, to view the Fed as now off on a kick of monetizing the federal debt or giving up somewhat on its battle against inflation--which would you view as having the least risky impact?  -22-    7/9-10/85   Before we go too far down the road on monitoring, I would just like to raise the question What do we do  -32-    7/9-10/85  instead? What kind of guides do we have? Are we going to start following M2? Or are we going back to taking the funds rate or relying on money market conditions or--going back 30 years--the tone and feel of the market? We have to have something in lieu of M1, and I think that question needs to be answered before we make a decision on just monitoring M1   I'm not sure   The same point, of course, holds if we go to eight percent The second quarter to the fourth quarter would be, if I figured it right, about 53 percent and June to December would be 28 percent The fact that June is so high is obviously the reason   I would like to support Bob Black's point on that I think [there is] the historical continuity factor as perceived by the public when we have to announce not only '85 but tentative '86 targets We might get to the same end results by raising the range to 4 to 8 percent or even 5 to 9 percent versus rebasing and keeping 4 to 7 percent but I think it would make the 1986 rationale a lot harder to establish, whatever range we decide on Either keeping them the same as they were or cranking them down a notch would be my preference So that led me, Mr Chairman, to favor rebasing over raising the range   Mr Chairman, it seems to me that, contrary to some of the views that have been expressed here, there is no greater implication of being forced to hit a rebased target than if we didn't rebase I don't know what experience or earlier precedent would correspond to that conclusion Circumstances change and uncertainties develop that we don't anticipate; I don't think we are stuck with any rebased range any more than we are stuck with hitting today's range   That's the big argument in favor of rebasing, in my opinion   I happen to agree with Si on that, but I think it's time for our semi-annual reminder from Steve The July figure that we pick out, as I seem to recall, Mr Chairman, more often than not--and probably very more often than not--is never changed by the time we get to January For some reason this Committee has felt in January that we ought to stick with what we picked out in the beginning of July Am I wrong on that, Steve?   Oh yes?   I take it all back!   I would support alternative B, Mr Chairman I think that makes a lot of sense in view of all the uncertainties we're wrestling with here I think the other alternatives would be putting up too big a bet One of the things about alternative B that I like is that it's more or less an explicit admission--at least I interpret it that way--that we're prepared to go along with the overshoots in the first half of the year and we have no intention of trying to get M1 back within that original range I think that would be a terrible mistake in view of all the uncertainties we've heard around this table the past two days Therefore, I think alternative B would make a lot of sense   Oh, yes  SPEAKER(?) Which is what?   Around $350 million   Oh, I guess to give us a little room I'd go for 8 percent   Unless there's been a [unintelligible], that doesn't help   I thought we were going to stop short of a monitoring range "
2823,1985-08-20," Jim, now that we have a budget resolution of sorts, I am wondering what your analysis shows with respect to the revised deficit realistically interpreted for the coming fiscal year How, if at all, would you change your forecast as a result of that Congressional action?   Could we pursue this issue of a shift in the demand for money a little more, Steve? What is your best guess? Is there a shift going on? There is that possibility, as you talked about If that is not it, what is causing the drop in velocity of Ml?   Would it be fair to say, based on that explanation or view of yours, that we could at least expect this overshoot of M1 from our new midyear targets not to carry with it the usual inflationary implications that it might otherwise have?   That's the $64 question!   Mr Chairman, I pretty much agree with the economic outlook as discussed here earlier In the West it is essentially flat or down in most traditional areas mining, manufacturing, and agriculture Those things that are going well are a number of the service industries, whether financial services or telecommunication, and of course defense is going through somewhat of a boom But by and large it is hard to see anything that is going to push the economy up with any real vigor and our staff forecast is essentially the same as the Greenbook forecast I would agree with Jim Kichline that, if anything, the 3 percent real GNP growth in the second half has more risk on the down side than the up side While I, too, have a streak of monetarism in me, I am prepared to ignore this overshoot of M1 as long as we have this peculiar and unusual, and hopefully not permanent, behavior of M1 in terms of the decline in velocity--whether it is a shift in money demand or different elasticities than we thought existed I would be prepared to overlook that overshoot because of the risk of possible recession, although I think the risk is more toward sluggish growth Therefore, all things considered, bottom line I am essentially in agreement with the position you expressed that this is not the time to make any significant moves, either easing or tightening I think that alternative B pretty much expresses the sort of policy I would like to see between now and the next meeting, with a borrowing target somewhere in the range that was specified in alternative B of $350 to $450 million, probably centered on $400 million   Mr Chairman, just to clarify one thing I am not sure what the Committee feels or what you individually believe about the dollar My own personal view is that continuation of a gradual unwinding of the dollar from the excessively high value probably would be for the good of the country--just thinking of the import-export situation I hope that it will continue and that a gradual orderly drop in the dollar would not trigger our moving up toward the upper end of the borrowing range I'd like to hear what your views are, though   Well, I would certainly agree   Mr Chairman, I wonder if I could ask Sam to explain a bit further why he thinks that a soft landing for the dollar is a very unrealistic possibility   It's hard to get from here to there   I would prefer it   9, 8-1/2 and 6-1/4 percent   That 8 percent sounds pretty high for M3, Mr Chairman That is above anything shown in the alternatives here   I'd suggest 9 percent   Well, it should be  -43-    8/20/85   9 percent is what I want "
2848,1985-10-01," I just wanted to make sure of what I heard, Jim For the projection of the dollar, you assumed down 20 percent by the end of 1986 from where?   May I follow up on this dollar outlook question because that's a very key one? If I understand your numbers correctly, your expectation is that the dollar will be down another 8 percent between now and the end of '86 It's already down 12 percent from the second quarter of '85   Thank you, Jim   I would like to ask for a little further clarification in Steve's view of these so-called portfolio shifts as a possible partial explanation of the surge in M1 Looking back to May, as we all know, we have seen absolute declines in some of these term deposits like large-time deposits, term RPs, term Eurodollars, etc You and your staff study this, Steve To what extent is that a significant factor in this surge in Ml?   Well, that's what I recall In the May-to- August period, which is what I was looking at, the increase in demand deposits was just about as big as the sum of the increase in NOWs and Super NOWs So, I'm a little confused as to whether the portfolio shift out of these term deposits was in fact directly connected with the rise in old M1A   Yes, that's about my view   In terms of the business situation, both around the country and around the West, it appears to us that it's a touch better than the last time we met I would say that the risk of recession--which I never judged to be very big in any event, but it was a risk--if anything, has receded since the time of our last meeting Having said that, there is nothing that has changed fundamentally in the fabric of the economy, certainly not in the West We have this big contrast between things that are going well, like defense and aerospace and most services, and weakness in the fields we all know about, such as agriculture, lumber, and many lines of manufacturing    10/1/85  Translating that into policy, we like many others are puzzled by the behavior of M1 The bottom line is that we, at least, can't explain it satisfactorily by any different hypothesis--that it's an increase in the demand for money and a shift in the demand function for money upward, or simply money demand moving downward along a given demand function as interest rates have come down While you can explain some of it possibly by portfolio shifts, that does not get the whole answer either That leaves me, net, a bit nervous about the continuing strength of M1 that we have seen and I hope that we can slow it down a little before it translates into some sort of resurgence of inflationary expectations in the market I don't know how long market participants and investors will go along, seeing virtually an unprecedented surge in money, without beginning to wonder what lies down the road in a couple of years in terms of the inflation rate So it is really a matter of the feedback and the impact that is having on investor expectations So far it has been quiescent, but I wouldn't bet on that continuing too long Were it not for the G-5 program, I would be between ""B"" and ""C;"" but given the G-5 program, I suppose the better part of wisdom is to aim for something of an even keel right now Thus, I favor alternative B but tilting a little toward the tighter end of the specifications--going up to the maximum level of about $550 million on the borrowing range specified there and wanting to keep that federal funds rate up to about 8 percent   There is going to be quite a bit of difference, Mr Chairman, between the lower end and the upper end of that range in terms of the tone of the markets   It's a pretty wide range   I for one would agree that this would be a bad time to make an announcement   Mr Chairman, one reason for taking variant I is that the Fed watchers are going to be looking for the slightest clue that we're somehow stuck or are precluded from tightening up or even are on an easier money kick For the very reason that you didn't want to change the announced ranges for the second half of the year, I would argue against moving away from that traditional language, even though there may be a more accurate [description] of what we're doing   That would be better "
2873,1985-11-04," From the Twelfth District, there's a combination of good news and bad news that we have had now for some long time The areas which have been weak and continue to be weak are the traditional ones that I have talked about so many times forest products, agriculture, and oil And now more recently, somewhat to our consternation, the electronics industry is in something of a slump, at least for the time being On the other hand, there is considerable strength in defense spending and in the kinds of companies that benefit from that I suspect we are on the receiving end of an unusually big share of that in the West My staff tells me that two of our states taken together, California and Washington, have about 28 percent of defense contracts, so that's obviously a strong plus in terms of the tone of business, at least in those two states Retail trade figures seem to be going very well; most stores have been reporting year-over-year sales gains of 5 to 10 percent Auto sales are going well in most of the states And of course the service industries, which are not nearly as identifiable as anything like steel or whatever, are reporting pretty good news in terms of their performance Our staff reports that the market for single-family housing appears to be relatively healthy, which I was pleased to see Whether it's permits, sales, or prices, all seem to be holding up in most markets, although it differs quite a bit if one moves from state to state We do have nine states, but as a generalization this does not appear to be an area of great weakness at the moment  In terms of the outlook, our view is not much different from the Board staff's with respect to the balance of this year Our staff is a little more optimistic as we look into 1986, simply in the sense that we expect somewhat greater shrinkage of net imports--that there won't be as big a drag on the economy as there has been in 1985 Of course, this is a judgmental difference, but we think we ought to get a little more kick out of the improvement in our foreign trade position coming from the expected decline in the value of the dollar That's the thumb-nail sketch from the West   Do you mean the 757?   Gee, Jerry, I am not familiar with what that is, unless it's a 747 SP   I haven't heard about that I am sorry to say   The emperor has no clothes   One more target to miss!   Can you repeat the specifications so we will all be singing from the same hymn book   Mr Chairman, do you think there are any expectations or fears in the markets that we might actually take actions to get back close to that 3 to 8 percent range?
