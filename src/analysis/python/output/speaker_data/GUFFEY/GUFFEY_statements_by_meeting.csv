32,1976-04-20,"  Yes, I’d like to associate myself with the recommendation [you] made,  Mr Chairman, with the exception as to the federal funds rate  I would prefer to see it set 4-1/2 to  5-1/2, with the thought that we would reach the 5 percent, the mid part of that range, by the time  this Committee meets next month  It seems fairly clear to me--from all the projections from the  staff, and from the people around this table as they talked about the long-term targets, and I  think, indeed, from the market--that the rates are going to get increased sometime in the near  term and certainly by the end of 1976  I think the projections are that, by early 1977, we may  have a federal funds rate of something between 6 and 7 percent     I’d like to see us start moving now  I think there would be very little disruption in the  market other than on the very short-range basis  And I’d like to see us take those steps gradually  from now forward rather than finding ourselves in the fall or at the first of the year having to go  up rather rapidly in the federal funds rate  So I would up the federal funds rate to 4-1/2 to 5-1/2  with rather specific directions to the Desk to reach 5 percent by this time by next month  "
59,1976-05-18,"  I’d like to go on record aligning myself with Mr MacLaury  I think he  stated our feelings very, very well and I wish I had said it  "
87,1976-06-22,"  Tom, with respect to Chairman Reuss’s attorneys, did his Committee staff  file this case     It raises a second question, Tom--you and I have had discussions in the  past about the quality of legal work that may be tendered to us by the Justice Department     And I guess I share some of Paul Volcker’s concern that sometime down  the road we might want to employ counsel to assist you rather than rely totally upon the Justice  Department  You find that that quality of defense is not as great as we’d like, and what I’m  suggesting is that it may be within the power of the Committee to [hire outside counsel]  I don’t  think we ought to lose sight of that fact       Well, Mr Chairman, I agree with the narrowing of the fed funds range  I  guess my principal concern is that we don’t get a turnaround in the aggregates in July, and as a  result I’d like to propose that we drop the top [end] of the 4 to 8 and the 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 a whole  [percentage point] rather than a half   If we are going to go with the money market conditions  directive, if I understand it--and I’m not sure I totally do--but we would basically stay at 5-1/2  even if the aggregates begin coming in, under alternative B, up to 8 percent, and I think that  would be a mistake     If I understand then, at the time you might get around 7 percent under  money market conditions, then you might be moving that fed funds rate up to the 5-3/4--     If we stick with 4 to 8     Well, I guess you bolster my thought, and I’d like to see the range  narrowed a little, and on the top side principally, a full percentage point under alternative B,  which would bring it to 4 to 7 and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2  Because I’d hate to see us sit at the 5-1/2 level  if we see those aggregates coming in fairly strong  I’d like to see us move on to the 5-3/4  "
110,1976-07-19,"  Well, only a comment, Mr Chairman  It seems to me, as you look back at  what has happened, the [unintelligible] for doing away with the Memorandum of Discussion was  a lawsuit and the fact that what happened at this table would go in the public domain very soon     7/19-20/76 - 6 -   after the meeting if they were successful in the lawsuit  We decided to do away with the  Memorandum of Discussion  I can see nothing that has changed since that decision was made   If the congressmen feel strongly enough about it to give us the type of statute or legislation that  says it would be held out of the public domain for five years, which they seem to agree is a good  rule, then I would be prepared to go back to the Memorandum of Discussion  I think it serves a  useful purpose, but not in the context that we’re now facing     Well, Mr Chairman, I think I agree totally with the recommendation  already made but I would like to focus on that part of the recommendation that suggests that you  leave the range of M1 [growth] as it has been in the past, and I believe that’s 4-1/2 [to 7] percent      7/19-20/76 - 50 -   I subscribe to the proposition you set out, that we should be taking a cut each time at the inflation  problem  And further, I understand you to say that these ranges would give us the latitude to do  that, and I subscribe to that     But now to move to my point, it seems to me that, if the staff’s projection is correct and  things are moving a little more rapidly three months from now as we move on into the fall, it is  going to be a little more difficult to move that upper range down  And as a result of the pause we  find ourselves in, and to affirm the position that has been stated publicly that inflation is our  greatest problem, I would like to see us move the upper [bound] of M1 down 1/2 percentage  point this time, which will bring us down to 6-1/2  I understand that it doesn’t mean a great deal,  but for public view I would like to see us do it now  I think it’s easier to do it now than it would  be three months from now     I think, with respect to the funds rate, that 3/4 percent makes me feel  better; 5 to 5-3/4 is a good range  I would like to point out--I guess it’s obvious to  everybody--that if we talk about alternative C, which would be my option, we are actually  increasing the aggregate limits for M1 and M2  That is to say, for last month, they will be  published as being 3-1/2 to 7-1/2, and we’re talking about an alternative C of 4 to 8  I don’t  know how the market reads that or what it leads to, but my preference would be alternative C  with a 5 to 5-3/4 range on the federal funds [rate]  "
137,1976-08-17,"  You spoke of the payment of the Treasury financing and how it fits  into--is that affected only for August?  And then you would see growth again in September in  M2?     The thing is that Treasury balances run down where you have a bulge in  September in M2 [unintelligible]     Just to kind of catch on to what Paul has just said, I think I’d like to do it  another way  I wouldn’t want to see the federal funds rate go down nor go up to 5-3/4, as you     8/17/76 - 24 -    suggest, Paul  But isn’t there another way to do it, and that is to go with a money market  condition directive, as opposed to an aggregate directive, with the anticipation that we’ll sit right  where we are for the next 30 days  And it’s what I would opt for  "
181,1976-10-19,"  Lest the impact of a couple of statements in the Redbook be lost, I’d like  to observe that one of the problems we’re seeing develop in the central part of the country  involves prices and not growth to the extent that [prices of] cattle and agricultural commodities  are again at a very low level  And as a result, this translates into retail sales at a lower,  progressively lower phase  We have cattle in the feeder area, for example, that are now losing  money again on each head that’s sold  Wheat prices, for example, are at a low level, and the  growers are holding on to the wheat rather than selling it, in anticipation of a higher level  sometime in the future, and this is putting pressure on particularly small [unintelligible]     But I think that all translates, at least in my mind, to the effect that since we have been  through a growing season, we would not expect retail sales to pick up or make any great  contribution in the near future because of the low prices [nor] spending for agricultural  equipment or agribusiness-related capital spending  I don’t think you’re going to see the mid  part of the country make much of a contribution in this area       I don’t think I have a great deal to add Mr Chairman  I would hate to see  the fed funds rate down at 4-3/4, although the specifications of 4-7/8 would be acceptable  I  think we have some other tools of monetary policy that I’d like to see us use if we were perhaps  not so close to November 2  The Desk is only one of three, I think, tools that we have and I  prefer to see the reserve requirements and/or the discount rate used at this time to get some  psychological [unintelligible] in our economy       [Unintelligible] philosophy, I like the idea of taking a cut in several  quarters, but I think I would prefer to stay where we are [now]  Ninety days from now, we can  make hopefully a cut in one or the other of the ranges   "
203,1976-11-08,"  I think my view is very similar to what Governor Gardner has already  expressed, that is, that we are focusing in on the long-range targets at the moment  There seems  to be little evidence that there is a lack of liquidity  Rather, the money supply is adequate in the  economy, as evidenced by the continuing downward drift of interest rates over a rather  substantial period of time  And I guess I would prefer at the moment, perhaps, to continue our  downward movement in one or more of the aggregates, this time at least to be focusing in on M1   And I think it would be reasonable because we’ve been using only the lower portion of that  particular range     [In] testimony for the public view, I think it might be equally premised upon the fact that  you do have a large latitude in M1, even if we are at 6-1/2 percent, to accommodate the  necessary growth we see in the future  As a result, I guess I would opt for the lowering of the  M1 upper range to 6-1/2 percent; it gives a better alignment, I suppose, between M1 and M3  So  I think there is something to be said for, [at] some time in the future, taking a look at these  outrageous upper ranges of M2 and M3  Now, at the moment, I would go with the 6-1/2 percent  upper range on M1     Thank you, Mr Chairman  If it’s true that we’re starting at a point where  we go to 6-1/2 on M1, I think that we have achieved a realignment of the three aggregates  In  looking ahead, the end results of these are a full year away, and we anticipate upward movement  in [unintelligible] growth, and thereby interest rates, which would make those M2 and M3  [unintelligible]  I would opt today for staying, by lowering the upper range for M1 and leaving  M2 and M3 where they are at the moment  "
220,1976-11-16,"  Are these being submitted to Mr Reuss as chairman of the committee or  as an individual congressman?     You were looking for optimism, Mr Chairman     Well, I’d like to report that, in the Tenth District, retail sales are holding  up quite well, and as a matter of fact, looking toward the Christmas season, retailers are  anticipating a very good season  But to also, I guess, endorse what President Mayo and  Governor Gardner just said, it seems to me--and you will excuse me for not relying upon figures,  because I am not a trained economist--it shouldn’t be surprising that businessmen and even  consumers are in a period of uncertainty  And it seems to me fairly certain, also, that, without  regard to what the final outcome when the new Administration [unintelligible], it may be that     11/16/76 - 31 -           businessmen are going to accommodate those, and this inactivity is going to burst out  And  whether the timing is by the blooming season in Washington, I don’t know  But I think it’s fairly  quickly into the year 1977     Well, I would share that feeling [about] moving to 4-7/8 and fairly  quickly--what we tried to do a month ago and were not successful  It seems to me that the case  is as good now as it was then  The only question about the numbers that you propose, Mr  Chairman, with respect to M2--if we’re going to give equal weight to the two of them [M1 and  M2] as we have in the past, I would just as soon adopt the numbers [for M2] in alternative B,  which are 9-1/2 to 13-1/2, in view of the staff’s projections     With respect to liquidity, everything that we see would indicate that liquidity is very good  and that most of the financing that’s going on in the business community is out of cash flows,  which indicates that liquidity is there  With respect to easing credit, I wouldn’t think it would  have a great deal of effect at the moment to go only to 4-7/8, and it seems to me that the public  needs sort of a stroke or boost, which this might provide  And with respect to the discount rate,  it would be that additional kick, coupling the two together  It seems it does very little damage in     11/16/76 - 34 -           terms of the aggregate growth rates as projected by the Board’s staff, and I think it may be vitally  important  "
246,1976-12-20,"  Just make a couple of comments with respect to the midsection of the  country, and it has to do generally with the optimistic retail sales, Christmas sales, in the  metropolitan area but [also with] a corresponding sort of decrease or depressed sales in rural  areas, which stems from a great pessimism as a result of drought conditions  As a matter of fact,  that’s complicated in some measure by the fact that interest rates in the rural banks have started  to move up, and are now at roughly 9-1/2 percent     I am not sure that it was, Lyle  The information that we have, however, is  that, as a result of the agricultural producers holding over most of their ’76 wheat, and as a result  of the increased cost of carrying cattle inventories, the rural banks are heavily loaned out and are  trying to cut off that, to the extent they can, by raising their interest rates  It moved up within the     12/20-21/76 - 53 -         last two to three weeks, the information we have, about a half percent to about the 9-1/2 percent  level     Yes, those are high-quality credit risks  So there is a sort of contra trend  in the rural areas  It has not apparently affected the metropolitan correspondent banks as yet     There is another rather depressing fact--     They are not  We do have some seasonal borrowings, Mr Chairman  But  there is not a substantial increase in our District  I think they’re in a position where the cost of  production and cost of carrying inventories and borrowing is beginning to worry the bankers to  the extent that they’re trying to make the free-market system work by raising the price of  carrying those inventories     Another, I think, sort of depressing factor in our area is the drought condition, and  immediately that is the lack of snow  The ski industry in the Rocky Mountain areas through our  District--principally Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico--equals the summer tourist rate in that  area  Unless snow comes on rather quickly, the spending that normally takes place starting in  the Thanksgiving weekend is not going to take place  We are liable to have a combination of  factors to depress the midsection [of the country] rather drastically      Indeed it does--     Yes, it does, although the snow throughout the plateau area [provides] the  subsoil moisture that is necessary for next crop season  Except for the southern portion of our  region, and I am talking about southern Oklahoma--it gets depressingly worse as you go north,  into Bruce’s area  It’s deficient to the extent that there may be no crops actually put into the  ground next spring unless there is a substantial amount of snow cover during the winter and then  a real good spring     Half of that season has already passed  There is still the big season, that  is, Thanksgiving and Christmas  Christmastime is the big season in that area     Yes, Mr Chairman, I think I share the view that you have set forth, and I  guess that Paul and Bruce have endorsed  I guess I am fourth now  It seems to me we have  taken some rather substantial steps in the monetary policy area in a rather short period of  time--30 days--that is, the reduction of the federal funds rate 35 basis points, the reserve  requirement action, and the discount rate decrease  It seems to me to be a time for a pause  As a  result, I think I would go one step further to the extent that I would like to see us adopt a money  market conditions target to ensure, to the extent possible, that we stay at that 4-5/8, in that range,  until the aggregates drop out on one side or the other  I would like to lock us in for 30 days to  the extent that we can  "
273,1977-01-17,"  When does the statute require that the regulation be published by an  agency?     Yes, Mr Chairman, in preparing for this meeting and sharing the desire to  continue to move downward, I think we came to the judgment that whatever we might do should  be principally cosmetic  And we came out, much as you did, to lowering the lower [end of the]  range of M2 a half percentage point     We had thought some [about] the M3 as well  Listening to this conversation, I wonder as  to the wisdom of lowering M3, and particularly drawing the fire that may come from it [because]  M3 figures [are] made up of savings and loan and other types of deposits, which may imply that  we are indeed going to do something to housing very early in 1977 or through 1977  We need  not draw that fire  So I’d stick with just going down on the M2 side     If I understand Mr Winn correctly, I think I would adopt the same thing,  that is, alternative C ranges on the aggregates with the fed funds 4-1/2 or 4-1/4 to 5--what is  expressed as the range for B  It isn’t clear to me, however, what would happen if we adopt a  4-1/2 to 5 range for the federal funds  Does that mean that we move fairly quickly to the 4-3/4  midpoint?  That’s an important question  "
298,1977-02-15,"  I think I would also prefer B [and] adopting the suggestion to widen the  fed funds rate range to 4-1/4 to 5-1/4  I think I would also like to see us, by the Committee  meeting next month, to be at a midpoint of that range, 4-3/4  It’s a very slight change, to be sure;  we’re averaging 466 now  I’d like to see us end up at 4-3/4 next meeting   "
325,1977-03-15,"  Yes, question, Mr Chairman, to Jerry  As to the assumptions that the  staff is building into your projections both on price and GNP with respect to the drought in the  western part of the United States, and if that moderates for the better or gets substantially worse,  will it make a substantial difference in your projections?     Would it materially affect your GNP forecast?  Is food that big of a  component?     With respect to your latter point, I think that is a very real consideration in  our part of the world, in the sense that there is real pessimism yet with respect to the economy in  the western--Tenth District, at least     It’s a combination of high farm cost and low prices for the product   Coupled with the fact that they have been through a very difficult winter, and the outlook isn’t  very bright even yet  I should quickly add that a good rain or two would change that very  quickly, and particularly when the sap begins to rise in the spring, those attitudes can change      Mr Mayo has said what I would like to say, in the sense that the range  that has been stated [for M1], 4-1/2 to 8-1/2, is satisfactory and probably more consistent with  our staff projections of what may happen in the remainder of March on into April  But more  importantly, with respect to the federal funds rate, we would opt for 4-1/4 to 5-1/4, increasing the  upper side of that [a] quarter, making the midpoint 4-3/4, with the hope that we would stay in the  fuzzy range through most of the period and, again at this time next month, that we would end up  at 4-3/4  And essentially taking a very little bite [out] of what perhaps we may have to do in the  May and June area, perhaps into July and the period ahead  "
349,1977-04-19,"  Well, I can only say, Governor, that we are in the midst of another survey  of 62 rural banks  Only 38 of them have reported so far, and I’ll give you a memorandum that  interprets those--with some caution, you can be sure  But, by and large, I believe that the credit  situation in the rural small banks is tight, and there is some evidence of bankers asking farmers  to dispose of their carryover crops of 1975 and some of 1976     Pardon me?     Generally, Mr Chairman, it would be Nebraska, Kansas, eastern  Colorado, and some parts of Oklahoma, and that’s basically the drought area that we’re looking  at  But, at least in my judgment, what has occurred is probably a normal function of the financial  intermediary in requiring some of these excesses to be turned in order to move into the next crop  season  We see a tight situation but not one in which, absent a severe drought, there are no crops  growing of any substantial amounts for 1977, that there is any crisis situation in this part of  world     4/19/77 - 14 -             Pardon me?     Well, they do  I think, Governor Partee, to the extent that the banks are  not willing to accommodate any further extensions of credit, for example, for a new crop year,  they do go to the PCA, Production Credit Association  Now, these are the farm credit types of  loans  They are picking up, and have in the last year or so--rather substantial sums  In checking  with the farm credit agencies out in the Midwest, we find that they are at very large levels of  lending, and they are really concerned about the creditworthiness of some of those loans, simply  because they have picked up what the banks wouldn’t pay  So that’s a secondary-type credit   And they do have a concern that they may get caught with some bad loans  But I think the banks  generally are in very good shape, [whereas] bad loans are [rising] among the farm credit [types  of loans]     It has not  And I might say that the continual increase of land prices is  [supporting the use of land as] collateral for the additional extension of credit, not only by the  banks but PCAs  If something were to occur, such as a mass selling out of farmers, for example- -that might affect those prices on the downside  You may find the farm loans without sufficient  collateral even if they chose to foreclose, because the increase in farm land prices is what’s  supporting these additional extensions of credit  But for that, they might be broke already     Essentially the market value  And that may be established by “Indians  trading with Indians,” but nonetheless there is a transfer of land establishing market value, and  that’s what’s being used as a broad base for these [loans]     It is correct  As a matter of fact, we analyzed the figures for all banks and  notified those banks that actually have a seasonal privilege as we see it  And we have set  specific communications with those banks, asking them to come in and to arrange for that  seasonal credit  I might also add, however, so long as the discount rate remains substantially  higher than the fed funds rate, we [haven’t seen] a great deal of interest in seasonal credit [from  us] other than as a lender of last resort, if you will  They look at us, but they can acquire those  funds from a correspondent at something in the neighborhood of a 1/2 percent less than we’re  willing to lend them  They are going to go get the funds there or in the market     I might make one additional comment with respect to that  The seasonal  borrowing is based upon a five-year experience of the bank that you’re looking at  When you  have unusual situations, such as are occurring this year--sometimes you have a bank that has a  real bulge this year, but, because you lay it against the past five years, you cannot find the  seasonal borrowing privilege for them     That’s correct     I would make one comment, if I may, Steve  It is true that declaration of  an emergency situation would permit us to lend and at the basic discount rate  It isn’t that kind  of a situation, I think, that we face  Rather, if they do not qualify for the seasonal, and if they do  not qualify for emergency, than we have to go under the adjustment provisions of Regulation A,  which essentially limits us [to] about a 30-day [period], and for an agricultural bank looking  forward to a crop growing season, 30 days is--we’d tell them that and they’d laugh at us--you  provide nothing for this     Yes     Yes, Mr Chairman, I agree with the philosophy that I think has been  expressed, that we continue to make some movement  But as we took a look at the ranges that  we’ve been operating within the past as a track record, and particularly focusing in on the  midpoints, what has been projected is such that you’re suggesting that there is only a 2-1/2  percent differential between the midpoint of M1 and M2, and the track record in the past would  suggest that that’s been a 4 to 5 percent differential  That suggests--     I went back to 1975 and 1976, and it ranges 44--     I see nothing that would materially change that in the period ahead, so as a  result--     To be sure, but projections of the staff would suggest that the interest rates  that will affect those two aggregates are not going to start moving up until some time in the third  quarter, which would affect the slowing of growth of M2 for example  If I read it correctly     To be sure, but I think that’s not projected by the staff until some time  into the third quarter, into the fourth quarter     Well, just to follow this for just a minute if I may, whether it is believable  or not, I would like to suggest that, because of the past track record and the fact that the  slowdown may not come until later in this year, we not drop M2 or M3 at the upper rate; leave  them the same, and to try to fulfill what I believe very strongly we should continue, a movement     I would prefer the first suggestion the Chairman made, and that is to drop the lower end of  M1 a half percent  My own feeling is that this would not have any serious impact in the  marketplace, and as a result we would have continued the process--we would have dropped the  midpoint of M1 a quarter percent, to be sure  But it would also, I think give better alignment in  what you might expect between M1, M2, and M3     Mr Chairman, I particularly like your proposal on the federal funds range   And it seems to me that the argument Mr Volcker makes with respect to the M1 and M2 ranges  is appropriate  I would also, I guess, like to speak to the point that Bob Black makes  I would  like to see an aggregates directive, retaining the language that’s proposed, which I understand to  mean that you probably maintain a 4-3/4 to 4-7/8 range until we got something over 9 percent   And that seems to me to be appropriate  "
376,1977-05-17,"  Mr Chairman, as an addendum to what Bob Mayo has said, I would also  note that this increase in the farm values in our part of [the country] is the support for the bank  loan to these farmers and ranchers--they have not sold their crops since ’75 and ’76--they’re in  business to put a new crop in  It is a support that permits additional lending to those units     I can only observe--the philosophy of these meetings seems to be, if  things are going well at the present, the meeting gets longer because of the [unintelligible]  And  I would suggest, as Chuck has mentioned earlier, we have had rain in the Midwest--spring has  arrived, the sap is rising  There is an increased demand in the recreational areas of Wyoming  and in Colorado for condominiums, which is something we have not seen over the last two or  three years     And another sort of interesting thing that’s heard--the announcement of the energy package  or proposed legislation has apparently not deterred those looking for gas and oil drilling  operations, because the loan demand at the banks has continued to increase, even in view of the  supposed uncertainty  Now, whether or not this was something that was in the pipeline before  and is just now being taken down, or whether these people are just overlooking the uncertainties  that hinge on the policy is not clear  But it is going forward; the drilling is accelerating in our  part of the country really nicely  Things look good in the western part of the Midwest       Mr Chairman, waiting until or near the end to speak should be of some  help, but it is not to me this morning because I had an underlying philosophy or feeling to want  to take a bite against inflation  But I’m also troubled by the fact that we have received a rather  substantial surprise in April  And there is not a great deal of uncertainty toward May or June   And as a result, I’m attracted to a proposal essentially made by Governor Partee, that is the  aggregates, zero to 4 [for M1], 4 to 8 for M2, but I would also adopt your proposal for the funds  rate, with some restraint on the Desk to move from the current level until we get fairly near the  upper bounds of those ranges  And as the result, I think it would be appropriate to adopt the  money market conditions directive, with that type of restriction   "
396,1977-05-27,"  Tom Davis     Ted Balbach     St Louis has not     Guffey agrees  I would hope that, before the next FOMC, these technical  aspects could be fitted inside a document, Paul     Paul, a question  Are you suggesting that, without IRS assurance, we  would not continue these transactions with the System account when we can accommodate  them?  "
413,1977-06-21,"  A couple of comments with respect to the level of optimism in the High  Plains area  It’s been sort of divided, up to this point, in the sense that in the metropolitan areas  there have been, for the early part of this year, fairly high levels of optimism  But there have  been a couple of things that have occurred that are not readable yet but could very well dampen     6/21/77 - 17 -         that somewhat  One is the fact that in the Colorado-Wyoming-New Mexico area, the drought  has culminated in a limitation of any new [water] hookups, both commercial and residential  It’s  only a limitation--they still can hook up, but a very limited number over the rest of the year and  projected into 1978, which is dampening considerably the construction of both residential and  commercial     The other event that had just occurred is a Federal Power Commission order that limits, as  of January 1978, any new hookups--as far as gas is concerned--throughout an area of Kansas,  Missouri, part of Oklahoma, and part of Nebraska, which means that if that order is in effect,  there will be no new gas hookups as of January 1  Again, the comments coming from the  business community, and particularly in the construction industry, are fairly [critical]     Lastly, with respect to the agricultural sector--which has been sort of depressed in terms of  level of optimism up to this time because of the drought--[it] has all turned around in the crop  areas, for example  What we are projecting now is a wheat crop that is larger by about 10 to 15  percent than in 1976, which was a very good crop year  The problem is now, not that they’re not  going to grow anything, but rather that they’re adding to the carryover they already have, thus  further depressing the price of grain, on top of which there is no clear capacity to store that grain   The price, as reflected by the futures, continues to deteriorate  On top of that, in the agricultural  sector, what has been anticipated for meat prices, for example, particularly cattle, has been an  increase, particularly in the latter part of this year  But the track record has been that cattle  prices and red-meat prices [have] again turned down, so that there is a pessimism that’s  arising--not only [regarding] the cattle but the wheat--in the agricultural sector  So you put all  those together, and what was kind of mixed before might turn out to be a fairly pessimistic  outlook for that whole midsection of the country       I’d like to join those--I guess Paul Volcker, Bob Mayo, and others--that  have suggested that we adopt the aggregate ranges of C but rather the federal funds that you have  suggested, 5-1/4 to 5-3/4, and staying at the 5-3/8 as long as possible  That seems to me and our  staff a little more consistent with staying where we are and avoiding a drop in the federal funds  rate that might possibly occur  The other point that I’d like to make, whether it’s a money  market directive or an aggregates directive, I guess it’s not of great importance to me  So long as  we have that lower range of the fed funds of 5-1/4, it will not go below 5-1/4 under any of those,  and I could accept either a money market or an aggregates [directive]     Paul, carry this one step further  If we do, indeed, get a satisfactory  ruling, that essentially forces all central banks to move through us     That’s right, they will come to us, so we will essentially force them all  into the Federal Reserve because the uncertainty--  "
438,1977-07-19,"  Mr Chairman, our analysis of the economy is very, very similar to what  the staff has already projected this morning  And as a result, we would be happy if the long- range targets were retained very much as was set last time  Further, in view of the fact that we  have been missing and we’ve been in the upper part of our range over some longer period of  time now, it would seem that maybe our moving the ranges downward isn’t our problem  If you  move the top side down, we may have a real [risk of missing] it; as a result, I think we’d be  opposed to that  On the other hand, the cosmetic effect, if that’s the right term, of continuing to  move is very attractive, and as a result, I think we would opt for a solution that you have  proposed on the M1 range alone, that is, moving the bottom [down by] 1/2 percent  I don’t think  it’s very meaningful at the moment  I think we’ve got to begin to focus on the shorter range of  getting those aggregates down, and what we do in the longer range is basically for consumption  of the public and not for this Committee  So in conclusion, I guess, I would be perfectly willing  to buy the cosmetic effect of moving the lower side of M1 but leaving the remainder of the  aggregates where they are for the moment     Contrary to what Bob Mayo said, I would rather support your proposal in  the fact that, so long as the aggregates [are] performing and appear at the midpoint, we stay right  where we are in terms of the fed funds rate  And only if they push up [to] the upper range do we     7/19/77 - 51 -    move it  I believe this other contemplates that we will indeed move the fed funds rate a little  earlier than might be under your proposal     I guess I would prefer that if we are going to have an aggregates target, if  you do, we use--     I am in support of your proposal, Mr Chairman  "
465,1977-08-16,"  Yes, Mr Chairman  Steve, do you have any information of what’s  happening to these wild-card renewals, and are they in your projections for the rest of 1977?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Sir, I think many of the expressions that have  already been made around the table with respect to the longer-run performance of this  Committee in controlling monetary policy--in the sense that the [growth rates of the] aggregates  are continuing to be very high--as Mr Volcker has expressed [it], there has to be a time when we  face up to that  But I guess I would hope that we wouldn’t do it all at one time simply because  we are following one month [of] very high aggregates growth  There is a need, it seems to me,     8/16/77 - 47 -           to let the market digest what we have done because we’ve taken a fairly major step in the market,  and the funds rate particularly     And as a result, looking ahead, [I can see the] proposal to move the B alternative to a 0 to 5  range for M1; a 3 to 8 for M2; with a further prescription that the funds rate be broadened, but  only on the up side, to 5-3/4 to 6-1/2 with an asymmetrical midpoint of 6; and a money market  conditions directive hopefully to get the lower growth of the aggregates in the upcoming period,  therefore maintaining a 6 percent funds rate  But if, indeed, we start getting a 5 or above figure  in M1, I would be quite happy to see the funds rate move on up to the 6-1/4 to 6-1/2 area  I  don’t think that we can have two or three months strung together with very high aggregates  growth without this Committee acting or reacting     With respect to the discount rate, I would like to see the discount rate increased 1/2  percent[age point] as of tomorrow [Wednesday] afternoon, Thursday afternoon, or Friday  This  would be simply a validation of what would be published on Friday, that we are indeed at 6  percent, that we are then 3/4 of a percent out of line with the funds rate and some other shorter  market rates  And I would oppose going 1/4 [point] now and maybe 1/4 a month from now, as  has been suggested around the table  I think we ought to take a bite at it and do it all at one time,  simply with the public statement that we are only following the rates and the movements already  taken place     But also I give support to further consideration of a reduction in the reserve requirements  at an appropriate time later this year     Mr Chairman, does that mean that, if you go with the monetary  aggregates [directive and] you get [M1] growth that is projected to be 2-1/2 [percent] or greater,  then you are going to use that other 1/4 percent [of the federal funds rate]?     With the money market conditions directive, you would be projecting 5  [percent] plus [in the growth of M1] before you would actually start making a move from the 6  [percent federal funds rate] under this prescription  Is that correct?  That is the appropriate--     In other words, [reaching M1 growth] in the upper range before you  would start making a move, and that’s what I would prefer  If you are going to do it the other  way, and that is, if you are projecting say 3 or 3-1/2 you start making a move towards your 6-1/4,  I don’t think I’d go along     Mr Chairman, just a procedural question  Does this become moot as of  January 1, 1978--do we release all of the ’72 minutes?     In other words, the December minutes of 1972, they’re only really four  years old, is that correct?     Then the January minutes of 1972 are 5-1/2 years old now?     Is it not possible then to release part of the 1972 minutes and still comply  with the five-year lag?  "
493,1977-09-20,"  Well, lest the euphoria about the agricultural sector get out of hand, I  think it is important to note that the productive capacity of the agricultural sector has added  nothing to the farmer’s or the rancher’s wealth--that the wealth in and of itself has come from the  increase in land price  To be sure, some sales are taking place, [but] if [that increase is] real [it  is] being absorbed to maintain liquidity of that sector of our economy, and [it is] really adding  nothing to the wealth in terms of the new tractors as Mark has suggested [it has]  Those came  two or three years ago following the Russian wheat sale  That sort of thing     The soft part in our economy in the mid part of the country is indeed these agricultural  areas, where, for example, the farm implement industry is having a rather sharp turndown  [because] the farmers and ranchers are not able to replace [agricultural] equipment  My point is  that that can go on only so long; you can rely for your liquidity needs on the increase in land  prices only so long  If you don’t have some contribution from what you are raising, then this  will become increasingly worse  It is showing up again, as everybody around the table knows, in  the bank loans  They are relying upon this increased land value  I don’t like to throw total cold  water, Mark, upon how you characterize [it], but I don’t think we would share totally that  euphoria     No, I think that’s not true     9/20/77 - 18 -     Banks, though, and other sources of financial strength to the agricultural  economy, could likely feel a real squeeze if things indeed did turn down in [the sense] that land  value was not realized  And that, I think, is what we have more concern about     I don’t believe that the governmental units are quick enough to have  picked it up yet, but certainly as those sales occur, then reassessments will be made, and taxes  will increase  But it isn’t something that’s going to come tomorrow     Yes, Mr Chairman, two additional brief comments  One is that as we  surveyed our directors and businessmen for this Redbook, it seemed that, for perhaps the first  time, absent the agricultural sector, that businessmen were rather optimistic, [with] some  evidence that they’re beginning to enjoy the recovery for the first time, and in particular in the  last 2-1/2 years  And I think that’s a plus  Lastly--     Oh, yes     They’re not only willing to believe--the only drags on that kind of  confidence level, it seems, are the lack of a tax policy and the lack of an energy policy  But  absent those two factors, it seems generally that the businessmen in the midsection of the country  are happy with what they see and are looking forward to continued good times  And that’s the  first--all comments previously had been more in the line of uncertainty of the future--this time  they’re beginning to enjoy it a little bit     The last comment that I would make is that you’ve heard from me and from John Balles  and others about the drought situation from the Midwest on to the West  I would say that it came  to the attention, particularly, of the people in Kansas City that the drought has ended as of last  Monday, [when] there was a flood in our city that did an estimated $100 million in damage and  some 26 lives lost  And that is true generally throughout our District up until you get to the  western slope of the Rockies  They have begun now to get some moisture, but they’re two years  away from restoring the moisture level that they’ve lost over this drought period  But from the  eastern edge of the Rockies on into our area, and I’m sure on to the east, the drought has ended,     9/20/77 - 26 -   and, as a matter of fact, we may even have too much water now  Certainly we’ve had too much  at one time in Kansas City     Moderation  The fact of the matter is, the loss in Kansas City is very  substantial, and the loss of lives of course is something that cannot be [unintelligible]     There is what’s called Brush Creek that runs through a very fashionable  area of Kansas City, that one of our politicians in the past, Mr Pendergast, cemented the bottom  of simply because he was in the ready-mix [concrete] business  When the creek comes up--it is a  drainage area--it’s normally a very small trickle  But when you have a very heavy rain that  comes up very rapidly--this doesn’t [normally] get out of its banks to cause any damage--[but]  this was described as a 500- year flood  That is to say, the moisture that accumulated in that  short 24-hour period was what you would expect to occur once every 500 years  It is a very  unusual occurrence     People were actually swept away  They were in businesses, restaurants,  other types of businesses, and the water came in as they tried to exit  It came up very quickly   As they tried to get out they were swept away, or the alternative was that they actually drove into  the waters and their cars started bobbling down the stream and they were carried away  They  were like lemmings going to the sea  There was no thought that they couldn’t make it across a  lower area that they’ve never seen water in before  And it occurred all over the city     There was damage that occurred, of course, where the flood waters cascaded through the  plaza [Country Club Plaza shopping center] area, and on east, but also there was great damage in  the outlying areas simply because the storm-sewer drains could not carry off the accumulation of  water  The homes, businesses throughout the city sustained damage, and there is very little flood  insurance in that area  So these are personal losses  I know there has been some concern about  making available the same thing the Board did for the [July 1977 flood] situation in Johnstown  [Pennsylvania]  We’ll perhaps propose a push for that--     It will, of course, because it was all owned by--the plaza area itself, and I  don’t want to suggest that that the damage was in the plaza area only, because it was city- wide--[but] that’s the place where the greatest volume of dollar assets can be seen and where a  great deal of damage did indeed occur  But that area is essentially all owned by one company,  and there will be a great loss because it was all uninsured     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I guess my concern is shared by perhaps  everybody around the table in terms of the aggregates growth  But let me say, first, that in our  view the economy is healthy  It isn’t as fragile as has been described today  And as a result, we  perhaps should be taking some advantage of that to move our aggregates growth rate somewhat  lower, which implies of course, a higher funds rate  I should also say I take some comfort in the  comments you made--if we do get slow growth in the period ahead, that we will tolerate that and  not go below perhaps a 6 percent funds rate     Turning attention to the [top end of the growth ranges]--with regard to M1 and M2, I think  that’s the important figure--I would quickly buy the 7 and 8 for the top of both of those  I would  also go with your prescription for the 6 to 6-1/2 [and] the proposal that we move to the 6-1/4  [midpoint] fairly promptly after this meeting  And I guess I would maybe prophesy that we will  have, as Governor Gardner has suggested, an opportunity to review it in between, because I think  we would expect that the growth rates will come in fairly strong, and it wouldn’t make me  unhappy if this time next month we were as high as 6-3/4  I’m just suggesting, with a narrow  funds range of 6 to 6-1/2, that we would have an opportunity to take a look at it     9/20/77 - 53 -  "
518,1977-10-17,"  I’d only verify what Mr Mayo has already said, and that is in this  renegotiation time on the extension of loans, which really doesn’t arise in our area until  November, December, January, because the farmers are out harvesting their crops now  We  have seen some improvement in the ratios within the banks in those agricultural areas; to be sure,  still very high  But there is a projection that, when you get into that December-January period,  the banks are going to be reluctant because of some slight showing that the agricultural prices are  turning down a little bit  They say that they’re going to accommodate the extensions and some  new credit for the upcoming year, but they’re doing it more reluctantly than they have before     Well, looking at our District only, as you know, there is a very good, very  big supply now unsold  It’s encouraging to hear the forecast for potential exports markets,  particularly in wheat  But we’re looking at very favorable conditions for 1978 crops--that is to  say, throughout the District it’s far advanced from this time last year, and last year was almost a  near record crop  So productionwise, absent some catastrophe such as insect disease, or  otherwise, it looks like another good year  We have to get rid of the some of the excess     That’s in wheat and corn     Yes, in our part of the country, it is, although it’s a fairly small percentage  of total sales--they happen to be big block sales that you hear about, but there are not that many  of them  But it is still an attractive investment, particularly for West Germans that have come  into the Midwestern and Southwestern areas     Yes, Mr Chairman, it seems to me that we’re running into a potential  credibility problem if we do indeed lower, particularly, M1 again  If we haven’t been able to hit  the current target ranges, then to lower even further implies much more, I think, than maybe we  want to imply at this point  As a result, your suggestion to retain M1 at its present level seems to  me to be a very good one  With respect to M2 and M3, however, I believe your suggestion was  to lower only the upper limit of that, thereby narrowing the ranges of those two targets  And as a  result, it would be my preference to lower both the upper and the lower ends of those ranges to  maintain the historic spread that we have had  And I believe, as it’s already been expressed, that  we have a real chance, maybe, of hitting M2 and M3 within those ranges in the period ahead and  restoring a little bit of credibility without doing great damage with a sledge hammer instead of  some other means     Thank you, Mr Chairman  With all the recital of what has happened back  in 1962, in these various eras, I feel a little bit inadequate, but I would like to associate myself  with some of the comments that Frank Morris has [made] with regard to the ultimate  prescription  I don’t think I’d be quite as bold as he has been, in the sense that the only real  problem that I have with alternative B is the federal funds rate  And I think I would prefer to see  either one of two things  a 6-1/4 to a 7 percent, which gives you a 6-5/8 midpoint, or in the  alternative--I share some of the concern mentioned by President Kimbrel with respect to going  below the 6-1/2--a federal funds range of 6-1/2 to 7 percent with an asymmetrical midpoint of  6-5/8  I would like to see the Desk move promptly to the 6-5/8 within the upcoming week and  before the Treasury financing that is going to inhibit us, perhaps--sometimes two weeks, three  weeks, and before this Committee meets again     To follow up Bob’s question, I would be closer to feeling comfortable  with the 6-1/4 to 6-3/4 that you proposed, and took a vote on, if we went to a monetary  aggregates directive, which would indeed permit--  "
546,1977-11-15,"  Yes, Mr Chairman, it seems to me that we have really only one issue that  we should decide here this morning, and it’s one that Tom has presented--that is, whether we  appeal or not  And to pick up on what Steve Gardner’s already very well stated, I think we have  an obligation to do it  There isn’t, I think, anything that attaches to you for pursuing your legal  remedies  I think we have to     As to what we should do with the directive today, if anything has been suggested, that isn’t  of great concern to me at the moment, I guess, because in listening to Tom’s statement as to what  time we have, the nearest being December 1, I’d rather suggest that we will go all the way  through this upcoming period until the next meeting  Quite likely, the odds are very high, that  we will not have to release before our December meeting, which means we’ll then release this  statement immediately following that  So I don’t think what we do today makes a great deal of  difference, and I wouldn’t fool around with our directive     Lastly, and equally as important, I got this on Sunday night and read it  It isn’t clear to me  what we can do to that directive, and there may be a lot of things that we can do that will permit  us to release it today after the meeting or the day of the meeting  And I’d like to have more time     11/15/77 - 18 -         and would suggest that we have the [Sub]committee on the Directive set about the [task] very  quickly of deciding what the alternatives are  And prior to the December meeting, that we do  indeed consider whether or not we change the form of the directive, how we state--whether we  state ranges at all, or whether we broaden the ranges, or whether we do something else     In that regard--     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think that our views also do not differ  substantially from those that the staff has projected, particularly through the first half of 1978   However, as Mr Black observed, it is, I think, a real possibility, with the right kind of a  statement from the Administration, that we could have a very good year in 1978, that things are  poised in such a way as ’78 could likely be much better than what my staff projects--that’s a  personal view, I guess     With respect to another area that has been mentioned by Bob Mayo, I was interested to  observe in the Redbook their comment with respect to a turndown in the agriculture sector in that  District--something that has occurred in the Tenth District over a period of two years  We are  more oriented toward wheat and cattle, both of which have been very depressed over the two  years in which, I believe, Bob, your agricultural endeavors, [which] are more toward corn and  [soy]beans and pork, have held up quite well  So what they are experiencing there we have  already experienced     To the contrary, however, what has occurred now in the Tenth District seems to be some  stabilization, because the wheat prices, for several reasons--not the least of which may be the  Russian proposal to buy--have increased over the most recent past  Cattle prices have increased,  and the prospects are looking up  And lastly, the banking situation in that area, which has been  strained to meet agricultural credit demands, may have some relief  The government  program--wheat subsidy program--which, it is now estimated, [will pay out] $12 billion in the  latter part of this month and early December to wheat producers--[will send] about a half billion  dollars into the Tenth District  Thus, there will be cash for liquidity relief in those agricultural  banks  Lastly, I would say that the credit situation in those banks is still extreme  They are     11/15/77 - 27 -         sending their customers who need liquidity to government entities such as the PCAs [Production  Credit Associations] and others for their longer-term credit now, but are still quite prepared to  meet the short-term needs of the agricultural community     Thank you, Mr Chairman  When coming to this table, [I was] prepared to  support alternative B and thought that the only real question was what kind of a directive you  liked, what to get to the Desk, and was prepared to push for a money market conditions directive  to achieve the stability that everybody around the table seems to want  Broadening the range, I  think, lessens my concern as to which kind of a directive it is, and I like the idea of going to the 1  to 7 [percent range] on M1, with either kind of directive  "
572,1977-12-19,"  Tom, did I understand, if the Solicitor General files with the Supreme  Court for a writ, then we have as much as six months before the Court rules whether they will  grant the writ and hear the case or deny the writ  Is that correct?     But the critical part of the timing, though, is the Solicitor General’s  decision to file for writ?     Well, first, I think I tried to make a comment earlier with regard to the  dissent  My comment, essentially, was that I would hate to see this Committee deny a request or  even hold up a request for a vote, because I think it would look as if we were trying to be  obstreperous and not cooperating with that court order--even one time I’d hate to see us do that   Secondly, the comments with respect to [unintelligible] all toward the side of dissent, but that  does not cover the whole issue, in the sense that the reporter can call up one that they know as  being part of the majority, and at that particular time what went on, why was it decided, that per  se allusion, perhaps, that you would not want to create  So much for that comment  But with  respect, now, the more--     I am only suggesting that all of the focus and the comments before were  with respect to those who would have dissented at a meeting and did dissent at a meeting, but  had left out everybody else  Those that voted for the majority, for the consensus view, you can  exclude  The situation--a reporter calls up one that voted with a majority and asks him what  went on at that meeting--actually what they’re seeking is information       Exactly  Whether it’s a majority or a dissenting member, I just wanted to  [be] clear [on] that     My only concern was, Mr Chairman--     I’d like to follow up, if I may, with the most current discussion, and that  is, I think, Chuck, you mentioned that there would be two figures published--that is, the range for  the federal funds and then the aggregates ranges  But there is one other figure that seems to me  to be important if we follow the procedures that we have followed in the past, and that is that we  actually publish the federal funds range target that we are trying to hit right then       The current rate, and the question is whether that is a quantified 6-1/2, for  example, or whether you use the language that we used in [the] past month’s directive  That  seems to be the more important issue than perhaps the breadth of the federal funds range, in the  sense that you’re establishing--when you start moving up, and you say that you want a 6-1/2  now  But if you put the range at 6-1/2 to 7, for example, what has been important in the past has  been the midpoint  I think that’s the market’s perception     And it may be necessary to in some way disabuse the market [of the idea] that the midpoint  is an important part of the operation [for] the Manager in the month ahead--either by public  statement or something in the directive that essentially says, don’t worry about the midpoint, we  are telling you what it’s going to be now  And either we are going to be slightly higher, slightly  lower, remain the same, that’s our perception as of this day  But that figure will become very  important to the market, it seems to me  Some way, we will have to deal with it  I don’t have an  answer; I’m the one raising the question     Well, I think that is a very important question  Because, if we are to  follow the court’s decision, and if we have actually taken a vote that we want asymmetrical, I  would judge that the counsel would [say] that that probably would have to be published     We have, in the past, up until last month, I believe  It is my point that that  has been a published figure  It is a figure to stand--     Mr Chairman, I’d like again to make the point that the Committee did not  address the advantages or disadvantages of making an announcement as to what the federal  funds rate precisely would be in quantitative terms from the date following the day of the  meeting  That’s laid against the alternative of casting it as we did last time--that the federal  funds rate at about the “prevailing” level, or you could choose alternative language “slightly  higher or slightly lower”--and thus not be so precise, to permit the market to move to a particular  federal funds level the next day providing you wanted to move it one way or the other  That was  not addressed by the Committee     Well, it would seem to me that if we did not express the federal funds rate  in that meeting at a particular, quantitative level, that it might give the Desk some flexibility to  let the market seek a level in conjunction with the Desk action, much as we are doing today  [It]  might have some advantage that you do not have if you say it’s going to be 6-5/8 tomorrow  In  other words, I would prefer to stay away from that      Yes, that’s right, and I’d rather not say “X percent,” but I’d rather use the  language that apparently the Committee considered and recommends against, that is to cast it in  something less than a precise figure     Does that mean that we go the $400 million-plus next month, next month  and next month waiting on these policy--     Does that mean we are going down the drain more slowly?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think, with regard to the staff projection, we  would feel it is a good projection  If it would miss, it would miss on the low side  But with the  mix suggested by Governor Partee, it would be a little stronger in the first half of ’78, and maybe  they would be about right in the second half, so they would be marginally stronger than what  they are projecting  With respect to regional matters, I would like to join with Ernie and others  with regard to the Tenth District, in the sense that the agricultural problem has moderated  somewhat with the government subsidy payments and the increase in corn and wheat prices,  cattle prices  So the farmers, ranchers are somewhat better off than they were 60 days ago   Also, with regard to the agricultural sector, I think it could be described as booming  And we are  running now into a point where the unemployment level is dropping to what I think is a good  level  In September, Districtwide, we are talking about an unemployment rate of 46 [percent],  which has dropped from a 5 percent level that was registered about April and continued through  the summer but now is beginning to move on down        12/19-20/77 - 64 -         Personal incomes have continued to be very strong in the District  And there’s one note of  caution, I should think, with respect to the residential housing sector  The thing that we have  been facing in much of our District is an order by the Federal Power Commission and its  successor, the Energy Department, which would have cut off any new hookups for much of the  Tenth District as a result of limitation in the supply of gas through a major pipeline  Through  court action and efforts by our congressmen and Senators, they have indeed set that order aside   The order was to prohibit any additional hookups after January 1, which meant we have had a  flurry of residential building in the area simply to get those structures up so gas could be hooked  up before January 1  And it was projected that the residential construction would then drop off  very rapidly after the first of the year  That order has been set aside because of some political  pressures, but I’m told that this is sort of an experiment; if by administrative fiat they can limit  the number of gas hookups in this area, then it would spread to other parts of the country, and we  can have a very serious effect upon businessmen’s or others’ projection for what they want to do      I would second the amen that was given over on the other side of the  table  "
592,1978-01-05,  Roger Guffey at Kansas City    
613,1978-01-17,"  They are also assuming a full half point, which may or may not be--      To a very minor degree or no change      Yes, Mr Chairman  With respect to the staff’s forecast, I think we have   been marginally higher for the last couple of quarters than the staff in its forecast so this time  maybe they have come closer to what we had believed in the past and still believe may occur in the  future  One thing that does trouble us with respect to their forecast for the fourth quarter is the kick  that seems to [come] from the tax decrease  Our staff does not believe the effect that might occur  in the fourth quarter will be of quite the magnitude that is projected by this staff      Lastly, [let me] follow up on Ernie Baughman’s comments with regard to the agricultural   sector and particularly the banks that service that sector within the central part of the country   Although [their financial conditions] are tight, there isn’t any great concern apparently at this time     1/17/78             35  that there will be any foreclosures or in the alternative, any inability to meet the credit demands  when they arise, and that would be in the spring at the planting season  So, by and large, there’s no  euphoria running through the agricultural sector  I don’t think the strike has had any great effect  nor will it  And when the snow melts and the sun comes out next spring and the sap begins to rise,  I think there will be a lot of activity going on in our part of the country and the strike soon will be  forgotten--not the reasons for it, but the strike itself will be forgotten       Let me say first of all that I am delighted with what occurred in moving to   this 6-3/4 percent [funds rate], maybe for different reasons  I think domestically we’re at the point  where we should be at the moment  Because of the events that are ahead of us, I think that’s  probably where we should be  That is to say, I would like to associate myself with Governor  Partee, Governor Coldwell, and perhaps others who would structure the directive so that we would  not move from the 6-3/4 percent [funds rate] unless the aggregates begin coming in at a fairly rapid  rate  As a result, I would suggest alternative B and would also narrow the ranges on the top side  down to 7 or 7-1/2   But I’d structure the directive in the money market conditions [formulation],  with it being a good bet to stay at 6-3/4 percent unless the aggregates begin to grow very rapidly    "
638,1978-02-28,"  Yes, Mr Chairman, thank you  We join those who take some comfort in the   staff=s projection this time  I have a couple of comments about particular sectors  With regard to  housing starts, which have been revised downward somewhat, we think that [projection is]  reasonable  There is a development that apparently is prevalent in our area at least that involves the  construction people, and that is that there is more residential construction going on now under  contract as opposed to speculative construction  If they=re under contract, [home building] will  continue on through perhaps a good part of this year at a fairly high level  A second aspect of that  seems to be the consensus that rates will not be a constraining factor in this inflationary period--on  residential construction at least  Most people perceive the fact that if they invest today in  residential construction, it will be the best investment they will have made and, therefore, what they       2/28/78           28  pay for the money to build a new home or to get into another home is not much of a constraining  factor      One other point that has not been mentioned around this table  We=re finding rather   universally throughout our District that the unemployment rate is much lower than the national  average  It’s probably down around 5 percent or even below 5 percent in most of the central and  high plains areas  As a result, we may get some price-wage pressures as we go along this year       Yes, Mr Chairman  I would join what appears to be a consensus with   respect to retaining the M1 range  I=d like to specifically align myself, however, with Governor  Partee=s and Governor Wallich=s comments with regard to probably hitting the upper [area] of that  [4] to 6-1/2 percent, given the velocity  projections by the staff, which we believe to be somewhat  high  Secondly, I’d do nothing with the M2 range, but with respect to the range for M3 I’d join  your recommendation--I believe it was your recommendation--to cut it 1/2 percentage point         We would prefer cutting 1/2 point off M3, recognizing that we quite likely   could come in toward the lower end of that range  But I would also suggest to you that you might  take some comfort from the fact that we have missed the M3 targets since, I believe, the fourth  quarter of 1975--always on the high side  So [if] we come in either in the lower part of those  targets or even miss them on the low side, that wouldn=t be of great concern       Mr Chairman, alternative B with a money market directive would be my   choice but with one minor adjustment  Everybody seems to have their own adjustments this  morning, but I think the risks of March coming in strong quite likely are greater than it coming in  weak and, as a result, I would like to see the M1 range adjusted to 0 to 5 percent with a money  market directive  My thought is that if we get up to around a 10 percent projected rate for March,  we ought to be taking some action  I’d also take the B alternative on the federal funds range, but I  would suggest that maybe we put a proviso in that it not go below 6-3/4 percent  I think we=ve  done that before and I think it is quite appropriate at this meeting       I don=t think I understand the vote, do you?    SPEAKER(?)  I didn=t vote      I would like to suggest that a 0 to 5 percent [M1 range] with a money market   conditions directive would be very acceptable and perhaps equal in my mind to 1 to 6 percent with  an aggregates directive       2/28/78           54      Talking about the March growth--      With 1 to 6?      So it=s 1 to 6 with an aggregates directive  That=s the alternative   "
676,1978-03-21,"  Question to Steve  You are projecting into April another blip as we   experienced in 1976 and 1977  As you made your seasonal adjustments to the 1977 data, can I  translate that to say that when you are looking at 9 to 10 percent growth projected for April of ’78  that that would equate to another 6 percent, roughly, if you weigh it against the ’77 figure--   unadjusted?       I’m just trying to lay experience against experience      Another somewhat related question  The assumption in the Bluebook has   been for the last couple of months that Regulation Q [ceilings] will be increased and I think it’s  scheduled for May  Are there discussions now going on with the other agencies and if so, is that a  reality, a possibility, or what?       Well, we are running up on that May date, which is an assumption   underlying all of your projections      Yes      Just briefly, Mr Chairman  Thank you  I would prefer to have the   alternative C aggregates--that’s the 4 to 9 [for M1]--particularly if we have an aggregates directive   If I understand how that is viewed by the Desk, that would trigger an upward or a downward  movement someplace within a percentage point of the outside of those ranges  So it doesn’t seem  to me to make much difference whether we’re talking about a 4 to 8 or a 5 to 9 percent range, if in  one case with a money market directive we use 4 to 8 and if with an aggregates directive we use the  4 to 9  In other words, [action by] the Desk is going to be triggered at the same point  As a result, I  would prefer to stick with the C aggregates, with an aggregates directive--maintaining, however, a  federal funds range of 6-1/2 to 7 percent  I share the view of Paul Volcker and many others that we  should not go below the 6-3/4 present level unless there are very unusual circumstances  The thing  that bothers me a little bit, remembering back to both ’76 and ’77 again, is that we got very strong  growth in the aggregates in April of each of those years  To my knowledge there’s never been a  very good explanation of those  Soon thereafter the growth rates returned to much lesser levels  I  guess I am concerned that with an 8 percent top, for example, and with an aggregates directive, we  may be taking action that is really not appropriate  That is, the aggregates may not be telling us  what we think they are because we’ve not been able to explain what has happened in past years   So in summary, I would go with the C aggregates, with 6-1/2 to 7 and remaining at 6-3/4 percent  [on fed funds]    "
701,1978-04-18,"  I’d only say, Mr Chairman, that our staff projections come very close to  those presented by your staff here at the Board  There are a couple of areas that we have taken a  look at that come out a little bit differently, and one is housing  We would agree with Phil Jackson  that there may be a carryover through ’78 and into early ’79 that may add some real strength that is  not evident in the staff’s forecast  Secondly, we think the contribution of agricultural exports might  be somewhat stronger  There has been an announcement that Red China is coming into our market  for small grain, wheat principally  And if the attitude of that nation were such as to buy rather  significant amounts in our markets, it could make a substantial difference in our trade balance     In summary, I feel that the staff’s forecast is reasonable to the extent that it goes  But  contrary to Governor Coldwell’s feeling, we think there may be strength that moves on into l979   And that is not terribly good because that level of economic activity, coupled with the inflationary  pressures, is all going to come crashing together  And we should be mindful, as we set monetary  policy for the period ahead, that a year ahead inflation is going to be a self-fulfilling prophecy in  our part of the world       Mr Chairman, I would have no problem with reestablishing the ranges at  their current levels  I am attracted, however, by what has become almost a tradition with the  Committee to continue to move these ranges to a lower level  And I would like to suggest, if that     4/18/78             32  were the feeling within the Committee, that it could perhaps be done without any great disruption-- in view of the fact that you don’t have to testify very soon--by lowering the lower ends of both M2  and M3 by perhaps a half percentage point and leaving the tops of the ranges where they are now   I think it could be explained away in your testimony on the basis of an anticipation of increased  inflation, higher interest rates, and that type of thing and not an attempt to really squeeze credit in  those two areas       I would feel fairly strongly that it should be your personal views  I don’t  think much can be accomplished by way of expressing a “corporate” view  You are not going to  satisfy Chairman Reuss or those like him  The next step would be to ask to come into this room  and then participate  I think a line has to be drawn and your expressing your own views is as far as  it should go       I would adopt Chuck Partee’s proposal  I would also, however, align myself  with what Frank Morris has suggested--to take a small bite now and go to 6-7/8 percent  immediately but to wait and be fairly cautious about moving on to 7  And I assume that if the  aggregates begin to come in very strongly, we would delay moving to 7 until after the Treasury  financing has been completed, which would be just about before this Committee meets next month    "
741,1978-05-16,"  Our views are consistent with the staff’s with respect to growth in real GNP,  with maybe some variation of how that occurs  We’re expecting somewhat stronger growth  perhaps in the third quarter, as Frank also may have mentioned, and somewhat less as we move  into 1979  As to prices, we believe the staff may be a little bit low  That is to say we expect the  pressures to be somewhat greater than the staff’s 7 percent projection  [I’ve heard] an interesting  comment, and I really don’t know what it means  But businessmen I have met with most recently  on two occasions have mentioned the fact that their suppliers had been posting price increases to  take effect either 60 or 90 days hence and then were withdrawing those before the price really goes  into effect  The thought is that they are [hedging] again against some wage or price controls--that  they are building their case  So apparently there is a very strong expectation for [the rate of  increase in] prices in our part of the world to accelerate, and it’s a matter of when and how much   Lastly, as to employment and unemployment--particularly on a regional or District basis--in the  nonagricultural sector we are finding unemployment levels at or below 5 percent now and all  skilled laborers fully employed  So there is going to be some pressure on that side, we believe  Thus we think prices may be modestly higher than the staff is now projecting       Mr Chairman, I’d like to come out on the side of that we have moved a  considerable extent since the last meeting and it seems to me that the risk now may be on the side  of going a little too far and in early 1979 our actions maybe accounting for this possible recession   It also seems to me that right now, whatever we do around this table, there isn’t an awful lot  monetary policy can do to abate inflationary pressures in the near term  I could also say that it  seems to me that the criticism of the Fed is that we always move too slowly and we must take the  first step  And indeed, I believe that in this past month we have taken the first step  So I would  propose that we not move too much further at the moment and just wait and see  [My preference]  would be a 4 to 8 M1 range and a 5 to 9 M2 range, with a federal funds range of 7-1/4 to 7-3/4 with  at least a near-term midpoint of 7-3/8--where we are now  I would like really to see us move over  the period to 7-1/2 [by] this time next month  I think the market anticipates it  I think we’re going  to do it sometime in the future and the pain would be very little for us to be at 7-1/2 this time next  month     5/16/78              39       Mr Chairman, as a non-voting member, I would like to protest the exercise  we have gone through around this table  The lateness of the time of receiving your memorandum  hasn’t given me an opportunity to read it and think it through and yet we are amending that  language here at the table  It’s very difficult to follow and I can’t think precisely what the effect  may be  It does seem to me that Frank Morris has identified the real problem  So long as you  publish the ranges, you are going to have the same problem you’re trying to correct  As a result,  maybe this isn’t the time to be changing [the language] but maybe next month when we have a  little more time to consider it    "
766,1978-06-20,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think that my staff and I come out very close to  where the Board staff comes out on all three of these numbers, providing we don=t screw it up by  focusing in on the 5-1/4 percent  Rather, our staff would suggest that if we are at 6 to 6-1/2 percent  money growth over the year ahead, we indeed could have a real GNP number perhaps a little more  vigorous than the Board staff’s 4 percent  We think there is underlying strength in this economy that  is going to carry through not only in ’78 but well into ’79  We think that [the rate of increase in]  prices quite likely would be in a range of 7-1/4 percent  But that is based in part upon some research  and analysis that our people have done with respect to what food prices may do in relation to farm  prices  As I think you all know, there has been a rather substantial increase in both commodity and  cattle prices  We are talking about small grain prices--for wheat and corn--up some 50 percent over     6/20/78                19  the last six months  The same is true for cattle; 90 days ago we were talking about $40 cattle and  now we are talking about $60 cattle  Our analysis is that that probably is at or near the top for both  of those major commodities; [they] might rest for the remainder of this year  But that does not imply  a slowdown in the rate of increase in food prices, by our staff analysis  Food prices will continue to  add to the inflationary pressures, thus coming to about 7-1/4 percent over this period  Lastly, I  would say with regard to unemployment--and our view perhaps is biased by the regional  information--we again have information that unemployment in the mid part of the country is at a  very low level  Depending on what metropolitan area you’re talking about, it’s someplace between  3 and 5 percent, which is substantially below the national rate   And if the projection that the  economy is vigorous and will continue so over the period ahead [materializes], it is going to put  some upward pressure on prices to be sure, but also it will hold that national unemployment rate at  around 6 percent or moderately above That would be our judgment       Mr Chairman, I think Paul Volcker fairly well expressed my view  I have  just a couple of comments about the range of 5 to 10  Somebody around the table mentioned that  July could come in much stronger than is being projected by the staff and I guess I am fearful that  that will occur  It seems that in each of these quarters for the first month of the quarter we have  missed [always] on the downside and have been surprised  So, I=m concerned that July may come in  very strong  In that context, the M1 range of 5 to 10 implies, I believe, a growth rate of about 12  percent in July for M1 if the June growth rate as projected by the staff is correct  That=s a very  vigorous growth, it seems to me       At the upper end--that=s correct  If we get that kind of growth, I would hope  that the Committee, whether it be in consultation or otherwise, would indeed move onto the 8  percent funds rate level before the meeting next month  I’d really suggest Paul Volcker=s range of 5  to 10, with a federal funds range of 7-1/2 to 8, and a money markets condition directive--that is, to  move to 8 only in the case that July does come in much stronger than is now projected by the staff    "
792,1978-07-18,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  My question revolves around your projection for  the first quarter of l979 premised upon the tax cut  What are the elements of that tax cut that give a  kick early in the year and then die off so quickly?  It seems to me that on the [consumer] side at  least we won’t realize that until we have gone through the year       But in terms of consumer expenditures, if you follow it into the economy, it  is spread over the full year, right?       But that is coupled, for those of us who pay taxes, with social security tax  increases, so there is some question of whether you get any kick at all in the first quarter       Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, think that the economy has a lot of vigor  in it  But the assumptions for the forecast figures that I will give probably put a little more  emphasis on what I think monetary policy is going to have to do in the period ahead, and thus  reduce the growth that we would otherwise expect  As a result, we expect a GNP of around 3-1/2,  which is something less than the last time we were asked to give these figures        Okay  I think it was 4 plus the last time; I would scale that down simply  because of the role I think monetary policy has to play in the period ahead  So I have 3-1/2 for  GNP  I agree with Bob Mayo in that I think the 57 is a fluke so two quarters from now we will  have about the same level [of unemployment] but it will be 6 percent as measured  And for prices,  the deflator will be 7-1/2 or I would think in a range of 7-1/2 to 8 percent       Thank you, Mr Chairman  I don’t know quite how to say this  I’ve listened  to the people around the table and I give great credence to what has been said about the  international perception  But it bothers me that we may be underselling our critics and watchers in  the sense that if we [stay] with no change--[4 to 6-1/2] on M1--I think we have as large a credibility  problem as if we go the other way and recognize the realities and raise the upper end to some  extent  That is to say, if we were to publish an M1 target of [4 to 6-1/2] it is almost laughable in  view of the track record we have now built--with 79 percent in the most recent period of time   Thus, I would suggest that we do indeed raise [the top of the range], with an adequate explanation   But rather than going to the 7-1/2 or 8 percent that has been suggested around the table, I would  adopt much of what Paul Volcker has already suggested, which is moving to 7 with some action by  the Committee--not only by rhetoric but also by action--to demonstrate that we really intend to hit 7  percent  I guess I am encouraged by Steve Axilrod’s statement that 7 may be doable  But the fact     7/18/78              30  of the matter is, if it is doable, and if it’s believed, that is a much tighter monetary policy than what  we have been following in the past and one which is not too tight, perhaps, to push us over the  hump  So I would propose that we indeed go up, recognizing reality, but do it cautiously to 7 and  do something about it on the short run       Yes, leave M2 and M3       Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think we have had quite a lot of movement [in  interest rates] and, as a result, I’d prefer not to see an additional movement come out of this  meeting  But to insure that we do indeed move if we have strong growth in the aggregates in the  intermeeting period, the prescription that I would prefer is 4 to 8 on M1, 5 to 10 on M2, with the  existing 7-1/2 to 8 percent funds range, but with an aggregates directive  That means, if I interpret  it correctly, that if the July-August growth rate for M1 approaches 7 percent, for example, we  would indeed move to 8 and quite likely we would be at 8 percent under those circumstances by  this time next month  I think that would be all right, but I would hate to come out of this meeting  moving to 8 percent  So, the important aspect of that, in my view, is that we have an aggregates  directive with those ranges       Mr Chairman, I would endorse what Bob has said  I think it is important to  maintain the integrity of the System, as it has been in the past  I would ask a question that has not  been raised otherwise as to whether or not the supplier of this material--and I’m talking about the  bridge principally, which I understand is the big cost item--who wants to develop and market this is  prepared to go on a lease arrangement with us for some time to prove the product  We indeed used  this arrangement when I was on the call last year  Apparently there was a bridge in place at that  time  We were using a scrambling device  I was talking to Kansas City and I had a device set in  my office  What I am really suggesting is that a cooperative effort or some sort of reasonable lease  arrangement might be possible       It seems to me that they are new in the business and if the Chairman’s  forecast is right--if mass development is going to take place in the period to come--this company  will be in the forefront  And if they have us as a touchstone to sell, it may be very advantageous  for them  I would like to see us look into that       You would want [the cost] to be reasonable       We don’t get it until after 100 or 130 our time in Kansas City    "
842,1978-09-19,"  Yes, a question, Jim  We're still puzzled as to how you get the kind of kick   in the first quarter of 1979 from the tax cut that is proposed  I assume it's from personal  expenditures as a result of lesser withholding, but the figures don't seem to add up       No, I guess I'm really asking a question  Isn't it true that the tax cut will be   spread more throughout the course of the year rather than getting the kick-up in the first quarter as  suggested here?       I'll break your track record and only say that we did not disagree with the   staff's projection other than in the area of price inflation  We think it will be somewhat larger, at or  near 8 percent for the year ahead       That's correct      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Just an observation first of all What has   happened over the past month seems rather incredible to me--that is, that the markets have  absorbed with very little pain or very little anguish the 1/2 percentage point increase that we have  fostered  And it seems to me that the markets are now in a position to accept a further increase   With that background and my concern, which is beginning to become stronger, that the aggregates  are growing far in excess of the long-term ranges--[I would move rates up further]  Although we  make efforts to move the aggregates back toward the tops of their ranges, each month we find we're  further away from them--thus, Mark Willes's comments with regard to the meaning of interest rates  and the fact that they’re not biting in this environment as we might have expected them to  That  suggests to me that we have to take further steps and be rather bold about it--though maybe not  quite as bold as Mark  That's why I would like to see this Committee today with ranges on M1 of 5  to 9 and on M2 of 6 to 10, adopting the federal funds range that you originally proposed, Mr  Chairman, of 8-1/4 to 8-3/4 percent  I’d go with an aggregates directive, which would suggest that,  if we get into the upper portion of those ranges--which I would fully anticipate very early in this  period--we will be at the 8-3/4 percent level within a short period of time  And I think that would  be appropriate    "
866,1978-10-17,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I guess you could characterize our feeling as  one of a bit less optimism than the staff has projected  Particularly with respect to GNP, we would  look for a performance of around 3 percent, which we don't view as pessimistic, frankly  It is about  as high as we would hope for      Secondly, on the price side, we are a good deal more pessimistic in the sense that there do  not seem to be those factors working that will give us any assurance that prices will come down   Rather, [it appears that] they will accelerate even further and we are looking for something in the  range of 8 percent--perhaps even 8 percent plus  There has been some comment [about] some  contribution from the food sector because of good supply in the growing season of 1978  But I  would remind you that prices of food are more greatly affected by the middle man than they are by  the producer  Secondly, the producer price that will hit the middle man for processing is now being  determined to a greater and greater extent by some floor of government subsidy  So you just don't  have the elasticity in that price that you once would have expected     Lastly, with respect to unemployment, I would share [the view of] those who have  mentioned--I guess I would start with Ernie--[unintelligible]   Unemployment in our area is  virtually zero, particularly for skilled people but it does indeed run on down to those people who  wait tables  We do not see very much unemployment, so the figure of 6 percent that is commonly  [cited] nationwide is certainly not [the case] in our area, as far as we can tell  But as this year  unfolds we would expect the unemployment rate, because of the price impact, to move upward  In  the year that we are looking at, we think perhaps unemployment will go to the 6-1/2 level from the  current 6 level       10/17/78 22                  Mr Chairman       There was one point  Apparently around this table there is an assumption  that it is wise to publish an M1+ and I would just like to raise a question about it  The work that we  have done suggests that M1+ is indeed a measure or modifier to M1 as we go through this period of       10/17/78 37             adjustment and uncertainty  But with respect to M1+ as any type of guide--as a replacement for  M1 in terms of a measure of a narrow aggregate--it has a great deal of volatility to it because it  includes all savings accounts at banks and those are interest-sensitive  As a result, it seems to me--       Yes  It seems to me that if we now surface that and tell the public that we  have another measure called M1+ and we give the definition of it, we may have a very hard time  getting away from it as we move into the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony  As a result, I would  prefer that we publish M1 with some recognition and qualifying statement--that the range is  broadened, for example, because of uncertainty but not [introduce] a new aggregate measure called  M1+  I think it's going to get us in trouble down the road  My point is that if we are going to use a  narrow definition, I'm not sure it's the best definition       Yes sir       Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think we would adopt the ranges for M1 and  M2 that are set forth in alternative 1   With respect to M1+, in view of the comments earlier, I have  no objection to setting ranges for that for internal operating procedures  And if I was  misunderstood before, I'd like to correct that  I have no objection to the range in alternative 1 for  M1+, which is 3 to 7  It is important, in my judgment, to go with a money market directive  I think  there would be some advantage to moving to the 9 percent level, with a money market directive,  immediately following this meeting  And as a result, I would select a federal funds range of 8-3/4  to 9-1/4, with the understanding that any movement from 9 percent during the intermeeting period  would require some consultation     "
892,1978-11-21,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  We believe that the staff figures are just a bit  high--in other words, growth over the third quarter to the third quarter at 1 to 2 percent, hopefully   Part of that comes, again, from the strength that is shown by the staff in the first quarter--which I  believe is attributed somewhat to the tax cut--and we don't see that  But I think also the rate of  growth would suggest a bit less in first quarter of '79, but getting some strength further out into the  period, which gives you the 1 to 2 percent overall  Secondly, with respect to prices, I think [the  staff] may be a bit optimistic; we would say 7-1/2 to 8 percent  On unemployment, [we see it]  moving up to about 6-1/2 by year-end       Yes, Mr Chairman  I would prefer the prescription very much as you  described it earlier  I think it’s not necessary to say, but maybe I will say it anyway, that we are  only three weeks away from a very dramatic move in the markets  They haven't adjusted very well  It seems to me that we ought to sit right where we are--maintaining the 9-3/4 funds rate, however,  to confirm that to the market  That's where they think we are on the bottom side at least  And I  would take the aggregates as you suggested them, with a money market conditions directive    "
916,1978-12-19,"  Mr Chairman, with respect to our view, it’s not greatly different from the  staff’s projections  We would be a bit less optimistic about growth in 1979 and then again about  the distribution throughout the year  We think there’s enough strength going into the first quarter     12/19/78          16    [to be] fairly strong in ’79  If we’re somewhat less than the staff, this implies in the latter part of  ’79 that there would be more weakness than the staff implies  As far as the inflation [projection],  we are a bit higher--something around 8-1/2 percent as opposed to something less than 8  And on  unemployment we’re about the same  It is not, I think, surprising that we are getting some fairly  strong growth in the fourth quarter  As Ernie Baughman and others noted particularly in the  Southwest--and it’s true in the Tenth District as well--we are at full capacity, not only in terms of  plant and equipment, but also human resources  There’s almost no unemployment at all, at least in  our part of the country  A very strong fourth quarter and a very strong first quarter of ’79 seem to  be in train      Having said that, and now turning to policy, I would join those who have some real concern  as to how far we have moved already and how much further we should move--bearing in mind that  we’ve moved rather dramatically in the last 60 days as far as tightening interest rates  We do have  some weak showing in the aggregates, although as some others have said [it’s not clear] what all  that means  It’s heartening so long as it doesn’t last too long  I have a feeling that we’re going to  see some growth in the early part of 1979--perhaps much greater than the staff is projecting--and  I’d like to be in a position to act against any really substantial growth in the aggregates early in ’79   That implies, of course, higher rates  But for the time being, unless there’s a reason dictated by the  international situation that we need to go up, I would prefer that we stay essentially where we are  with maybe a modest increase to 10 percent  But I’d be very hesitant to move [the funds rate]  above 10 percent unless there’s some dramatic event internationally that requires us to move  further         Mr Chairman, this is a troubling recommendation to me in that, among  other things, it is cutting the meeting dates from twelve to ten and lengthening the intervals  between meeting dates--particularly as we move into 1979  It’s going to be a tough year, as  demonstrated by the discussion around this table today, it seems to me       There also appears to be an alternative that may or may not have been considered by the  committee but seems to be a reasonable one as far as I’m concerned  And that is that we move all  of the meeting dates to the second Tuesday instead of the third Tuesday of the month, thus  maintaining a full 12-month schedule and having no interval between meeting dates greater than  five weeks--very much the way we have done it in past years  Because of the shortness in coming  into this procedure I think we might still adopt the recommendation of a telephone meeting for  January, but nonetheless a full-blown meeting in January by telephone         Yes, I think it does     "
941,1979-02-06," Thank you, Mr Chairman With respect to 1919,  we agree rather closely with the staff's projections, except that we  think the first quarter may not be quite as strong as suggested by the  staff But f o r  the year as a whole we are fairly close--perhaps a bit     2/6/79 -17-   more pessimistic but in a range that probably doesn't make much  difference   In meetings with businessmen and others in our part of the  country, the sentiment is fairly strong that we will escape a  recession in 1979--that these straight lines projected by the dots  might really come true Philosophically they believe that there is a  little better chance that that will be the case [than not]   With regard to the aggregates, I noticed that Steve mentioned  the possibility of some political problem with widening the ranges  from what he put into the Bluebook But he ended up with a range of 3  percentage points range rather than 4; he went from a range of [2 to  61 percent to a range of 2 to 5 percent But there are a lot of  uncertainties about M1 specifically that have been mentioned around  the table One, for example, is the shift in demand for money; that  might amount to 2 percent Another relates to the effect of ATS  accounts, about which we know very little--we are 3 months into this--  and the projection is that it could be as much as 3 percent Given  these uncertainties, it seems to me that even under the new Humphrey-  Hawkins bill there would be some advantage to having an M1 range a bit  wider than 3 percentage points; perhaps we should maintain the 4  percentage point width that we went with in October because of  uncertainty So, I would like to see the width of the M1 range at 4  percentage points, with a range of 1 to 5 percent Hopefully, as we  get more experience with ATS accounts we can narrow it a bit But I  don't see that there will be a great deal of criticism in maintaining  that 4 percentage point span for M1 With respect to M2 and M3, I  would agree with those around the table who would like to see the  numbers increased a bit from those in alternative B of the Bluebook,  again because of various uncertainties A s  a result, I'd have an M2  range of 5 to 8 percent, which again is a 3-point band, and an M3  range of 6 to 9 percent  "
965,1979-03-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman I think I'm also  falling into bed with some people that normally I would not have  associated with in the past We have done some of the same work that  Steve has described this morning and a couple of conclusions are  apparent to me at least One is that M1 is totally unreadable now  and, as a result, I don't think we should put a great deal of weight  on it But by the same token, the impact on M2 is not nearly as  great It has been rather readable In any event, if one looks at  all of the aggregates, it's fairly clear that there has been a  substantial deceleration in their growth And given the environment,  most people, including myself, would look for recession some time  later this year or early [19801 It seems appropriate that we be  careful not to worsen that [prospect] in the sense of doing any  further tightening at this time If we're going to move at all over  the upcoming month, then I would prefer to skew our ranges and targets  in such a way that we would, indeed, move [the funds rate] down a bit  Whatever we do today is not going to have an impact on bringing  inflation down further, it seems to me We have rather strong  constraints in place now as we have had starting last May To do  anything further at this point would not have an impact on inflation  for some period out but would ensure a recession As a result, I  would prefer, for this month at least, to hold about where we are but  to adopt a policy that will permit us to move back a little if indeed  the aggregates continue [to growl at a low rate through the month of  March    I would prefer ranges for both M1 and M2 of 4 to  8 percent--paying little attention to M1 but more to M2 in which I  have somewhat more confidence--with a funds range of 9-314 to 10-114  percent, centering on 10 percent, which may or may not be a  perceptible move downward That is 10 or 15 basis points that perhaps  the market would read And I would favor going to 10 percent  immediately  "
986,1979-04-17," Thank you, Mr Chairman I'm at the end of the  table and perhaps everything has been said I look forward to these  meetings [I was pleased1 particularly this morning to learn that we  have a new industry in Nebraska and they're apparently very persuasive  if they can sell that shoe for $559 to Mark Willes!   As for the Board staff's Greenbook forecast, we agree  generally with it, with a bit of exception to a couple of areas ~f  you look carefully at it, they have a [rebound] in GNP in the second  quarter which, as far as our staff can tell, does not have any basis  other than a hope that GNP will increase to a more acceptable level in  quarter two of 1979 Also, we'd suggest that housing starts and  consumer spending may not be quite as strong as they're projecting  Thus, we would say that their forecast is a bit on the optimistic  side, but [the difference] is narrow; we feel the economy might be  just a bit weaker   Turning then to the aggregates, everything has been said  about the aggregates To be sure, all of them, including bank credit,  have weakened measurably [even] with all the technical explanation  that Steve has given That, taken together with at least our outlook  for the economy--and I think it would be true of the Board staff's  outlook--the fact is that the restraint that has been put in place by  monetary policy in the past is beginning to take effect Looking  forward to 1979, the risks certainly are on the down side A  recession--hopefully a moderate one--is quite likely sometime late in  1979 or early 1980 As for inflation, there's no question that it has  been accelerating over the past months, but largely as a result of  factors that we cannot control with monetary policy That is, oil,  food, and other such price increases will not be affected, at least in  the short run, by anything we do here today Thus, I would prefer  that we stay where we are at the moment I think a tightening would  insure a recession I don't think that's the way out   As a result, I'd stay where we are and be prepared to move to  a bit easier stance if we find that, indeed, the economy in the second  quarter is coming in somewhat weaker than the staff is forecasting and  if the aggregates remain weak I'd give greater emphasis to M2 than  M1 because M1 does not seem to have much value at the moment  [Unintelligible] all of the measures are weak [andl so long as M1  remains weak with the rest, it seems to me we can throw it out and  probably focus on M2 and bank credit a bit more And I'd be prepared  to move to a bit easier stance if the economy does indeed continue to  be weak    Thank you, Mr Chairman I would opt for  alternative B straight down the line including the funds rate range  On the funds rate I‘d remain where we are unless we see the aggregates  moving outside the lower end of the ranges    A money market directive    Yes  "
1011,1979-04-27," Thank you, Mr Chairman I would be inclined to join Bob Black  and Bob Mayo, particularly in view of the fact that we have experienced six months of very slow  [economic] growth In fact, [given] the experience in April of the last few years, I’d like to wait  and get some additional information on [the aggregates] As a result I would like to stay where we  are for at least two more weeks and perhaps take a look at it [then] The aggregates are obviously a  matter of concern but they jump around so much that I’m not prepared to recommend going up [on  the funds rate]  "
1030,1979-05-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman First of all, we have  very little quarrel with the staff projections, particularly as to the  pattern, but our forecast is perhaps a bit weaker in the latter part  of 1979 Our analysis suggests that the housing figures might be  weaker in 1979 In talking with some savings and loan people in our  District, the impact of this money market certificate change has been  very dramatic That, coupled with usury rate ceilings that apply in  several of the states in the High Plains region, essentially has  closed down any future housing commitments by the savings and loans  There is apparently nothing in the works that would pick up that  slack Thus, we would anticipate that overall the housing projection  by the staff might still be a bit high, even after the adjustment they  made this time In looking at the Board's model and trying to work  through the housing starts and the potential for a bit of an increase  in the saving rate, the [growth] drops off very quickly it seems So  our best judgment would be that in the latter part of 1979 and into  1980 we would have somewhat lower growth than the staff has projected   With respect to policy, [my view is] cast against the  background of growth in the aggregates being very slow  numbers that have been published for the first quarter and what the  April numbers now show, there is not a great deal of strength--even if  the April numbers are adjusted It would be my judgment that now is  certainly not the time to take any additional tightening actions And  perhaps not until we see the figures in May and June would it be time  to consider easing As a result, it seems to me that for policy  purposes we ought to be looking at [maintaining] the interest rate   Given the     5 / 2 2 / 7 9  -16-   level and adopting [a directive based on] money market conditions  without regard to where the ranges may be   I've not thought about Steve's proposal for wider ranges ~t  is not very attractive to me at the moment Nonetheless, I'd like to  see interest rate levels stabilized as they have been in the recent  past I'd also like to endorse a proposal that I think [was implied  in] Dave Eastburn's question And that is that it is tine for the  Board to consider an increase of 114 percentage point in the discount  rate, which is merely an alignment We're seeing considerable  pressure Loan to deposit ratios are increasing in our part of the  world, and understandably so It's that time of the year But I  think the pressures are getting fairly strong Lastly, if one looks  at bank credit, which some apparently are prone to do, our  information, as best as we can track it down, is that a great deal of  the support for bank credit may be coming through the Eurodollar  market And if there is an increase in the reserve requirements for  RPs, as the Board has proposed, it's going to make the Eurodollar  market much more attractive--a cheaper source of funds Unless  there's some way to police the movement of funds offshore that come  back in through the Eurodollar market, I think we would just be  worsening that problem rather than making it better with that  [proposal], M r   Chairman    Mr Chairman, I would go for an M1 range of 1 to  5 percent rather than zero on the bottom with the anticipation that we  may get weak growth that would trigger a downward movement [in the  federal funds rate] I'd go with 4 to 9 percent on M2 and 10 to 10-112  percent on the funds rate with a money market directive  "
1050,1979-06-27," Thank you, Mr Chairman I was going to say “me too” in the sense  that I don’t think we have anything in our arsenal that we should use at the moment The possible  exception is that in a situation in which the dollar has worsened somewhat it seems to me that it  might be appropriate to consider a bit of a jump in the discount rate if only to give a signal  internationally--for that reason only Still that’s a concern I know that the discount rate is not a  matter for the Committee’s consideration but it should come into play someplace down the road  if conditions [warrant] it  "
1072,1979-07-11," Thank you, Mr Chairman First of all, I think  it's perhaps difficult to quarrel with the staff projection for the  economy But our independent look at the same figures they apparently  are looking at--with some of the assumptions different, however--would  suggest that we may have a bit less strength in the economy than in  the staff projection, particularly starting in the 3rd quarter and  running on into the 4th quarter And just to throw another variable  into it, there is a very good possibility that we will be facing an  auto strike starting in September or sometime in early October, and  that could further weaken retail sales and thus turn the economy down  further than even we would project Secondly, we would have some  quarrel with what I believe to be the staff's assumption that there  will be no substantial inventory reduction We believe that there may  be one--short-lived to be sure, but nonetheless rather sharp   With those very few exceptions to the staff's forecast, it  seems to me as far as policy is concerned that monetary policy has to  work against the inflationary aspects of our economy, much as Mark  Willes has described essentially On the other hand, in view of the  weakness of the economy that I have just described, it doesn't seem to  me that we should go overboard even through the remainder of 1979 I  would also suggest that the chances are that we will not get the  growth in the aggregates, particularly M1, at the midpoint  [unintelligible] Thus I have no reason to quarrel with Steve's  suggestion for the ranges for 1979 And to agree with Bob Mayo, I  don't understand the exercise for 1980 So what Steve has suggested  is perfectly all right    Just to [follow] on that, I don't know how you  would intend to avoid testifying as to the numbers--that we're indeed  looking at 3 percent for the ATS adjustment early in this year and  perhaps only 1-1/2 in the latter half of 1979 That can be read, if  we maintain these ranges, as a tightening of policy    But it's going to be very difficult to explain,  and the--    Alternative 11, Mr Chairman Just a comment  with regard to the international situation If I heard Scott Pardee  correctly this morning, he suggested that any move by the Federal  Reserve, whether in the discount area or an upward movement in the  funds rate, would have some salutary effect [in countering1 any  weakness in the dollar that might develop Again, I would like to  propose that serious consideration be given to a discount rate  increase if that develops rather than moving to an upper limit of  10-1/4 percent [on] the fed funds range  "
1098,1979-07-17," Yes, I am, Mr Chairman With respect to the President's speech, Bob Mayo synthesized the comments that I've heard here almost to a tee That is, there isn't great enthusiasm perhaps because of the long-range nature of [the proposals] and it was not aggressive in terms of the domestic inflationary problems As to the international situation, it does seem to me that [unintelligible] have been met, they're going to go farther than they perhaps should Under the    7/17/79  circumstances we face, I would be prepared to recommend that we take rather aggressive action in the intervention [area] for obvious reasons but also I would increase the discount rate later this week if conditions remain as they are today Also, I'd be prepared to increase very modestly the fed funds rate either at the same time or preferably early in the following week if the discount rate [move] does not have the effect that we'd like it to have "
1139,1979-08-14," Thank you, Mr Chairman I, like everybody else around the table who has [spoken] this morning, am mindful of the balance needed between the [potential] depth of the recession and the need to fight inflation Over recent months, my attention has been more focused on trying to moderate the depth and the length of any  -33-    8/14/79  recession that seemed to be clearly on its way or perhaps already in progress I guess that's a very comfortable position when the aggregates are indeed growing at a moderate rate or even at a very low rate; we can [then] afford that luxury But things have changed The projections we're looking at now of as much as six months of very high rates of growth in the money supply ultimately will translate in my judgment into a worsening of the inflationary outlook  I would come to the position then of suggesting that we have to move against those growth rates in the money supply The question is how and by how much I would note that this Committee has taken interest rates, as measured by the federal funds for example, a full half percentage point higher since the last meeting on July 11 That's not an insignificant move The proposal around the table is that we take another 1/2 point [increase] immediately; that's a full percentage point from one meeting to the next There's been a change in the Chairman of this Committee; there have been changes in several other aspects of the Committee itself That [increase in rates] may have a public perception that would be acceptable in the short run On the other hand, it seems to me that in view of the past movement we've already had--and if there is indeed a lag in how interest rates affect the growth rate in money supply--then I would oppose going up at this time in any major step  I would like to propose that if the markets question where we are [on the funds rate]--whether it's 10-5/8 or 10-3/4 percent--we indeed validate a move to 10-3/4 percent And I'd set the ranges in such a way that they would be below either ""A"", ""B"", or ""C"" as they appear in the Bluebook I would have them be 1 percent off the ""B"" ranges of 4 to 8 and 7 to 11 percent, with a rather restrictive federal funds range of 10-1/2 to 11 percent And if indeed we get the growth projected by Steve and his staff for the latter part of August and into September--particularly those first 2 weeks in September which apparently is a crucial period--we should be prepared to move to 11 percent and let the Desk work within those ranges, but [I'd go] no further than 11 percent  You asked, Mr Chairman, for some comments with regard to the discount rate If we were to move [the funds rate] to anything above 10-3/4 percent--if that's the decision of this Committee--then it would be my feeling that the discount rate probably should go up and by as much as 1/2 percentage point I would prefer, on the other hand, if we do stay fairly stable--that is, at the 10-1/2 percent target we have now--that the discount rate remain where it is Only if we move to 11 percent should consideration be given to a discount rate move   Mr Chairman, I've been sitting here puzzling over some of the comments with respect to what the speakers perceive to be the need to move to 11 percent to hold the growth of the aggregates in late August and in September to something less than has already been projected First of all, those are guesses So it seems to me that we have to focus upon what level of interest rates is appropriate for the economy in the period ahead while still moving against the pressures of inflation Moving to 11 percent isn't going to lessen the pressures of inflation With that kind of puzzlement I would say--and I guess I'm repeating myself--that we have taken rather substantial steps in the last month And since I don't see that at this point an additional 1/2 or 1/4 percentage point [on the funds rate] will bring those growth rates down any in the next six weeks, I would prefer to stay where we are at 10-3/4 percent "
1168,1979-09-18," Mr Chairman, I'd like to join Bob Mayo with  respect to the ""B"" ranges and standing pat at the moment I would  like to suggest--this is not a substantive issue--that if we have an  aggregates directive with a 9 percent top [on the M1 range1 that's  really about the same thing as if we have a money market directive  with the ranges that you have already suggested Either one of those  is acceptable to me  "
1205,1979-10-06," Thank you, Mr Chairman I believe almost  everybody who has spoken up until now has said that they would endorse  the change in operating procedures I'd just like to raise a voice,  not necessarily in opposition to it but at least to question it  First of all, let me say that I agree that there's a need for  something to be done today and that it has to be rather dramatic  Hopefully, it would include the Treasury, but if that's not in the  works then we have to move ahead But if I understand what is being  proposed--the change in operating technique--it seems to me a very  high risk venture, particularly in view of the fact that it has never  been tried To be sure, it has been studied to death Moreover, I  happen to be somewhat sympathetic to this kind of operating technique  But we are in a time of crisis For us to move to a new technique  that has never been tried will be viewed by the markets, it seems to  me, as our grasping at the last straw, so to speak And if indeed it  doesn't work to get the aggregates in better position by the end of  this year I think we would have shot our last round and missed I  think that's putting the Federal Reserve as a system in a very, very  precarious position   Lastly, if I understand what is being proposed, I would say  that the very same thing can be accomplished by using our present  operating procedures simply by broadening the federal funds range and  narrowing the aggregates ranges We would have as much chance--or  perhaps more chance because we have experience with it--of hitting the  targets we're shooting at instead of starting to swim in new and  untried waters If we can get the public reaction that we're trying  to get by operating with our present procedures, I would prefer to go  that route rather than go into something that we know very little  about I happen to believe that we may be on the verge of moving into  a recession but it isn't clear And I think we do need some dramatic  action I would rather see a press announcement by you framed in the  context of having a wider range for the federal funds rate, which  certainly will be understood by the market though maybe not by the  public And it will probably be better understood by the market than  our moving into a new operating procedure That coupled together with  a rather dramatic increase in the discount rate--and letting the fed  funds rate move up to a fairly high level--would be a preferable  action to me However, I do recognize, as you mentioned earlier, that  it's absolutely essential that we have a broad consensus [on whatever  action we take today] Accordingly, I will [not object1 if a  consensus forms on the other side    I would say that when Bob Black and Emmett Rice  agree, I would expect everybody else to be able to agree!  "
1227,1979-10-22," I agree with all the statements with respect to  credibility I think it’s absolutely essential that we come in at or  near the target path for the fourth quarter, which also suggests that  we should use the full [funds rate] range at this point, up to 15-1/2  percent I would hope, however, that we would have another meeting  before we‘d allow the fed funds rate to remain above that 15-112  percent for a full weekly period Lastly, I would say that there is  some question in my mind as to whether or not the horizon that we are  looking at for the fed funds rate on average--being one week--is the  proper length of time or whether it ought to be a bit longer than  that But with those comments I fully endorse the position that you  have set forth  "
1247,1979-11-20," Mr Chairman, we believe the staff's forecast  to be a good one, particularly with the caveats about additional oil  price increases that may come out of the December OPEC meeting and  that would turn the first quarter a bit lower perhaps than our initial  forecast would suggest As to business activity in our area,  particularly in regard to housing and autos, autos virtually have  stopped selling simply because of credit and prices    Both With respect to housing, we have two  situations within the seven states One is the usury ceiling, which  of course has cut off all residential housing But the same is true  in the other areas where usury laws are not a [factor] The savings  and loans virtually have shut their doors They are not prepared to  bid for the high priced short-term money and put it out other than is  necessary to meet the commitments they had outstanding before these  recent rate increases Beyond that, retail sales have turned soft and  as a result there is fairly good evidence that [they] are going to  move to a lower level What Christmas may hold I suppose nobody  knows, but quite likely it will be a bit softer than we would have  thought some time earlier in the year   With regard to the policy we may be considering today, I  would say first of all that I, too, would opt for ""C"" or something  even a bit to the right of ""C""--and for a couple of reasons that are a  bit different than those Governor Coldwell has already expressed  One, it seems to me that if we try to move growth in the aggregates up  in the next six weeks to 9-1/2 percent, as Steve has suggested--or if  we get zero in November it's 11 percent [in December]--we are going to     1 1 / 2 0 / 7 9  -26-   get a funds rate drop And [the rate1 would be pushing on the lower  end of the 11-1/2 percent range that we now have or of some lower  range if we were to set it lower today I think that would be totally  inappropriate, not only domestically but also internationally In the  discussions that I had on a trip to Europe recently I got very much  the same question that you said was proposed to you If they see our  interest rates drop before they see some [progress] in the fight  against inflation, then they are going to believe that we have lost  our resolve and, therefore, act accordingly And the dollar will  quite likely come under some pressure    Well, it seems to me that we are going to have  the same kind of psychology--    Yes Policy-wise, it seems to me that it would  be appropriate to adopt "" C ""  or perhaps something a bit more  restrictive than that On the other hand--  "
1274,1980-01-08," Maybe I shouldn't say anything, but would it be possible in this transition period to publish M-lA and to use M-1B as a memorandum item with a notation that, indeed, M-1A will be replaced by M-1B when the transition period is completed?   But it's particularly important when the Committee expresses its view in the directive to the Desk as to whether or not equal weight is to be given or what we're focusing on Thus, it would [reasonable] to put M-1B in the public domain but as a memorandum item, initially at least, so that the public and the markets can track it   This table that you just described will be published monthly and then there will be weekly publications of M-1A and M-1B?   Thank you, Mr Chairman There are two or three points I would like to make One, on the discussion of whether or not to retain ranges, I think there is comfort in ranges and that we must retain them for 1980 And I think a spread any narrower than the spread of 3 points that we have had in the past would be ill advised Secondly, as to the projection of our intentions for 1981 and beyond, I would agree with the comments that it would be perhaps more destructive to credibility than helpful If we project for 1981 and beyond, we would have to do it either [by giving] a set figure of where we project the money supply to be, which takes us out of the range concept, or by saying that we are going to reduce money growth 1 percent from the year before, whatever that may be There is real danger in trying to project into 1981 and beyond It seems to me quite appropriate, however, to express what probably would be a consensus of this Committee that our objective is to move the money growth to a lower level [within] those ranges, [namely around] 55 percent That's still a very restrictive monetary policy for 1980 as opposed to 1979 That would be moving from growth of 7 percent in 1979 to 55 percent in 1980, which I consider to be a fairly restrictive policy I would like to recommend that we look at a range  -38-    1/8-9/80  for 1980 for M1 or M-1A, and I think they are both the same, of 4 to 7 percent rather than either alternative 1 or alternative 2   Thank you, Mr Chairman I, too, would opt for alternative C, taking advantage of what would appear to be fairly slow growth in money that we are focusing on in the first quarter I would note that historically--in recent history at least--we haven't had very much growth in money in the first quarter and, quite likely, that history will be duplicated this year To get somewhat of a head start on our longer-run targets it seems to me that we ought to accept that slow growth in the first quarter; and as a result alternative C would be attractive I would also note that if you focus on Ml, its growth even under alternative C is greater in the first quarter than we had in the fourth quarter, which turned out to be a fairly strong quarter I don't know what that implies except that it just reinforces my thought that we quite likely will get very slow growth in the first quarter and ought to tolerate it whether it is below 4 percent or not The interest rates are an important factor both domestically and internationally and we shouldn't lose sight of that "
1299,1980-02-04," Thank you, Mr Chairman The staff's forecast is a bit more pessimistic than our forecast, and that largely centers on two differences One is the saving rate, which the Board staff's forecast suggests will increase over the coming year while we believe it will be either flat or at least at a low level, thus giving consumers the ability to maintain in part their standard of living even in view of heavy inflation Secondly, we believe defense spending will be somewhat greater than the staff is forecasting for the year 1980 coming into the third and fourth quarters; it may be $2 to $3 billion larger in each of those quarters than the staff has projected, thus giving stimulus to the economy As a result, we would see the real GNP at about flat, zero to maybe one percent on the positive side, with unemployment someplace between 7 and 7-1/2 percent The CPI in our judgment, however, is going to continue at a fairly rapid rate Our judgment is that it will still be in the 11 to 12 percent range in the fourth quarter As to the fiscal side, obviously there will be much more expansion than the staff or the Administration are forecasting And as to a tax cut, I would agree with whoever said it would be a tragedy   Thank you, Mr Chairman Chuck Partee has moved from one recommendation to another from last month to this month and I will also, but going the other way Last month we were looking at a somewhat weaker economy and it seemed that perhaps the inflation rate would fall off a bit through 1980 Also, the deceleration from what actually happened in 1979 to what I would like to consider our target --the midpoint [of any of] the ranges [we select]--from about 7 percent [growth] to 5 percent for M-1A, for example, seemed fairly fast And that is the reason last month that I would have opted for what now appears to be alternative I But things have changed, at least to my mind We're now looking at a bit stronger economy through 1980, as I tried to outline earlier today Secondly, and more importantly, inflation quite likely will stay at the present level or even accelerate as we get into the latter part of next year As a result, what we do on the monetary side seems extremely important That leads me to say that I would go to alternative II, which has a midpoint--what I [consider] the target--of 5 percent Whatever we've said about ranges, they are unimportant to me except in how the public perceives them I would hope whatever targets this Committee sets, whether on the long run or the short run, that the Desk at least in its month-to-month or day-to-day operations will look at the midpoints So, I am looking at 5 percent for M-1A or 5-1/2 percent for M-1B And I share Bob Mayo's view on going to M1 and doing away with M-1A and M-1B I think they will confuse more than we will be able to explain   You had 8 for alternative III, Mr Chairman   Which one did you go with, the last one?  SPEAKER(?) Yes   I thought we had more votes for alternative III "
1327,1980-03-07," No, I haven't spoken, Mr Chairman   [We 're on] the other side of Missouri, MrChairman I happen to believe  that we've come a long way so far and I think now is not the time to hesitate or lose our courage As a  result, I think we ought to give the Desk whatever latitude seems necessary, and that would suggest an  18 percent upper limit On the other hand, I would [not] agree with Governor Partee I would like to  see us maintain the 4-point spread on that [funds rate] range It can be moved, of course, if and when  we have to [move rates] down and that would suggest that the top [of the range] would come down at  the same time   Paul?   Roger Guffey We had a vote this morning by wire that is inconsistent  with what we just did I would hope that the record would only show one vote today, that being the  [vote to raise the upper limit to] 18 percent 1   Okay "
1345,1980-03-18," I would like to ask what may be the same question John Balles asked but in a little different way Had we raised the discount rate early in March, having in mind that through the period total reserves would be over [path] by about $700 million plus, would you not [conclude] that we'd have come closer to the total reserve path and that the adjustment would have been a bit quicker? I guess the alternate question is What would you have projected for interest rates? Would they have been any higher absent the anticipation [of a discount rate move] that was going on?  -14-    3/18/80   Thank you, Mr Chairman The agricultural sector has been reasonably well covered in the comments made by Mark Willes and Bob Mayo Our banks supplying credit to the agricultural sector are very tight with respect to loan/deposit ratios But contrary to what Mark suggested, we have found that the country banks are facing up to their problem and raising their interest rates to agricultural borrowers They have no outlet for the loans even at these higher rates, however, because the correspondent banks are not prepared to pick them up, even at a discount, at the rates the credit is being extended [Cattlemen] are withdrawing from filling the feedlots again as they turn their present stock, which implies less meat in the future I suppose Secondly, as we go into the planting season, a period of high agricultural [loan] demand, there is a bit of a safety valve, if you will There is still a lot of grain in the hands of the producers, which can be sold at the lower prices now prevailing That would suggest that there will be a considerable  -28-    3/18/80  squeeze on farm profits in the period ahead But I don't think the restraint program will have a great impact on the agricultural sector immediately The grain embargo probably will have as great an impact as the restraint program What I am really trying to say is that there are tough times ahead in the agricultural sector  Turning to policy, Dave Eastburn captured my concern very well In the Bluebook we are looking at a 4-month period instead of the usual 2-month period or even a quarter It seems to me that credibility of the Federal Reserve System may be the more important aspect, at least of near-term policy The potential bulge in April is part of the problem I'd hate to go back to the [procedures used] prior to October 6 and focus on interest rates But I think it's extremely important--for international and domestic reasons, inflationary anticipation, and other things--that we not permit [the funds] rate to come down very far in the next month or two As a result, ""B"" looks very reasonable to me I would be inclined to move a little closer to ""C"" because of the potential for interest rate movements if indeed the demand for money begins to ease somewhat because of the lower projection of growth And as I understand it, the restraint program may depress that another half percent over the year How that will roll into the [next] two months, I don't know So, ""B"" would be reasonable and I would be inclined to move a little toward ""C"" if that were the sense of the Committee I would also set the federal funds range by raising the lower end and reestablishing the 4 percent spread, thus coming out with a 14 to 18 percent range with the anticipation that interest rates would remain in the upper half of that range for at least the next 60 days "
1367,1980-04-22," So moved   Thank you, Mr Chairman The new operating procedures seem to me a bit more effective when we're seeking to restrain credit on the up side than when we're trying to encourage the extension of credit on the down side As a result, I've been pleased with what we've been able to do on the up side, but I am concerned about where interest rates will go as we move into a recession Like Ernie, I agree with much of what has been said here this morning; it seems to me it's all relative If we move into the May-June period when things are very weak, having come from a period when we've successfully--hopefully--killed off inflationary expectations and people are wondering what is going to happen and they see interest rates drop not to the 13 percent level implied by alternative B but maybe to 10 percent, then we may lose all that we've gained over the last 60 days by going to a 20 percent prime rate or a 19 percent federal funds rate Thus, I think this Committee does have a responsibility to moderate [the movement of interest rates] on the down side It's not that rates can't go to 13 percent or maybe to 10 percent, but they shouldn't do it in a 30-day period or perhaps even in a 60-day period I would be concerned if we just turn those rates loose even with a down side of, say, 13 percent If we're looking at a very weak economy and indecision by those who take down credit or hold money, then it is perhaps true that within a couple of weeks we'll find that 13 percent is not the right level; so via a [conference] call it will go on lower I would hate to see that take place If the staff is correct that to achieve [the money growth of] alternative B we're talking about increasing nonborrowed reserves at a 20 percent annual rate through those two months, I think that's far too fast and would add confusion to the market rather than stability And I think right now we need stability   Thank you, Mr Chairman I feel some discomfort in what I'm about to say in the sense that it may be taken that I don't have great faith in our new procedures But maybe it's because of uncertainty I'd feel somewhat more comfortable if we were to move toward ""C,"" [which has 4 percent growth for M-1A] [Our directive] now has 4-1/2 percent or somewhat less I'd also point out that the ""C"" [growth rates] are well within the ranges that we set for the year as a whole, the 3-1/2 to 6 percent for M-1A, for example So it wouldn't do great violence but would recognize that we have gotten a bit less [money growth thus far] in the first half of the year And as a result, I'd feel more comfortable with it I take some comfort also from your statement that if the funds rate gets to the 16 percent level, whether we adopt ""B"" or ""C""--and I don't think it makes much difference which one we choose in the short run--there will be a consultation And the point of that consultation would be to discuss whether or not interest rates should continue to drop very quickly I have a considerable concern that we should not in the next two weeks, or even before the next meeting, be at a 13 percent rate, for example, which is the bottom of the funds range [under ""B""] Thus, I would prefer to move to ""C,"" with the understanding that the consultation would indeed take place at about 16 percent and we could discuss whether or not the rate should go below that in such a short period of time   Is that exclusive of the big bank borrowings?   Does this imply consultation at 16 percent? "
1389,1980-04-29," Mr Chairman, Roger Guffey I'd like to associate myself with Governor Wallich and Tony Solomon It seems to me that we should resist--not overly resist, but resist--[the funds rate] going down too quickly I would think that a range of 14-1/2 to 15 percent for some short period of time would be very appropriate I would also agree that maybe a week from now we ought to consult again I would suggest that the numbers we are looking at in April are just as surprising as the numbers on the other side were in February, and they may not mean a whole lot I would hate to see us drop the funds rate precipitously strictly to try to get back onto the somewhat artificial path for the first half of 1980 I'd rather take a bit longer The aggregates are coming in weak but I would not try to get back on path in one month on figures that we're not very certain about "
1409,1980-05-06," Paul, Roger Guffey I would reluctantly accept 11 percent but would be happier with 12 percent I would hope that the move down would be very cautious and that [we] will catch up with the market someplace around [that] level   I would hope that the Board of Governors would wait until the end of the week to announce it   Well, because some of us have meetings [of our boards of directors] on Thursday and would prefer that this not appear to the market to be an unusual action by the Board of Governors or the respective Banks   Let's declare a victory and withdraw "
1430,1980-05-20," All of this discussion does point up the importance of the discount rate, however That's because we could have moderated the fall in the funds rate, the [final] standard, if borrowings had been above zero That is something we are going to face in the period ahead, and thus the Board [should] give considerable [thought to] what to do with the discount rate So long as borrowings remain at zero, we have nothing to operate against but the funds rate--the fall of the funds rate itself--if we try to achieve these targets   Well, it's fortunate, I think, because Tony Solomon just synthesized my feelings both for moving somewhat gradually and for building stability I would also point out only as an addendum to what he said that if we [adopt] alternative A and shorten the horizon to September, if the estimates are right, by the end of September we would be above the lower bands of M-1A and M-1B, and that to me is an acceptable performance I also feel rather strongly--and the argument has already been made--about people's perceptions if the federal funds rate is allowed to go much below the perceived rate of inflation for the remainder of the year But it points up again what I believe to be the operating reality If we have no borrowings whatever, the bottom of the funds range that we set today will be a constraint if at any time within the next week or two the staff finds that the projections are not quite as strong as those put forth in the Bluebook So, we'd really almost be choosing a lower federal funds constraint wherever we set that I would opt to set it not much below the 10 percent level Thus, I would like to adopt alternative A--and maybe it will [get us] back to path by September-- recognizing that if the staff is right we'll be within the range established for the year as a whole   Mr Chairman, if I understand the way we have operated in the past, if we have a consultation and the rate is within the range established by the Committee, then no vote is taken at that consultation Isn't that correct, Murray?    5/20/80   Well, I don't believe there ever has been one There has only been a vote when we've lowered or raised the range from what the Committee set at the meeting Therefore, I would be opposed to setting a range now with a lower limit below 9 percent And I would also like the caveat the Chairman has put forth that there be consultation at 9-1/2 percent At this point I feel fairly strongly that a federal funds rate below 9 percent would not be acceptable   There is no compromise, either   This is with consultation as we approach 9-1/2 percent?  -47-    5/20/80 "
1504,1980-07-25, As is Kansas City 
1561,1980-09-16," Thank you, Mr Chairman I'm delighted to be here Let me just start by saying that we would not differ greatly from the staff's projection on the economy We think the coming quarter might be a bit stronger than their projection because we start from the premise, regardless of what the Chairman or others around the table may say about a tax cut, that a cut is in train and we are going to get one We should be talking about the structure of that tax cut rather than whether or not we will or will not have one Having said that, it also seems to me that we have not made any real progress against inflation as a result of the fact that people are now projecting a very short recession Historically it's true that we don't see any movement on prices until well after the recovery is under way What I'm afraid of is that our new procedures have done nothing more than shorten the cycle and that they will not produce an atmosphere that will permit any movement against prices this time If we indeed have the kind of growth that the staff is projecting, which is modest to be sure, and if we have gone through 3 or 6 months of decline albeit very steep and we get no movement on the price side, then I think it will all have been for naught That says to me that  -25-    9/16/80  in the period ahead, since we are the only [game in town], monetary policy is going to have to be fairly restrictive And we are going to have to face the criticism that Jerry just mentioned, but that's a year down the road So I'd rather get something working now, even though we could have negative growth in the period ahead because of the tight monetary policy, given that we will get a tax break, and take that heat a year from now Otherwise, we have will gone through a period that has netted us nothing and we are going to have to start again, whether it's incomes policy or some other type of governmental policy Maybe that will come to pass, but I would like this Committee at least to put the kind of monetary policy in train that suggests that we may not have positive growth in the period ahead--that we may be looking for a W or a little longer [before recovery]   Thank you, Mr Chairman I would opt for alternative B, but with the caveat that the [monetary growth] figures listed in ""B"" would be the maximum we would accept; we'd accept somewhat slower growth during the period ahead, if indeed the economy or other factors would dictate that On the other hand, I see no reason to raise the lower bound of the federal funds range from 8 to 9 percent, as suggested under alternative B I would leave the funds range at 8 to 14 percent In part my feeling about this stems from the fact that M-1B is more acceptable to me as an aggregate to measure what we should be doing with monetary policy in the period ahead Looking at the quarterly average for M-1B under ""B,"" for example, we are still talking about a [quarterly average] rate of 7-3/4 percent for the fourth quarter, and that is a fairly high rate of growth Anything that would exceed that would be troublesome to me Just to restate my position I would take ""B"" but as the maximum; I would accept somewhat lower growth if it did indeed come about I'd leave the federal funds rate range at 8 to 14 percent because I don't think it makes that much difference If the rate gets up to around 14 percent, we ought to be talking; we can do that in a telephone call rather than at this time   There's an alternative for that, Mr Chairman, is there not? [We could adopt] the alternative B [growth] rates and drop the borrowing assumption from $800 million to perhaps $700 million, thus increasing the nonborrowed reserves to make up the total That would not push up interest rates early in the period necessarily It would give us a bit of time to view what is happening to the aggregates   Are you making those comments based upon a weekly horizon or for the five weeks?   My question is If the Committee decided on a ""B"" or ""B+"" target for the aggregates, would you construct the path based upon a borrowing assumption of $750 million for five weeks? "
1584,1980-10-21," Don't we have in place warehousing agreements with the Treasury where they permit us to accumulate mark balances?   Thank you, Mr Chairman With respect to the staff's forecast of the outlook for economic activity, the only real divergence I have is that I would suggest that the fourth quarter might be a bit stronger than they are projecting In turning to the financial side, it seems to me equally that the Bluebook's forecast of moderate demand for money in the fourth quarter may be a bit optimistic Taking those two things together would suggest that we will find considerably higher interest rates necessary to hit either ""A"" or ""B"" And it comes to my mind that the Fed's credibility may be more suspect now than virtually any time in the future because we are the only one out there that the public is looking to for any comfort that prices will come down some time in the future Thus, with the prospect of difficult times ahead, I don't think we should shirk the responsibility It seems to me that the nation would be well served if we made a fairly strong public comment and commitment that inflation is the number one problem And we can do that in my judgment only by adopting a policy at this meeting that is at least no more expansive than ""A"" Let me suggest that if we adopt ""B,"" for example, we would be saying to the markets and the public--maybe 30 days from now to be sure when they look at the record--that the Fed gave up in November the opportunity to come within the stated ranges And I think that would be very unfortunate I would focus on at least alternative A I think we are going to have difficulty hitting either [unintelligible]; it does imply higher interest rates There has been some comment about the 1980 recession and the fact that we got no price improvement as a result of that recession I'd like to point out again that it was a very short recession I don't think one could expect any price [improvement] If we now shy away in monetary policy from the risk of having a recession or a double-dip, I think we are avoiding our responsibilities for the future Lastly, if we adopt ""B""  -34-    10/21/80  or something to the right of ""B,"" I think we would be making our task for 1981 impossible in the sense of trying to hit the targets we have already announced As a result, I would like to take the bite now rather than some time later   Mr Chairman, following those comments, I'm attracted to Tony Solomon's proposal that we adopt the A alternative with a borrowing level of about $13 billion I would also suggest  -43-    10/21/80  that we move the federal funds range to 9 to 15 percent, with some caution as we go above 14 percent if that is indicated   I'm picking up on the Chairman's comment that we not move too quickly early in the period I guess I've come to the conclusion that in this intermeeting period we are going to move upward with interest rates It's a question how quickly we do it And I think we control that through the level of borrowing   I think that's correct   The difference may not be so important today But as we move into the first quarter of 1981 if we stick with the targets already announced, we're making up not only the reduction that we're proposing for 1981, but the 1/4 or 1/2 percentage point that we missed before And it just worsens the problem if we're focusing on M-1B, for example "
1611,1980-11-18," The Committee does have rules with respect to what the Desk can hold   Well, there is an intermeeting limit as well as a maximum we can hold in any one currency Aren't we getting at or near that limit? If it is not changed--   So in the period ahead, we are talking about accumulating a maximum of $400 million in marks unless we have a notation vote to change the limit during the intermeeting interval   That seems reasonable   Thank you, Mr Chairman With regard to the economy, the staff's projection seems reasonable I would just note that they consistently have underestimated the strength of the economy And if that continues through the remainder of this quarter, we could have some of the additional pressures that Steve spoke of on interest rates On the other hand, if I understand the Bluebook correctly, for the first time in several months the staff has not built into any of the alternatives any further downward shift in demand for money over this remaining two-month period So it would give me some comfort that we may come closer to hitting those numbers between now and the end of the year than we have in the last couple of months when we experienced overshoots from the staff's projections at the time of the Committee meeting Coming down to policy considerations, it seems to me there are a couple of things The Federal Reserve has a credibility problem It has been talked about around this table Last month we chose to adopt ranges for the aggregates for the quarter that insured that we would be outside the [annual] range for at least two of the three targets--M-1B and M2   No, but we understood that if we hit those targets it would take M-1B outside for the year   I would agree with that And unfortunately, the misses have always been on the high side   And that brings in the credibility question, which I'd like to address   And the revisions have all gone one way, unfortunately   As to the credibility problem, of course, we will be in a new era after the change of Administration and the change of Congress And the Federal Reserve is going to be looked at in terms of how we plan to perform It seems important to me that we not adopt aggregate targets at this meeting that would suggest we are taking another step, as Frank Morris pointed out, toward insuring that we will miss the aggregate target for 1980 to an even greater extent It seems to me that ""B"" is consistent with what we set last month; thus I would opt for the B alternative with a funds rate range of 13 to 17 percent, having in mind that if we have underestimated the strength of the economy for the remainder of this year, we may be using that 17 percent I am really suggesting that a cap of 17 percent might be appropriate   The fact of the matter is that borrowing has been higher than $16 billion Over the 4-week period it has been about $1-3/4 billion; it has only been $16 billion for the week that we're in now So what we're really looking at in terms of the recent borrowing level is somewhat higher than that $16 billion "
1634,1980-11-26," Paul, this is Roger Guffey I have just a couple of questions When you were talking about an 18 percent cap, [does] that conflict [with] no increase to the nonborrowed path?   The other question--perhaps Steve could respond to it--is [whether with] an 18 percent rate, [which we have] in fact, we're still looking at about $2 billion in borrowing?   Well, I'm with you and Tony Solomon in supporting the proposal    11/26/80   We've had no problems in Kansas City and are putting no pressure on the banks "
1652,1980-12-05," Mr Chairman, Roger Guffey I would support your proposal if I understand it, and I think I do I would add just one other point It's puzzling to me, in view of the discussion here and at least our view as to what is happening, why the discount rate was increased yesterday It would be helpful to me if somebody could explain the rationale for it   I guess I am really asking what was the chance of--   In that context, I would support the proposal "
1672,1980-12-12, Guffey Okay 
1690,1980-12-18," Mr Chairman, I'd like to ask a question What is the limit or what constraints are there on our warehousing for the Treasury? Is that based upon the Exchange Stabilization Fund availability?   Well, is there any leeway at the moment?   $2 billion left?  -26-    12/18-19/80   Thank you, Mr Chairman I'd like to start with the premise that for the long-run 1981 target the most attractive approach to me is strategy I, which has some implications And you've asked that each of us speak to that I would agree with those who say that we do have some powerful forces in place, that we are quite likely at or near the turning point, and that the first quarter will be a negative figure and perhaps a fairly substantial one First of all, that doesn't bother me very much It seems to me that what happened in 1980 is that the so-called recession had no impact on prices, and that is an experience that I hope we'll avoid this next time through It seems to me we do need a downturn; we do need a washout And I would be prepared to do what the Federal Reserve needs to do to accomplish that, having well in mind all of the pain that comes from that As for the alternative, I think there is no alternative at all for the nation in the long term  Secondly, the prospects of hitting the targets under strategy I may be quite good in the first half of the year with this downturn we have spoken about And there's another factor that may come into play If indeed the Administration comes out on January 20th or soon thereafter with a program in which there is some fear, if you will, or some realization by the public that we really mean business, there are two possible results One is that there will be some euphoria and we won't get the dip that I just predicted The alternative, and what I think is more likely, is that we will see a withdrawal from the market  -44-    12/18-19/80  --something similar to what we saw after the credit controls went into effect earlier in 1980 In other words, we will have no problem hitting the targets simply because there will be little or no money growth Having said that, it seems to me our important task in 1981 is not to duplicate the 1980 effort and permit interest rates to drop  Therefore, I would join with Henry Wallich in the belief that there will be a time in the first quarter and maybe through the first half when interest rates will be more important to me than the targets We can tolerate the lesser money growth that I would expect to happen and manage interest rates on the down side a bit more than might be acceptable to those who would want to follow our procedures strictly There have been a couple of comments having to do with base drift; I would not opt to correct for the base drift That is to say, I would center the targets for 1981 based upon the projections that we announced in July of 1980 I would go from that point forward and accept what happens, hopefully on the down side, and the base drift might correct itself by our getting some low growth It seems to me that there is presently a window that the Federal Reserve can move through in anticipation of Administration programs coming on to help us for the first time in the years that I've sat with this Committee The prospects are that if we adopt strategy I, which incorporates this rather large downward shift in the demand for money--I don't know whether that will occur or not, but it may not need to occur if these other things come to pass--we will have a window to move through to do our part and we perhaps will have another player on the field to help us I would hope that we would take advantage of it and not wash the economy out to a very long and deep recession but accept one and do those things necessary to achieve [our objectives]   I'd just as soon go forward  SPEAKER(?) We'll get finished quicker if we are hungry   Mr Chairman, maybe in view of the time and hunger, I would say I like what you have proposed The only reservation I have about it is the 16 percent on the low side I think we must maintain at least a 4 percent range but I would hate to see us get to 16 percent in the next two or three weeks or even by February 5th, or whatever the date of the next meeting is, without some consultation and a better view of what is happening in the economy With money growth and what is evident now, I would really prefer a consultation, say, at 17 percent, which is consistent with what the staff is projecting under the B alternative in the short run   What I'm really suggesting is that we adopt this with Chuck Partee's amendment to the language in that one sentence I think we should at least consider some consultation if the funds rate is above 20 percent and stays there for any long period of time or if it drops to 17 percent and looks as if it's going to pass through 17 percent to that 16 percent level   Isn't this consistent with what we publish [now] --""generally in the range of"" and then we cite the range--for the federal funds rate?   It doesn't seem to me that this is something we need to deal with in this intermeeting period Your testimony is going to come within 10 days [of the publication of this directive]   I would go for consultation at 17 percent Then I would join you   May I ask what the vote is on?   No, I mean the range of the federal funds   With any idea of consultation at a higher level? "
1717,1981-02-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman The discussion that is taking place around this table this morning suggests that there's enough confusion, and we should not confuse the public further by your testimony late in February With that premise, it seems fairly clear to me that we have no choice, as you stated earlier this morning, but to publish growth ranges for the year 1981 that are lower than what we had in 1980, even though we didn't achieve them Thus, I would opt for alternative I, the straight 1/2 percentage point reduction in the M-1A and M-1B ranges from the published ranges of 1980 without the bottom line that's on the left-hand side With respect to M2 and M3, I'm inclined just to adopt ranges that are 1/2 percentage point below what we established for 1980 as well, with a caveat or an explanation when you testify that at the time of the required July testimony you will reveal all of these shifts, believing that most of the shifts in NOWs will have taken place by that time You would describe then what happened in 1980 and 1981 but with the assurance that we're moving toward a bit more restraint in 1981 than we had in 1980   The answer is no   Does that statement imply that we'll be looking for the midpoint on M-1A and M-1B and the upper end on M2 [and M3] or the upper end of the range on all four of them?   For the [Congressional] committee's perception or the public's perception we would be still looking at the midpoints of M-1A and M-1B, although we may know around this table that it's not too [likely]   There's another explanation there, Steve, in that alternative B relates to alternative II, which had the lower ranges We did not adopt those ranges So you're talking about something between ""A"" and ""C,"" but not ""B"" as consistent with what we adopted on the long run   In response to Governor Partee, though, ""A,"" ""B,"" and ""C"" are not consistent numbers ""B"" relates to alternative II, the tighter one   Yes, right   I would join those who prefer something between ""B"" and ""C"" The problem is complicated as far as I can see because of the very sharp one-month drop in money growth in December It rebounded in January and we had about 6-1/2 percent growth, which is above the long-run target that we just established for 1981 If you look at ""A,"" for example, the money growth that we would have to have on a monthly basis to get back to our 4-1/4 percent growth by the end of March involves very large figures The same is true of ""B"" It seems to me that we shouldn't [go that fast] [My prescription] represents what we have done in the past; we've tried to [make up] about one-third of the [way each month, taking three months] to get back to the midpoint I would suggest that we get back to the midpoint by April or sometime beyond   Well, just to conclude, I have one other point If we were to adopt ""A,"" for example, or even ""B,"" we would get back close to the midpoint by the end of March And if we're going to hit the targets we've established for 1981, then we'd have to drop the monthly growth rate of around 6 to 8 percent--8 percent under ""A""-- back to 4 or 4-1/4 percent That would really be putting on the brakes again at the start of the second quarter It makes more sense to me to take another month or so to get back to the midpoint rather than to try to reach it by March as represented by ""A"" or ""B"" So, I'd favor someplace between ""B"" and ""C,"" with the federal funds rate probably in a range of 15 to 20 percent I agree with some of the comments around the table in that I have little confidence in the interest rate projections in the Bluebook   15 to 20 percent   Taking January [M-1B growth] at 6-1/2 percent   Is that for M-1B?   I don't mean to resurrect yesterday's discussion but it seemed to me that we did assume yesterday that there would be more rapid adjustments in the nonborrowed path I'd like to go on record as saying that I don't happen to agree with that; I think that's what Lyle was talking about   A majority opinion, yes I just want to register [my disagreement with that]   Have excess reserves come down this past week?   Well, does that account for the drop of the--   What is the federal funds rate assumption consistent with $13 billion of borrowing? "
1743,1981-02-24," Mr Chairman?   Roger Guffey I tentatively would support your proposal, if I understand it So, I would like to ask a few questions One is When you speak of adjusting the borrowing [assumption] to $1 billion plus, is that an adjustment from the current [assumption] of what I believe to be about $950 million?   I'm going to have to ask another question then The downward adjustment to the nonborrowed path to accommodate your suggestion is about $250 million Is that right?   Yes I do and I would approve that The second question that I had, Mr Chairman, is for a bit clearer statement as to what we would do with the lower bound, which is 15 percent   Significantly means something in the 14-1/2 percent or below range?   I would support you on that basis   I'm not quite sure I might say, if I understand what we're doing, that I think I would prefer a formal vote in the sense that there has been a policy judgment to change the nonborrowed path   Yes, I think so "
1767,1981-03-31," And change the $8 billion to $5 billion   Right That's in the text   There is another part of the recommendation, and that is that rather than put $8 billion in the text, we would put $5 billion; it retains the language that's now in the text with respect to the Committee's authorization   Well, to go at it another way, if I understand the recommendation, it would be to go to $8 billion in the text and delete the language that would permit the Committee to increase it   Well, I just want to go on record to say that I didn't understand either, and that may not be unusual I understood the same thing that Jerry Corrigan just explained When we dropped the nonborrowed path, I thought it was for the remaining weeks in the  -20-    3/31/81  period before the next FOMC meeting, which would have been five or six weeks   Further, there was a misunderstanding on my part that when we took the action that the federal funds lower bound was no longer a constraint   I have no recollection of any discussion, either inferred or otherwise, indicating that to be true other than, I believe, Mr Chairman, you stated--and I may have asked on the telephone what you meant by reaching the lower end--that the federal funds rate would be something below 15 percent I asked what area you were speaking of and you would not be pinned down, as I recall But it was also fairly clear to me at that time, apparently erroneously, that as we moved into the remaining weeks of the period the 15 percent would still be a constraint or a consultation would have taken place   Thank you, Mr Chairman With respect to the staff forecast for the economy, I don't know that there's very much to disagree with if you can't come up with a better forecast But since I'm not a professional economist, I guess I can take the liberty of suggesting that the forecast in the past has consistently undershot the actual performance And queuing off of that history, I would believe that we may be looking forward in the period ahead to somewhat stronger growth than is evidenced by the staff forecast in the Greenbook Having said that and then looking at what is described as the downward shift in demand for money that has been very great in the period just passed--and the sub-talk that we'll return to some more normal level in the period ahead--it suggests that we are going to have very strong money growth as we move to the second quarter and perhaps into the third quarter If that's correct, it seems to me that we ought to take what we can get now, and that would suggest at least ""B"" and perhaps ""C"" And since I can't decide between the two, I would take something in between The borrowing level that has been described in the Bluebook as being consistent with alternative B, and I believe that's $1-1/2 billion, seems a bit high to me Let me make the point that there has been some discussion about whether or not M2 should be taken into consideration for the period ahead I'd like to see it taken into consideration in a sense that it is running very high And at the time the staff sets the paths for the period ahead and the borrowing level consistent with those paths, M2 should be either explicitly in the directive or, because of the discussion around this table, implicitly be taken into consideration and not lowered Thus, that suggests a bit firmer policy, or closer to ""C"" than to ""B"" I would just come out someplace between ""B"" and ""C,"" which is about 6 percent from February to June   It's 6 percent if you are looking from February to June   M-1B goes to 6 percent and M2 to 12 percent; or if you are looking at March to June, it's about 5-1/2 and 10-1/2 percent  -41-    3/31/81   That would suggest we could narrow it to 2 percentage points "
1790,1981-04-28," Mr Chairman, Roger Guffey If I understand where everything ends up--and you appear to have a fairly good consensus--we're talking about dropping the nonborrowed path, which I assume would elevate our borrowing level above the $17 billion that Steve was talking about earlier   My understanding, at least according to my staff, is that that implies an interest rate level that is at least at the top of the range--18 percent--and quite likely something more than 18 percent   I think that's right, Mr Chairman I'd like to suggest that this time we observe the upper limits for the purpose of consultation and that at the time we crack through the 18 percent we have another telephone session   Well, [with] the path on the down side, I'd just like to urge that we have a consultation at or near 18 percent "
1812,1981-05-06," Paul?   Roger Guffey I would join Frank Morris and Ed Boehne I think we've effectively told the market that the fed funds rate is only the point at which the Committee will consult And anything beyond that, I think the market is discounting They don't know when we consult If, as you have suggested, we have essentially done away with any point of consulting, I don't have any problem at this time because we only have ten days before the next meeting   Maybe the market was a bit confused after they saw the record before And I guess I'm a bit confused as to why we establish a range if that's true You've tied this language, as I understand it, to some projected rate of money growth for the period ahead   Well, I'd feel more comfortable saying we had a Committee meeting and reestablished the range at 15 to 20 percent I think that is consistent with what Frank Morris and Ed Boehne just said   Paul, Roger Guffey again About your statement that we've tightened up It would be the first time, as I recall, that anything would be in the record saying that we actually have reduced our nonborrowed target and that it was done not by the Committee in a formal way   I must have misunderstood   Okay With the comment that you made--   So the fact that the nonborrowed path for the intermeeting period has been lowered will appear no place in the record, then?   If you're talking about the last telephone meeting, I don't believe there was a vote  SPEAKER(?) Not the last telephone meeting, the last-- "
1832,1981-05-18," It largely has abated, yes Just over the last week to ten days we've gotten very good rains and very general rains There is some good and some bad news to that Along with the rains was some very severe weather; and much of the winter wheat, which would be harvested commencing in early June in the southern part of the District, was laid flat by the hail and high winds So, the question is whether what wheat survived will result in a good crop, beyond earlier expectations; that which was flattened is a total loss The USDA doesn't know what is out there and I don't think the farmers can tell Not until the harvest is completed will we know The fact of the matter is that the outlook for the agricultural sector probably is better at the moment than it has been over the past sixty days, with the exception of the red meat industry, particularly the cattle industry There has been a continued liquidation of breeder stock, keeping meat prices down As a result of that there is a loss in the cattle in the feedlot area That has to end one of these days; and when it does, we will quite likely see an escalation of meat prices, which will roll into [consumer] food prices  On the other hand, the District is heavily engaged in the energy business and that is going gangbusters The unemployment rate ranges someplace from 3-1/2 percent to 8 percent, depending upon whether you're in Oklahoma, Colorado, or New Mexico It's a very mixed picture    5/18/81   Before you leave, Mr Chairman, I should say that the green bug problem has been whipped with a red lady bug   Lady bugs   Well, I can't answer the question of what may happen in the future The rains have only occurred within the last ten days, so those judgments might be made in the future But they certainly haven't been up to now Conditions have been very dry and as a result the cattle have been taken off of the range for two reasons One was that the prospect for keeping them through the upcoming summer was not very good Secondly, those in the feeding business were losing from $75 to $200 a head on fat cattle So, they are just liquidating their breeder stock Whether or not business judgments will be made to maintain some of that breeder stock now that some green grass has come forth, I don't know It doesn't bode well, however, for food prices for the period ahead   Further along [in his report] Scott mentioned that the French had inquired about the use of the swap line Is the Treasury position such as to prohibit us from filling a request for the French if we otherwise chose to do so?   There's confusion arising [even] within the Committee   Thank you, Mr Chairman I'm primarily motivated by a desire to hit the targets that we set earlier, not because they're magic but because that would tend to avoid the same kind of thing that happened in June, July, and August of last year That is, things got away from us after one month [of] fairly large [monetary growth] We say that isn't terribly bad, but when we start piling one month after the other, we then have a very small chance of hitting our targets for the year Therefore, restraint at the moment  -31-    5/18/81  is attractive to me, but I'm not sure that I would go as far as ""C"" The staff's estimate of growth in M-1B of 6 percent or a little above in May under alternative B probably is subject to being off by at least 100 percent That is, I think we could get 3 percent or 9 percent in May as easily as 6 percent Thus, my prescription would be something between ""B"" and ""C,"" with a borrowing level initially of about $21 or $22 billion and with the rather specific instruction to the Desk and to the staff that if money growth as it develops in May is running above 6 percent, the borrowing level should be adjusted upward promptly to $2-1/2 billion, [the level] I believe the staff would say at the moment is consistent with ""B"" So, I am choosing numbers for growth in the aggregates between ""B"" and ""C,"" with an initial borrowing level of $21 or $22 billion but I would be prepared to move borrowing up rather rapidly if growth in M-1B starts coming in above 6 percent in May A federal funds range of 17 to 22 percent would be acceptable   When will that be published? Is that in the directive?   Mr Chairman, for the moment, I'd like to try to make a case to keep the language as it is presently The markets and the public have not seen the March change in the language, which I think is rather specific and good   Yes, it's an explanation But if we then come along a month from now and publish a directive, which may mean the same thing to us but changes maybe 60 words, that will give rise to the analysts publishing from now until at least the end of the year all sorts of interpretations I think that's what we don't want It seems to me that consistency would best be served by leaving the language as it has been published in the directive, with an informal understanding in the Committee with the Chairman that it is a consultation point as described in the record   I'm more convinced myself, but it--   But we'd be taking a risk if we do that "
1850,1981-06-17," Hello, this is Kansas City with a full contingent of Presidents   Thank you, Mr Chairman   That's the end from Kansas City "
1867,1981-07-06," Does this have any implication at all for our swap arrangements and the conditions under which we could draw on them?  -10-    7/6-7/81   I would join those who would like to have a more cooperative intervention policy If that, added to the two or three other voices, is a ground swell, then--   Thank you, Mr Chairman Let me just make a couple of preliminary comments as background to my recommendations First of all, I feel that there's a good deal of latent strength in  -54-    7/6-7/81  the economy and that at any indication of lower interest rates, for example, that strength will come forth and we'll have a quite different problem than we may be facing right now Secondly, it does seem to me that we've made some real progress against inflation and that the public is at least willing to accept that To be sure, most of it has not been of our own making; it has been in both energy and food prices Nonetheless, the stage is set And one last observation If it is true that we've come to this point for whatever reasons, whether we've had a part in it or not isn't important Historically, the Federal Reserve has always come up to the hitching post and then backed off simply because the Administration and the Congress have thrown bricks at us or have not been supportive of a policy of restraint Through the course of recent history at least, we've backed off and we've made a mistake each time I think we have an opportunity this time to carry forward what we should have done before because for the first time ever we do have, for whatever length of time, the support of the Administration at least So, we ought to take advantage of that opportunity That is the background  With that background, I would like to propose that we not change the ranges for the remainder of 1981 I'd leave them the same with the understanding, [explained] through testimony or otherwise-- and I think the market already understands--that we're probably looking to the lower end of the range The fact that M2 and M3 are running very high in the range or outside of the range at the moment seems to me to be consistent with perhaps running at the bottom end of, or even below, the M-1B range for the remainder of this year, while M2 and M3 are right at the top of their ranges As a result, the fact that we may end up with M-1B below the lower end of the range for 1981 is not important I wouldn't move the ranges downward simply to accommodate that shortfall   Well, I think we ought to leave it right where it is That story can be told from the picture that will unfold in 1981, and I think it leaves open the lines of communication even with the monetarists For 1982, from the alternatives on page 14, I like lowering the range of M-1B coupled with broadening the range to 3 percentage points, so 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent has some attractiveness to me But I'd also retain the present ranges for M2, M3, and bank credit I'm not sure what those all mean For M2 at least I'd retain the present range, the 6 to 9 percent As to the short run and what we do in the next month, as I understand the procedure, we're not going to talk about that right now So I'll stop I do have some comments to make about that, however   Thank you, Mr Chairman I would opt for alternative C as shown on page 15 for both M-1B and M2 for the intermeeting period Because of all the uncertainty that surrounds the velocity and shift in demand for money and all the other boogie- men we seem to come up with, it seems to me that it is a time to focus a little more closely on interest rates Thus, I would start out on the side of not wanting to see interest rates drop very quickly through the remainder of this year, and a 16 to 20 percent range is my preference for federal funds   I beg your pardon, 16 to 22 percent The ""B"" federal funds rate range, but the ""C"" aggregates rates "
1933,1981-10-05," I'd just like to follow Bob to say that one half of our District--the western part comprised of two or three states plus Oklahoma--would fall in the category that he has just described, and it's largely related to energy and energy development They continue to put down holes, successfully finding gas and oil in Wyoming, Colorado, and in Oklahoma There is a commercial building boom in Denver, as Bob has described in Dallas and Houston, whereas the rest of our District--and I'm speaking largely of Kansas City and the Omaha area--does not share in that particular activity On the other hand, in the agricultural sector we've enjoyed one of the best crop seasons that the District as a whole has experienced in many years The cattle and hog industries, although marginally profitable, appear to have a somewhat brighter outlook However, the--   Yes, marginally profitable at the moment   Well, some of them say they're losing from $30 to $100 a head, but they continue to lose that every year and remain in business and drive Cadillacs It's a rather strange operation But the fact of the matter is that the outlook for the profitability of the red meat industry [in] the high plains area is much brighter than it was, say, a year ago By the same token there just does not appear to be any evidence of additional upward pressure on food prices stemming from the cattle/hog meat prices that may result from the [somewhat brighter outlook]   The latest information we have is that farm prices have gone up but only marginally They have been essentially flat recently, with some increases in prices but not nearly to the extent that they rose over the last 3 or 4 years The rise has slowed considerably And residential prices are flat or actually decreasing, at least in the eastern part of the District In the western part of the District, they can't build houses fast enough to accommodate the growth, particularly in the Denver area So, prices have not subsided there   Yes As a matter of fact, within the last 30 days there was an announcement of one of the largest developments in the Denver area--the project is over $1 billion--to be undertaken It's well financed, no question about it being--   Perhaps not from scratch, but some of the areas are [unintelligible] In the coal or other energy-related industries, both oil and gas, we have some camp cities where people are housed essentially in temporary housing simply because they are in boom communities That's particularly true in Wyoming and on parts of the western slope of Colorado One thing that I would like to mention is that I have met with the homebuilders in our District and probably the rest of the presidents at least and perhaps the Board members will have an opportunity to meet with homebuilders also I hear two curious comments One is that they're about to go out of business and they need some relief By the same token, and almost in the same breath, they say that they believe Federal Reserve policy to be the correct policy and thus they feel uneasy about even coming to talk with us They recognize that the relief they need is legislative relief rather than an easing of interest rates through monetary policy It seems to me a rather curious turn I understand that  -16-    10/5-6/81  today is the day they're going to present keys to everybody I met with them last week and their message is for the Federal Reserve to hold tight but that they need relief   As a matter of fact, I know that you were up there Our homebuilders spoke of your speech to the board of directors   Thank you, Mr Chairman It seems clear, at least to me, from the discussion around the table that the informational value of M-1B particularly--and maybe M2 or all the aggregates--is suspect As a result, I think we have to refer to what I believe Governor Gramley first cited, and that is the state of the economy The fact that we are at zero or thereabouts in real growth seems to be exactly the objective we set out to achieve The risk may be for a further downturn in the economy; I think it's a risk that we must take To back away from it now would be a great mistake for the Federal Reserve Having said that, my prescription would be for something similar to the current money market conditions and, in my view at least, alternative C comes closest to setting forth what we [recently] have been experiencing Alternative C would be my choice, with the fed funds range that is shown there of 13 to 18 percent On the other hand, I would prefer to have a borrowing level someplace in the $850 to $900 million range, at least initially, to insure that if weakness in the aggregates does show up very quickly in October, we won't precipitously push the funds rate down and, thus, other interest rates down   An exception week being what? "
1959,1981-11-17," Thank you, Mr Chairman I would like to align myself with comments made earlier by Governor Schultz and Governor Gramley It seems clear to me that the weakness in the economy that we're experiencing now is something that we've been looking forward to We've achieved it and we hope it doesn't go any deeper But it's a point at which, if we make a mistake with regard to interest rate levels, in my judgment our credibility will indeed be in jeopardy Let me just make one other observation For those who have commented about achieving an M1 growth represented by alternatives A, B, or C, I'd like to observe that we are talking about only a two-month period remaining in this year I believe Frank Morris spoke of adopting ""B"" or ""C,"" which are somewhat more restrictive than what we adopted at the last meeting At that meeting we were looking at a three-month period, and the incoming evidence suggests that we cannot achieve what  -25-    11/17/81  we set out to do in September or October To try to do so in the remaining 6 weeks of this period would not be my prescription  I think the focus should now be on the interest rate level; to moderate the interest rate reductions to smooth the transition into the first quarter of 1982 is important I would also observe that the interest rate levels have been reduced rather significantly over the last 60 days; the lagged effects of those interest rate reductions are not clear, but they are significant Let me remind you that as of the first of September, for example, the federal funds rate was averaging close to 16-3/4 percent; it's now at 13-1/4 percent, I believe Peter said, and rates on short-term governments have had an even further reduction We don't know what the effects of this will be but they should be positive on the economy As a result, just to turn loose and let interest rates continue to fall to achieve an aggregate growth target for the year over the remaining part of the year is not what I would prefer  I would suggest a prescription of alternative C with an 11 to 16 percent federal funds range, a borrowing level in the neighborhood of what it is now, which I understand is about $350 million However, to avoid the possibility that things might turn around and we would get much stronger growth in the aggregates than was forecast in the Bluebook, I'd like to suggest a change in the language of the directive I'd say growth of 5 percent from September to December, as suggested by alternative C, ""or somewhat higher,"" thus accepting higher growth if it occurs I think the [chances] are that it will not be that high But if it is that high, in view of the past record over 1981 we should accept it for these last two months without moving interest rates back up   Not at all   It is today, I believe, for newly discovered But they have to compete with the old gas   It's my impression that that's not true Any new gas is--   I would join in that, except that for the federal funds band I would prescribe 11 to 16 percent simply because of the shortness of the horizon; we're [only] looking at the next [5] weeks If the funds rate drops to the tune of another 2-1/4 points, that is close to being a precipitous drop over the last three months  -38-    11/17/81   Oh, I see   It seems most desirable   No I don't have a vote or I would stay "
1986,1981-12-21,"  I'd just like to ask this  You mentioned that  we had authority to intervene  Authority from whom?       I'd be comfortable with Mr Solomon's proposal with one exception It is maybe a fence-riding caveat I am concerned about interest rates rising and, to ensure against that, I would like to suggest that we adopt the modified ""B"" as Tony has suggested, with $400 million borrowing but by the same token have an understanding that if money in January begins to come in a bit stronger than projected, there wouldn't be any overt action taken that would result in higher interest rates until we got to [M1 growth] at about the ""A"" level In other words, we'd have a range, if you will, of 4 to 5 percent M1 growth under that kind of proposal before the Desk would alter the path that was set based upon a November base Also I'd favor a federal funds range of 10 to 14 percent, which provides a bit of insurance that we would have a consultation if the funds rate begins to rise early in the period   Just to follow on that, Bob, I would prefer that the Desk, without regard to how it comes out in the directive, start targeting with 4 percent rather than 4 to 5 percent "
2014,1982-02-01," Thank you, Mr Chairman Our survey didn't turn up anything that hasn't already been noted to this point But there is a bit of work that was done by our staff that may be of some interest to you It relates to a float factor that might be being [double] counted It's principally perhaps a reporting problem Since we started charging for servicing checks, more and more of the checks have been collected through the correspondent system rather than through the Federal Reserve And we have some indication that there's a bit of double counting in the correspondent system That is, the collecting bank will record the checks in ""due from"" balances as opposed to checks in the process of collection As a result it's a double counting in the demand deposit that they pass along to the customer and thus could affect M1, for example And that would be magnified in terms of the checks drawn on NOW accounts simply because they start from a very small base   Well, he started at our Bank I'd prefer to name it something else   Oh, okay   Thank you, Mr Chairman I would agree with those who have spoken about the uncertainty that might come about by trying to rebase or to fool around otherwise with the numbers As a result, I come out on the side of taking the ranges as we set them in July and trying to decide whether or not we want to increase or decrease those ranges, as the case may be Let me just say that it's striking to me that one month's money growth--which we have talked about and the bulge that took place is totally unexplainable--has prompted this Committee to talk for another hour and a half or so as to how we should change the ranges for the period That's a dramatic change, it seems to me, from what we talked about just one month ago at our December meeting I mention that to make the point that because of the uncertainty that I suspect rests within everybody's mind and the unexplanability of the January numbers it doesn't seem to me to be very logical to start talking about rebasing or doing anything else with those numbers There's only one [month of data] As a result, I would reestablish what we set in July and agreed upon again in December without taking any formal action on it  There's one potential [change] that has been mentioned before that might be acceptable as far as I'm concerned, and that is the movement of the lower end of M1 from the 2-1/2 percent that we originally set to 3 percent And that is only because the January bulge probably has rendered that 2-1/2 percent lower limit ineffective unless we get some very big negative numbers in the next couple of months And if moving the lower band from 2-1/2 to 3 percent would    2/1-2/82  serve the Chairman's purpose when he testifies before the Congressional Committees to give a view that we are going to be a bit more expansive in 1982 than what we achieved in 1981, then I would opt to increase the bottom end of that M1 range from 2-1/2 to 3 percent That produces a midpoint, if anybody worries about midpoints, of 4-1/4 percent as opposed to 4 percent, and that's some 2 percentage points more than we achieved in 1981 It tells a pretty good story   Thank you, Mr Chairman If I understood what you said earlier, the only quarrel I might have with you is what side of ""B"" we ought to end up on You are on the right; I'd go a bit to the left  -60-    2/1-2/82   It's on the left side of ""B"" It's almost the same   That's coupled with the thought you also expressed that we would move against any evidence above zero and would tolerate or accept and be grateful for anything below zero   I think that's precisely what I'd like to see happen   I would opt for the $15 billion Although we've been above that over the past week or two, it seems to me that things are moving in the right direction I believe Peter said that we had a $600 or $700 million [run-off] last week and a potential at least of some run-off again this week, which would bring the borrowing level back to about $15 or $14 billion That seems to me to be the right place to start with a zero [M1] growth in the intermeeting period   --for the purpose of coordinating monetary and fiscal policy   I would join those three to make it four "
2041,1982-03-29," If you were using the old method, Steve, what would April have come out to--17 18, 20 percent, or something larger than that?   Just one other comment in that respect While there are foreclosures and there are work-out situations, there are very few sales There are offers of land sales in our area but very few sales actually have taken place That means that the lending institution is taking over the land or their alternative is working with the borrower one more year So, it's very difficult for us to get a handle on how much land prices have actually dropped because there are no sales to verify it   Thank you, Mr Chairman My view of what we should do in the period ahead is influenced in some measure by a point that Larry Roos made with respect to what we do in the second half of 1982 Let me start my comments by saying that from my perspective all the doom and gloom that was presented around the table shouldn't be unexpected A year and a half or two years ago, we set upon a course through monetary policy that would bring economic growth to zero or a negative rate for some period of time and then to a very slow rate of growth thereafter And I think we've achieved that In a sense, we ought to be pleased with what has been accomplished up to now  The question then arises, for me at least What do we do in the period ahead in view of economic activity that is zero or maybe even negative for another quarter? In looking ahead, there seems to be a lot of potential for stimulus beyond what we would do at this table, with the deficit and the government spending that is in train for the third quarter of the calendar year, the last quarter of the fiscal year That's somewhere between $40 and $50 billion that has to be raised in the market and will be spent Together with the tax cut that comes on July 1, it would seem to me that there is a good deal of stimulus that will hit the economy starting in July or thereabouts and continuing on through the last of the year So, I'm not so concerned about getting money growth at some higher level to be sure that we don't kill the goose that has laid the golden egg Therefore, I would like to propose that we look at alternative B or something a bit less than alternative B, which is designed primarily to ensure that as we get into the last half when we get the stimulus that we will have some growth, in the 4 to 5 percent range And with the projection for the deficit and the amount of money that must be raised by the government  -37-    3/29-30/82  in the markets, if we don't have some latitude for growth in the 4 or 5 or 6 percent range, we're going to have interest rates at very high levels And I would hope that that would not occur Thus, someplace between ""B"" and ""C"" for the second-quarter period would seem to be an appropriate policy response  With regard to all the talk about the April bulge, I don't know what all that means, Steve, other than that it means uncertainty And as a result, I am attracted by your proposal--I believe it was a proposal--that we use M2 as a direct informational variable to guide policy during the upcoming period So, I would take a policy stance someplace between ""B"" and ""C"" for the second quarter, but give some weight to M2 as an informational guide as to what is happening in M1   First of all, let me say that I'm attracted by your proposal with respect to the aggregates and the implications for constructing the path But it does bother me a bit that you are proposing to drop the borrowing level from about $1-1/4 to $11 billion Actually, this week the [target] level is $14 billion My concern stems from--   But the path has $14 billion   And it has been greater than that over the intermeeting period, hasn't it?   Well, my concern about dropping the borrowing level at this particular time is the perception in the markets; they are expecting a big bulge in April Whether they are right or not is all speculation, but the fact of the matter is it will be visible very soon after this meeting that the borrowing level has dropped from the prior week's level And it would not be uncommon if [market participants] arrived at the conclusion that we had met and that we had eased in the view of a very large bulge in the money supply in prospect As a result, I like very much your proposal for the aggregates, but I'd rather have the borrowing level remain about where it is at the present time until we see some additional developments The path should be constructed on about $1-1/2 billion of borrowings   But if you give--   I assume this all contemplates a consultation before the paths would be redrawn, based upon the data that you have just described   I would hope so "
2065,1982-05-18," What form of [liquification] are you thinking about? Is this an RP merely to help the major dealers carry their inventories? Is it potentially a direct loan or do we just go in and buy--?   Is that the form of the loan--just RPs?   Well, I assume we could do it with a dealer also through the window if we had to   First of all, I'd like to direct a question to Jim Kichline If I understood your comment, Jim, the Greenbook is based upon an assumption that there will be a budget compromise and that it will be in magnitude about half what the President has recommended I was under the impression that the assumption had been that there would be no compromise   Is that for the remainder of calendar year '82?   Fiscal '83  -19-    5/18/82   If I may [continue], Governor Martin, there are three or four major economic activities in the Tenth District that I'd like to comment on the aircraft industry, energy, agriculture, and auto assemblies, the latter being a very big employer in our District Starting with the aircraft--and I'm talking about the Cessna, the Beach, the Lear jet, the Boeing aircraft--operations essentially are dead in the water, if you will, with simply no sales on the horizon They are completing their contracts and as a result some unemployment is beginning to show up and quite likely will run out even into the recovery period In the energy field, the number of rigs operating is down something on the order of 18 percent, May over January And that suggests some layoffs in that industry, [and with] less piping and other supplies it rolls back to other industries But the fact of the matter is that that has been a very vigorous sector of our economy, and some downturn perhaps is not unexpected I would observe also that even with an upturn in the economy in the third quarter or perhaps the fourth quarter, that problem won't be solved simply because it stems largely from the glut in the international market and from the stock markets [Given] the stock market prices, the numbers just will not work So, until the oil prices come up on the international scene, we won't see a lot of improvement, but I don't think the downturn will go much deeper In the auto assembly area, it is well known that there is unemployment, and that sector probably will not come back until the economy recovers  -20-    5/18/82  In the agricultural sector, Si Keehn accurately described the situation with respect to some optimism in the livestock area Prices have increased rather substantially over the last 30 days That's a segment of the agricultural industry and, to be sure, the improvement is welcome But on the crop side, there is a glut there is an overhang in the supply We are looking at a very good crop and, as a matter of fact, there is no optimism in that area; unless we get the dollar in some better alignment internationally and pick up the export sales, there isn't much hope for substantial improvement Just to give you an order of magnitude Net farm income last year was about $23 billion; they are estimating $15 billion this year And when taken in real terms in 1967 dollars that's almost the present level for the agriculture industry Having said that, however, the best estimate is that there will be only about a 4 percent withdrawal of operators during this year In other words, this year will be a washout They have about one more year of [unintelligible] before we will see some very disruptive developments, such as sales of farm land and equipment in large numbers  In summary, there are some difficult spots We are in a position in the Midwest where, because of the nature of agriculture to begin with and the energy area, we can weather another 9 months to a whole year fairly well Lastly, in the energy area, I'd say that the announcement by Exxon of the close out of the shale oil [development] on the western slope of the Rockies, which was a surprise to everybody to begin with, will have some economic impact, estimated to run something like 10,000 in unemployed in that industry in Colorado That probably won't impact the state, which is a small state and sparsely populated in some areas, to the extent of 10,000 employees simply because those are employees who have been attracted to the area and who quite likely will go home But it will have a major impact on the economy in that western area   Thank you, Mr Chairman Let me say first of all that my preference would be alternative B, that is, retention of the second-quarter targets that we set last time and for the ""B"" proposal with respect to the intermeeting period of May and June I would like to pose a question to Steve with respect to the $800 million borrowing assumption associated with ""B"" It isn't clear in paragraph 10 on page 7 whether or not we start the period at $800 million or end the period at $800 million or whether that is the average over the intermeeting period   On average?   If that's the case, then it's my judgment that starting with-- Well, first of all, let's say that we have something like a 14 or 14-1/2 percent federal funds rate at the moment with a borrowing level of about $1 billion, which was the level last week as I recall If we're moving then to construct the paths commencing with an $800 borrowing level, then I would suggest that ""B"" does imply a rather quick downward shift in interest rates My best judgment is that your [estimated decline to] 13-1/2 percent for the federal funds  -29-    5/18/82  rate over the intermeeting period may be a little modest It might be quite a bit lower than that   Well, just in conclusion ""B"" is attractive to me, and my own feeling is that a path built upon these dimensions will give us a lower funds rate rather quickly, which will give the kind of relief that I think some around the table are suggesting may be necessary I would hate for us to give up the quarterly target [for M1], however, at the 3 percent level   Would it not be possible to take a vote now on the directive? There's a consensus probably on the resolution as you have outlined it "
2091,1982-06-30," Mr Chairman, everything that I want to say has already been said, so I'll synthesize quickly First, I think that the staff's forecast is probably as good as any forecast and secondly that the risk is on the down side in the latter part of 1982 simply because the forecast is based upon some downward shift in money  -11-    6/30-7/1/82  [demand] or an increase in the velocity that may or may not occur Those are all prospective judgments and there is no historical record really to support them But having said that, it seems clear that we are in risky waters There are businesses in financial stress; I don't think we should be surprised at that in view of the monetary policy we have been running We have achieved some good on the price side  Starting from that point, on the question of what we should do for the last half of 1982--the choices being to retain, raise, or rebase--I'm attracted by the arguments that say that we should probably retain the 1982 ranges of 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent and 6 to 9 percent for the aggregates, with some sort of public announcement in your testimony that growth would be at the upper end or even [that we would] tolerate some modest overshoot rather than take the affirmative step of increasing the ranges up to 6 percent, for example As Tony has pointed out, those are very modest increases and they really are not very meaningful And because of the credibility concern, I'd rather stay with the current ranges and make a public announcement that we're going to be flexible rather than do what is necessary to come within the 5-1/2 percent top  As to 1983, it would be my preference to reestablish the range for M1 in 1983 at the current 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent with the explanation that we will indeed be at or near the top of the range for 1982 and that because of past performance we don't expect it to be within the range by the last half of this year and thus the 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent [in 1983] is still consistent with our professed desire to move money growth to lower levels over some extended period of time There is a lot of flexibility between 2-1/2 and 5-1/2 percent if we achieve 5-1/2 or 6 percent for 1982 If we want to reinforce the commitment to move to lower growth rates in 1982, we might consider adjusting the M2 range down 1/2 point If you recall, we have not had any downward adjustment in M2 for two years now, I believe And if the [MPS] model means anything at all, it would suggest that in 1983 M2 will grow somewhat more modestly than M1 and thus a 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent range for M2 would be consistent with what we're looking for in M1 at 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent   Mr Chairman, I share the feeling of most of those who have already spoken about getting interest rates down It's a question of how to do it The June numbers complicate the analysis, obviously, but I would probably go for [an M1] range something like Chuck has suggested but a bit lower I would narrow it to 5 to 5-1/2 percent Either of those accommodates some uncertainty as to what the June figures will be and what the shift [in money demand] may be in the third quarter I would just point out that 5 to 5-1/2 percent growth is substantially greater than what we achieved in the second quarter; the June figure would indicate that we achieved an average of 3 percent for the second quarter, and moving to 5 to 5-1/2 percent is indeed somewhat more expansive To avoid being slavish to the targets, I would retain the 5 to 5-1/2 percent top for the remainder  -46-    6/30-7/1/82  of the year Growth in that range in the third quarter would bring us someplace near the top end if the June figures are indeed real, but would not bring us into the range However, we would have another quarter to deal with that So, 5 to 5-1/2 percent seems reasonable to me My concern is that we should have some easing in money market conditions, and I think those kinds of rates would do it providing we start out with a borrowing level, which I think may be consistent with what I'm trying to achieve, of about $600 to $700 million  My last point is that if growth in July--which I think is the month of great uncertainty--comes in greater than the 9 to 10 percent that we're talking about, I'd tolerate that growth So, the paths would be constructed in such a way that they would be changed in July if we got a much larger bulge than the 9 to 10 percent And interest rates would not move up because of that excess growth that we're expecting; we just would not have the dimensions right In conclusion, I would like to see interest rates come down and I think [M1 growth of] 5 to 5-1/2 percent for the quarter is more expansive than we have had in the [recent] past I do not want to see interest rates go up because of some aberration [in M1 growth] that may appear in July and, thus, I would have a caveat, either implied or in the directive, that the staff would accommodate that greater growth   And those numbers are only good if June holds at zero Growth of 5-1/2 percent will move us farther away if the June number is [higher] than zero   I was just focusing on your comment on 5-1/2 percent   What does that imply for interest rates in the first week until we have to decide what to do with the borrowing path thereafter?   They haven't got-- "
2116,1982-07-15," In Kansas City we've had a number of inquiries But in talking with the FDIC people, apparently they haven't been very diligent in getting these certificates out   It's not in the hands of the holder "
2153,1982-09-24," Paul, Roger Guffey   My question to you is whether or not this should be a formal vote for the purpose of directly telling the staff to adjust the nonborrowed path, so that when the figures are published in the future the regime that we're allegedly on will be clearly understood by the markets We looked at it; we saw great growth and we were willing to accommodate it because there were all sorts of reasons why we put our faith on accommodating it I'd prefer to see us actually act on your recommendation   [Unintelligible] what range of the federal funds rate you can use under that directive I have read that we are indeed moving to an interest rate target, which I might say I think is appropriate for a time But for the record, I'm inclined to think we would achieve less confusion if we had a formal vote I don't think you'll have a problem getting [a majority] "
2171,1982-10-05," If I understand what we're discussing, you are really talking about M1 The impact on M2 would be considerably less; it is a more reliable guide   More subtle perhaps but nonetheless-- And M3- type deposits--   Just a related question Has our governmental posture with respect to intervention in foreign exchange markets changed at all? I noticed we did some purchases yesterday, as Sam reported   Not in any size [unintelligible]   That together with some lower interest rates may help   Well, my question is whether or not there is a recognition by this government of that fact And I assume the answer is, to a greater extent, yes   Let me first of all say that I agree with the proposal that rates shouldn't go higher, that they should be in some way capped from this point forward for some period of time Indeed, they should be urged to come down, not precipitously but in a modest way, over the quarter But having said that, I look at the language that you have put before us and am trying to equate that with what the staff has in the Bluebook It seems to me that the 8-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent range for M2--or at least the ""A"" proposal [of 9-1/2 percent] --and then the caveat in the last sentence would suggest that we will tolerate growth above that given some perception of liquidity needs or otherwise I'm suggesting that in my view at least--and I will ask a question of Steve in a moment--that probably will result in rates coming down immediately following this meeting, depending upon how we build the path And I would hesitate to associate myself with those who would want a fast drop in rates If that's not a correct assessment, I would like to ask Steve How would you build your path for the reserve objective based upon this kind of language? And what would you expect to happen within the next two weeks? That is rather a critical period for us   Well, it is important where we're going to set the initial borrowing level; that is critical to what happens to interest rates in the next two weeks   I guess that sort of makes my point I'm interested in the rates coming down and not going up, but I would object to seeing a precipitous drop built upon this kind of path It occurs to me that we may have fed funds trading in the 8-1/2 to 9 percent range rather quickly if we're going to set that kind of initial borrowing level and these kinds of targets   Those money numbers are not going to last except for the one week?   But we are at a borrowing level of about $500 or $600 million   And if you're going to build the path on $200 million--   Thank you, Mr Chairman I have just a couple of observations One is that, clearly, all the discussion around the table has been [consistent with] a money market conditions or interest rate directive Secondly, I agree with the comments that Ed Boehne expressed with respect to the discretion that is vested in the Chairman in the intermeeting period with this kind of a directive As a result, I'd like to ask the Chairman if he's prepared to make some statement as to the appropriate interest rate level and the pattern of getting there Clearly, it is in the down [direction] But in order to understand how the Chairman may exercise that discretion, it would help me to understand what you're thinking   In terms of the pattern that you might expect to occur If I understood your most recent statement, you suggested interest rates would be at or near their present levels for some period of time   Which drops interest rates and worsens that very situation   Sure, when interest rates--   I would opt to have a funds rate range of 7 to 10 percent; I would hope that it will be at 10 percent tomorrow and that that would be the maximum we'd tolerate on the up side I had a similar question   Well, that's all right We'll be there tomorrow But the point is that the 7 percent is also an important figure to me I would hate to see interest rates drop quickly if, for example, we get very slow growth in M2--if that's what we are targeting on or trying to use as the target But 7 percent is equally important "
2197,1982-11-16," Thank you, Mr Chairman Jerry Corrigan captured the theme that I wanted to express And that is that the discussions in October with businessmen and bond dealers in our area and at our board meeting involved probably the grimmest, gloomiest reports on the business outlook that I've experienced since I've been with the Federal Reserve Interestingly, at the most recent board meeting and in meetings with businessmen in November, there was this glimmer of hope that things indeed were getting close to improving    11/16/82  There was some report, for example, that housing in the Oklahoma- Colorado area particularly, which has been a very vigorous economy, is continuing fairly strong  As far as the agricultural sector is concerned, while I do agree with Jerry that the agricultural sector has great resiliency, in talking to the farmers and [others] and also as a result of a quarterly agricultural farm survey that we conduct, we find that the foreclosures or the estimates of near foreclosures, which include substantial sales of assets in order to provide liquidity to the producer, are increasing or expected to increase rather dramatically in our area One other thing we hear from farm credit people as well as bankers is that they are very conscious of [the desirability of] not putting very much foreclosed farm real estate onto the market because the market is already depressed in value by some 25 percent from a year ago They are going to hold that farm real estate in some fashion rather than flood the market with it, which would push values and prices down [further], thus jeopardizing the collateral on outstanding agricultural loans The bright spot in agriculture is the red meat area; hogs and cattle, for example, both are in the black as far as profits are concerned So there is some hope   Nancy, I'm not sure I can identify all that goes into that glimmer of hope But the fact that interest rates are lower certainly has to be an important factor There is obviously some broad anticipation of a further drop in interest rates I'd just suggest that without a further drop or with some backing up I think that glimmer of hope could vanish immediately It would not only go away but that would worsen the potential outlook   Thank you, Mr Chairman I agree with those who have already suggested that we must find an appropriate interest rate level that will further our economic recovery I'm not sure that  -22-    11/16/82  9-1/2 percent isn't it, but it certainly hasn't given a good signal yet that it is the appropriate level That implies to me that we ought to move interest rates to a modestly lower level, and that lower level is, I suppose, something this Committee should decide All the talk about targeting reserves and looking at M2 for some informational content as to what policy should be I think is a bunch of baloney in the sense that we are targeting interest rates And we ought to recognize that In that context, I think there are a couple of ways to go First of all, let me say that I am not suggesting that we do away with or abandon the regime of targeting reserves and money supply, at least for public consumption But around this table it seems clear to me that [we are on] an interest rate regime and we ought to target on the interest rate we think is appropriate to get the economic recovery started again Having said that--   I agree that we have to be concerned about--   Well, notwithstanding growth of the aggregates, I would propose that some lower interest rate is necessary to trigger the recovery The way to get there is what this Committee has to deal with Others have suggested alternative A and that has some attractiveness to me But there are a couple of ways to engineer lower interest rates in the intermeeting period And I would prefer doing it by adopting ""B"" and having an initial borrowing level below that suggested in the Bluebook, which was $350 million I would make it $250 million or maybe $300 million, thus setting the reserve path in such a way that we would get a fairly immediate drop in interest rates; and coupled with a discount rate decrease, that would bring the funds rate to the 9 percent area The reason I'm not terribly attracted to ""A"" is that, if I understand the Bluebook projections correctly, ""A"" [contemplates] about an 8-1/2 percent fed funds rate in the intermeeting period That's a full percentage point decrease in a five-week period That may be a little quicker than I'd like to see happen I'd like to go down gingerly and see what happens so that we could continue a downward trend And thus, I would opt for ""B"" with a lower initial borrowing level as the prescription   In that connection, I think the question is whether we continue to do what we say we have done, which is to follow the [market] rate down, or whether this is an appropriate time to [lead] by moving the discount rate down   If we had some assurance that there will be a discount rate decrease, I would agree to a little higher borrowing level for the intermeeting period   I don't agree with those who say that releasing the directive will avoid the leaks I agree with those who say that it might even increase speculation But I'm a bit troubled with the proposal that we release the directive early, based upon the fact that we think we had a leak after the last meeting I don't think that we could control leaks by releasing the directive immediately after a meeting I think the issue that has given rise to the discussion today can't be cured by an early release I'd also add a detail  -65-    11/16/82  That we don't know how we are going to operate in the future and how that directive might look and how we might have to move one way or the other in the intermeeting period As a result of that, it seems to me to be paramount that we maintain that kind of flexibility If we can't control the leak problem by early release, then I would adopt a motto that has been used by others in the past and that is ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" I would continue to do what we are doing, since we can't control the leak problem in my view, and I would not opt for early release   I'm just making the point that I don't think we would cure it by early release--   --so why try to cure something we can't cure?   There have been a lot of other instances I remember when Dr Burns was Chairman that we did have a leak or a suspected leak, and certain members of the staff were excluded for, I think, two meetings "
2223,1982-12-20," I would just note that we had a discussion at our board meeting about this very problem, the take and pay contract I think the [bulk] of that is the take and pay contracts, or at least 10-year contracts that were entered into by the pipelines or other suppliers The interesting part is the fact that take or pay means that they pay if they don't take but they also have that gas available to them sometime in the future, so they're putting it on their balance sheet In a sense, there should be a time when these take and pays are either altered or they just run out There is a supply of gas that is already paid for in these pipelines that sometime out in the 1985-86 period will perhaps bring gas prices to a much lower level than is now being paid for gas   Well, they are just building up an asset, that's all In other words, if they don't take it, they have to pay for it but it comes to them later   Thank you, Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman Lyle has said very much what I wanted to say; I may just go at it in a little different way I agree with those, however, who say that we shouldn't bury M1 totally We ought to keep it in the background It has served us very well politically in the past Perhaps it could again It may have some informational content, as everything settles down, that we will want to use in the future As a result the fact that we merely set it aside for some period of time to be looked at again is important Lyle has made the point that I wanted to make with regard to the interest rate volatility of the proposal made in the paper, using what I think is the only reasonable variable to guide us in the future, and that is M2 We'll have to pay more attention to interest rates and thus perhaps build in an interest rate target, whether we publish it or not, that constrains some [rate] movements  I would just ask a question of Steve or others with regard to M2 It looks to be very stable on a quarterly basis, but if you look at it on a monthly basis, just taking this year as an example, it has ranged from about 44 percent growth in February and what would be 45 percent in December, if we hit that [estimate], up to about 14 percent In about 6 months of that period it was above 10 percent and [in the other] 6 months it was below 10 percent The question that I  -25-    12/20-21/82  would pose to Peter or Steve is this How does the Desk propose to operate without some interest rate constraints? I'm saying, as Lyle has just said, that we have to pay more attention to interest rates; I don't understand how the Desk would accommodate either an increase or a decrease in the nonborrowed path for the purpose of trying to adjust [operations] in an intermeeting period on [the basis of] a directive given to the Desk following the meeting   But you're going to expand that when you go to the shadow type of reserve requirement--the 3 percent as opposed to the 2 percent?   Well, my point is the one that Lyle made This Committee should pay attention to interest rate movements, if we're going to target on M2 as suggested by the paper, using a 3 percent shadow reserve requirement Interest rates have to be more important to the intermeeting operations of the Desk   Isn't it true that if we had been following this for the last six months, we would have had interest rates moving up in a period of time, say, in the fall--September, for example--when that would not have served the Committee's purpose well?   Well, I guess that makes the point that I want to make That being flexible with respect to the interest rate range that I think should be established by the Committee at this meeting is an important ingredient of targeting M2 in the period ahead    12/20-21/82   The maximum exposure would be $250 million, roughly?   At current prices?   Whatever the volume of it   Steve, may I follow up on Bob's question? You were talking about 8 percent as the basic growth for M2 and you are looking at 9-1/2 or perhaps 9-1/2 to 10 percent to go into the directive And you're thinking of a 3 percentage point shift Those numbers don't work out   At this level aren't we at or below the frictional level [of borrowing]? As a result wouldn't we have lost the advantage of the path and what it might imply?   With the level of excess reserves that the banks want to hold, if that continues, this has some implication it seems to me for the federal funds rate in the period ahead Is that right?   Mr Chairman, I'd like to raise a question about 8 percent for M3, given the performance of M3 over the past two quarters and what is estimated in the first 2 months of the fourth quarter It isn't clear why 8 percent is a magic number for M3 It looks to me as if it may be somewhat restrictive   For the year and for October-November it is over 9 percent   So, you're anticipating that that trend will continue for the next 3 months I don't understand on what basis you make that projection   There's a real possibility that bank credit will grow simply because of these new money market funds Funds are being attracted at 10 percent They don't have any loan demand; they are going to have to put those funds to work in some way  -90-    12/20-21/82   That's right They're going to have to make some loans because the only rate that can give them any spread is either on commercial or consumer loans "
2246,1983-01-14, The same is true in Kansas City 
2260,1983-01-21, We could indicate that we don't believe that 32 percent if the discount rate were lowered 
2275,1983-02-08," Yes, but lumber prices are going down   Mr Chairman, I just want to raise a question to perhaps lay a base or understanding for future discussions If I understand the assumptions underlying the staff's forecast, an 8 percent M2 growth after the first quarter translates into your figure of 88 percent M2 growth for 1983 Is that correct?   Yes   Not yet   Well, I may not have anything to say that hasn't already been said If so, I'll just repeat what has already been said I would join those who would retain the aggregates targeting because, first of all, I don't think we have any choice Legally, I think we're obliged to do so and it's a question of which aggregates we select My own preference would be to target Ml, M2, and M3, and adopt the debt aggregate My purpose is twofold I think Frank Morris said it very well They may not be used in our implementation process in the immediate period ahead, but they have served us very well as a political shelter And that wheel is going to turn back around and we're going to need them again To abandon them now or to dilute them in importance would be a mistake for the future, as far as the public's perception is concerned I am concerned, however, about the recovery and that we ensure that the recovery takes place I again agree with Frank that this Committee should look through the aggregates to ensure that recovery does take place fairly early in this year I hope that's the case, at least What reinforces my feeling of targeting the aggregates is the fact that the markets are used to looking at them and if we fuzz them up too much without any historical connection with what we've done in the past, we're building uncertainty in the markets The risk of delayed recovery that I believe is out there is enhanced as a result This is beyond where you want to go at the moment, Mr Chairman, but I would set these target ranges in such a way that they can be easily equated to what we have said and have tried to do in the past and move to the lower levels It bothers me a bit when we talk about a 9 to 13 percent    2/8-9/83  range for M2, for example, and not talk about the 6 to 9 percent range   One alternative to that, of course, because of the historical significance of the fourth-quarter base is to use that base and for the purpose of your testimony use the underlying growth rate that is assumed and adjust that by the shifts as we go through the year   I understand that But the other numbers don't make any more sense, particularly for the Committee setting its targets And the fact that we're pursuing the course that's consistent with what we've done in the past is probably the most important message that this Committee could deliver to the public and to the markets in the period ahead   I'd just like to follow up by saying that I'd rather fuzz up the adjustment than I would the basic underlying growth rate we're shooting for And I'd assume the 8 percent   Well, the historical connection is what I think would be important to the markets   Absolutely   Yes   I think that's attractive   Does what you just said imply that if velocity returns to some normal pattern based upon historical experience, we'll go back to targeting Ml as the single aggregate as we did at some time earlier?   Primary is right I think I would oppose getting back--   We were also working against inflation then and were all willing to see Ml run low to try to achieve lower prices   My point is that if this is taken to mean that if the one condition is met--that velocity returns to some normal pattern--   --a predictable or historical pattern--then Ml assumes some importance, as I think it did before, then I think some additional language might be appropriate In fact, I rather like Chuck's language of emphasis rather than characterizing it as is done here in this sentence   Well, I'm not sure I understand what you've done to this language If we retain the language consistent with the current degree of restraint, that suggests that there isn't any flexibility for easing and achieving a discount rate decrease, for  -83-    2/8-9/83  example, because we would provide reserves in such a way as to maintain the current interest rate levels unless we saw the aggregates coming in much, much slower or at least slower than now That seems to me in the period ahead to be somewhat unlikely to any appreciable extent I come out on the side of wanting to ensure recovery and thus, although [a discount rate action] is the Board's prerogative, wanting to see some additional downward movement in short-term rates to ensure that   Yes, indeed it is I'd like to see language that would permit us, without regard to what the aggregates do, in some period ahead when a window comes open again to move rates to a somewhat lower level, whether it be 50 basis points-- It doesn't sound like much, but it has a psychological impact   Leave open the possibility; that's correct   It seems the only thing that we can control at the moment is interest rates Our biggest objective, as far as I'm concerned, is to ensure a recovery And if we're all hung up on waiting for the aggregates to show us some diminution in their growth, then we've given up the only thing we can do to aid the economy   I think that's correct And I'd maybe not put any language in that suggests that we'll continue this restraint until    2/8-9/83  we see the aggregates growing at some lower rate, because that also would--   Yes, I think that's right   I would go one step further and suggest that we do want to cut the rates without regard to the aggregates because we have no control over those Our focus should be on the economy and the recovery I, at least, would have cut the discount rate two to three weeks ago But the Board didn't   Well, I understand that point   But we're only talking about between now and the end of March   That doesn't really satisfy the objective that I have because we would have to wait for this evidence to come forth I agree with Lyle that 50 basis points isn't going to make a lot of difference except for the psychological impact that that 50 basis points may have in the market And we need it now, not at the end of March   That's a risk I'm just saying the risk is on the up side   And we can do that by our borrowing level   Go to less than $200 million   No   I just have a question for Peter How will you interpret the language we've just adopted here with respect to the current level of restraint when borrowings have been at $110 to $150 million in the last two weeks? Are we talking about a $200 million borrowing level or are we talking about a $150 million borrowing level? Maybe it's a question to you, Mr Chairman   But the current level of restraint is something less than that, as evidenced by the borrowing level "
2301,1983-03-28," Are we talking about the swap arrangements or the Desk operations?   Okay   Yes, but on the swap agreements the Desk has to have prior authorization from the Committee to activate a swap   Do we get the discount rate plus 2 percent on that overdraft?   Absent some change of policy by the Treasury, though, we're not going to use that $500 million on the yen, are we? We're not going to do it unilaterally?   Well, if that's the purpose of your discussion, I join you   They may be in a danger zone right now  SPEAKER(?) That's before reserve adjustments   Well, I'm not sure I'm going to respond to that; I don't want to make a markedly different case I just would like to observe perhaps the obvious that has already been touched on What we have seen and have described as a recovery is largely driven by the two interest-sensitive sectors of our economy, autos and housing And to the extent that interest rates move up appreciably from this level, that quite likely could kill off the recovery In other words, the recovery that's being projected is very fragile I just note that one of the comments made concerning the outlook was that [the staff] expects business spending on equipment and exports to increase to sustain this recovery, and each of those areas is as fragile or as uncertain as anything we can tie it to I really think this is a very fragile recovery There's no question of recovery, but [in] autos and housing it's the rundown of inventories that has made the numbers look pretty good in the last 2 months or perhaps 3 months That can go away pretty quickly with any increase in rates--maybe even to the levels that we're now experiencing The reported increase in the fed funds rate, for example, and the upward pressure that may exert--the prime could go up--could be very devastating in my view to this recovery   I don't know what the credit card growth is, but another possible explanation is that the credit card companies all are charging on a day-of-purchase basis an interest rate something between 18 and 22 percent that makes the cost of holding cash much less at these current interest rates   You're just substituting cash for credit card purchasing   Thank you, Mr Chairman It probably will not come as any surprise that I would join those who would not want to see interest rates rise any further For clarity purposes, because of the statement I made yesterday, I would agree generally with the staff's forecast Then turning to the percentage chance that it's right or wrong, I think the risk is on the down side rather than on the up side That's particularly true in view of the experience we've had with two recessions in the last 3 years I think we would be taking a very great risk if we [slow] this recovery down so that the psychological impact on the public is such as to perhaps push us into another recession So, I think the risk is on the down side Thus, I would opt for a policy that would ensure that we would not increase interest rates above the present level Just as a guide, I would think that anything in the range of 9 percent or over in the federal funds rate increases that risk very measurably and we should not take that risk I should also say that if you believe in the staff's forecast in the Bluebook, for those who are interested in returning to the targeted ranges of the aggregates that were established for the year as a whole, you will find that alternative B would return both M2  -54-    3/28-29/83  and M3 to within those ranges by midyear And for M3 I bet it would be before that I think that's a pretty good track record, considering the uncertainty that we're facing today With regard to the directive, I would like to move back to the targeting of the aggregates sometime in the future And I would just observe that what we're doing today is setting policy for the second quarter as a whole and that this directive will not become public until after the next meeting As a result, it seems to me that alternative II as a directive would be an appropriate policy   It would be an appropriate policy I would opt for alternative B--for aggregate targeting and a move to alternative II I would keep the first parenthetical phrase To emphasize my feeling about interest rates and that they not move up, I would even opt for a 5 to 9 percent federal funds rate range to ensure that the rate doesn't go above 9 percent, although I don't think that's necessary if there's some reasonable agreement around the table as to what policy should be with respect to interest rates going up On the point about how the market will react to higher interest rates, it seems to me that the earlier episode in which the market reacted to a little snugging up if you will, in which long rates came down and short rates went up, reestablished the Fed's credibility with regard to inflation I don't think we ought to do it again [Laughter] So, I would opt for alternative B with a borrowing level at $200 to $250 million, simply based upon the history of the last 5 weeks of borrowing A level of $200 million would be acceptable; $250 million would be acceptable To go above that, I think we would be holding the funds rate in the 8-3/4 percent or above range, and I'd feel uncomfortable about that   You have discarded the first parenthetical sentence in alternative II and you have tried to incorporate an additional sentence But wouldn't it be better to keep that first parenthetical sentence simply to maintain flexibility because of the uncertainty we're looking at in the aggregates?   That brings it up and highlights the uncertainty and grants to the Committee and to the Desk the flexibility that we may need in this period, which is a full quarter   The fact of the matter is that the only real purpose this directive is going to serve is for public consumption If I understand what the Chairman said earlier, we're not going to change our operating regime in the intermeeting period and I think that's appropriate This is going to become public on May 25 or some such date And to the extent that we have done something that deviated from what we think we're doing today and from what we hope will happen in the period ahead, then the flexibility that's built into the statement requires less explanation after it becomes public That's my only point   I agree "
2319,1983-04-29," Mr Chairman, Roger Guffey I would like to join Tony for some of the same reasons, but I would restate some reasons that I have put to the Committee before It seems to me that we should take advantage of a ""window"" to move interest rates a bit lower in the period ahead, and the window may be within the next couple of weeks Even if it's a mistake, as suggested by Chuck, I'm more concerned at the moment that we do indeed continue the recovery than I am with the fear that there is a possibility for some fairly strong growth in the aggregates in the second quarter "
2338,1983-05-24," Jerry, part of your forecast beyond the second quarter is premised on the weakness of the dollar What kind of factors are you taking into consideration to project that the dollar will indeed weaken later in 1983 and 1984?   I'd just like to complete a thought that led to the question to Jerry with regard to the dollar There is a potential that we will have just an inventory liquidation/consumer spending recovery without the capital expenditures coming on stream Traditionally, I understand, those have been very short cycles With the [possibility] that there isn't any strength that might come from exports, I just want to raise a note of caution about all the euphoria and the good numbers that have come out in the last 30 days The potential for this being an inventory liquidation/consumer spending recovery that lasts only through the third or fourth quarter perhaps is a real potential I don't think we should become all that euphoric yet that this is a sustainable recovery through 1984 I'm a little concerned and not as sanguine about the numbers that we've seen   Mr Chairman, I take alternative B with a $250 million borrowing level as being maintenance of the current conditions And although I recognize the concern of some about Ml, it seems clear, at least to me, that the informational content of Ml gives very little guidance for policy in the period ahead That does not suggest that I want to join Frank Morris to bury Ml; rather, I think it will become an important guide sometime in the future, but certainly not between now and July Having said that, I still have a concern about the sustainability of this recovery over the long haul and I think the international situation suggests somewhat lower interest rates Neither of those [considerations] seems to me to be persuasive enough to ease in the period ahead Thus, I come out with a $250 million borrowing level from now until July and I hope that we get some more good news that we can react to in July I'd like to say that I have some real questions about what kind of directive we may adopt, but I guess that's for later in this discussion   Mr Chairman, I would object to a directive that would get the funds rate in the 9 percent range I'd go to 8-3/4 percent maybe--ranging above and below 8-3/4 percent That's a pretty small range, obviously But when it touches 9 percent, there is some magic to it, it seems to me, particularly if it touches 9 percent and remains there for any period of time  -32-    5/24/83   There was a time when we used to do it in 1/8 point [increments], Bill, as you may remember   Then what's the point in doing it?   I'd certainly hate to go to Williamsburg after snugging up!   It seems to me we may be taking a risk reacting to the May Ml figures If we look at the pattern of April at minus 3 percent and May at 24 percent and June projected--whether right or wrong--at only less than 5 percent, we're talking about snugging up in reaction to one month of very high Ml numbers And we're not certain of what they mean   Well, looking at the projection, I see [Ml growth of] 47 percent for June  -38-    5/24/83   But it is coming down   But we also had an inflation rate of 7 percent in the CPI in March of '75 In other words, we were then starting at an inflation rate that was much higher than where we are in this recovery   Aren't you elevating Ml to a target again?   Is this upsetting to you?   But in part of that period the funds rate was 9 percent or thereabouts   The alternative is what appears ""the existing degree of restraint""   And if $350 million is what we have, I think that's a little high The existing degree of restraint is what we have and what we maintain   To be clear, Mr Chairman, I would join Tony Solomon in opting for alternative II and lifting the bracketed language out of alternative I with respect to the downside risk on M2 and M3 It seems to me we're really adopting a money market conditions directive and the initial borrowing level is the important factor If that's $350 million, that's consistent with what we've had in the past And I don't see any reason to include language in a directive that will be made public after the next meeting, 6 weeks from now, which says we're going to snug up slightly or we're going to have slightly greater restraint or any other such language I don't see where we [gain] anything from it It seems to me that $300 million or the $250 to $350 million range of borrowing is what we ought to be focusing on without any language about snugging up Alternative II, with the lifting of the language on the down side, seems to me to do that And it doesn't elevate Ml to some target level for the Desk to shoot at   May I ask you, Mr Chairman, what you believe to be the advantages of making public 5 or 6 weeks from now the language ""to increase slightly the degree of restraint""? What advantage enures to the System by publishing that language after the next meeting?   Well, I don't tend to agree with you, obviously   On the other hand, you've also incorporated in this that we want to increase interest rates, or restraint if you will, because the economy has just come out of an episode where we had two recessions in three years  -50-    5/24/83   What level of borrowing are we talking about?   Well, I thought that you had assumed before that that's the existing degree of restraint   Then the statement is dishonest in the sense that we are not going to snug   Why put in that last part about deceleration of Ml? That again is raising its importance   No it isn't   Mr Chairman, I would go for $350 million if we're talking about a [funds rate] level of approximately 8-3/4 percent   I understand, but I--   We can operate policy so it won't go to 9 percent in the intermeeting period if that's the consensus of this Committee "
2354,1983-06-23," What's the implication for the funds rate?   Mr Chairman, Roger Guffey Do I understand that what you plan to show publicly is that the Committee met and confirmed the slight firming that has already taken place?   What has already happened? "
2373,1983-07-12," I'd prefer to go down on both ends; there's some comfort in using the [wider] ranges   Mr Chairman, I'm starting from the point that I'd like to preserve M1 for some time when it becomes more important informationally But this discussion has just reinforced my view that we shouldn't rebase at the moment We shouldn't be talking about 5 to 9 percent or anything else because it gives much more credence to those numbers than anybody around this table is able to assign to them, at least by a consensus And thus it seems to me that we should drop back and use the 7 to 11 percent, which recognizes that we had an overshoot in the first half that we can't explain and we don't know what is going to happen in the second half An 11 percent top suggests to anybody who chooses to figure it out--and the monetarists and market people or others will do so--about a 6-1/2 increase for the remainder of this year And in view of the uncertainty, that isn't unreasonable As a result, I would go to the 7 to 11 percent now without rebasing and maybe talk about it sometime in the future And [for 1984] I'd go to 4 to 8 percent, which we established in February of this year, in view of the uncertainty The uncertainty still exists for 1984 and we will have the opportunity to change it in February of 1984 The result, it seems to me, is that we're according less precision to M1 and it's more attuned to the discussion we just had around this table Nobody knows So, why should we elevate it by changing it and assigning some precision to it, even with all the language that you suggested that if velocity increases at the historical rate or if it's at zero--?   To be sure, the uncertainty involved is velocity and its relationship to income But to do the things we are talking about--one rebasing it and then establishing a 5 to 9 percent range and trying to explain it for the remainder of 1983--seems to me to be elevating it beyond the point that I'd like to see   Well, as I've just suggested, in February we established a 4 to 8 percent range, describing some uncertainty And the report to Congress had nominal GNP of [7-1/4] to 11-1/4 percent  -50-    7/12-13/83   9 percent, roughly   Therefore, it gives the background of saying that we'll just reestablish the 4 to 8 percent because we don't know what will happen and we'll look at it [again] in February   Rebasing suggests that we know more about what M1 is going to do in the future than I think anybody around the table is willing to admit   It seems to me that the market would suggest that M1 is going to become a greater focus of policy implementation And I'm not prepared at this moment to start looking at Ml as a policy guide because I don't think we know what is going to happen in the period ahead any more than we knew what would happen or how we can explain what happened in the last six months or nine months  -52-    7/12-13/83   I'd just like to clarify that point I would not want to ignore Ml totally and not set any targets at all because I think M1 has served us very well, both politically and economically in the past and it will need to do so in the future I wouldn't want to move totally away from it I'd like to preserve it   But then when we move back to it, it will be the sole target as far as the markets are concerned If we eliminate it and then reinstitute it when we think it has some validity again, then the markets are going to pick it up as being the sole target for monetary policy And in my view it shouldn't have been totally the guide in the past and shouldn't be in the future Again, I think you're according it something that I would not be prepared to do   The other approach, though, provides some flexibility to us in the period ahead when the uncertainty is still at a very high level   Well, 7 to 11 percent puts some restraint on M1 over the last half of the year   That's a quarterly average?   Mr Chairman, I would like to ask Steve, in response to Tony's question If we select alternative A, what kind of borrowing level in your judgment would give us a funds rate someplace between 9-1/4 to 9-1/2 percent?   Between $600 and $700 million would you say?   I would join that view for a borrowing level of $700 million or thereabouts That suggests to me that we validate what has happened in the past; a funds rate roughly in the 9-1/8 to 9-1/4 percent range with a potential high of 9-1/2 percent might fall out of the $700 million borrowing level I would oppose going much higher than the $700 million at this point   We're still on the short-run directive?   I have a question about putting in the bracketed sentence I don't know that it adds anything and I would opt to remove it   I don't know that it does, Tony We can operate policy and this is a record that is essentially meaningless when it's released   I guess my point is that, at the time this record is released, that's a meaningless expression   6 to 10   I'd just like to ask When you are talking about $600 to $800 million and $300 to $400 million, I assume you are  -78-    7/12-13/83  looking at $700 million [on borrowing] with about $350 million on net borrowed Is that at least the way we start in theory?   I would prefer doing that and coupling it with going to 7 to 11 percent for this year and thus not building any certainty on the Ml target   Assuming rebasing?   For '83 and '84?   There's a potential rebasing every year "
2400,1983-08-23," I'd like to step back You spoke of next year's rates [In the Bluebook appendix] an increase in rates is shown in the fourth quarter, which I assume is built into your Greenbook forecast Can you comment on the background of that assumption?   I'll wait   Just to follow up on that comment Our people had [forecast] an increase in food prices in 1984 of about 5 to 6 percent until this drought really hit the corn and small grain crops; now they've moved it up to 7 percent or a little over And the reason the rise is only that modest is the fact that in the early part of 1984 there will be a liquidation of red meat [animals], both hogs and cattle As a result there will be a depressed meat price and the impact on food prices won't occur until later in 1984 So, the yearly contribution to inflation [from the food] price increase will be modest--in the 7 percent range But by the end of 1984 quite likely we'll see food prices rising much more rapidly than 7 percent   As somebody observed, the PIK program was ill devised but what they also missed was Mother Nature being a participant in it It essentially has been much more effective in bringing down the excess stocks of corn and other crops that normally would be harvested in the fall than anybody ever imagined   I would agree   I would just change the focus a little It isn't clear to me what establishment of a borrowing figure by this Committee really means We've been operating on nonborrowed reserves or net borrowed reserves It appears to me that what we're doing is simply pegging the funds rate at some level and turning over to the Desk and in a sense to you, Mr Chairman, where that funds rate will rest on a week-to-week basis I guess I'm raising a question on the operational procedures that are being followed If we're following a regime of merely pegging the funds rate, then establishing a borrowing level isn't very meaningful because it all cues off of what Peter and Steve believe will give us a 9-1/2 percent funds rate And then it is  -22-    8/23/83  adjusted from there depending on, I guess, their judgment and the Chairman's judgment   Well, to illustrate the point, the fact is that the funds rate ran up in the last two weeks; it then came back down, to be sure It may have been affected by technical considerations of the [Treasury] refunding and other things But as a member of this Committee, I have a very difficult time saying that $700 to $900 million is the right borrowing figure when it is meaningless after the first day, if you will, after the paths are built I'd rather talk about some appropriate funds rate   When borrowing ran at the $900 to $1 billion level, we did not follow the regime of earlier days by adjusting the nonborrowed reserve path   [Unintelligible] and then you accommodate that borrowing   Yes, I am   But those weeks have followed one after the other; that is my point It's not just one week in isolation   Well, you try to hit a net borrowed reserve figure that will give you a [particular] funds rate, though, if I understand the way you've been operating most recently   That's correct   And this implies a funds rate of around 9-1/2 percent?   Or a little less [Laughter] "
2415,1983-09-08," What are you proposing, Mr Chairman a lower borrowing level to achieve a bit of easing? "
2428,1983-10-04," Thank you, Mr Chairman The report in the Tenth District is not unlike others that have been given around the table That is, retail sales have remained fairly vigorous; the agricultural sector is under some pressure although I would note that in our District it involves only the corn and soybean crops whereas wheat has not been affected since it was harvested before the drought really hit On the other hand, the PIK program has maintained liquidity within the financial system that finances the agricultural sector Perhaps the greatest impact would be on those suppliers to the agricultural sector--I'm talking about farm machinery and other manufacturers who are doing no business now and do not expect to into the next year Energy, mining, and housing, of course, are very much as has been described in other Districts  I was interested in Governor Gramley's comments because I agree that [the forecast] is almost too good to be true I disagree only with his last comment in that I think the risks may be on the down side instead of the up side I too would hate to see a lot of vigor show up in 1984 because it would present the problem that he described By the same token this forecast seems to me to be largely based upon two or three assumptions that consumer spending will remain very vigorous; that capital spending will come on very early in 1984; and, lastly, that the dollar will decline and thus improve somewhat the export market and our balance of trade problem We have seen the saving rate return to the 5 percent level; if that were to continue or go up to some level closer to historical experience, then I assume that consumer retail purchases would be muted somewhat Similarly, fixed investment may not come on It appears that there may be a change in the way companies plan their fixed investment That is, if I understand it correctly, it used to be that we would see fixed capital investment coming on [stream] at a utilization rate in the area of 80 to 85 percent It seems to me that [business executives] are much more cautious now, having come out of a three- year recessionary experience, and are not going to be as quick to make those capital commitments Lastly, as to the dollar, the staff--and I think everybody--has been expecting a dollar decline over the last year, and it really hasn't happened I just note that part of the forecast is based upon agricultural export levels that our people judge will not be achieved either in 1983 or 1984 They are looking at an annual export level of about $36-$37 billion in 1983 and I think the USDA just announced a figure of roughly $34-1/2 billion Now, that [difference] is not big in magnitude but for 1984 I think the staff is projecting an agricultural export number of about $40 billion and our people think that it likely would be in the $35 billion range or thereabouts And it is going in the wrong direction, which is one point that I want to make I like what I see but I would suggest that the risks may be on the down side rather than the up side I don't  -14-    10/4/83  think that suggests anything in terms of action by the Federal Open Market Committee at this meeting, but I'm not sure that all is as good as it may appear   It's not meaningful, I think, for this short intermeeting period but how would the markets read this directive if we say ""maintain the existing degree of restraint"" and have the accompanying language for [moving] up and down [from that], when they see after the next meeting that the quarterly targets at least for M2 and M3 were raised at this particular meeting and [we say] nothing happened   Well, they won't--   Well, to be sure, the two have gone up only 1/2 percentage point from the third quarter to the fourth quarter   But it [represents] some ease My question, and maybe somebody can answer it, is How would the market interpret that 30 days from now?   I think that's right Can we use the word ""sought"" in recent weeks instead of ""achieved""? That's exactly right; everything else would--   But the policy record can explain that   Really, it's not--   That's also consistent with what we would have done because of the way the aggregates came in from the--   What does that mean, Mr Chairman? Why set a range for borrowing at all?   It has no meaning It's not a constraint up or down We merely build the path on $650 million; I don't understand the range for the borrowing that we incorporated last time To me it's meaningless The policy that--   Well, you start out at the midpoint of the range and that's the only thing you really use until there's some consultation that suggests that the aggregates are coming in  -40-    10/4/83  differently [than expected] and then you drop the borrowing The last time we set the range at $700 to $900 million and then we went to $650 million And that wasn't a policy decision of this Committee; it was done in consultation with the Chairman Why set a range?   No, and that's my point If it doesn't have any implication for staying within the range, why set a range?   But only for M2 and M3?  -42-    10/4/83   I would come out on the side of being a bit asymmetrical in the sense of not reacting to higher growth of the aggregates during this upcoming intermeeting period simply because the projections indicate that we're going to be within the long-run ranges unless the aggregates just explode on us Then I think we'd have a conference call and do something about it The other point is that we do have a federal funds target range of 6 to 10 percent and we're in the upper part of that already And as a result, that range would not let us react to strong growth really as quickly as we could, it seems to me, if the aggregates came in somewhat lower So, I would not react aggressively on the up side, if at all, but I would be more inclined to react in this intermeeting period on the down side if we saw the aggregates coming in a lot lower "
2455,1983-11-14," We went through a similar exercise using the [MPS] model But the difference from what the staff has done in the baseline case is that we used Ml as the money growth rate We started with 6 percent for 1984 and dropped it 1 point per year for the next 3 years, using 5 percent for 1985, 4 percent for 1986, and 3 percent for 1987 and 1988 That does have some measurable effect on output in the sense that it's just marginally higher in 1984 but is roughly a percentage point higher in both 1985 and 1986 And it brings the inflation rate down to 1 percent at the end of the five-year period So, what we did was to use Ml, dropping it 1 percent a year for the next three years and then holding it stable at 3 percent And that does give a bit better inflation picture, bringing inflation down in the years 1985 and 1986 a bit faster than is shown in the staff    11/14-15/83  projection, as well as about a percentage point greater [GNP] growth in 1985 and 1986; it comes out to about the same in 1987 and 1988   That's right Faster growth in '85 and '86 and faster deceleration in the inflation rate in '86 and '87   I think we're using the same model   I'll have to turn to my staff   I think about 14 percent is close It may be the 18 percent that the staff is looking at   However, I think there is a difference in the unemployment rate because it drops in 1985 to 82 percent as opposed to your 86 percent and is 83 percent for 1986 as opposed to 84 percent And then it comes back to about your level in both 1987 and 1988    11/14-15/83   Well, it seems clear that that is our task to keep it from accelerating And that's what their model shows--the way we get it If in '84 and '85 we're going--   With the current monetary growth rate as your assumption for '84? Without any reduction in money growth?   Now, what about money growth?   As a matter of fact the wheat crop has received moisture and looks very good at this point Lots of things could happen between now and harvest, to be sure But if it comes forth as a good year, then we could be in trouble again in wheat   Mr Chairman, I think the Tenth District is sharing the general optimism about the recovery, particularly as it  -50-    11/14-15/83  relates to consumer retail sales Residential construction has picked up For commercial construction, on the other hand, it depends on what area of the District one is talking about The Denver area was in a boom for a number of years and is well overbuilt, and that's not a very vigorous sector But if you begin to disaggregate the basic industries or areas of economic activity in the Tenth District--if you look at energy, there has been some moderate upturn in the number of rotary rigs actually working But it is only modest, even though percentage-wise it looks pretty good It is maybe 40 percent greater than 8 to 10 months ago, but that was a very low base level from which they are working up Mining, on the other hand, particularly coal, is flat There is certainly no increased activity in the mining industry That whole industry hasn't begun to recover yet Commercial aircraft, which is a very big segment of our economic activity, is flat on its back, contrary to what John has reported about the Northwest There is no backlog of orders; as a matter of fact there are continuing cancellations of commercial jet aircraft orders The one bright spot is a military contract landed by the Lear Company down in Wichita and in Arizona, but that's just one blip on the horizon As for the rest, they are looking at a rather dismal outlook  With respect to the agricultural sector, you spoke of land prices As I think most of you around the table know, through this recession agricultural land prices fell somewhere between 15 and 21 or 22 percent, depending upon whether it was dry or irritigated land And those prices have not yet turned up As a matter of fact, the report that I've had is that there will be some continuation of foreclosure on farmers and ranchers as a result of their not being able to service their debt Although there's a good deal of optimism at the moment in the farm area over the PIK program, which has given them a cash flow so that some of them can service their debt, I think the observation is correct that without some improvement in the export market, there isn't a great deal of hope for substantial improvement in the period ahead  As to unemployment, it has been decreasing; one of the principal reasons is auto assembly, which is a fairly large segment of our economic activity Auto plants have put people back to work and as a result the unemployment rates have dropped dramatically in Missouri, as has been observed by Ted Roberts, as well as in Oklahoma where there are auto assembly plants With regard to the mainstream merchant in the agricultural area, it's a mixed bag In the agricultural chemical area, they have had a very good fall season and look forward to a good spring On the other hand, for the farm equipment manufacturers there's nothing going on in sales It's obvious that the ranchers or farmers are just not buying any additional equipment; they are not making any capital expenditures They're just sitting and waiting to see what will happen So, in summary, it seems to me that we're enjoying the benefits and the optimism of the consumer but the underlying support in the Tenth District isn't all that great   Thank you, Mr Chairman Well, I have some sympathy for those around the table who have spoken for returning to Ml, but not now I also have some sympathy for those who expressed the position that we will indeed face a period in the future when some additional tightening is needed, but I think not now I would come out very much as Tony has for retaining our current position with a borrowing level of about $650 million This may be the month to sit back and enjoy it Come next month, before Christmas, I believe we may be the grinch who takes away Christmas It may be appropriate to make a modest move, even in view of the international situation, in the upcoming month or two   There has also been quite an inflow into the S&Ls recently "
2486,1983-12-19," It seems to me, as has already been said around the table, that if we really are going to implement CRR and make it meaningful, we have to elevate Ml to the essential, intermediate target we follow I have two comments about that First, I do not believe the informational content in Ml relative to income is sufficient that I would be prepared to do that; and secondly, we're moving into a period where the commercial banks are learning how to operate under contemporaneous reserves and that uncertainty would suggest that at least for some period of time--maybe as much as six months--we would want to continue to operate very much as we have in the past We may want to run an experiment along the side to see what    12/19-20/83  would happen if we adjusted 25 or 50 percent But I would not run policy in the upcoming period--at least until July--given the uncertainty that falls out of CRR and the uncertainty that falls out of the relationship of Ml to the real economy As a result, I would propose that we not change operating procedures until we get a good deal more experience than what we will have on February 2   With regard to economic activity in the Tenth District, I think we've joined the national recovery certainly, with the exception of two major sectors agriculture and energy And both of those will take much longer to work out The agricultural situation will depend largely, I think, upon some drop of the dollar-- if and when that ever occurs--to encourage exports; and energy everybody knows about But by and large I think the view of businessmen and market makers in our part of the country is not euphoric but it is very strong as to the outlook six months or so hence In talking to those individuals, they are almost consumed with the federal budget deficit problem and the fact that the Federal Reserve is really the only player on the field and that inflationary expectations are just under the surface--whether they come from corporations and businesses taking the opportunity to try to increase their prices and hopefully make them stick or from wage pressures [The view is] that inflationary expectations could take hold and be a reality, particularly in the markets, unless the Federal Reserve is very visible  In general terms, we would expect the staff forecast to be the best of all worlds if it could be achieved But our best expectations are that growth will be somewhat faster in the first half of the year and then slow down toward the latter part of the year With regard to inflation, our projection would be higher than the staff's and as a result--this may be ahead of the discussion--I probably would join those who say a little snugging up now would serve us well in the future   Thank you, Mr Chairman I join those who would not want to make quantitative announcements as to 1985 But I also would like to see us maybe quantify the time that we're looking forward to moving toward price stability; I'm talking about a 5- or 6- year program with a gradual reduction over that period of time, yet accommodating what may be happening in the real economy It seems to me that we have since 1971 or 1972 continued to say that we are moving toward price stability by reducing the money supply gradually over time But there has never been a program set forth by this group that I know of in which people could look and find a result at the end or light at the end of the tunnel If we were talking in terms of a rather specific program in the sense of an horizon over which to reach price stability--whatever that may be, whether it's 1 or 2 percent or zero--then it seems to me that we could work into that kind of public discussion what the likely outcome would be if nothing is done about the budget deficit At this point to quantify targets for money growth for 1985 seems to me to be far in advance of anything we could predict But in a longer-term picture it's [quite] reasonable to assume that there will be less money growth in '85 than '84 by some amount  With regard to the 1984 ranges proposed in the Bluebook that were set tentatively in July, I have no problem with the Ml range of 4 to 8 percent As a matter of fact, I take a little comfort from that 4 percentage point spread in the range As for M2 and M3, I would probably opt to drop M2 to the same range of 6 to 9 percent [shown for M3] in the Bluebook My reason for that, as has been stated around the table before, is that it is inconsistent to have an M2 range that's greater than the M3 range And it's very difficult to explain that M3 is lower than M2 simply because we hope to fund some of the credit needs through Eurodollars, which also implies a continuing strength in the dollar and assumes further that European countries and other developed nations would continue to be operating at a very low rate of economic growth That is a picture that I think we can avoid, whether it be true or not, simply by making the M2 and M3 ranges consistent with each other And I would opt to have them at 6 to 9 percent   I'm told that the Russians have been very active in foreign exchange markets, acquiring dollars I'd just like to ask  -53-    12/19-20/83  Sam how much of the rise in the dollar value vis-a-vis the mark, for example, can be attributed to those apparently rather substantial activities by the Russians?   For purposes of this discussion, I would agree to adopting the ""B"" alternative as it appears in the Bluebook In view of the discussion and the feeling about the potential for some reemergence of price pressures, I would opt to snug up marginally or have some nuance or whatever it may be of [snugging] Rather than take a $650 million borrowing level, I'd go maybe to $750 million, which implies about 1/4 percent more [on the funds rate] than what we have been shooting at in the past If I understand what has been said around the table, particularly from Peter, the pressures that are coming on because of technical matters at year-end might move us to a funds rate of 9-1/2 percent or a bit above I am really suggesting that with a $750 million borrowing level we essentially would validate that level after the technical pressures subside and end up with something over 9-1/2 percent and certainly not greater than 9-3/4 percent It would, in my view, present a picture that the Federal Reserve has some concerns about the strength of the economy and the potential for a reemergence of price pressures   Just a matter of clarification When you make the statement--I'm paraphrasing--that if things go in one direction you have the finger on the trigger, are you talking about the aggregates or are you talking about economic activity? Or do you have to combine those two things before you pull the trigger?   So we are relying a little more heavily on the aggregates because-- "
2511,1984-01-30," Wishful thinking   Thank you, Mr Chairman I'd like first of all to ask a question, perhaps directed at Steve I notice that your seasonal adjustments and benchmark revisions bring the growth rate of M1 for the last 6 months of 1983 to 72 percent But I also note that using the experimental model that you have been tracking over the past year would drop M1 growth from 55 percent to 53 percent   Well, my point is that there's some uncertainty as to the seasonals with respect to our confidence level that M1 grew from the base period at 72 percent Would that be a correct statement?   By 1/2 percent or so   My only point in asking is that I'm uncertain what the growth rate of M1 has been over the last 6 months, which only adds to the concerns that I have There are lots of uncertainties, not the least of which is the strength in the economy that we may experience in the first half of 1984 and through the year And that is coupled with concern about the implementation of CRR and what will come about this week and for the period ahead I would just note in that regard that the last real big bust that we had in the money supply numbers was at a time when Manufacturers Hanover chose to change its reserve accounting computer program We missed by a very large amount and it took a while to figure out what caused it Now we have some 10,000 banks or so that are going to be dealing with CRR  Having said all that, I want to climb on the band wagon or the wagon that Lyle is leading to say that flexibility is perhaps the most important aspect of policy in the next 6 months as far as I'm concerned As a result, I would not elevate M1 to a target but rather would maintain it as a monitoring range With regard to the alternatives, I would select alternative II in the Bluebook with the  -28-    1/30-31/84  modification of moving the M2 range down another 1/2 point to a 6 to 9 percent range And if we maintained M1 as a monitoring range rather than a target, I would not object to seeing the M1 range moved down another 1/2 point to 4-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent, which is about half-way between the alternative I and II ranges for that particular aggregate   Well, that's just suggesting that if M1 returns to some historical relationship, we would not place as much weight on M2 and M3  -47-    1/30-31/84   I would prefer to leave ""more"" in   That's when M1 was described as being only a monitoring range   I'm sorry How would it read again?   This directive isn't adopted for that purpose It's for the public   That's correct   But is it important to put that in the directive--that you just described as evenhanded the understanding that I think is fairly consistent [with the views expressed] around the table that we would operate in such a way that it would take somewhat more evidence to tighten up?   Well, I think it is more important that we be fairly consistent with what we've done in the past And there is a nuance, if you will, by simply making it evenhanded now as opposed to the greater inclination for restraint that was in the immediately preceding directive So I think there is a nuance that can be read in it if we use evenhanded language   May I ask a technical question? At the end of the two week maintenance period will there be a carryover available? Will a 3 percent carryover for the first two weeks really amount to 6 percent on a weekly basis?   So, you could come to the end of the period and apply a 6 percent carryover factor the first two weeks and you could have very high excess reserves   Yes, I understand that But is there any carryover that applies to the first two weeks?   Is there a 3 percent carryover?   It's still the 2 percent?   But for the second week in the two-week period what's the carryover?   If we don't understand it, they won't understand it "
2538,1984-03-26," Bob Forrestal has raised a question that's troublesome to me also and that is restricting the number to four, which would mean I'd have to cut out the first vice president Under the by-laws, on all other things he operates in my stead when I'm gone, which is reasonably frequently To go through the process of sending a wire to add him on an ad hoc basis for some indeterminate time while I'm gone seems to me unreasonably burdensome I'd like to suggest that this be amended to permit four as designated and to permit the first vice president to have access without this special authorization at the time the president is not there As I say, he has all the powers that I have when I'm not present   Yes, that is true But the fact of the matter is that he stands in my stead and ought to be able to have the kinds of information that I would have if I were there That seems quite reasonable to me The only thing I'm suggesting is that there be a built-in ad hoc exception without the notification process for the first vice president at the time the president is not in the Bank    3/26-27/84   No, I'm not I'm talking otherwise   That's correct   Among other things, he has handled my board of directors for a discount rate action when I'm not there He certainly ought to have available to him what the Committee has done and what it is thinking about preceding that kind of action   Well, I'm suggesting that it remain four but that we have an ad hoc exemption without the clearance procedure   Yes, but only when I'm out of the Bank   Only when the president is not available It would seem to me to be a fairly simple matter   Yes, that's also true with regard to the upgraded [classification] of the wire from the Desk There is information there that would be helpful if there were going--   There's one other problem associated with this The way the Bluebook is sent, two copies come to our Bank that are put together in one package and we have to designate somebody in the Bank either Saturday night or Sunday to open that material and repackage it, with one going to Tom Davis and one to me If each were packaged separately with our name on it, we'd eliminate that   Will it print a blue cover? [Laughter]   Wasn't there a time, though, in the recent past when we used bankers acceptances when collateral was otherwise short?   But that's no longer present The market is mature; I don't see why we don't get out of it   When is that released--if ever?   How much of that Argentina debt resides in US banks and how much in non-US banks?   When the loans go nonperforming, what percentage do the banks have to charge off?   Is there any significance to the fire in your ashtray?   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Tenth District has enjoyed some of the strength that has been evident in the economy elsewhere There are two or three areas to mention, and I'll focus largely upon your question with respect to the agricultural sector As you know, we do a rather extensive quarterly agricultural survey of bank lending and the most recent one indicates that there is some stability felt among the bankers--stability in the sense that things are not getting worse and that they are manageable But there's a very long period of adjustment [ahead] for the agricultural sector In terms of specificity, they look to the projections for net farm income in 1984 that are now running some 50 percent greater than net farm income in 1983 Part of that is the PIK program that has come early in 1984 in which the sales have taken place of grain that has been shipped to the producers themselves So, some of that income has already taken place They have serviced the current debt and as a result the banks are feeling somewhat comfortable about the upcoming period But the point that I think should not be lost is that there is nothing on the horizon that they can see, absent a Russian grain deal or some other magnificent event, by which the agricultural situation is going to improve from this rather low stable level--in particular in the debt service area Farm liquidations were a very small percentage of farm holdings; that has gone up modestly There has been some voluntary liquidation--that is, encouragement by the lender to liquidate in order to service debt--but that again has stabilized I think you have to understand when you're talking about the agricultural community that, as Si indicated, January, February and March are times that they sit around the hot stove and talk about problems It's only when the sun begins to warm things up and the sap begins to rise that optimism comes back into that area There has been a pickup on Main Street of small ticket farm equipment sales but the large machinery sales are still very weak But there is some encouragement on the agricultural input side--I'm talking particularly of [sales of] chemicals and fertilizers, which have been very brisk In other words, the producers are anticipating large plantings this year and have the money to put into fertilizers and chemicals  Energy and mining are still very weak, particularly energy Just to give you a benchmark The last report that I have is that the number of oil rigs working in the Tenth District is 716; that's up from a low level of 574 a year ago contrasted with 1981 levels of about 1600 So, there is some modest exploration and production going on but it is indeed modest With respect to the general aviation sector, there is a good deal of optimism They are not producing but they think and still hope that production is going to increase in the latter part of the year In the commercial construction field, Denver is beginning to have an absorption rate of their overbuilt situation that looks very favorable Kansas City and Omaha have what might be characterized as a commercial construction boom In Kansas City there have been seven major downtown office buildings announced within the last 90 days and two or three of them have holes in the ground and are ready to come out That is in contrast to Tulsa and Oklahoma City, which essentially are overbuilt in the commercial area We have seen no real evidence of pressures in the area of wage increases  -39-    3/26-27/84   They are all in Dallas!   To join Tony, I have the same dilemma with respect to which of the alternatives to select if indeed a discount rate action may be forthcoming But the more important part as far as I am concerned is how the Desk would react to a discount rate increase and whether it would use the post-1979 operating regime or the post- 1982 regime In other words, the latter approach would involve adjusting the borrowing level in some measure to moderate the increase, if I understand [that regime] If we go with the post-1979 regime then we're going to get a one-for-one result--a half point discount rate increase produces a half point rise in the federal funds rate If we use the post-1982 practice, we moderate it by adjusting the borrowing level I think Steve appropriately raised this issue of whether it will be incorporated in some measure in the directive But some expression from the Desk or the Chairman as to how they would react to a discount rate increase is important to deciding whether to go with alternative A, B, or C   If I look at ""B,"" for example, it may be attractive to me at least in terms of a 10-1/4 percent or maybe 10-1/2 percent funds rate But if we get a discount rate increase on top of that and use the post-1979 procedures, that would get it up to 11 percent   I would select a ""B+"", which would be something with the following specifications 7 percent growth for M1; 8-1/2 percent for both M2 and M3; and a borrowing level of about $900 million And if there were a discount rate increase, I would suggest a drop in the borrowing level to about $700 million to accommodate some of that upward pressure on the funds rate   And that's consistent with the last two-week period?   Not if you've mentioned borrowing at $1 billion   And that's starting from the benchmark of accepting ""B"" with borrowing of a billion dollars and $600 million in excess reserves and someplace between 10-1/4 and 10-1/2 percent on the funds rate, as indicated in the Bluebook?   No, I'm talking about [the funds rate] without a discount rate [increase]   If you accept the commentary in the Bluebook, it's 10-1/4 percent with $1 billion borrowing and some possibility of--   Well, no I'm just trying to get a benchmark, though  -87-    3/26-27/84   I agree on the easing, but I guess I'm concerned about approaching that 11 percent rate--whether with $1 billion borrowing without a discount rate increase or some other level with a discount rate increase That 11 percent triggers some real concern   I would agree that 7 to 11 percent makes more sense It has never constrained us in the past   At 11 percent   That's right   Just to reinforce that, last week the rate was just about at 10 percent; it was 1004 percent And it has gone up this week if it comes out to 10-1/8 percent Now you're talking about 10-1/2 percent That's where you're going to get some--   As recently as two weeks ago it was at 9-3/4 percent   7 to 11   Well, that's misleading to begin with   It's misleading   ""As may be modified""   The sentence in parenthesis?   That's just an alteration of variant I "
2566,1984-05-21," Where do we stand on the debt limit legislation? Is that posing great problems for you?    5/21-22/84 -8-   Are they out of money?   In the Kansas City District I think it is probably more the Comptroller, and that's perceived to be a fallout of the Penn Square situation, which the Comptroller's people are so skittish about   On agricultural loans as well as energy loans But the perception, as I hear it, is that the Comptroller's staff is very, very tough   It's much higher   Thank you, Mr Chairman Over the last couple of weeks I've had an opportunity to meet with individuals involved in the energy sector--those in discovery and development as well as suppliers for that industry The story, simply told, is that there is some modest activity in drilling beginning to come back Just to cite some numbers At the height two years ago, late '81 to '82, there were around 46,000 rotor rigs working in the United States That dropped to 18,000 and is back up to about 22,000 The important part of it is that these were very, very large statistics in that industry It is clear that the price of putting a well down and bringing petroleum products for sale is now low enough that the numbers are beginning to work and it's beginning to be attractive again to go out into the field to discover and bring in energy products But the suppliers of that industry are still flat on their back Those who have survived are barely surviving They are concerned, of course, about higher interest rates because they have a very high carry of inventory to supply the industry  I also met with our Thrift Advisory Council They have a concern about the increase in interest rates that they have seen Most of them readily admit that they are on the margin of being profitable or nonprofitable, that the increase in interest rates quite likely will put them back in a nonprofitable position, and that they cannot survive for a very long period of time without help, merger, or something else unless interest rates come down a bit  Lastly, in the agricultural area, I have a couple of numbers that I'd like to cite because Pres has thrown a couple out As of the end of April, for example, 42 percent of all farmers and ranchers have gone out of business in the last six months, and that's 2-1/2 times what would be considered the normal rate That number is those who have gone out of business as a result of financial stress; the total who have gone out of business as a result of financial stress plus death and other normal things is about 6 percent of all ranchers and farmers This is as a result of the developments, essentially, within the first quarter of 1984 Another 54 percent of all ranchers and farmers have experienced partial liquidation because of financial stress, which has come about among other reasons because the land values dropped in the first quarter of 1984 The best information we have is that land values have dropped an additional 6 percent They are now on average about 22 percent below the peak of 1981 And that, of course, is the collateral by which much of the lending took place in the agricultural sector back in better times The important point, it seems to me, is that the agricultural banks that we survey and work with are liquid They just can't find creditworthy borrowers to take down that money Although they have money, they are not prepared to extend more money to the agricultural sector It seems clear to me in  -22-    5/21-22/84  talking with people in that industry that lower interest rates are not a solution to the agricultural problem That is, without an increase in commodity prices we're going to see the situation continue to deteriorate The fact of the matter is that the average rate to the agricultural sector now is about 14 percent That doesn't change greatly when rates go up or down in the financial markets So, we could drop that rate 3 or 4 percentage points and on the margin it would help certain farmers and ranchers But by and large it has to be an increase in commodity prices in the period ahead that will salvage this situation; interest rates are not the key to it  Turning to a couple of other industries In the aircraft industry, we have a number of very large participants in the Tenth District and they have had an uptick in their business As a matter of fact, Boeing and Buick both have announced plans to expand their facilities, largely in Wichita, Kansas The auto industry, which employs a large percentage of workers in the Tenth District, is going full out with a second shift   I would agree with what Tony has just stated; it is precisely what I had in mind I do have one question, however I know the federal funds rate isn't under our total control but I would have expected after the discount rate increase, when the fed funds rate was running about 10-1/4 percent, that the one half point increase [in the discount rate] would have put the funds rate at about 10-3/4 percent It has been running less, about 10-1/2 percent I would not object to seeing that rate around 10-3/4 percent at the present time I think that is consistent with what alternative B and a billion dollars of borrowing would imply I would ask the question of Peter or Steve if that is a correct perception   But that event would not be determined by interest rate levels necessarily   Well, that's my point The LDC problem is more directly affected by the interest rate movements   More so than is the Continental situation or another $1 billion or $40 billion bank problem   The only point I wanted to make is that the LDC problem has been with us and has been recognizable over the past two or three meetings, so the language proposed to go in the directive on recognizing the financial market stress has to be tied essentially to the Continental situation   I would agree with that, Tony, but the question of whether to put it in now just because of the events--   Is ""only"" in or out?   I don't have a vote, so it's all right "
2591,1984-07-16," Thank you, Mr Chairman I would leave the Ml, M2, and M3 ranges the same, but I would argue for increasing the debt range at this time to 9 to 12 percent It's not so much to make the argument for 1984, but I'd like to move on to 1983 and be able to reduce that in 1983 back to 8 to 11 percent   Pardon me, I mean 1985 I'd like to increase it in the last half of 1984 to 9 to 12 percent with the anticipation of showing a reduction for 1985 back to an 8 to 11 percent range It's more consistent It is only a monitoring aggregate at the moment, and we have had very little experience in this Committee with using the debt aggregate It seems quite logical to me that the Chairman can present the picture that with the merger situation there are uncertainties as to what the debt aggregate really means Because we're still monitoring it, one could make the case for increasing it now and dropping it in 1985--carrying through the idea of continuing to move down on all of the aggregates for 1985   No, I think not   Yes, I understand that But I would prefer, simply because we've had more experience with M3 and consistently have been over that targeted range in past years, to leave it as it is Because if we raise both of them, it seems to suggest to me that we have indeed turned the reins loose a bit and I would not want to give that view   Tony, I would just rebut that by saying it's a monitoring range now that we've had very little experience with We elevated M1 at the last meeting to a higher position, equal to M2 and M3 And we have not elevated the debt aggregate to that position As a result, if we're still experimenting with it, let's experiment with it by raising it to be somewhat more consistent, with the thought of  -23-    7/16-17/84  dropping it in the '85 presentment that the Chairman will make at the same time he talks about '84   It's simply a recognition of what has happened over the first 6 months   Did I understand that most of these are one-year contracts?   Thank you, Mr Chairman I also would opt for alternative II I'm puzzled, however, why there is a narrowing of the [M2] range to 2-1/2 points as opposed to 3 points and, as a result, I would alter alternative II to 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent [for M2] We also came out with 8-1/2 percent nominal for 1985 and alternative II may or may not be consistent with that; but I am persuaded by Tony's strategy, if you will, to do 1/2 point now and if it looks as if in February some other change could be made on the down side, then I would opt to do it then It leaves us some flexibility for movement in February   I would like to raise a question again about M2 Why narrow the range of M2? What's the impact and what's the purpose of that?  -46-    7/16-17/84   Well, neither can one envision it being below the other ranges It is a change that doesn't seem to net anything to me Why do it?   Really gutty, yes   Sure Keep the 3 percentage point range We have narrowed the M1 range; however, we come out to a 3 point range Why then would we take one additional step and narrow the M2 range? It makes no sense to me   Nor, I should think, would we want perhaps the 4 percent of M1   As analysts look at it, they will detect that there is an area of the range that they won't have an explanation for And we don't have an explanation for it, so why do it?   I also would go with what Jerry just characterized as the Solomon/Gramley version I have a concern about the uncertainty with respect to the $1 billion borrowing and its relationship to the current interest rate levels of 11 to 11-1/4 percent Because of that uncertainty, then, I would focus more upon that [funds rate] itself, whether that's fine-tuning--Chuck's terminology--or not We haven't had good evidence of a slowing of the [growth in the] economy yet, which I think all of us would like to see The market essentially has taken us there, but for policy purposes it would seem to me more appropriate to focus on a federal funds rate because of that uncertainty in the period ahead In other words, I would not let it go up or let it go down below the 11 percent level It also says to me that if that's the general consensus, there should not be a movement in the discount rate, which is on the table before the Board That's simply because if we follow the usual procedures, a 1/2 percentage point increase--if that were the number-- would imply a 1/2 point increase in the funds rate level, which I think would be quite inappropriate   I don't think I understand the rationale for the bias on the up side on rates We're talking about a 4-week period until the next meeting   We're at the 17th now and we're talking about an FOMC meeting on the 21st of August However many days that is, it isn't very many And the amount of information that will come in to suggest that we would push rates up from the present level further-- That's unconscionable in my view because we have had rates in the last 30 days go from the 10-1/2 to 10-3/4 percent range to 11-1/4 percent And to put a directive out that will be read 30 days from now that suggests that this Committee sat around and adopted an asymmetrical directive that suggests a bias toward further tightening when we talked about the LDC problems and we talked about the fragility in the financial markets makes no sense to me   We may be there now "
2619,1984-08-21," Thank you, Mr Chairman With respect to your question ""Is there more pessimism?"" I'd say things perhaps are more pessimistic in the Tenth District It's a very unbalanced recovery in the sense that in manufacturing, particularly auto assembly, aircraft, and other manufacturing, together with construction, things are going very well I don't know that there's been any damping of those sectors of the economy On the other hand, I'd just note that the good projection for inflation in the period ahead is tied largely to the energy and agricultural food sectors, which will have an effect of lowering the outlook for inflation In each of those cases--in the energy sector, for example, the dropping of oil prices and the dropping of natural gas prices will impact the discovery and extraction of petroleum products in the Tenth District rather dramatically There has been no increase in rig counts in the most recent time; it's fairly level and some ten to thirteen percent higher than it was April of '83, which was a low point in the rig count If energy prices fall further, we're quite likely to see that sector turn down again, and it's already in trouble At the same time, as all of you know and as has been recited around this table, the agricultural sector is in trouble and there is no prospect in the sense of exports or other factors that will raise commodity prices That's the salvation and the hope, [but] there is nothing out there As a matter of fact, there is a good crop assured at this point and that has a continuing depressing effect The one tangible number that I can recite to you is out of a survey of farm land prices; they have decreased another 2-1/2 percent in the second quarter of 1984 That has an impact, obviously, that rolls back into the financial system that we quite likely will see around the first quarter of 1985 I think we're talking about the thrifts, for example, and potentially a segment of our financial industry that supports the agricultural sector that could be in really serious trouble late this year or in the first quarter of 1985 Again, I don't think the interest rates in and of themselves hold out much hope Lower interest rates would help, to be sure, but that isn't what will extract the agricultural sector; it will be commodity prices, and nobody has any real hope that that will come to pass   Thank you, Mr Chairman I also would opt for the B alternative My concern is with the current federal funds level I would hate to see it go any higher and thus would maintain the 8 to 12 percent range But my real concern is What happens if Financial Corporation of America does indeed affect the financial markets and create a flight to quality and, as a result, the federal funds rate balloons far beyond the 12 percent? What is the proper response of the Federal Reserve under those circumstances? Do we try to keep the funds rate within the 8 to 12 percent range or at the top of that range? Or do we pour in reserves in order to liquify the financial system and in order to contain the damage that might be done by the Financial Corporation of America situation on top of Continental? I pose it in the form of a question What would be the proper response? How should this Committee and how should the Desk react to that? It seems to me there is more potential of that than of the fed funds rate falling rapidly and giving some indication to the market just before an election that we have eased I would keep the billion dollar level, to be sure, and the 8 to 12 percent range, but I pose as a question How should the Desk react if the Financial Corporation of America affects the funds rate and pushes it up far beyond the 12 percent for some period of time? I guess I'm posing that question to you, Mr Chairman, since you have daily contact with the Desk   Well, I still opt for ""B"" at the moment until we find out something different   And, therefore, you would react by providing substantially greater reserves   Dislocation   I find it strange under those conditions that we seem to be hitting the'targets not only on borrowed but on excess reserves I should think that excess reserves would be ballooning under these circumstances  -42-    8/21/84   I'm talking about the fact that there's a dislocation In other words, there's a reluctance in regional banks to sell to money center banks "
2644,1984-10-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman Focusing on our regional economy, it's not unlike what has been described in some other areas, particularly where there is a fairly dramatic division between urban and rural areas In the urban areas, retail sales have leveled off; the housing starts, not unlike what has already been described, are falling off somewhat On the other hand, commercial construction, particularly in Omaha, Kansas City, and Oklahoma City is booming It started late and it will continue on for another couple of years simply to complete the projects that are underway In the energy area, as Bob Boykin has indicated, there's been an uptick in rig count operations In Oklahoma, Colorado, and Wyoming, the numbers are reasonably substantial as a matter of fact   I think our numbers would reflect something modestly different from that; the uptick compared to a year ago would be somewhat greater than Bob has just described In auto production, they are working very near capacity on the auto assembly lines Aircraft, on the other hand, is almost a dead industry at the moment They can't sell aircraft, particularly business aircraft That is one of the things that businesses apparently defer and there's an overhang on the market of used aircraft And that's rather an important part of our industry in the Tenth District The agricultural scene is not unlike what already has been described It's bad now and the prospects of it getting better any time in the near future are not bright--non-existent as a matter of fact Russian grain sales are taking place now, but they're taking place in [the context of] an inventory overhang and as a result the prices do not reflect it nor does it pass through to the producer And that, of course, has a continued impact on the financial side; the agricultural banks are sort of hanging on The question is what they will do with collateral that supports those loans when the loans cannot be serviced--interest cannot be paid As a result the best estimate is that if there is a bottom to be reached, it won't be reached until perhaps the first quarter of 1985 The question of what will happen from now to then is uncertain But I think it should be important to this Committee to understand that unless we have a dramatic decrease in interest rates there will not be any salvation for the agricultural sector The current rates, or modestly lower rates, will not be an answer to the financial problems in the agricultural sector  With respect to the staff forecast, I would agree with Ed Boehne and others who have expressed the view that we ought to be happy with the slowdown As I look into the fourth quarter and particularly into 1985, I have some question about the staff forecast in that I think the economy will be somewhat weaker than they forecast In the numbers that they used, retail sales are very  -20-    10/2/84  important; auto sales, for example, are extremely important in 1985 The staff is looking at an 11 million unit rate for auto sales in 1985 The fourth quarter of 1985, for example, is in the area of 112 million--greater than any time in 1983 That suggests to me that if there is any retrenchment because of problems in the financial sector or otherwise, that forecast is more expansive than I would feel comfortable with With respect to the dollar's strength, it's anybody's guess But as it relates to inflation it would seem to me that so long as the dollar is strong imports are strong, and we could look at lesser real growth and lesser inflation and, thus, the forecast for nominal GNP in the period ending in the fourth quarter of 1985 would be somewhat less than the staff is projecting   Thank you, Mr Chairman Tony Solomon has stated a position that I would like to join, with just a modest change for maybe different reasons Rather than adopting ""B"" as proposed in the Bluebook at a 6 percent M1 level--and I'm not talking about either M2 or M3 or the federal funds range--I would prefer that the Committee adopt a shading toward ""C,"" to the 5-1/2 percent level, the same level we adopted for the third quarter In other words, as the record is published it would reflect that there has been no change in the objective of the Committee with respect to money growth The difference, obviously, is that we did not achieve 5-1/2 percent growth in the third quarter, but only 2 percent on a quarterly basis It would give us the latitude to move down My concern is, much as what has already been expressed, that the fed funds rate range have some flexibility in it but that within the next six weeks there not be any major move to a lower level I think the chance of moving to lower interest rate levels is quite likely consistent with the comments that I made earlier in that I don't believe that the economy is going to be quite as strong as the staff is forecasting for the fourth quarter I think we'll see some easing But for the record I would like to see us re-adopt the same money targets that we had in the third quarter and try to achieve that 5-1/2 percent growth for M1   Doesn't that appear in the sentence immediately above the start of the operating paragraph?   I would agree   Indeed That's a good suggestion "
2668,1984-11-07," I would like to inquire, Peter When did we drop the borrowing level from $750 to $700 million? I must tell you as a preface that I was surprised The first time I realized it was from the Bluebook, which I thought was a mistake; I went back to the daily wires and there was no indication that I could find that the borrowing level had been dropped   I think I went back over [the wires of] the last week   Well, I could be mistaken, but I don't think so   On the other side of Missouri--   But an important thin edge In the Tenth District there has been no improvement in those areas that I have expressed concern about before--principally agriculture, energy, and the aircraft manufacturing industry There are a couple of factors, however, that may influence the future One, in the agricultural sector, is the Administration's program that was announced a month or so ago for delaying or setting aside some of the debt of the producers That is now being put into place and they hope to have it operational by January 1 For your information, it involves among other things setting aside 25 percent of a producer's total debt up to $200,000 and delaying that for a period of 5 years with no interest and no payback It is a guarantee program also with respect to the commercial banks that are financing agriculture, if that comes about It's a pilot program in five states--Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Minnesota, and Iowa There is some mixed reaction from the agricultural sector, but it is something positive and they are trying to assess what the impact will be After it is in place in these five states, they expect to expand it nationwide  -17-    11/7/84  With respect to the energy area, OPEC and the lowering of crude prices have damped the enthusiasm, which was not very great, in energy discovery Another factor that has come to pass most recently was the announcement by Canada that they were going to reduce the price of natural gas imported into the United States by 25 percent A lot of the Tenth District is very heavily engaged in natural gas production, so that could further depress any interest in discovery or exploration in that area There is a fairly large segment of the District involved in high-tech business, particularly on the eastern slope of the Rockies Most recently there have been rather substantial layoffs--about 2,000 people--in that area who were engaged in the production of semi-conductors I'm told that the demand for semi-conductors worldwide has diminished but it has impacted this particular area more dramatically than I think any of us realizes On the positive side, auto assembly [activity], in which we have a very large number employed, is going full out Everybody is back and employed Nonresidential construction is experiencing boom conditions in several areas in our District Recreational activity is very high, with tourism and the ski industry looking forward to a very good year I'd just note that in New Mexico, which is a very small part [of our District] population-wise but very important in the defense industry, is experiencing a boom particularly in the Albuquerque area simply because they are deeply involved in the production of defense equipment  With respect to the outlook, I would agree with those who think the Greenbook is about right or maybe not optimistic enough I don't see the dangers that everybody expressed around the table that we are going to drop into a growth recession, if you will, in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 1985--or even if we did, that that would be all bad In other words, I don't see the potential of recession as a very high probability or any probability at all On the national level, I would accept the staff forecast as being about right And if we get it, I would be delighted   Yes With respect to the October number--and I know this won't make a great difference--do I remember correctly that last year when we did the seasonal adjustment those figures for the fourth quarter, including October, were revised up substantially? Would you not expect a similar event this year?   That's making a substantial--   Thank you, Mr Chairman With respect to the difference between alternatives A and B, given the money numbers that we have looked at, clearly a move to alternative A would suggest some further easing immediately after this meeting We don't have a lot of hope, judging from the comments around the table and from the staff, that we will reach the level of money growth that is incorporated in alternative B; therefore, if we move to alternative A, we are going to be easing more aggressively immediately after this meeting The second point is that in accordance with the staff's projection, alternative B suggests a federal funds rate in the neighborhood of 10 percent with a $700 million borrowing level I think there is fairly good evidence that there has been some shift in the demand for borrowing and, therefore, the relationship between the borrowing level and the federal funds rate is perhaps less precise than in the past Let me just make two points in that regard One is that, clearly, the unwillingness of large banks to borrow following the Continental situation has reversed itself They don't seem to be experiencing that unwillingness and as a result have come back to the discount window The second and more important thing is what Lyle Gramley has spoken of and that is the relationship of the borrowing level to the federal funds rate when you incorporate seasonal borrowing into that borrowing level Traditionally, seasonal borrowing has commenced growing around the first of the year, grows through August, and then declines to almost zero by the end of the year This particular year that pattern did hold, but at a much higher level Seasonal borrowing has been much higher than in the past And there has been little or no decline from August forward, as we would have experienced in the past We're now in the $300 to $325 million range for seasonal borrowing; if you consider that that has become less sensitive to interest rates, there is very little room If you take that away from the total borrowing level of $700 million, we are at a frictional level, it seems to me; adjustment borrowing would be virtually nonexistent if we go to the $400 million level and at the frictional level if we remain at the [current] level  The conclusion that I would draw from all of this is that I would opt for alternative B because we don't know what relationships will come to pass as the result of the interest rate drops that have already taken place I would consider those fairly aggressive--1-1/2 to 2 percentage points over the last five weeks Secondly, I would also anticipate that if we adopted ""B"" as specified in the Bluebook with a $700 million level of borrowing, we would see some further easing in interest rate levels, maybe to the 9, 9-1/4 or 9-1/2 percent area It would seem quite appropriate to me that we get to that 9 to 9-1/2 percent area, but I think we can achieve it with a $700 million borrowing level   Simply because a good part of the seasonal is inelastic now or unresponsive to interest rate levels, which I think  -39-    11/7/84  the record would reflect Then you're really operating on a borrowing function of something in the neighborhood of $400 million and that is closer to a 9 percent federal funds rate than a 9-1/2 percent rate, as suggested by the Bluebook Alternative A would get you there with a $400 million borrowing level   I think fed funds right now are probably at the 9-1/2 percent level or thereabouts If we don't do anything, I think we will see them come on down to that level The last point I want to make is that if I were running policy by my own prescription, I would rather take ""B"" and a $700 million borrowing level for the reasons I have just expressed--expecting fed funds to come down to the 9-1/2 percent area Then, if we saw a need for further easing, I would do it with a discount rate decrease rather than letting the fed funds rate run down to 9 percent or maybe even below 9 percent and then making a 1/4 or 1/2 point cut in the discount rate, which could push [rates] down to a level that I would not want to see occur   Yes   Yes, there should be a terminal date on seasonal borrowing; it can run out as far as 11 months, Chuck   Historically, such borrowings start at the first of the year Just to give you the figures from '81 to '83 On average, they would go up to a $250 million peak level in July and then decline back down to about $60 million in December The pattern this year was that they started out at about $80 million in January, progressed up to a $350 million peak in August and are currently in the $310 to $325 million range; we don't see that falloff in the last half of the year   If you consider that it is inelastic and that there has been a shift in demand for borrowing, then those banks that run out of their seasonal privilege are going to come back in for adjustment credit or they are going to be illiquid   But the number that we will put in there with that change will be something in the neighborhood of 1-1/2 to 2 percent for M1 growth in the fourth quarter  -42-    11/7/84   That is the reason I would opt for alternative II, so we don't have to deal with it in mid-quarter   Something more--   What period are we speaking of?   Oh, September to December   I would just remind you that the borrowing level was just reduced from $750 to $700 million this week And federal funds today--although to be sure it's Wednesday--are trading below the discount rate I don't know what all of that means and the funds rate shouldn't remain there, obviously, but we've already taken one cut from $750 to $700 million that the market doesn't know about Now you're suggesting cutting it another $150 million   Let me be sure to be understood I am not critical of having moved to $700 million I am just noting the fact that we very recently moved to the $700 million level and to talk about taking it to $550 million seems to me to be a rather large change in policy   Well, to be sure   I cannot tell the difference, but the fact of the matter is that there has been an overt move and we don't know what the result is   $600 to $700 million "
2694,1984-12-17," Thank you, Mr Chairman I would start out with the premise that maintaining as much flexibility as possible is the most desirable course for the Committee It does, however, turn [out that] the Chairman and the staff who work with this on a daily basis have a great deal of discretion, I think, within the very broad directive that the Committee adopts for the intermeeting period Having said that, however, I am attracted somewhat to Steve's proposal because of its directional content if you will It seems to me it is so small that it will not alter policy, particularly in the public's view or the market's view, but it will give the Committee some indication as to what the Desk is doing or what it's thinking about on a day-to-day or week-to-week basis If the borrowing level were adjusted by as much as $20 million or $50 million at a particular time, then it's a clear indication that the people who are looking at it and making those judgments are indicating that money growth is deviating from what they believe the Committee directed at its past meeting And in that sense, it seems to me it would be very helpful to me as a participant in this organization and would not do great damage in the sense of disrupting the markets or [producing] wide swings in the interest rates As a result, I would be in favor of moving in this direction in the very modest way that Steve has proposed   Thank you, Mr Chairman Things are much clearer to me now as I return to the room Let me say that I'm grateful to Jerry Corrigan for having captured, I think rather fully, my view of what will happen in '85 and what is appropriate to happen in '85 Let me just recap, because it has been a while since he spoke With respect to the outlook for the economy, I believe that the staff forecast is a bit conservative; I would look for something more in the range of about 4 percent in '85 And that comes from the fact that the interest rates have come down Given the lag effect, I think that we're going to see the consumer come back into the marketplace in the first half and that the first half will be somewhat    12/17-18/84  stronger than is now being projected and the strength will carry through a good part of the year As a result the 29 percent, I think, is a little low I'd rather we focus someplace between 3 and 4 percent, and closer to 4 percent for the year as a whole The question is whether that's an appropriate growth I think we would be right on track if we could achieve that kind of performance in 1985  With regard to the ranges for 1985, I think what we adopted in July would be quite appropriate and it seems to me that there is latitude within those ranges However, I would also give some recognition, Mr Chairman, in your testimony or otherwise, to the fact that unless we rebase we would be in the upper half of that range or near the top and perhaps even [above it] for '85 because of the shortfall we've experienced in 1984 With regard to your question on M1, some may have misunderstood what I said yesterday with respect to the importance I would place on M1 I believe it has greater informational content than the other aggregates, either M2 or M3 or credit As a result, I would look at it a little more closely, but that does not mean to suggest, along the lines of the question we were asked yesterday, that I'd place primary weight on it I would not do that because I think the aggregates in and of themselves are only one of several informational variables that we should be looking at in the economy and everything else I think what we've been doing in the most recent past is quite appropriate I wouldn't ignore M1; I'd just put a little more weight on it than I would on M2, M3, or credit  With regard to the exchange value of the dollar, everybody has spoken on the importance of moving its value to some lower level, and I think we all would agree that that would be helpful to the United States and in a sense helpful to the debtor nations around the world But I'm not convinced that we can do very much to correct that problem As others have said, if we aggressively target monetary policy with that as an objective, it seems likely that it will backfire on us and we'll be back with a problem at least as serious as we have now and perhaps even more serious The point I've come to is that it certainly is not totally within the power of this Committee or monetary policy to correct the excesses that now appear in that market To the extent that we run US monetary policy in a way to benefit our economic activity domestically, I think we have to leave it to the politicians and to fiscal policy to do the remainder That does not suggest that we shouldn't nudge interest rates a bit more with that being one of the primary objectives But if we were to set upon a course to correct the imbalances in the dollar vis-a-vis other currencies, I think we would be making a very great mistake And that's said in the context of looking at my own District in which agriculture plays an important part and, as Mr Keehn has already observed, the dollar itself is perhaps the only remedy to the situation--and it is a very serious one--that we find in the agricultural sector But still, with that kind of background, I am not convinced that what we do with monetary policy will affect the exchange rate in any long-term beneficial way   I don't know whether it's a contribution or not I have no quarrel with your prescription on the aggregates but I do share the concern about the $250 million borrowing level To accept it, one must accept the premise of the staff that $250 million is at or above the frictional borrowing level I'm not at all convinced, in view of the extent of the seasonal credit provisions, that that necessarily is above the frictional borrowing level If it is not, we certainly will be establishing a federal funds rate, it seems to me, and I would accept Lyle's prescription that 8 to 8-1/4 percent is about the correct range I would like to have some assurance that that's what we're looking at if we're going to adopt the $250 million borrowing level because I have a concern that if that level is below the frictional level, we'll essentially turn loose any control other than establishing the federal funds rate In that connection, I've just observed that everybody is talking about a fourth-quarter growth rate in M1 that's very low But if you are willing to believe that a seasonal adjustment factor might put as much as an additional 2 percent in the second half, that together with some benchmark revisions could bring growth up in the 4 to 5 percent range for the fourth quarter, which would be quite acceptable We may be pushing the ease button a little before we have all of that knowledge As a result, I would prefer to see a discount rate decrease by the Board of Governors and then to establish a borrowing level at least above the $300 million range with the target being a federal funds rate in the range of 8 to 8-1/4 percent "
2715,1985-01-18, Kansas City's on 
2734,1985-02-12," Just to follow that up As we talk about our intervention, how much control do we have over it at this point? Any    2/12-13/85  at all? Do we have any say, unilaterally, as to what the central bank will do?   Okay It may be that unless others change their minds we don't have any choice   Mr Chairman, we're in fairly close agreement with the staff forecast for 1985 but with a couple of different assumptions One is that we [keyed] off the midpoint of the M1 [objective] and projected 5-1/2 percent M1 growth rather than the 6-1/2 percent that the staff has, and still came up with essentially the same numbers with the exception of the deflator; we would be somewhere in the range of about 1/2 percent higher on the deflator The higher deflator number fell out of the unit labor cost component of the forecast, suggesting that unit labor costs would go up more than the staff has forecast But in all respects, it would seem to me that we're going to get somewhat greater growth than the staff is forecasting in the first half of the year and somewhat less in the second half, largely because of the interest rate pressures that will be brought to bear because of that greater growth [in the first half] and maybe some action by the Federal Reserve to move against that  I would also want to note for the Committee, as a follow-up on a comment of Si Keehn, that the condition of the agricultural sector in the high plains of the Midwest is a very serious problem It may not have the national impact, much as he has suggested, but that does not mean that there will not be great social and other disruptions in that area And indeed, it could get out of hand I would also want to note quickly, having talked to the Farm Credit people, bankers, large input suppliers to the agricultural sector, as well as to some Congressmen, that I fairly well concluded that there is not a great deal that monetary policy can do to alleviate that problem, at least in the very near term--I'm talking about 1985 and quite likely 1986 I'm not sure that there is a role for this Committee with respect to taking action to try to alleviate the problem that rests in the agricultural sector   Would you describe that again?   And then draw a cone off of the fourth-quarter average? Would that be the point?   Isn't that essentially rebasing?   Have both   Have both   I also would choose alternative II for a couple of reasons One, if we raise the range even to 7-1/2 percent--which I recognize is a move down from the 4 to 8 percent--or if we move to an 8 percent limit on the high side, as has been suggested, I believe we're really saying that we've done our job on inflation and we're willing to accept inflation at roughly a 4 percent level or perhaps a little above And that's a view that I would not want the Committee to give to the public; I would not want to permit that kind of interpretation Secondly, as to the ranges themselves, it seems fairly clear from the discussion yesterday and from the projections that 4 to 7 percent will accommodate the growth in nominal GNP that we're looking for with the level of inflation we're expecting And if it doesn't, as we have done in the past, we can talk about the upper part of the range I would emphasize looking for growth near the midpoint, but I'd be willing to go to the upper part of the range providing velocity doesn't perform as we are projecting As a result, it seems to me that these ranges accommodate what we're looking for I would like to have the top at 7 percent, therefore providing some restraint in the event that the projections don't come through Lastly, I'm not very concerned about M3 or credit; so the ranges, whatever they may be, are perfectly all right with me For M1 and M2 I would prefer those in alternative II   With respect to the first alternative, are you contemplating putting it in writing or doing it in your testimony?   Well, you're going to testify within--   I'd prefer not to go that way I'd rather go to the 7-1/2 percent, if those are the only alternatives you are suggesting   I'd also choose alternative B The only question that I would have with respect to alternative B is the $300 million borrowing level that the staff associates with an 8-1/4 percent funds rate I would just point out the pattern of seasonal borrowing between now and the next meeting If you just take 1984, for example, seasonal borrowing went to a very low level of roughly $150 million by the end of the period If we're at or near a frictional level of borrowing now and we get $150 million of seasonal borrowing, then that suggests to me that the funds rate might well drop below the [8-1/4] percent We would have a hard time holding it there without some additional--   Yes, in January; and then historically it begins to move up For example, at the end of March in 1984 it was $150 million after starting the year at or about the same level [as this year] So there's an increase of about $100 million in seasonal borrowing alone, which may complicate Desk operations if [adjustment] borrowings are at or near a frictional level now   Well, we had the same problem at this time last year January had growth in the double-digit range and we were above the cone until the end of the first quarter as I recall I don't know how you explained it then but it didn't seem to create great problems   And then we used it as a monitoring--   It picks up M2   But it's still well within the range   The assumption for the money growth is at the midpoint or--?   It makes quite a difference   Well, that's the point "
2760,1985-03-26," I, on the other hand, wouldn't view that as being an appropriate role I think we should stay with them and even at times support them We're going to support them if they go down anyway Although I wouldn't make an overt market entry I'd sure hate to back away from them at this point I think the statement by Peter that they show a good market presence and that they are able to attract funds at good rates now may be more PR than it is real And I would hate for us to be a disruptive force by backing away from them   Thank you, Mr Chairman My comments with regard to the economy are brief Let me start by saying that we're in general agreement with the staff's forecast I cannot quarrel with the comments that have been made that if there's a risk, the risk may be on the down side and not on the up side, because I don't see anything that indeed will move us to a higher level of output than has been forecast Nor do I really see anything on the down side that will alter the judgment that that forecast is about right  I would, however, just note that the Tenth District probably is one of the better illustrations of the imbalances that exist within the economy that have been described For example, on the plus side we have a fairly large producer of automobiles--I think second in the nation--and that's going full out; the high-tech and defense industry  -25-    3/26/85  is booming; commercial construction, at least in Kansas City and Omaha, is very vigorous Aircraft production is a big component part of our activity and I've received an interesting report on aircraft most recently, and that is that the number of aircraft being produced is down, largely because of the inability of the aircraft producers to export On the other hand, the dollar volume of aircraft being produced and sold is up simply because there has been a switch from the smaller type of aircraft back to the business jets, such as turbo jets, whose sales were dead in the water a year ago simply because business wasn't investing in that kind of capital good So, there are parts of the economy that are faring very well On the other side, I won't belabor the points on the energy, mining, and agricultural areas in which our District is very deeply involved, but all of them are flat on their backs  As for the fragility, there is fragility and it will begin to show up in the agricultural banks during 1985 as it has in the past And I think that will accelerate somewhat But there don't appear to be situations that can't be managed by the FDIC and by [FCA] and otherwise But there will be a great deal of discussion about them as well as about the bankruptcy or the ceasing of business by the implement dealers, the grain dealers, and others that have been very important to the Main Street merchant in these small agricultural towns And the impact is going to be very great  Just as a matter of personal interest, perhaps, there was a sale of a farm of some 700 acres in the little town of Platsburg, Missouri, and some 500 to 600 people showed up--mostly farmers and UAW retired workers--for whatever reason, to protest the sale on the courthouse steps The farm was sold amid shouting and there was violence; there were 7 or 8 arrested, several injured in the melee, and they damaged the front doors to the courthouse where the sale took place The reason I recite that event is because (1) it does perhaps portend for the future what may happen as these farm sales increase; and (2) one of our ex-colleagues, Willis Winn, has his home in Platsburg, Missouri I don't know that he was in the middle of it, and I doubt that he was   This happened on the 50th anniversary of a similar event in 1935 in which a federal marshal and his authorized [agents] tried to sell a farm on the courthouse steps of Clinton County in Platsburg It was an unsuccessful sale; the crowd took off his pants and ran him out of town They are more sophisticated now than they were 50 years ago  Turning to monetary policy In my judgment, staying about where we are would be appropriate for the upcoming period and even for the three months of the second quarter But I do have a concern that we not get ourselves in a position of letting money expand so rapidly that it takes all the flexibility away from the second half of the year and does not permit us, without some drastic moves, to get back within the bounds of the limits that we set for money growth at the last meeting I would note also that we have been fairly expansive in money growth over the last three or four months and if there's any lagged effect of money growth on real output, then I think we shouldn't get too exercised at the moment about easing policy In  -26-    3/26/85  view of my concern about not getting caught in the last half of the year, then, I would be leaning to the side of snugging up just a bit through this second quarter   Thank you, Mr Chairman I would join those who would opt for a 6 percent target for M1--in other words, just a modest modification of alternative B for the reasons described by Jerry Corrigan and others Clearly, that would imply maintaining the existing conditions, whatever that may mean Therefore, in my mind it comes down to what borrowing level should be adopted I would join those who would adopt a level in the $400 to $500 million range, tending toward $450 million I suppose, because based upon past experience it seems to me that we're talking about someplace around 8-1/2 to 8-5/8 percent as existing conditions with respect to interest rates What gets us there is not clear, but it seems to me it would be something more than $350 or $400 million--something more in the $400 to $500 million range  I would just note that in the Bluebook there is a recognition of the seasonal borrowing and that the Desk would intend to accommodate the seasonal borrowing starting with a level of about $80 million in the current time period and increasing upward Looking over the last three years, the second-quarter average for seasonal borrowing is something around $200 million, based upon the old seasonal borrowing privilege Taking into consideration that we not only have a new temporary seasonal provision but we have expanded the regular seasonal provision to encompass a great many other banks, I hope the Desk will be mindful that that could explode on us, if indeed there are creditworthy borrowers out there to whom banks can pass through seasonal credit   No, as a matter of fact the demand that-- Well, first of all, are you talking about the temporary?   The seasonal borrowing is at a very low level at the present time I think the numbers are presently about $80 million nationwide, whereas in past years by this time we would have been up in the $150 million or so range and then would accelerate on up from that point And we haven't seen that   It is lower than normal   No, as a matter of fact, it's interesting I think they're sitting on their hands The other aspect of this is that of the $650 million government provision--that is, the guaranteed loan program--only $8-1/2 million has been used Nobody knows what to do, I think  -36-    3/26/85   If we're successful in hitting $350 to $400 million, that will be the first time the market would have seen that number for about three or four weeks I don't know what the reaction would be, but it could be one of ease, if we did it more than one week  -39-    3/26/85   I assume the path then would be built upon a $425 million level   [Unintelligible]  -42-    3/26/85 "
2784,1985-05-21," How do you respond to that question?   About the financial stability   Let me focus just briefly on the Tenth District economy The major sectors in that economy are agriculture, energy-- which includes both petroleum and mining [unintelligible]--aircraft, auto, and high-tech, including semiconductors In that array, only one is doing very well and that's the automobile industry The remainder are all in a depressed state In agriculture the situation is basically the same that has been well publicized and that we've talked about around the table I would note that, based on the results of a quarterly survey just completed, the land values in the Tenth District--that would be dry land, irrigated, and pasture land-- are down another 6 percent from the end of 1984 In the aggregate for the District as a whole, land values are down 38 percent from the high of 1981 Now, that means that in some of those states it's down 30 percent, depending upon the kind of agricultural land, and in some states it's down 40 to 45 percent; on average, it is down 38 percent But the important fact, I think, is that land continues to drop in value, showing a 6 percent decline from the end of 1984  Energy, both the petroleum and mining, is just rocking along with no great hope of any resurgence in the period ahead Aircraft manufacturers just can't sell commercial or private aircraft overseas as a result of the dollar And with high interest rates and the uncertainty about what the future state of the tax law will be, corporations are just laying back in the woods and not committing themselves to aircraft As a result the industry is struggling The auto industry in the District, which is a very big employer and a big component of the economy, is going full out and that's the real positive aspect In the high-tech area, which is in Kansas City, essentially, and in New Mexico and the eastern range of the Rockies, we find that the competition from overseas together with the [strength of the] dollar [has put] the semiconductor part of that industry at great risk As a matter of fact, we had the second closing of a high- tech firm in Colorado this past week They just are not able to compete with the overseas markets  -18-    5/21/85  Having said all that, I would like to turn momentarily to the national economy I take some encouragement from the comments that have come from around the table There is very little concern about a recession That is to say, the staff's forecast of 2 to 3 percent growth for the year as a whole suggests that we will be in the positive figures and perhaps not working against the high unemployment rate Nonetheless, there is no concern about recession, and I find that true in talking to people in the Tenth District; recession is not on their minds Our staff, looking at the outlook for the period ahead, would forecast just a bit more expansion in the second and third quarters than the Board staff's forecast, but on balance we would come out for the year as a whole about where the Board staff comes out, with slightly more growth in the latter part of the year because of the interest rate action that was taken most recently There are two parts to that expectation of a bit more expansion than in the Board staff's forecast one would be inventories in the second quarter and the other would be domestic consumption remaining very strong through the second and third quarters My own view, however, would be a bit more optimistic than the Board's staff or even my own staff Given the money growth in late 1984 and the early part of this year, I think the chances are that we will see some real strength beginning to emerge in the third quarter and maybe on through the remainder of 1985  Having said all that, I also have met with the small business and agricultural group as well as people around the District and, clearly, the focus in their minds is the strength of the US dollar That touches each of the areas that I mentioned that the Tenth District is involved in It is becoming very [apparent] that they tie in the federal budget deficit with the dollar and they see that as their enemy at the moment The most recent decrease in the interest rates is looked upon very favorably, and I should think the reduction of the discount rate will fall in that category I would just note, if I heard the Vice Chairman right that he could not [identify] any financial markets that didn't have froth in them, that I can tell you that the agricultural financial markets don't have froth in them   Thank you, Mr Chairman I would favor the aggregates specifications of alternative B It doesn't bother me greatly that we are at, or near, or above the top of the parallel line [for M1], given the weakness we've had I think it's an appropriate response, with the velocity [growth] being negative for what would appear to be two quarters But what I am bothered about is the borrowing level suggested in the Bluebook the $300 to $350 million range, which will achieve a 7-3/4 percent federal funds rate If I'm correct in my thinking about that, if we maintain the same pressures on reserves that we've had in the past and have dropped the discount rate 1/2 percentage point, then that would suggest that in order to get a funds rate of 7-3/4 percent we would need to have the same borrowing level that we had before we dropped the discount rate And if I understand the numbers right, that level is closer to $400 million than it is to $300 to $350 million I think borrowing averaged $380 million over the intermeeting period The point that I'd like to make is that $300 to $350 million seems a little low and I would be a little more cautious so as to get to the 7-3/4 percent over time As a result, I would opt for a borrowing level of $375 to $425 million with a target, obviously, of $400 million starting out And I should think that if we're looking ultimately to move to 7-3/4 percent that we can do it gradually  The other point that I would make, and I've made it before, is that seasonal borrowings are now running about $170 million, which is half of the $300 to $350 million, and they will continue to build over the upcoming intermeeting period Therefore, with a $300-$350 million borrowing objective, we're really getting very close to turning loose and actually pegging the federal funds rate, which I would oppose Therefore, I would accept ""B"" and recommend a borrowing range of $375 to $425 million, centering on $400 million for the start of the intermeeting period   As a follow-up on that Your $380 million borrowing level that you averaged out over the period excluded everything, right?   April to June it does   Mr Chairman, the target that I think you're looking at is $350 to $375 million If I understand, that would result in the federal funds rate quite likely moving to the 7-3/4 percent area immediately Is that a correct interpretation?   I understand that   Well, if there's 50 basis points down to 7-1/4 percent then I would oppose it, obviously I understand you're not a  -42-    5/21/85  prophet; but I think the staff's projection suggests that it will be moving immediately to 7-3/4 percent as a result of the discount rate cut with a $350 million borrowing level "
2806,1985-07-09," Thank you, Mr Chairman I am glad to be at or near the end of the ones to speak because I was a little depressed with the earlier conversations, and I was delighted to hear Frank Morris and others come forth with a little more optimistic view Our forecast is very close to the staff's forecast My staff would suggest that the risks are more on the down side than the up side and I guess I don't totally share that view It seems to me that the two- tiered economy that has been spoken about--not only in Gary Stern's District but in mine and others that are predominantly agricultural and mining-related--is certainly there But looking on a national level, I am more inclined to believe that we have experienced a pause in the first and second quarters With what the Federal Reserve has done in conjunction with the very stimulative fiscal package, it would seem to me that we could look forward to some better growth in the latter half of this year and well into 1986  But I don't want to minimize the impact of the two-tiered economy It seems to me that one of the greatest risks that we may face is the instability in the financial system As Jerry has noted, there is a lot of liquidity; but when you look at agriculture and mining and the prospects for a further drop in oil prices, which impacts the producers in the United States largely in the Texas, Oklahoma, and Wyoming areas, the prospects for financial instability that can throw this forecast askew seem to me to be very great And that is one of my greater concerns--not whether 3 percent is right or 2-1/2 percent is satisfactory, but what may happen in these other  -14-    7/9-10/85  areas, particularly in the financial area I am not at all convinced that what we have done up to now isn't about enough to stabilize the situation; to do more may translate into prices rather than stability to that system In other words, I am not sure that the Committee can do a lot to fend off those kinds of uncertainty   Indeed they are, Chuck As a matter of fact, if I may, let me give you some facts As far as the crops, wheat is being harvested now and is largely out in the mid-section, going on north But the commodity prices are falling For example, the commodity price of corn was some 21 percent below the price of a year ago; the price of soy beans is down 15 percent from a year earlier; winter wheat, which is just now being harvested, is down 9 to 10 percent from a year earlier; fat cattle are down 18 percent from a year earlier It's these falling commodity prices that are worsening what has happened in the farm credit area, which has been fairly stable over the last month or two You haven't heard much about it It's simply because they are in the field and the real crisis isn't going to surface until the fall But my own view is that that crisis hasn't passed and is indeed going to worsen as fall and winter approach We are going to find that growing back in spades in the financial sector, particularly in agricultural banks and the Farm Credit System   That was when we had credit controls--in the spring of 1980, I think   Mr Chairman, there has been a good deal of discussion about the uncertainty of what M1 is going to do I would start from the premise that M1 has a value in that it has informational content even now when we are uncertain about it We have seen it return to more normal relationships in the past and I would hope that would occur in the future As a result, I would not want to do away with M1 totally But in view of the uncertainty, it would seem to me that it makes no sense either to rebase or raise the top limit for the reason that that uncertainty suggests that we don't know whether we can hit the target if we raise the top, for example, or if we rebase To be sure, it improves the chances But it also implies to the market, it seems to me, a precision that nobody around this table believes--that we know what is going to happen to M1 in the period ahead Therefore, I come to the conclusion that we should do nothing with M1 other than to move it to a monitoring status We should let you describe in the upcoming testimony that velocity and demand for money have created the uncertainty; that M2, M3, and debt are all within their boundaries; that the economy is chugging along-- maybe not to the level that we want, but chugging along nonetheless; and that looking at all things we are setting aside M1, which we don't understand, to a monitoring status but are not totally doing away with it because it does have some information content as to direction if nothing else So up or down, if you will, on M1 I would describe what has happened in the past and the uncertainty, and rely upon the other touchstones--and I am talking about the aggregates, principally, as well as the economy and the level of the dollar I would not want to raise the upper limit or rebase because either one implies precision that we don't have  -39-    7/9-10/85   That's not true! [Laughter]   I would share that [view] I think proposal number 2 does capture what I have in mind put M1 on a monitoring status but don't do away with it   Doesn't that imply to the markets that we are intending to hit those targets if we rebase, or if we raise them?   That's exactly my point If we either change the target or rebase, it implies that we are going to hit it And I might just observe that there is a possibility that if we rebase we won't even hit the bottom end of the target That's an outside possibility, to be sure; nonetheless, the possibility exists And certainly it's going to put us to the test to hit the top of the target if we rebase Therefore, I would opt not to do either of those two things, but describe what has happened and describe what we think will happen in the future and put M1 on a monitoring basis   And we don't know whether it is over or not   I don't share that   I would like to ask a question about your last statement that it is more difficult to go to 4 to 7 percent next year from the 5 to 9 percent If we rebase or raise the range this year because of an aberrant behavior of M1 that we think is behind us, and we select the fourth-quarter average as the next year's starting point, I don't see that 4 to 7 percent is any more difficult in 1986 from either of those two starting points   And the explanation has to be that it was a one- time aberration that occurred in M1 in 1985   I guess I would suggest that we don't do either   Don't do either   We said at the beginning of the year that we set a range of 4 to 7 percent and that we expected to be at or near the top And indeed, we are above the top because of unforeseen circumstances I don't see any problem with admitting that and admitting that we don't know--   You simply would describe in your testimony that, because of the uncertainty M1 is on a monitoring basis or however else we may describe it; that it has informational content so that we are going to retain it; and that we don't know what is going to happen over the remainder of the year but we are still dedicated to the proposition that we are going to move toward price stability in the period ahead And we do that with the 1986 targets   I think that's correct But I don't know that you can explain any better 4 to 7 percent rebased or raising the range to 5 to 9 percent   Well, I think we can find words to get over that hump, if that's the only hill we have to climb   $350 to $400 million?   I would support ""B"" with the caveat on the borrowing It would appear, just looking back at the historical numbers, that the $350 million is pretty low And we have had the federal funds rate dropping below the discount rate for some short period of time Whatever the number is, I'd start at $350 million as kind of the base--   --and accept something a bit higher than that providing the funds rate is trading around the 7-3/4 percent level   I'm not a voting member, but I would prefer not to   But with only a 6-month horizon we ought to have a wider band A 3 to 8 percent range would be a--   That kind of description precludes easing, except when everything runs in the opposite direction that you just described "
2831,1985-08-20," What are the current spreads on the Farm Credit Agency--?   Thank you, Mr Chairman I normally have a fairly optimistic outlook on most things in life, but I must say at the moment that it has been damped somewhat In our area of the country there has been a great deal of discussion about agriculture and what may happen At the moment, as I think most of you know, we will have an outstanding wheat harvest and the prediction on corn, soy beans, sorghum, and so forth is very, very good On the other hand, there already has been a 20 to 25 percent drop in prices for those    8/20/85  commodities; for each of them the price is now below the break-even point for production At the same time, red meat prices, hogs and cattle, have dropped roughly 20 to 25 percent over the last 60 days And those producers now are either at a break-even or a loss position The energy problem somebody has mentioned--the rig count is indeed down by 25 percent from a year ago, but it is flat or going on down in Oklahoma, Wyoming, and Colorado Mining is flat on its back Aircraft sales, which are a fairly large component of the output in the Tenth District are flat--flat being no sales at all unless to the military As a result, there is not a great deal of happiness outside of the metropolitan areas, where economic activity is still going fairly strong in terms of auto production and other activity  Let me say further that I take no comfort in the budget resolution that has been passed by Congress, because if you look at the history of what has happened in this so-called new budget environment, the budget resolution has not meant very much in the past Indeed this time, if you look at the agricultural sector, whether you like it or not, the government is going to end up with about 2/3 of all of the production this year as a result of the sign- ups for CCC; the producers simply are going to walk away because the target prices are higher than the commodity price in the market And that all is a direct tap on the Treasury   That's a very big number--somewhere in the $24 to $30 billion range It is something like $18 billion above what otherwise would have been projected So in my own view, the budget deficit problem is far from resolution and it is going to get worse rather than better It seems to me that with respect to monetary policy, we have one of two choices One is in some way to get real interest rates down, which will help marginally in agriculture and some of these areas; and to me the only lever we have to pull is lower [nominal] interest rates and that implies monetization of the debt As a result I am gloomy and not very optimistic   Not with farm commodity prices dropping   Well, it is very difficult to tell what land prices are doing simply because there are foreclosures but there are no sales And as a result, you can get the survey--as we do and I think Minneapolis and Chicago do--and it shows that they are still declining But those are numbers that are not based upon sales The amount of land now being held by the Farm Credit Bureau is large The numbers that I know come out of Wichita and Omaha and they are very large numbers Most of the agricultural banks that have been deeply involved, and indeed are in trouble, are holding considerable amounts of real estate and simply have hired somebody to try to farm it because they can't sell it The question, I guess, involves not only the gloom that already has spread, but there is a systemic problem in  -16-    8/20/85  the financial area that evolves out of the agricultural banking problems that I think is very great   That may have been intentional, Mr Chairman I think that everything has been said In my view, we are neutered with regard to policy at the moment   We are neutered to the extent that we don't know what is happening in M1 and we don't know what is going to happen to the economy and, as a result, I don't see any reason to change policy Thus, if ""B"" represents no change, that's my preference   Well, I am a bit puzzled We are in the middle of August now, and if the projections for the money supply in August are somewhat correct, there would have to be a very dramatic movement it would seem to me from the projected 4 percent in September for us to move off the $425 million   Okay I am satisfied with the answer then   Or $200 billion at home   How about 7 to 9 percent?   If we use the 7 to 9 percent, it is centered on 8 percent but it does give us some flexibility to go one way or the other without having to make any policy move   But to use 7 to 9 percent, centering on 8 percent, seems to me to provide flexibility that would be desirable   Can you tell me what you've done with that last sentence with respect to the foreign exchange markets? "
2857,1985-10-01," Thank you, Mr Chairman I would agree with those around table who suggest that an uptick in the national economy is probably in train--that the Greenbook forecast is very reasonable That, however, is only from a national view From a regional view, in the Tenth District things have not gotten better; they have gotten worse And the projections for the fall and winter, particularly in the agricultural and energy areas, hold out no great hope As a matter of fact, the financial strain simply rolls back into the financial institutions; the outlook for banks, savings and loans, and others looks to be devastating From strictly a national viewpoint; I would agree with those who say no change in policy From a regional viewpoint, I guess I would have to urge perhaps some relaxation of interest rate levels I will just note that on the inflation front, much of the contribution to stable inflation in the short run is a contribution by food and energy And that impacts my District rather dramatically  There has been a good deal of talk about M1 and I would agree, in view of what I have just said, that we shouldn't pay very much attention to it in the very short run Although I would hate to give it up as a part of policy, over the next intermeeting period and perhaps over the fourth quarter as a whole I don't see M1 as a major player in policy decisions, unless other matters such as the dollar come into play and we may want to use it On the other hand, the dollar and the G-5 arrangement are a bit puzzling to me That is to say that there's been a great deal of talk here and I think you, Mr Chairman, expressed the concern of a precipitous drop in the dollar I think that is a real risk, obviously But if you look at it in another way the fundamentals haven't changed, as far as I can see As a result, it seems to me that the dollar has come down relative to the other currencies but I would expect that in the short run the traders will test the United States, for example, and will try to push the dollar back up to see how far the United States really will go to participate in the G-5 agreement  So with that in mind, and with the background of the economy, particularly queuing off of my own region, I would prefer alternative B But I am troubled a little by the language describing alternative B and that is that the staff would project a funds rate of 8 percent or a bit higher I would object at this point, if it were up to me, to having a rate of 8 percent and pushing on up unless some of these other exogenous forces, such as the dollar, come into play As a result, I would modify that and be someplace between ""A"" and ""B"" and  -21-    10/1/85  start out with a borrowing level, say, of between $400 and $500 million, centering on $450 million I am hopeful that that would be enough latitude and flexibility, if the dollar did start to drop, that there wouldn't be a [conference] call and the policy prescription changed as a result of that call   You have no problems with the funds rate beginning to trade at 8 percent or a little higher in view of the most  -25-    10/1/85  recent background of something less than that--that is, coming out of this meeting and seeing it trade at 8 to 8-1/4 percent?   Well, since funds haven't traded above 8 percent in recent times, moving above 8 percent may provide a message of sorts "
2881,1985-11-04," Thanks, Mr Chairman I don't think I shall burden the Committee with reciting again the problems in our regional area, other than to tell you that the latest survey we have done at the banks suggests that farm land prices have fallen another 5 to 6 percent   That's in the third quarter; they are down in the 40 to 50 percent range now below the high of 1981 But there is another activity that I would like to bring to the Committee's attention Because of the rather depressed conditions in our region, and based on the resourcefulness of the people who live in the Midwest, they do turn to other activities to provide food for the table As a result, game wildlife hunting is a big activity this time of the year and I can tell you that, at least in the immediate area around the Bank, there is some optimism for the Thanksgiving holiday because the hunting season opened early You will find four out of seven Bluejays and four out of seven Cardinals will be served!   Yes I think that's good   Mr Chairman, what do you have in mind when you speak of the dollar being weak, in terms of this intermeeting period? Are you talking about stringing ten days together all on the down side of some magnitude? Or are you going to let it--   I guess when you talk about the implementation of this policy, I don't know what ""weakness in the dollar"" really means   The weak side with respect to the yen largely?   My point is that I would like to see rates come down a bit, but it isn't clear to me how that occurs If the dollar is a constraint and the measure of the dollar's weakness is feel, how do you get there?   If we were missing M3 or debt, we wouldn't be considering this, it seems to me; and I don't think we should for M1 I wouldn't raise the question ""Why is M1 more important than M2 or M3 in the context of policy?""   I understand that, but to the extent we could diminish that perception, I think it's important Therefore, I wouldn't do it   Well, given the record that will be published on Friday this week, it will be no surprise that we're not going to make the 3 to 8 percent target And I don't see any reason to make any announcement at all, unless you're asked the question "
2905,1985-12-16," What kind of impact would that have on our trading partners--Germany and Japan, for example? Would that--   Thank you, Mr Chairman With respect to the staff's forecast, it has been fairly well detailed that there is uncertainty on either side that could affect that forecast, and as a result the forecast seems to be quite reasonable The news from the Tenth District is [no] better than it has been before Indeed, the outlook is dominated by the problems in agriculture and energy and the now-surfacing real estate problems that are fairly well known in Denver, Oklahoma City, and some of the other larger metropolitan areas If you talk to individuals in the various areas, you will find mixed comments if they are not dominated by the agricultural and energy [industries] If they are in the urban areas, they think things are going very well But overall, I think the attitude is more negative than positive There is great uncertainty about the retail sales in the Christmas season, simply because we have had very cold weather that started right at the Thanksgiving holiday and it's uncertain whether or not there is enough time left to have good Christmas sales  Having in mind that the staff forecast may be as good as any other, and looking ahead to 1986--with 2 percent growth, a fairly high unemployment rate of 73 percent at year-end, inflation being down or in check if you will, and the hope that it will be even less than the forecast because there are no decreases in energy prices built into that forecast, as I understand it, and with capacity utilization projected to be at fairly low levels--I think it would be unacceptable in even the fourth year of recovery that we should be concerned about an upside risk, frankly I would like to see something greater than 2 percent; something in the 3 to 4 percent range would be quite acceptable And to the extent that monetary policy has a part to play, particularly against the background of some, albeit imperfect, deficit reduction package out of Gramm-Rudman, I think we ought to be on the side of doing what we can do; and that in my view is to bring about somewhat lower interest rates fairly quickly   If I can just follow on that question a minute If we were to take ""A"" without a discount rate decrease and we got a 7-1/2 percent funds rate with $200 to $250 million in borrowing as projected in the Bluebook and then we had a discount rate decrease, that would be a double whammy if you will, and the rate would get down to 7-1/4 to 7-3/8 percent, I assume Is that--?   And then a full half point after that?   Well, the practical alternatives would be ""A"" with a discount rate change or ""B"" without a discount rate change, I guess No, ""A"" without a discount rate--   If you have ""A"" without, you would set in motion expectations that [a discount rate move] would be forthcoming   Thank you, Mr Chairman Ed Boehne has already said what I wanted to say, I think I believe also that we have a window of opportunity and we should take advantage of it With respect to the international situation, it seems to me that the threat of a precipitous drop in the dollar has perhaps not disappeared, but it certainly is much less than it was at the time of the last meeting And I would ask you, Mr Chairman--perhaps you can or cannot comment-- with respect to some lower interest rates here, what is your best guess as to what Germany and Japan, for example, might do in terms of following us down? If they're satisfied with the current [exchange rate] levels of 250 and 200 for example, it would seem to me that there would be some leeway for them to move their interest rates down and thus become a bit more expansive in their own monetary policy and thus have some impact that would flow back to the United States over time by permitting them to attract more of our export markets But having said all of that, it just seems to me that [we have a window here] with inflation not being a high visibility concern, though not at an acceptable level to be sure, and the Gramm-Rudman bill And with the passage of that bill we may even have a bit of an obligation to give a nod to that by easing interest rates, if you consider that fiscal policy will be somewhat more restrictive than it has been in the past And Gramm-Rudman will really have some impact If there is a window, in view of the financial strains not only in the Midwest but throughout the United States and internationally, I think we ought to take advantage of it Like Ed Boehne, I would prefer to coordinate it with a discount rate decrease rather than some easing through the Desk's actions and then a discount rate decrease that might have to come thereafter So, I would do the discount rate decrease, leave borrowing at the $400 million level, approximately, and move interest rates down in that fashion rather than the other way   Well, I would prefer 1/2 percentage point I can't remember how long it has been since we used the 1/4 point but that implies some precision that I believe we shouldn't try to demonstrate in the market As a result I would object to a 1/4 point If we're going to make a move, we ought to do 1/2 point   [Unintelligible] use that term to be--   Well, if we took the lead that would suggest then that they might follow US rates down Is that--   But starting out at the $300 million level until this all unfolds?   I meant $350 million   Are we at $450 or $400 million now?   We could adjourn this meeting and the Board could adjust the discount rate and clear the whole thing up   You do not have a reference to the discount rate in the directive, then? "
2930,1986-02-11," Just an informational question with regard to the debtor oil-producing nations such as Mexico Is most of that debt denominated in dollars so that they are getting a double whammy with respect to the drop of the dollar as well as the oil crisis?   And will it carry a LIBOR? If it carries their interest rate, the repayment will be in their currency which could have a--   Mr Chairman, very briefly I want to say that my forecast is very similar to the staff forecast, deviating marginally with respect to the projection for prices; our projection is a bit lower than the staff's Picking up on what Governor Johnson has just noted, I think there will be a greater impact on prices coming from the decrease in the oil price than there will be from the effects of the dollar, and I think the dollar effects will [begin to] show up later in 1986 and have a greater impact in 1987 Therefore, I would look for inflation to be somewhat lower than the staff forecast  With respect to the Tenth District, I am delighted to hear that there is some brightness being exhibited in the Ninth District Maybe it will flow with the cold air down across our part of country!   We have several copper mines; I am afraid the Ninth District may have a jump on us Talking to people in the urban areas of the Tenth District after Christmas, I would characterize the outlook as fairly optimistic because of a fairly good Christmas season, though retail sales were up only modestly on a year-over-year basis Secondly, throughout our District the month of January has been very warm and as a result that increased the optimism, I guess, of virtually everybody But outside of the urban areas the major activities are agriculture, mining, energy, and aviation industry and very little has changed except for lower asset prices with respect to the agricultural sector, for example There have been some new orders in aviation that should have some positive impact on the Tenth District, but not a great deal So, I don't see any real change from that very low level There is very little optimism outside the urban areas, and I am not sure that the Tenth District is going to share in this nice forecast of 3 to 4 percent growth that the nation may enjoy in 1986 I will just make one observation with respect to the energy situation and how it may impact my District Energy is made up in the District not only of petroleum crude but also natural gas and coal Natural gas prices have not reacted to the [drop in] crude prices; coal is in less demand and perhaps over time will be fairly severely impacted But overall, I think there will be less of an impact in the District just from a reduction in crude prices simply because of the various kinds of energy resources that are found there   Yes As a matter of fact, one or two of those open pit mines up in Wyoming actually closed because of [falling] demand There is one being opened momentarily, but they don't think they can go on into production   Mr Chairman, for all the reasons already stated, I would join those who would retain M1 as a target and treat it much as we did in 1985 because of the uncertainties Secondly, it's attractive to me to adopt what Si Keehn has just proposed to retain the ranges for all the aggregates, including debt, at the [unintelligible] positions we had in 1985 That incorporates the 3 to 8 percent [for Ml] and retains the debt range of 9 to 12 percent Although there is some real concern about what debt means, the fact that it is monitored and that we have to take a look at it and try to determine why we missed the range is an important exercise As a result, I would keep debt and retain the 9 to 12 percent monitoring range that we had in 1985   It seems to me that that may be the best argument to readopt the range for Ml that we had for the last half of    2/11-12/86  1985, that is the 3 to 8 percent, as no change It is a wider range, and from the 4 to 7 percent that we gave tentatively for 1986 in July we've widened it on both ends   It doesn't seem to me that enough certainty has come into the ability to forecast M1 growth that we should adopt what we thought might be appropriate in July of 1985 for 1986 Indeed, the track record suggests that we are still uncertain and that the wider range is more appropriate   Mr Chairman, looking at these alternatives, I see very little difference between ""A"" and ""B"" I discount ""C"" to begin with There is virtually no difference between ""A"" and ""B"" with the exception that ""A"" implies lower borrowing and a discount rate cut I might have been in favor of that six weeks ago, but it seems to me that a discount rate cut, in view of the good numbers that we    2/11-12/86  have had recently and the fragility in the dollar, might [not] be appropriate Therefore, ""B"" at a stand pat level of $300-$400 million would be an appropriate prescription for the next six weeks   That might be--   But the market wouldn't see that for another six weeks   What's the understanding on borrowing?   $250 to $350 million? "
2956,1986-04-01," Thank you, Mr Chairman I would also join those--virtually everyone that I have heard around the table--who  -28-    4/1/86  would opt for alternative B I am a bit concerned, however, about the discussion of the borrowing level being a bit below the $300 million level It seems to me that we are very close to the frictional level now And to talk about $200 to $300 million and $250 million, for example-- I just feel more comfortable staying where we are; if that is $300 million, I'd opt for ""B"" with $300 million and not fool around with the borrowing level   The answer, I think, depends on what happens elsewhere I guess for the fed funds rate in and of itself the answer is yes I think that the market has probably overshot a bit   About $180 million   Under the circumstances I think it would be less this year   The word is cryptic   7 percent for both   I hate to ask this question, Mr Chairman, but I assume that the latter implies a 7-1/4 to 7-3/8 percent funds rate or thereabouts "
2980,1986-05-20," They are continuing to fall, Mr Chairman As far as agricultural land values, from the survey that we take at the end of every quarter, they are down another 5 to 6 percent across the District; that would be roughly 50 percent of their highs in 1981 With respect to the agricultural sector, the winter wheat crop is in good shape; it's perhaps a very good crop The other plantings that would take place in the spring are going forward well ahead of the usual schedule There are about 5 to 7 percent of agricultural borrowers that will not get credit this spring and, as a result, something will have to be done with respect to foreclosure They will not be able to put in a crop So, there is some good and bad in the sense that the crop is good and commodity prices are up marginally, largely because of the Russian disaster On the other side of the coin, red meat prices are down largely because of governmental programs with respect to the dairy herd buyout which depressed red meat prices very substantially  In the energy sector, the story has already been told What has happened to Bob Boykin's District has happened to the Tenth District in spades For example, the rig count as of January 1 in the Tenth District was at 550; in May it was 236 And that [compares with] a number of about 1700 working rigs in the District at the height of the oil boom As far as manufacturing is concerned, again, it's a mixed picture Missouri, as I think you know, is second only to Michigan in auto assemblies Those plants are going full out so that in the urban areas, particularly Kansas City, things are looking very good and unemployment is lower than the national average On the other hand, general [unintelligible] aviation aircraft, farm  -17-    5/20/86  1, if maybe we won't have to see some more paring back in the third quarter because they are at close to 2 million units and that is probably 400,000 to 500,000 units above where they would like to have them Have they taken enough out of production schedules to achieve that, given the current sales pace? Again, I don't know the answers; these are just questions   Thank you, Mr Chairman I share the optimism about growth over the second half of the year and, as a result, the lack of good evidence at the moment creates an uncertainty that suggests to me that alternative B is the appropriate prescription for policy in the period ahead simply because we don't know what is happening and that alternative pretty much holds the current position As to the directive itself, I would favor draft alternative II for the reason that there is a recognition of the rapid growth in the aggregates that has already taken place and that we would expect through the second quarter And it places M2 and M3 first, with simply a recognition following that of the M1 growth Lastly, it does suggest or maintain the idea that some firming could take place in the future given that rapid growth, if the economy begins to perform as we would anticipate and the pressures begin to show up in prices All those things to me seem to be consistent with (1) what we think and hope the outlook will be, and (2) a realization that M1, M2, and M3 are outside [their ranges] and that the numbers are somewhat different than last month, but nonetheless we maintain them as guideposts   Well, draft directive III has no numbers in it at all with respect to any of the aggregates I think that's a rather marked departure from what we've done in the past and one that I would not feel comfortable with   It seems to me that there is only one issue, Mr Chairman, and that is whether or not we want to maintain some range for the aggregates, particularly as set out in alternative II--keeping M2 and M3 as the first targets and indicating that M1 is sort of uncertain   I read III as Frank does--that M1 is in some way elevated   But in very modest amounts   I have a hard time envisioning, under the current circumstances, that we would do intervention without coordination with the Germans and the Japanese   At least you'd have the up and up "
3005,1986-07-08," So moved   Just a follow-up to that question Have you considered that the imports from these emerging industrial countries around the Pacific Basin are really substitutable for what may not come in from Japan and other countries against whose currencies the dollar has moved substantially?   But that beneficial effect may lag somewhat?   I am afraid I won't do much more than join the discussions that have already taken place It seems to me that it is honest to say, first of all, that M1 has [served us] quite well in the past and perhaps will come back full circle to where there will be a restoration of some historical relationship between income and money growth and we will want an M1 target again As a result, I would prefer not to drop it but rather, as Emmett said, to be more honest and say we'll have a range for it but expect not to hit that range in 1986--and I should think in 1987 also, unless there is a return to some historical relationship The Bluebook has the language that I think would be appropriate It says that M1 [would be evaluated] depending on ""developments in the economy and financial markets, and potential inflationary pressures"" That is the kind of explanation, it seems to me, that would be appropriate after we have said we don't understand what has happened to M1 Therefore, I would opt to retain the 3 to 8 percent range for 1986 and also for 1987, with the explanation We'll have another opportunity to look at it in February   May I ask for an explanation of the discussion that you just had with yourself with respect to 1986 and 1987 with regard specifically to the use of the term ""monitoring range""?   That's all I wanted to know  SPEAKER(?) 930 am tomorrow?   Thank you, Mr Chairman What has happened and what is happening in the Tenth District is not greatly different than what I have described in past meetings, and that is, that it's a very unbalanced situation In the urban areas, things are going quite nicely except in Oklahoma, which is particularly impacted by the energy and agricultural situation And in the rural areas there's growing desperation as to how this whole thing will play itself out    7/8-9/86  Having said that, I guess I'd like to focus on a couple of good pieces of information One would be that the wheat crop is out and was a good crop The weather in the growing season has been very good for all the crops, generally speaking, in the Tenth District And I guess I take some comfort that they are having a drought in the Southeast, which will improve the commodity prices spilling into the Tenth District or [unintelligible]   Not very much; I'm afraid that's right Another piece of information that comes out of a quarterly survey that we conduct has to do with agricultural real estate prices There was a further drop from the fourth quarter to the first quarter of about 5 percent in agricultural real estate values That's down roughly 21 percent from a year ago and roughly 50 percent of the values posted in 1981, which was the high point But the good news that may be showing through is that ranch land, for example, was down 7 percent, but crop land was only down 3 percent; and that is a slowing in the decline in crop land values So, to the extent that you're searching for any good news, I suppose you could dwell on that only briefly to say that maybe we're getting close to the bottom of the decline in agricultural real estate values  With respect to the energy sector, it continues to worsen For example, in the District there are 193 rigs now working and that's roughly 1/3 of the number of rigs that were working at the end of January of 1986, just a few months ago In the banking sector, particularly that part that services agriculture and energy, [the news is bad] At the agriculture-related banks the loan-to-deposit ratio is only at 53 percent, which is the lowest level since we began doing the survey in 1976--which merely says that the banks can't find any credit-worthy borrowers This demonstrates some of the pain and the distress that is showing up and clearly is present in the agricultural and energy areas  With respect to manufacturing in the District, the farm machinery and oil equipment manufacturing is weak On the other hand, auto assemblies, which are a very big component of our economy, are still going full out In general aviation, aircraft for example is a very depressed part of the economy Tourism is very strong, apparently in large part because of people travelling in the United States rather than going abroad  Turning attention to the nation, our projections are very similar to the staff projections But increasingly, I am concerned about the pickup we have been expecting in the third and fourth quarters as well as in 1987 because it seems largely dependent upon the net export position The swing that the staff has built in is fairly dramatic between now and the first quarter of 1987 If that does not come to pass, it seems to me that the economy is going to continue to buck along at a 2 percent [rate] in the period ahead; and it seems to me that perhaps that's not satisfactory for the long pull To the extent that monetary policy [through] interest rate levels can impact that, I guess I would be more inclined today to do something along that line than I have been in the past, even though it will help only at the margin and not be of great benefit in my view to my  -35-    7/8-9/86  section of the country But at the national level, I'm coming closer to feeling the need to do something more in the monetary policy area   First of all, let me say that I would prefer to leave it at 6 to 9 percent, given a forecast that falls within a very narrow range for the remainder of 1986 and 1987--and particularly given that only a modest acceleration of inflation is being forecast Furthermore, the fact is that we'll be in the fifth year of a recovery That wouldn't seem to me to be the time to be moving money growth to the lower level to give the impression that we're going to work against inflation, when indeed the [inflation] forecast is pretty modest for the period ahead   That contemplates setting a range for 1987?   But if we did re-establish [an M1 range] in February, the markets quite likely would make a lot more out of it than if we just re-established 3 to 8 percent now and then changed it as we looked at it in February I would opt to leave 3 to 8 percent in for 1987   I wonder why you use all those words?   I would be counted in the alternative A [camp] with a discount rate decrease and $300 million on borrowing   The answer to that is ""yes,"" as far as I am concerned "
3030,1986-08-19," You spoke of the September 1 date to publish reserves That has nothing to do with this? There will be no drawing on this?   Is this shared with the Treasury?   I guess I've always been--   Well, we did pass this spring, which would normally have been a time for a coupon purchase, right?   For a reason?   From our perspective in the heartland, there has been some encouragement taken from the recent legislation for export subsidies of farm products--farm exports being a very big component part of our exports I guess my question to Ted would be Have you factored in the result of that subsidy program?   The last time we took the lead in reducing the discount rate there were clearly great expectations, I thought, that some of the secondary countries such as France, the United Kingdom, and others would follow along, and they did not   Then you wouldn't expect them to move until Germany moves?   They spent quite a large sum of reserves supporting it   Hasn't Germany as well?   My preference would be for a discount rate decrease of one-half percentage point with the $300 million borrowing level, which would result in roughly a 5-3/4 percent [funds rate] Or, if we wanted to go some place between ""A"" and ""B,"" if you will, to raise that borrowing level to the $400 million range as opposed to the $300 million range would give us some flexibility if we wanted to go  -42-    8/19/86  on down adjusting the borrowing range But in terms of the greater question as to whether or not I would opt for some ease, the answer is yes The way I would love to do it is with a discount rate decrease I would not favor some lesser borrowing level because I think we are getting fairly close to some sort of frictional level We could lose control Then, you are right on an interest rate target The second part of that recommendation does include the international It seems to me that we are the only catalyst and have the only tools that would make the Germans and the Japanese move if they are going to move at all If we don't move, they are not going to move To the extent that the lower dollar would help us on exports, or as an alternative that they would move and give us a little more stimulation, I think that is the prescription that we need to follow   I thought that was the sense of the discussion   I understand that But if they do not, then the dollar will fall in some relationship to their currencies and make us more competitive in international markets Either one of those two if they move, that would be the better of the two; but if they don't then we get, hopefully, some benefit from a bit of ease domestically   With that understanding, I would agree "
3056,1986-09-23," Does that mean it's not inflationary the way they're doing it?   If two or three large banks get into trouble and we're providing reserves through the discount window, though, there could be a liquidity problem even with these numbers   Traditionally, or within the last few years, we've done a couple of bill purchases in providing longer-term reserves and the market expects that   Yes, coupon purchases Does this in any way alter that policy? Would we not do a coupon pass if--   And you'd just shorten it up by not taking as much on new issues then?   Yes, on new issues   Thank you, Mr Chairman In the Tenth District I'm not sure that the cautious optimism is present The District as a whole, as I think the Committee knows, has not performed as well over the past year or two as the national economy--measured by either total    9/23/86  employment or unemployment numbers, personal income gains, and things of that nature There is the difference between the urban and the rural that I've spoken of before However, in my most recent meetings with businessmen, I found the views of urban businessmen across a fairly wide range of activities a bit more pessimistic than in the past That is to say, they understand that the economy even in the urban areas is operating at a fairly low level, but they don't have any great optimism that there is any light at the end of the tunnel that gives them much hope that it's going to improve over the near term That seems to me to be a bit of a change The other side of that coin is that they have apparently no concern, or little concern, that inflation or inflationary expectations will be revived As a result, in the urban areas activity is rocking along at kind of an unsatisfactory rate but at least on the positive side  On the agricultural side on the other hand, there is very little improvement other than in the areas Bob Boykin just referred to--that is, in the red meat sector prices of both hogs and cattle have come up and are at very good levels There are good profit margins simply because the [cost of] feed that is necessary to put those animals to market is less; as a result the profit margins in red meat industries are very good If you look at net farm income, however, you could build a fairly good case that it will be about the same level in 1986 as it was in 1985 If you look a little deeper you will find, however, that the net farm income is largely attributable to government programs It's merely a transfer from the federal Treasury to the producers that gives you net farm income that is nearly equal to last year On the other hand, the net exports of agricultural products will be at the lowest level in 20 years We will have a net export position of agricultural products that is something over $7 billion; a couple of years ago that was in the $30 billion range So, the impact of the dollar hasn't hit, and probably won't hit, in that sector simply because there is production beyond the US boundaries that is supplying the demand that we used to supply So the outlook in the farm area is not very bright  In the energy area, much as Bob Boykin has indicated, there is a little activity but there's still a great reluctance to do very much exploration simply because of the uncertainty of what OPEC's impact will be on energy prices They are afraid not that the oil price will go to $20 but rather that it will go back down to $8 or $10 and they will be in the midst of drilling a well that will not pay off if they are successful in hitting oil So, overall, the District is rocking along at a very low level But in a sense the tenor seems positive, except for the foreclosures in the agricultural sector and the lack of activity in the energy sector   I will join those who prefer ""B"" notwithstanding some of the comments I made earlier in the discussion with respect to M2 and M3 and the concern that we should be expressing to the market, either verbally or otherwise, that we are not abandoning the aggregates I share some of those feelings, but if we are going to rock along at 2-1/2 or 3 percent growth, I would hate to be focusing on M2 and M3 going marginally above the top of their range and take some action to tighten up So, I conclude that ""B"" is the appropriate course now and I would not be very receptive to any movement in the period ahead if M2 and M3 are going to exceed their targets in just a marginal way   That's still okay   Mr Chairman, I would like to raise a question on the other side--that is, with regard to the language of 7 to 9 percent on M2 and M3 and the importance of that language with regard to snugging up a bit or oozing up a bit We are at the top of those ranges now and I guess I have an operational question as to how either you or the Desk would respond What would you do if M2 and M3 started coming in at 9-1/2 or 10 percent and the economy was working along without much problem? Would you then ooze up? Unless you saw some real strength in the economy, I would hope you wouldn't ooze up until M2 and M3 burst out as Jerry Corrigan described it   It's not triggered off 9 percent; it's something higher than 9 percent "
3082,1986-11-05," Mr Chairman, with respect to the national picture, we don't have any serious difference with the Greenbook forecast This time again, as has been said around the table, that [forecast] depends greatly upon the turnaround in our net export position; absent that we would expect a still positive rate of growth but more in the 1 to 1-1/2 percent range So it's extremely important that we get that kind of turnaround to achieve 3 percent growth in the next five quarters  With regard to the District economy, not a great deal has changed We still have the unbalanced condition that Gary Stern described in his District of the urban versus the rural areas Urban  -20-    11/5/86  areas seem to be doing very well with the exception of the oil patch cities; Oklahoma City and Tulsa still are very depressed, but other cities such as Denver and Kansas City, or even Omaha, are moving along at fairly good clips--particularly the Kansas City area Manufacturing in the District is very mixed Auto production--and we are fairly large in auto assembly within the District--is moving along at a full two-shift operation The rumor that we have heard is that instead of 12 GM plants closing it's only 6 and at least one is in the Kansas City area However, the offset to that is that there is a very large plant being constructed now in Kansas City; so it may involve just an upgrading of their plant facilities, as far as our local economy is concerned Interestingly enough, the high-tech sector, particularly the chip industry in Kansas City and in Denver, seems to have an uptick and that is largely attributed to the relationship of the dollar The strengthening seems to have come about even though their competition was, among others, Taiwan Although that relationship hasn't changed, apparently they feel that they are back in competition again where they were priced out of competition at an earlier time With regard to other manufacturing sectors--such as farm equipment and oil field equipment--those are still very depressed, largely because of the agricultural situation  With regard to agriculture, net farm income will be essentially the same as it was last year But breaking that down, the red meat sector--I'm talking about hogs and beef prices--has been very good With the low commodity feed prices they have an all-time good spread; so there is money being made in that That's being used largely to service some of the agricultural debt and hopefully it will buy a little more time In the farm sector, we just completed our third-quarter survey and two things fall out of that One is that the decline in agricultural [land] prices continues The second quarter showed a decrease in agricultural real estate values of about 2 percent and that continues in the third-quarter survey, as contrasted with a decline of 6 to 7 percent in the fourth quarter of 1985 So the decline is slowing and, hopefully, we are getting at or near the bottom The other important number that falls out of that survey of agricultural banks is the fact that the loan-to-deposit ratio is the lowest that it has been since our survey started in 1976 That is, it is now resting at a 52 percent loan-to-deposit ratio in agricultural banks That's largely attributed to the fact that there is a lot of liquidity but there are no good agricultural loans that they can find; as a result, they are sitting with that liquidity   I think it's ""slightly""  -27-    11/5/86   I think we ought to take a vote "
3105,1986-12-15," I would join those who would opt to maintain M1 as an aggregate and also to set a monitoring range To be sure, I'd adopt language not unlike what we have done in most recent times--that is, that we will pay attention to it, but only in relationship to M2, M3, and other developments--and as a result keep it in front of the public for purposes of going back to it sometime in the future, which I'm convinced we will have to do   Thank you, Mr Chairman Our view is very close to, and consistent with, the Greenbook forecast I think that is an acceptable outlook, and I would join those who say that if we achieve    12/15-16/86  27 or 28 percent growth in the fifth year of recovery, that's a pretty good record given the projection for prices  On the regional front, the situation has not changed greatly from what has been reported before--that is, we have an uneven recovery, with severely depressed conditions in the energy, agricultural, and aircraft sectors of the economy I suppose we can take some comfort from the fact that our most recent agricultural survey shows that the decline in agricultural real estate values is moderating That is the second quarter in a row in which declines have averaged only 2 percent, as contrasted with earlier declines of 6 to 7 percent in each quarter Those values now are roughly 50 percent of what they were in 1981 at their highs I take some comfort from the discussion about exports, particularly Ted Truman's indication yesterday that agricultural exports have picked up I must tell you, however, that we don't see any of that activity in the Tenth District As a matter of fact, the crop this year has been a bumper crop virtually across all crop lines, and the good news is that the red meat industry--both beef and hogs--together with the government subsidies are returning some cash income to our agricultural producers  On the energy side, there has been a bit of an uptick in the rig count from 215 to 223; that's cited as a great improvement in our District! But having met last week with a very small group of Oklahoma businessmen, I can tell you that pessimism pervades that part of the country, both because of energy and agriculture And the situation regarding bank failures is very, very gloomy; they can see no light at the end of the tunnel, if you will, so they are just hunkering down and hoping that something magic happens that will bring them out of this depressed state I don't see what that will be either, I might tell you In the aircraft industry, there is a further decline--that is, layoffs, simply because they cannot compete on an international basis given the value of the dollar and there is no [new] domestic demand for purchases of aircraft, largely because of the very big pool of used aircraft As companies have cut back over the years, one of the first things that went was their airplane As a result, new aircraft just are not coming off the line or selling, so the industry is simply laying off the people All in all, it seems to me that we have quite a long ways to go in the Tenth District to join the rest of the country in the recovery But it seems to me that the Greenbook forecast is quite reasonable for the nation as a whole   ""B"" and symmetric   Because that's what we had this past time In other words, it's consistent with what we had in the last--   But would you be easing policy through the Desk or would you be considering a discount rate decrease under those circumstances?   [The press] would have a good story with this "
3129,1987-02-10," Mr Chairman, I didn't hold up my hand, but--   Well, I think that since I am about the last [speaker], I will say something Our forecast is very much like the Board staff's on the growth side; we are a touch higher on the inflation side If one were to make a forecast from the Tenth District perspective, none of those figures would be very satisfactory; they would be much more pessimistic On the forecast itself, the growth is largely dependent, as everybody has already noted, upon the turnaround in the net export sector If that occurs, then growth much as we experienced in 1986 seems to me to be quite reasonable On the other hand, on the price side it seems to me that our foreign competitors' import prices will have to rise since their profit margins have been squeezed over the last year and a half as the dollar has declined vis-a-vis their currencies And that should start to show through together with an increase in imported oil prices If that were to occur, and as that is passed through, it would seem to me that inflation would be a bit higher than we experienced last year Having said that, I think it is noteworthy, as Governor Heller mentioned, that the CPI--which will incorporate those higher import prices--quite likely will be in the 4 to 5 percent range And it's going to take some explanation, I guess by the Chairman, of the contrast between the slow CPI numbers posted in 1986 with what likely will happen in 1987 and why this may not be all that significant--why it looks very high and should [not] give us all cause for concern   That's the reason they pay you that big money, Mr Chairman! In summary, our forecast is very close to the Board staff's forecast with the exception that we think prices may be a touch higher   I would also favor alternative II I don't have a great deal of faith in M2 or M3 as a guide to policy If you look back over the history of M2, for example, over the last 5 or 6 years it has varied between 8 and 9 percent except, I believe, for 1983 Many things have happened--policies have changed, interest rates have dropped--and still growth comes out to be 8 to 9 percent As a result, it doesn't seem to me that it's a very reliable guide   We expect to see--   I have a little problem with the thought that we would, at a particular meeting, resurrect M1 for some limited period of time or forevermore I don't think we know enough about it to do that unless we got into a real bind in which we needed to call upon M1 in order to move interest rates to 20 percent I wouldn't want to use--   That's a bit different than establishing a target for an intermediate period   I assume also that this M1 performance would be evaluated in view of the other aggregates that we have set targets for   It doesn't make any difference   Isn't that the same as January to April?   Isn't a precedent condition of this arrangement that they agree to stimulate their economies? And is that to be a public announcement of some sort   That presumes that we'll know what the appropriate growth is "
3153,1987-03-31," Wonderful thought, Martha   Mr Chairman, our current published [foreign currency] directive limits our operations to countering disorderly market conditions This last episode seems to me maybe not to fall into that category; rather it seems that we are getting awfully close to a managed float situation which--   To be sure But the point is either that the directive should be changed if we are going to go the route that we have been on the last couple of weeks or, in the alternative, that we shouldn't be doing what we have been doing--other than the commitment that was made in Paris That speaks to changing the directive   Article IV, as I read it, is not a constraint or type of directive, so I go back to the simple phrase countering disorderly markets    3/31/87   Well, I understand the term countering disorderly markets can be interpreted [differently] and I guess that's the prerogative of the Chairman's subcommittee or the Committee In my mind, what we have been engaging in does not fall within that category   Maybe somebody should look at it, at least   I have been on the call the last several weeks, Martha, and I think they have been very skillful at that, in terms of attempting to do what needs to be done domestically but dealing with this international situation that is overhanging the market And I think they have handled it well   Jim, for the fourth quarter of 1987, your projection in this Greenbook shows personal consumption expenditures down about 1-1/2 percentage points from last Greenbook to roughly a half percent What are the factors?   Just to continue on with a question about consumption If you look at services, particularly beginning in the second quarter of 1987, growth rates spend most of their time, actually, at less than 1-1/2 percent Is there any time that we have ever experienced that other than in a recession? Secularly, growth of service expenditures is probably more in the range of 3 percent plus I think on a cyclical basis we have seen it for a couple of quarters, but nothing like this   This goes back to the old story You are depending greatly upon the turnaround in net exports to make this a palatable forecast    3/31/87   Thank you, Mr Chairman With respect to the staff's forecast of the economy we have no great quarrel I will just say that we are a touch stronger on personal consumption and less optimistic about the turnaround in net exports to the extent of about $5 billion or so Where we would differ is on the projection for prices On the deflator, for example, we are roughly a half percentage point or more higher than the staff I think this has been mentioned two or three times around the table up to this point and we would be consistent with those comments  With respect to the District, I am delighted to tell you that over the past couple of weeks, in meetings with boards of directors, businessmen, bankers and others, there is a decided turn in the outlook More optimism has been expressed over the past two weeks to a month, I think, than I have seen in our part of the country for three, or maybe even four, years There isn't a great deal of good hard evidence that there has been a turnaround It may be part of the optimism that comes in the Midwest when the sap begins to rise-- people's outlooks become a bit more optimistic I was accused of that by Governor Angell when I mentioned it to him earlier But the fact of the matter is that there is some evidence of a turnaround For  -23-    3/31/87  example, in Oklahoma, there has been some leasing activity in the oil and gas area with leases on a three-year basis of $35 to $50 an acre That is not a great amount compared with what they got two or three years ago, but it does provide a cash flow that eases some of the strains for the lenders, particularly those small banks located in the petroleum-producing areas  Also, as has been mentioned earlier, there seems to be some stabilization in the price of agricultural real estate There are reports that some sales have taken place in remote areas such as western Nebraska in which fairly good prices were established; and some sales are actually moving property There's an interesting development that's occurring with the Farm Credit System It started with the St Paul Farm Credit Bank, and perhaps Gary Stern can expand on it, but they are adopting a new program in which they are going to accelerate the sale of the agricultural real estate that they now have by using a program of incentives based upon term, price, and particularly interest rates For example, they will go as low as 49 percent for 3, 5, or 7 years, and after that time the interest rate rises to a market interest rate for the 25- to 30-year amortization period of the loan It is obvious that the price of the property that is being sold is not the true price because of the incentives being granted But it is something that has received some rather positive comments And if you are concerned about the amount of land that might be dumped on the market through this by the Farm Credit System or other lenders, let me just tell you that there are about 4-1/4 million acres now in the hands of lenders and that represents only about 5 percent of the agricultural real estate that is normally sold in any given year So it is not a big amount but it may mask a bit the problems in the Midwest because much of it is centered there There is an optimistic tone that hasn't been present in the past   Thank you, Mr Chairman I think Jerry Corrigan captured my feelings very well That is, I would favor no immediate change in policy but I would be prepared to move to a higher borrowing level Having that in mind, and trying to capture that within the framework of the way we talk about these things, that is somewhere in the ""B-C"" area I'm not sure that I would be prepared to go to $500 million On the other hand, I feel that there may be some advantage to showing some modestly higher interest rates earlier rather than later--that is, to permit the market to understand that somewhat higher interest rates effected by the Federal Reserve, as opposed to just the technical factors, would be acceptable in the near term However, the point is--and I think Jerry made this point very well-- that this does not mean a change in Federal Reserve policy but rather the management of Federal Reserve policy at or about the level that we presently operate The other thing that I would just mention is that,    3/31/87  contrary to some other comments that have been made, I would move the reference on the dollar in the directive to a more prominent level; I would move it up in that sentence as proposed in the directive language and as mentioned by Don Kohn   I have the impression from the discussion around the table that the only tightening that would take place would be to manage the dollar to some lower level in an orderly fashion rather than that we would tighten policy for any other reason That is to say, I think the original intent was not to tighten policy except to manage the dollar down to a lower level  -47-    3/31/87   During the 7-week intermeeting period?   I assume from the discussion that what we are talking about in terms of restraint is only roughly a quarter of a percent in any event   It's only roughly a quarter of a percentage point, in any event, measured in terms of the federal funds rate About 6-1/4 percent, I think, was the sentiment around this table  -55-    3/31/87 "
3171,1987-04-29," Just a perspective question, Mr Chairman If indeed, for whatever reason, the dollar begins to firm or to settle at its current level, would that suggest that we move to or near the $300 million level? "
3187,1987-05-19," When you speak of Germany, do you include all of Europe or the major players?   Do you call that speculation?   Thank you, Mr Chairman As to the outlook on a national level, we're very close to the Greenbook forecast; I have no real quarrel with it We're just a tad higher on inflation than the Greenbook, but beyond that, it seems to be a reasonable forecast  With respect to the region, it seems to me that there has been a bit of a change in the outlook of participants in the business, agricultural, and energy sectors It isn't clear to me why, because the numbers don't really reveal that things have turned up What has occurred includes developments that have been mentioned around the table for example, the stabilization, or the lack of further decline, in agricultural land prices; and a bit of greater activity in the energy sector, both in the petroleum and natural gas area It may be that, as a result of having looked at a decline over roughly the last 3 to 4 years, when people don't see the decline continuing then that's cause for optimism As a matter of fact, in the agricultural sector, for example--and the comments about the agricultural land prices stabilizing are revealed in our most recent survey as well--there have been some fairly sizable agricultural land sales, but they are generally led by the Federal Land Bank And those are all induced by concessional interest rate arrangements That is, they will sell but they'll finance at 2, 3, or 4 percent and, therefore, it makes it reasonable for some of the producers to pick up that land When it comes to other land sales, we find they are largely to the farmer next door who wasn't caught in the debt burden situation and who simply believes that the agricultural land values at the moment are such that he wants to add to his other land holdings and can make the numbers work at these prices I would say that this quarter was the first time in six years that agricultural land values have not continued the decline And they're roughly now 55 percent of what they were in value in 1981 That is coupled with other things in the agricultural area--for example, the projection that the wheat crop that will be harvested starting now and into June and July will be something in the neighborhood of the sixth largest wheat crop ever produced, which means that the government agricultural policy is the one that is going to pick up and buy that grain unless exports pick up There has been some euphoria, if you will, among those producers because of the Russian agricultural wheat and grain sale and export prospects In the cattle/red meat market, they are still making money and that should continue  With regard to the question of inflation, in talking with the agricultural and small business representatives, our Board of Directors, and other business people, I don't hear as much talk about price increases in our region as I've just heard around this table As a matter of fact, I've heard of some price increases being put in place but not sticking; they are backing off from them If we're concerned about inflation--which obviously we should be if our objective is price stability--it seems to me that the pressures are coming largely from food and energy and import prices Those all should be one-time increases As a result, unless one believes that inflationary expectations are going to be built into the wage levels,  -16-    5/19/87  I don't believe we should be taking actions, at this point at least, to offset higher prices coming from those sources alone   Thank you, Mr Chairman In my view, what has happened is not a result of Federal Reserve monetary policy management The fact that we have a 6-3/4 percent, or a 6-7/8 to 7 percent, funds rate is largely a result of the markets' misconception or perception of what has occurred That is, I still view our borrowing target as $400 million, with $850 million excess reserves; with the technical problems that the Desk has encountered, we didn't hit that simply because the market took it elsewhere Further, given the forecast of domestic growth--which is fairly modest, it seems to me, at 2-1/2 to 3 percent--the only reasons that one could justify raising the interest rates at this point, either through open market operations or the discount rate, are (1) if you were concerned about inflation, and I don't share that at the moment; or (2) to support the dollar It is my understanding that for the moment the dollar is  -30-    5/19/87  fairly stable So, neither one of those two things looms very large to me and, as a result, I would probably generally opt to go with ""B"" But given the uncertainty in the market and the fact that they have taken the rate up, to come down too quickly would put some downward pressure on the dollar As a result, I would go with a ""B/C"", with a borrowing level of about $500 million But that would be simply to moderate the downward movement of interest rates if we can achieve that without putting pressure on the dollar   But we sought $400 million   Having said that, Mr Chairman, what level of borrowing do you have in mind?   This policy implies a 6-3/4 percent fed funds rate?   For what? "
3210,1987-07-07," Just to follow up on Tom Melzer's question If you look at the quarterly pattern of prices measured by the CPI, the implicit deflator, or otherwise, you really end up 1988 at about the same level as the second quarter of 1987 But I think you may have just answered my question when you said to Tom that the rise in interest rates is what pulls that to about that level Is it?   Given the capacity utilization you're projecting of roughly 80-81 percent and the unemployment rate of about 6-1/2 percent, it could turn out not to show through in prices if indeed the dollar does not fall We may not need the various interest rates that you have built into the projection   Mr Chairman, I would opt to retain the ranges for 1987 In listening to Don Kohn, and if I read the Bluebook correctly, the reason that we would be at or below the range is the anticipation that interest rates will rise If interest rates remain at current levels or somewhat lower, then I believe the projection is that we would come within the ranges established in February I don't--  -34-    7/7/87   My point is that if we change the ranges now to lower them, it does imply that we believe interest rates will rise over the next six months I am not prepared to make that kind of assumption   I would opt for alternative II with the 5 to 8 percent, simply because I've been persuaded to keep a little of the powder dry If indeed in February alternative II of 4-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent looks appropriate, we would have an opportunity to adjust it at that time I wouldn't use up all my ammunition in midyear when it doesn't mean a whole lot for the next year   Do we have to say anything at all about the next six months and the fact that we are coming in at or near the bottom or even maybe below the bottom? I don't think the market perceives that we are going to take any action at this table to try to come within the M2 range within the next six months "
3236,1987-08-18," It is a simple matter, however, to get that authority by wire if the need exists   Thank you, Mr Chairman Let me comment that I think our forecast parallels the forecast that appears in the Greenbook this time But a question, I guess to Mike With regard to the really sharp swing that you have between the third and fourth quarters in personal consumption expenditures, and the resulting buildup in inventories, which we have somewhat [unintelligible] for the period ahead, is that in your forecast totally as a result of the auto sales picture that you've described?   No other factors--   The other question I would pose has to do with your outlook on inflation and your rather sharp jump in the unit labor    8/18/87  cost that appears between the third and fourth quarters and continues on out through the projected period It's my impression, at least, that other than the autos that come up in September, the union-labor negotiations [calendar] is very thin, and we can't see where you're getting that kind of a jump in the output, the decrease in productivity, and so forth   Thank you, Mr Chairman I've already made comments with respect to our outlook and our general agreement with the Greenbook forecast I'd like to make this very brief, in view of the time The regional economy that we're experiencing in the Tenth District has some positive outlook to it in the sense that, as others have already commented, the agricultural sector is having and will have one of its best years, with this major rise in net farm income There has been a good crop The red meat industry is in very, very good shape As a result, there has been some uptick, or at least modest turnaround, in what had been falling agricultural land values One survey shows that from the first quarter to the second quarter, agricultural land values have increased about 1-1/2 percent; and that's to be contrasted with a long period of declining land values I would just note, however, that the sales that have translated into that greater land value number are one of two kinds 1) cash transactions in which neighboring producers are picking up depressed or troubled land ownership; or 2) the Farm Credit System is offering very attractive financing rates to move land off of their books in order to avoid any additional loss I would just note that, as a result of this, the margins in the production of red meat are very good at the moment However, the inventory is beginning to build, and we would expect that there would be little or no additional pressure on prices from the food sector as a result of the [uninteligible]--no real hope of increased commodity prices either in terms of crops or red meat Lastly, there is some optimism being generated in the energy sector There is some drilling now taking place; the rig count is up modestly from a month or two ago So, psychologically, given what we see, we would expect things to continue to improve but at a very slow rate In the commercial real estate area, we have overbuilding in Denver, Oklahoma City, and Tulsa, which is depressing that market; and those conditions, obviously, rose out of the depressed conditions of agriculture and energy that they depend on greatly We believe things are looking up, but we have a long upward pull to get back to better conditions than we have now   Thank you, Mr Chairman A good deal of comment has already been made about the growth--that it's perhaps a bit stronger than we were expecting last month But, I would just note that if you believe the forecast, and I think virtually everybody agrees with the Greenbook, you're only looking at 2-3/4 percent growth in the third and fourth quarters That doesn't seem to me to be overly expansive And, there is considerable uncertainty as to the inflation outlook, at least in my mind To be sure, prices are quite likely to be up, but as a result of feeding through on import prices; and I'm not at all sure that a bit tighter monetary policy is an appropriate prescription under those circumstances As a result, I would favor ""B"", with $500 million borrowing, until some additional evidence comes along I would note, in that respect, for those who believe that the aggregates are important and that there is some informational content in them, that they're growing at a very nominal rate now As a result, to further tighten at this point, in anticipation of some higher prices, seems to me to be inappropriate So I would go for ""B"" with a $500 million borrowing level until some more information surfaces that would lead us away from that Lastly, I would prefer to leave the language with respect to the dollar in the directive because, in my view, monetary policy has to act against a depreciation in the dollar that becomes fast, no matter what the cause And, as a result, I would leave it in, and I would even leave it at a fairly high level of visibility in the directive   The alternative is to state it in terms of about 5 percent for both "
3261,1987-09-22," There is some comment in the press saying that the G-10 or the G-7 had adjusted their target levels from 140 or 160 to 13150 Is that rumor, or is that--?   Mr Chairman, I have a couple of questions for Mike with respect to the sections that caught my eye in the forecast You mentioned that a further decline in the dollar was assumed in your forecast As I remember, the Greenbook only made reference to a decline much like that projected in the last Greenbook Further, as I remember, that decline was 10 percent on an annual basis, and most of that had been completed in the first half of the year Am I correct, or is there further decline assumed?   My second question has to do with your assumption about rising interest rates in the fourth quarter To be very specific, do you have a level of interest rates in the fourth quarter that you assumed in this forecast?   In the first quarter?   My last question has to do with your comment about inflation picking up--I guess that's in 1988, if I read the Greenbook numbers correctly, because your forecast has it actually declining in the last quarter of this year, as measured by the fixed- weight index or the deflator itself    9/22/87   So is it fair to say, Mike, that inflation in the second half, and particularly in the last quarter and maybe even into the first quarter of 1988, is reasonably stable in your forecast?   Thank you, Mr Chairman I will try to be very brief in view of the coffee being outside! With respect to the Tenth District, we do see some very, very modest recovery Looking at various sectors of the economy, starting with agriculture commodity prices are up; red meat prices are very good; government transfer payments are outstanding; and, as a result, there is some comfort in the agricultural sector--or at least among those who are still in the sector Lastly, I would say that our most recent survey indicates that agricultural land prices have stabilized, and there is a modest uptick in those prices as well So, agriculture, from a very low level, has a good outlook for the rest of 1987 and quite likely in 1988, depending upon what the farm subsidy program will be in 1988 When you look at energy, the same is true from a very, very low base it looks a bit better In July, for example, there were 373 rigs working in the Tenth District as opposed to [unintelligible] in June That's not much of an uptick, to be sure, and it is only 20 percent of the level that was achieved in 1982, which was the peak of the energy boom So, it is still at a very low level [Unintelligible] supporting a bit Commercial real estate has been very depressed in Denver, Oklahoma City, and Tulsa--those areas that built on expectations [generated by] the energy and agricultural booms back in the early 1980s, inflationary expectations, [unintelligible] There is a very slow absorption rate of some very nice and new commercial structures In the Kansas City area there has been some damping in commercial construction, but nonetheless, it still looks very prosperous In some areas, there has been a bit of damping in residential starts and sales, but activity is still above a year ago throughout the District in the aggregate One last point that I would make with respect to economic activity in the District would be on the manufacturing sector the automobile industry is not working at full production and, as a matter of fact, there continue to be layoffs in plants, particularly in the Kansas City area, in the GM plants specifically There has been a bit of light at the end of the tunnel in the aircraft industry in the sense that sales most recently have been up in dollar volume but down in unit sales, largely because the sales are of jet aircraft as opposed to the smaller units  Let me just address, then, our view of the staff forecast They are a bit more bullish than we are We look for about 2-3/4  -27-    9/22/87  percent growth not only for the remainder of 1987 but into 1988 In trying to look at their forecast in relation to our numbers, I believe the difference is that they have a buildup in inventories in the fourth quarter that goes out into 1988 That may be the difference in their forecast and ours, but it is such a modest difference that I don't think there would be a lot to argue about To be perfectly honest, I hope their forecast occurs I don't feel there is much risk on the upside, however, of this getting away from us  Lastly, as to your question on long-term bond rates, I suspect it is a part of all three of the things that have been mentioned I guess I would come out on the side of giving more weight to the view that it is an increase in real rates necessary to attract funds to support this federal budget deficit as opposed to just inflationary expectations The uncertainty created by all of this largely accounts for it; how you disaggregate it, I don't know   Mr Chairman, I would support the proposition I would prefer, however, to drop back to the $500 million borrowing  -34-    9/22/87  level You said it doesn't take us much from where we are currently, but if, indeed, $100 million equates to about 1/4 percent [on the federal funds rate] you are looking at least at that amount more yet to take place that the market has not perceived And, since the market doesn't know we have been at $600 million, the $500 million seems more appropriate to me, and that would be my choice   But he hasn't been too well the last two maintenance periods, have you, Peter? "
3291,1987-11-03," Well, Mr Chairman, I don't think that I can; so I will respectfully pass   Thank you, Mr Chairman I would join those who would opt for ""B"" with asymmetric language towards ease--that is, if ""B"" as it has been defined means a funds rate around 6-3/4 percent or a bit higher, and I think it clearly does I also would adopt the Corrigan language, particularly if I understood Jerry correctly, that he wants to delete from Variant I the language referring to relatively frequent consultations I think that highlights something that six weeks or eight weeks from now, when this is released, perhaps will have more meaning than we want to give to it On the federal funds rate range--although quite clearly we are targeting the federal funds rate within some very narrow range, it is under very unusual circumstances--to change that language in the last sentence from 5 to 9 percent to 4 to 8 percent is a bit meaningless and, in my view, unnecessary I'd leave it at the present range and keep it as broad at it is   I'd prefer just to maintain 5 to 9 percent "
3313,1987-12-15," Thank you, Mr Chairman As to the fundamental question of whether to stay with the federal funds rate or go to a nonborrowed or a borrowed reserve target, I think I would be one of only three or four here who sat around this table when we targeted federal funds back in the 1970s And I can tell you that our experience was not very good, as everybody knows There was a lot of tugging and pulling to go an eighth of a point on the federal funds rate As a matter of fact, we even got to the point of setting a zone of indifference where the federal funds could move a quarter of a point between two established points And the fact is that the information that came from that procedure was well behind the facts and got us into trouble, in my view I think we have to move back to a procedure of targeting nonborrowed reserves Also, I would join Tom Melzer in his proposal to do it, first of all, as quickly as possible, and secondly, under the umbrella of uncertainty that surrounds the year-end I would opt for alternative (3) in the sense that we shouldn't totally ignore the federal funds rate over this next three- to four-week period But I think the focus should be on the borrowing level and--   No, no, I beg your pardon, I didn't I should not have said that; I meant a borrowing target And I'd do it under the umbrella, or the smokescreen, of the year-end uncertainty   That would be the zone of indifference   I can tell you, Frank, having had several of these special situations, that the market knows about as early as the Federal Reserve does that a bank is in for special borrowing They do discount it, in a sense, I think   Pardon me?  STERNLIGHT(?) When it gets to--   Before it gets to extended credit, it's fairly well known and the banks are fairly well identified But suggesting that we would actually--   Yes, the dollars--   Some of you don't   Could you speak up a little, Jerry, please?   I've forgotten what I was going to say Well, given the fact that we have to set growth targets for something under the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, what has come out of this paper, it seems to me at least, is that M2 is perhaps the best of what may be bad choices M1A may be about the same, but given the fact that M2 is better understood by the public and the markets, I would continue with M2 There's one other aspect--and I'm not quite sure that this is correct, but my recollection is that Canada has in recent years set a target over a longer horizon than one year I think perhaps it's a two-year target with a moving base and they use that merely for the purpose of determining whether they are above or below the trend line of growth that they were shooting for That has some attractiveness to me, and I think that may be what we should be doing with M2 over a longer-term horizon I think Canada abandoned that, simply because they determined that it was more important for them in current times to focus on exchange rates, relative to the dollar principally, rather than to hit a monetary target, however they defined it So, it seems to me that we are talking about two different things One is how we would manage monetary policy in the very short run through these intermediate periods; the other is what we should be focusing on, and that is a horizon, and probably for M2, over a one-year or two-year period   Sure  -32-    12/15-16/87   And, in the short run--   Because of deregulation?   I would just ask Sam How much do we have--I am talking about the System and the Exchange Stabilization Fund--as a cache of marks and yen that we can draw upon in the future without swap arrangements?   That means, if we were to continue [intervention purchases of dollars] for a very long period of time, we would have to use our swaps   Well, it's getting late, Mr Chairman I would just add to the optimism in a sense, particularly from the District perspective, although we are lagging the national recovery both in terms of employment gains as well as personal income gains Nonetheless, looking back from where we started, in energy, agriculture, aircraft, and so forth, things are looking much better That's particularly true in the agricultural area, where things such as agricultural real estate values actually have increased in the second quarter--very modestly to be sure, but nonetheless there is an increase Energy rig exploration is something in the neighborhood of 35 percent greater than a year ago However, given what's happening now with the potential fall in the oil prices, I'm not sure that will continue With regard to retail sales, the report that we have is  -68-    12/15-16/87  that they are modestly higher, some 5 percent higher, than the same time last year, with a lot of sales and discounting, which means volume should be moving through those retail elements As a result, I guess I would say we feel better than we did a year ago, and better than we did six months ago The clouds on the horizon might be a drop in energy prices as the result of OPEC's problems and/or a change in the agricultural subsidy provisions from the federal government, both of which would impact the Tenth District However, looking at 1988, the latter would suggest that it will be a fairly good year, given current commodity prices--if they hold up Agricultural exports are very encouraging to the people in our area Those are mostly government-subsidized exports, I might say, but the inventories that built up in the last couple of years are being worked off   Well, the summary would be very short I would favor alternative ""B"", with a symmetric directive With respect to the operating procedures, like several others, I would like to move to alternative (4) as quickly as possible I'd do it under the cover of the year-end uncertainty Alternative (3) has some attractiveness to me, but it seems to me that this Committee ought to be making the decisions rather than putting that burden upon you, Mr Chairman, and Peter on a day-to-day basis As a result, I think alternative (4) ultimately is where we should be And with regard to alternative ""B"", I'd associate that with a federal funds rate in the range of 6-3/4 to 7 percent, with whatever borrowing is commensurate with that, which I assume would be around $350 million to $400 million   Well, this number doesn't appear in the policy record or the directive; it's not in either one   Yes, but it only talks about the level of the borrowing target "
3351,1988-02-09," Thank you, Mr Chairman However, it's always difficult to follow the Eleventh District Over the years, we in the Tenth District have lagged the national economy, both in personal income as well as employment growth, generally throughout the cycle That's true again this time However, there is some optimism it seems to me, given [developments in] two or three primary sectors of our economy For example, in agriculture, which has already been spoken of here, land prices are up; commodity prices are up; and exports appear to be very vigorous and have taken with them the red meat prices, particularly for cattle and hogs The farmers have recovered from a very low level of activity and they're feeling very good, even in the middle of the winter with cold weather I think an important observation, which Gary Stern made, is that there are some real paybacks to the agricultural banks--their outstanding agricultural credit--and that is flowing back into main streets of these small communities Although that sector is not totally reviving, there is some optimism appearing there On the other hand, in the energy sector, apparently because of the lack of any substantive agreement among OPEC members to control supply, what we saw as an uptick early in 1987 in drilling exploration activity has dropped off again in the Tenth District People are simply not willing to commit to financing another hole--to put down another hole to discover whether there is any more resource there One of the bright spots, as mentioned earlier, is in the aircraft orders that have been booked, which impacted our District rather significantly through Boeing, Beech, and other aircraft manufacturers It has given some real hope for an uptick in that sector Commercial construction is winding down in our District It should have wound down in Denver, Oklahoma City, and Tulsa two years ago, and as a result, there are high vacancy rates there But by and large it's being pretty well managed  On the national level, as far as the forecast is concerned, I have no disagreement with the Greenbook My staff would be a bit more pessimistic than I personally, but the Board staff's forecast is right on, as far as I'm concerned And I'd like to echo those comments that have already been made that we don't become overzealous in the first half of the year, or at least the first quarter, in working off the inventories, if indeed that be the case--jockeying monetary policy around to try to accommodate an unforeseen event I'll talk a little more about that tomorrow   Thank you, Mr Chairman I guess, like a couple of others who have sat around this table too long, I'm maybe getting  -39-    2/9-10/88  jaded Let me first say that setting ranges is legally necessary to have some constraining effect on the Committee and monetary policy Therefore, I accept that as being something very good But listening to the discussion around the table brings to mind what I believe was a statement in the Bluebook that the staff forecast falls in any one of these three [alternatives] You're talking about a difference of 1/2 of a percentage point in the midpoint from one to the other And it's minutia The fact of the matter is that any one of them will fit  So, I think Ed Boehne is right As the Bard said, ""all the world's a stage"" and I think that's what we're doing here today That is, [the issue] is what kind of message you give as you testify regarding the intention of the Federal Reserve in the period ahead with respect to economic growth and inflation My own view is that since we already established alternative II in July, we probably don't know much more about what's ahead now than we did in July with respect to a decision on these aggregate ranges Going on a holiday as Jerry suggested, or at least the Federal Reserve doing nothing very dramatic, seems to me to be a very good thing to happen in the period ahead I would reestablish the ranges of alternative II; I think you can do anything you want to with them I think they serve the purpose; and the message that you give in testimony is the more important one  I would not rebase; we've been through that many, many times in the past with a great deal of consternation by Congress and others about what they thought we were rebasing And I don't think we ought to get into that kind of controversy As a result, I could accept the widening of the range to 4 to 8 percent; but to avoid any ripples I'd do 5 to 8 percent--alternative II straight down the line   Mr Chairman, with regard to Lee Hoskins' question about changing the borrowing target--I don't want to focus on whether or not reducing the target $50 million was right or not right for the long-run best interests of the economy--but I am concerned that it was done in such a way that it did not take into consideration the decision made by this Committee and the directive that was issued [when the Committee consulted in early January] There are four kinds of developments in that directive that permit you [as Chairman] to move the borrowing target and I think that decision is left principally in your hands I think there was no evidence--at least it certainly wasn't clear in Kansas City that there was incoming evidence from the fourth-quarter numbers, for example--for the borrowing target to be adjusted down $50 million for the next two-week period It seems to me that decision was outside the confines of the directive itself I raise this without trying to make any other issue out of it But it seems to me it is an important issue that we have to keep in mind   In my view, it's particularly important, given the background of the political pressure that had come from the Treasury people and so forth, that such a decision be a broader-based decision I understand the flexibility that you must have, Mr Chairman, and that the Desk must have This is a structural issue and I only want to raise it   Mr Chairman, I would opt in the short run for alternative B with the existing borrowing target of $250 million I'm concerned about trying to hit a target below that--and I'm talking about the $100, $150, or $200 million--simply because I think there is a frictional level of borrowing where we lose control, particularly if you get seasonal borrowing as $50, $70, or $100 million of that $100  -62-    2/9-10/88  million borrowing target I think you take a real risk if things do not come in as you want in the first quarter and you choose to move against a recession, then you have to do a discount rate decrease And I think the implications of that for the dollar are very great, as Governor Johnson has pointed out As a result, I would stay right where we are with the borrowing target of $250 million On the long run, I favor alternative II with a 5 to 8 percent range for M2; I could accept the 4 to 8 percent range I agree with the point made by Bob Boykin that we have already gone down a half of a percentage point from the targets set for 1987 and if you do another half point, you give the view that you went on the low side That's something I don't want to do "
3375,1988-03-29," There's one other aspect of that the market understood that we were looking at the funds rate And a 16th of a percentage point move in the funds rate moved the market at that time We almost got trapped in our own procedure, in the sense that we had to have a virtual consensus of this Committee and of the then-Chairman to move more than a 16th of a percentage point on the funds rate, simply because the market reacted so violently to it People such as the Chairman used to interpret that data, I'm sure   Thank you, Mr Chairman I agree with a lot that has been said around the table As a matter of fact, some five or six speakers ago Ed Boehne said almost everything that has been said and I agreed with him there   Just in summary, my view is very much as stated by Frank Morris and Bob Forrestal that the current procedure of using the borrowing target as a proxy, if you will, for the federal funds rate or for whatever, gives us some latitude in our operations That seems to me to be desirable at this particular time And I would strongly oppose moving to simply targeting a federal funds rate, or even a federal funds range, because it seems to me that as soon as the market understands that, then it becomes difficult, or almost impossible, to tighten You have to keep it a bit fuzzed up to permit the Committee to operate [unintelligible]  Perhaps the issue that is more important is the question of flexibility And I think the last time I may have made some comments with respect to that and what happened early in February My view has not changed and I hope I stated it clearly then I think the Chairman  -30-    3/29/88  and the Desk need flexibility It's clearly an issue in my mind as to what is a policy change and how that should be communicated, either before or after action is taken; and that has to rest largely on the Chairman's judgment And I'm quite willing to place the responsibility there When you talk about what is a policy change, I don't think that you can quantify that I see in the memorandum that was prepared that there's a suggested procedure on page 7 that if the borrowing target is to be moved, the Chairman would have some latitude to change the borrowing target by $50 million to $100 million I don't know, in some circumstances, whether that's really a policy change But if it were so determined by the Chairman, I would hope that consultation would take place, and take place before the change actually was effected by the Desk  Lastly, I guess I would ask that there be some change in a procedure that I have observed over a number of years, not just the last 6 months or a year at times a policy change, perhaps within the scope of the directive, was made within the week before the FOMC met It was already done before this group gathered around the table I objected strongly to it then, and I would object strongly in the future I would hope that if there is a change, that it would be done either around this table or by consultation on the telephone And I would not be in favor of more meetings in Washington, but it is pretty easy to put together a telephone conference call   Well--   I'd rather do it that way   Yes   In 1985?   Some of them were phone calls; and some of them were recorded because there were actually votes taken Some changes were actually made without telephone calls the week before an FOMC meeting   Everything was--   Mr Chairman, we also have revised up our forecast, particularly for the first quarter, but we still don't come to as strong a forecast for the year as a whole as the Board staff does; we're roughly one percent less than that We have not quite as much growth in the first quarter and substantially less in the second quarter; the third and fourth quarters look about the same The difference largely, as has been mentioned already, is in the projection for inventories We would see the growth of inventories to be somewhat less than in the Board staff's forecast I assume the underlying assumption of the Board staff is that the buildup in the fourth quarter largely was voluntary and will continue at fairly high levels in the period ahead We would think that is not the case, and as a result, that is the difference in the forecast  With respect to the Tenth District, there has not been a great deal of change from what was reported last month I will just go through the various activities Agriculture has had a very good year, largely because of government transfer payments, but also because red meat prices, principally cattle, have been very good Export-related activities have picked up; there is some hope that perhaps in 1988 the government subsidy that goes with that will, in a sense, continue to permit agricultural products to be shipped abroad With regard to energy, what had looked at the end of 1987 to be a bit of a recovery, particularly in terms of exploration, has turned back around because of the instability of energy prices For example, in  -47-    3/29/88  December there were 363 rigs working in the Tenth District; in January that fell to 307, and in February it fell to 271 It's simply a matter of the instability in those prices People are not willing to put their money out to put a hole in the ground and hope that there's something at the bottom of it If some stability comes through OPEC pricing, then I think that very quickly they will be back to exploration in our area With regard to commercial real estate, it's flat in most areas with the exception of Omaha and Kansas City But it's overbuilt in Denver, Oklahoma City, and Tulsa; and as a result, as Bob Boykin has mentioned, that is a long-term workout problem that probably isn't going to get any better in 1988  With regard to the overall tenor, it seems to me that from discussions I've had with people in agriculture and manufacturing and retail business, their feeling is that things are indeed better They would expect 1988 to be better There seems to be no constraint on input goods; there doesn't seem to be any upward pressure on prices I would add an observation on the earlier discussion about the natural rate of unemployment It seems to me that because of what we have been through since 1979 and into the early 1980s, there may be a lag after you reach that natural rate before prices really begin to rise Then people realize it and are willing to take the chance of raising prices, and you get the explosion in prices that I think the Chairman mentioned I think we are on very dangerous ground at the moment with regard to the level of unemployment--whether it's at the natural rate or not I don't know I think you can go for a quarter or so beyond the natural rate before you get that explosion in prices, but I think the danger is on that side "
3398,1988-05-17," Mr Chairman, I too would join those who have a concern about upward interest rate movement However, it seems to me that the risk is on the upside, and there's enough room to take another cut at some restraint without disrupting the markets As a result, I would like to associate with those who would opt for a B-C alternative, which is the $500 million on borrowing; but I'd also include in that asymmetrical language toward further restraint When I focus on moving from the $400 million to $500 million, I would just note that seasonal credit has taken its normal track and has increased rather dramatically since our last meeting from something less than $100 million to--I don't know what it was at the close of this period, but at times it was over $200 million If you have a $400 million objective for borrowing, and over $200 million of that is seasonal, you really are depending upon how you view the seasonal--whether it's    5/17/88  sensitive to interest rate levels or not I really believe that moving to $500 million rather promptly is not a major move, given the makeup of the borrowing level of $500 million As a result, going to $500 million then, with asymmetrical language, would permit us to move on toward the C alternative depending upon what incoming information we may have in two weeks That would be my prescription "
3421,1988-06-29," Maybe a structural question, Mr Chairman Do we have any limiting factors as to how much foreign currency we can accumulate ourselves as opposed to for the Treasury?   Well, isn't it--   Set by this Committee?   Is there a limiting factor as to how much the Treasury can accumulate?   Money?   Thank you, Mr Chairman With respect to economic activity, particularly in its relation to the Tenth District, as you know, we're dominated by agriculture, energy, mining, and manufacturing Three of those activities--agriculture, energy, and mining--have been at very low levels Agriculture has revived in the sense that it's on the recovery path, with evidence such as agricultural land prices continuing to increase 4 to 5 percent in a quarter, for example Having in mind the impact of the drought, however, it isn't clear that that's going to continue And if the drought does worsen--and that's a very iffy situation in the sense that a week or two of rain could wipe out virtually any impact of the drought in our District and would turn the pessimism back to optimism; and I think agriculture would continue on the recovery track  Energy, on the other hand, is flat because of OPEC's indecision and the softening of oil prices Drilling rigs have decreased in total numbers over the last month or two, although they're still about 8 percent or so above year-ago levels Mining is in a recovery stage, but certainly not very brisk Manufacturing is dominated largely by the auto and aircraft industry in the Tenth District Because of production cutbacks, most auto plants--the ones that haven't been closed--are operating on two shifts But that's far from being flat-out production Aircraft, on the other hand, is booming--from the standpoint that both commercial as well as military orders are very great And as a result, that industry is looking up  With respect to your question about wage inflation or price inflation generally, we simply do not have any good evidence that has emerged that would suggest that that's present now, although I would agree with those who suggest that the feeling is right under the surface People we talk to keep talking about inflation, although they can present no real evidence that it's accelerating It seems to me that it may be one of those situations in which things have gotten better, both nationwide and in my District And as things look pretty  -32-    6/29-30/88  good then--and we can't stand prosperity--you begin to look for those things that can destroy what you think is good today And that may be what we're experiencing right now The real risk, obviously, is that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy We do see some wage increases in the public employment sector and particularly in the health [care] sector Nurses, for example, are in very short supply nationally Their wage demands are astronomical and they quite likely are going to get them simply because of the shortage in the supply of nurses  With regard to the Greenbook forecast and the outlook for the next six quarters, we don't have any great divergence from the view that has been presented by the staff I think our view would be that inflation would be a bit less in the remainder of 1988 but would indeed be greater than the staff forecast for the year 1989 as a whole--roughly 1/2 of a percentage point fourth-quarter over fourth- quarter Some of that comes from the projected impact of the drought on prices Our view is that there will be an uptick; it won't be a heavy impact unless the drought worsens very much in 1988 I think the staff would say that that would all kind of roll out early in 1989, but we think there will be an uptick in 1988; we see that continuing in 1989 And as a result, inflation from that component alone would be a bit higher than the staff forecast But by and large we'd accept that forecast as being reasonable I would agree with the earlier statement of Jerry Corrigan that the risk is on the upside and monetary policy will become a bit tight Inflation will rear its ugly head Vigilance! I quit   Mr Chairman, I would reaffirm 1988; I can accept alternative III for 1989 However, I would prefer to maintain the current 4 to 8 range for 1989 for the time being, with the appropriate language in your testimony that another look at the beginning of this upcoming year is something that we would look forward to   It's somewhat similar, yes The record of our ability to forecast has not been terribly good over time And the fact that we are looking out 6 quarters, to me [unintelligible] I'd rather keep the flexibility and look again in February   Mr Chairman, I, too, would agree that your proposal is reasonable and quite acceptable, with one proviso, however--that $600 million does indeed mean 7-1/2 percent and not greatly over that level My point is that it seems to me the next step in the tightening process quite likely is the discount rate And in my own view, it would be an inappropriate action to tighten further now As a result, your proposal of going to $600 million, if that really means a funds rate of about 7-1/2 percent and not greatly higher than that, is very acceptable to me   It should be maintaining   Yes, it sounds that way   The borrowing level itself is not published   It has to be interpreted by market participants I thought that your proposal incorporated the underlying assumption that going to $600 million gives you a 7-1/2 percent funds rate, roughly That seems acceptable to me and that translates in my mind to maintain the current-- "
3443,1988-07-19," Mr Chairman?   Yes, I was I've almost forgotten, Mr Chairman, what I was going to say But let me say that I would agree with the proposal that you have on the table, Mr Chairman, for several reasons Notwithstanding the strength of the dollar, I tend to agree that perhaps lower may be a better projection than higher over some near-term horizon To move up the borrowing target, and therefore, the interest rate level now, seems to me to be a little premature If indeed the dollar were to decline a bit, then it would be time to raise the discount rate perhaps, or even to go further in open market operations On the other hand, I don't see any emerging evidence of inflation yet I agree that we ought to move before that occurs, but the case just isn't very strong, in my mind And I would remind everyone that there remains a good deal of fragility in the financial system And the interest rate level, particularly for the S&Ls, is a very important ingredient as to their health in the future If indeed we will need to raise interest rates--and I'm sure we will sometime in the future--I'd rather wait and see the lagged effects of what we've already done rather than jump out in front "
3462,1988-08-16," Mr Chairman, with respect to the Greenbook forecast, on a year-over-year basis our forecast would be very  -21-    8/16/88  similar However, looking at the shorter term--and I'm taking about the third and fourth quarters, and particularly the third quarter--our forecast is a bit higher I hate to describe it as substantially higher, but in terms of final sales, for example, consumption is roughly a percentage point higher or so in the third quarter and also somewhat higher in the fourth quarter That suggests that the last half of the year is a bit stronger than the Greenbook forecast And it implies, at least to me, some further pressure on wages and prices that may not otherwise be built into the Greenbook over the forecast period  With regard to the regional forecast, as has been the case over the last couple--and perhaps the last three--years, we are improving in the District, but at a pace somewhat slower than the national recovery rate, as measured by personal income, for example, employment, and other similar measures Retail sales are moderately higher than they were a year ago with inventories reported to be about in line--as a matter of fact, being trimmed within the last month or two Auto sales are holding up; measured year-over-year they are a bit higher than a year ago  Two areas that are particularly important in our District are energy and agriculture The level of energy prices has continued to damp the enthusiasm of people for going out and spending money to stick holes in the ground As a result, there is not much enthusiasm--particularly in that belt which would include Oklahoma, parts of Colorado, and Wyoming, which are still depressed because of energy Laid on top of that, obviously, is the agricultural situation of the drought, which has been very varied across the District If you look for example, at Nebraska, parts of Kansas, and western Oklahoma, they've had ample rain and the crops will reflect that If you look, on the other hand, at eastern Kansas, Missouri, and up into Si's area in Iowa and on east beyond that, the drought has had a very serious impact  Having that in mind, our numbers are a bit stronger than the Greenbook It isn't clear to me whether or not some of that may be explained by the drought impact and the timing of that impact on those numbers By and large in the agricultural sector, there will be an impact on the producers, but if you look into the financial sector that finances agricultural production--as I think Si may have mentioned his survey shows--the banks are in pretty good shape As a matter of fact, they have gotten rid of a lot of the bad loans over the adjustment period They have built their capital back, according to our survey, by over 10 percent And in a sense, they are in very good position to accommodate this drought impact I would find something to worry about if this were to be a two-year drought instead of a one-year drought; then that story would change dramatically   Ed Boehne has said much of what I wanted to say I think, except that he came out the wrong place I happen to view what has happened over the last few months--that is, the borrowing target as moderated, if you will, by the federal funds level--as providing the flexibility that I think serves this Committee fairly well, at least at this time I must say that over the long haul I would move to the borrowing target But for the near term--the rest of this year at least--I like what we've been doing  I agree with the proposition that moving the borrowing target is much easier, much more acceptable, and perhaps of some greater comfort to the Chairman, than moving the federal funds target But I don't think we ought to be deluded What we are doing when we are moving the borrowing target is targeting what we believe to be a federal funds level But they work together; they have worked together over the recent past, although apparently there's some confusion in the market that I don't quite understand because of the Desk operations I would not want to change at the moment; I'd like to do what we've been doing I have a question I guess for Don, following onto Bob Forrestal's comment with regard to the seasonal borrowing level, which has peaked, and I think is at an historical high   Roughly at $400 million   Traditionally, that starts running off about mid-August on down to the end of the year Given the fact that we might maintain, for example, a $600 million borrowing level, my question is, with that seasonal running off, does that imply that we have a built-in tightening if everything else remains the same?   But over the last two or three months we've been essentially at a frictional level of adjustment borrowing   If you give credence at all to seasonal borrowing [ unintelligible] some slightly different characteristic--   Mr Chairman, I would also prefer your pre- scription, that is ""B""; $600 million; asymmetric It seems clear to me that the next move probably is up, but I have a feeling that we don't really know what the impact of our most recent moves has been It's time to pause a bit and see what impact that has on the markets The other issue--if it's true that the next move is up, and I think there's fairly strong agreement around the table--we are kind of in a box as far as I'm concerned, in the sense that you have this spread between the discount rate and the funds rate which many think does make a lot of difference Over time as that broadens, I don't think we can lose sight of that spread And as a result, after the move that's being talked about here in the intermeeting period, you may have to consider another discount rate increase That has a market impact, an announcement impact, that I think has to be thought about long and hard With respect to the outlook and moving it up, I'd just like to pause and see where we come out  With regard to the aggregate question, I have great faith in talking about the aggregates as an intermediate target for the long run, but I would prefer not to move it up from where it is now for intermeeting guidance for what policy should be I think it's about in the right place, about number four And we ought to keep it there until there's a bit more confidence that it means something for short- term policy guidance   Move it where? Where are you going?   Does that mean that the markets--  -46-    8/16/88 "
3486,1988-09-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman With respect to the Tenth District, there is not a great change from last time To summarize, we are still trailing the growth rate of the national economy But in all areas, including energy and agriculture, there is some improvement--to be sure, improvement from a very low base Manu- facturing is doing very well; retail sales have been holding up but not very vigorous By and large, the Tenth District is continuing on a trend to recovery, but a bit slower than the national rate  With regard to the national economy and the projection con- tained in the Greenbook, we would be very close to that except that the pattern we have is a bit different If I understand the Greenbook forecast, the drought effect has largely run its course by the end of the year, whereas we would find the effect to be fairly even in each of the four quarters from the second quarter of 1988 to the second quarter of 1989 Notwithstanding that minor difference, it still seems to me that we are projecting a very vigorous growth well into 1989 And, given the comments around the table and what we hear in the Tenth District with respect to wage and price increases not really showing up yet, it is still a matter of major concern that, on the national level, we're putting considerable pressure on our resources I guess my view is that there is going to have to be some greater restraint in the future in order to get the kind of pattern over the longer term that we'd like to have  I would also like to add, if I may, that I happen to agree with Frank Morris--as painful as it is personally because of the travel--that going back to a monthly meeting schedule makes a lot of sense, given the way we're operating at the moment   I'll join   In fact, we've always--   No matter what "
3528,1988-11-01," I, Mr Chairman, would also support the change on the basis of the continuity and accountability issues already discussed   Thank you, Mr Chairman With respect to the national economy we would agree with the Greenbook on growth in 1988 For 1989 we project a bit slower growth than the Greenbook, and that's without the assumption that interest rates would rise in 1989 I guess you could conclude, therefore, that we are [projecting] more than just modestly slower growth than the Greenbook Nonetheless, it's so close that it has no real relevance for this purpose  With regard to the District economy, in the agricultural sector as already has been noted the picture is very bright; it has almost turned upside down from what we were looking at earlier in the year The net farm income for the nation, for example, will be as great as it was last year and last year was a record Having said that, there are some pockets within the District where the drought has had a substantial impact, particularly northern Missouri, northeastern  -36-    11/1/88  Kansas, and on up into Si's area On the other hand, agricultural farmland sales have picked up rather dramatically because of the liquidity that seems to be in that area And prices have begun to accelerate in those sales With regard to the manufacturing sector, it's roughly flat Retail sales are flat It's interesting that we also have found little evidence of price increases showing up in the District However, without exception when you talk with business people in the District, inflation is still on their minds There's an interesting activity going on in the energy sector because of the drop in the [price of] oil OPEC oil prices have created the uncertainty that quite likely will almost close down the new exploration activity within our District It's a fairly sizable part of the economy and largely will affect Oklahoma, Colorado, and Wyoming Those are the areas that were depressed earlier because of agriculture and energy and it won't help their outlook  There is no new information with respect to commercial construction which is a problem in Denver, Oklahoma City, and Tulsa It's going to take a long time to work its way out Overall, I think the Tenth District will continue to trail the national recovery   I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman I came in with some feeling of moving to a symmetric directive, but I have no quarrel with keeping it asymmetric for this time "
3566,1988-12-13," I don't think I can add anything that hasn't already been said other than to state my own position I would oppose moving back to a rigid federal funds rate target I think that what has happened over the last two intermeeting periods particularly has proven the worth of the procedures we've been following And I'd also note that there is nothing new apparently in that world because this idea of broadening the federal funds range and letting the market move it within that range rather than us was a regime that we followed some 10 or so years ago when we called that area in which the federal funds rate could move on its own a ""zone of indifference"" I don't know whether that was a published term or not, but it was certainly featured in discussions around this table That zone of indifference would have been set within a federal funds rate range of 2 to 3 percentage points, and no action would be taken so long as the fed funds rate moved within that zone My recollection, Bob Black may remember, is that the zone of indifference was about one full percentage point The point is that it has been done before It wasn't successful then I might add, and that is one of the reasons I would hate to go back to a rigid federal funds target even with that type of caveat   Mike, in looking at the staff forecast in the Greenbook, it is difficult to know what you are projecting in terms of interest rate levels and when changes in those would take place It would make quite a difference, it seems to me, as to what one might think would happen if, as I believe you said yesterday, you are looking at a 2 percent rise over a 12- to 18-month horizon Do you have in this forecast much of that coming early on, or it is on out?   Just to follow on, Mr Chairman, I would like to request that the staff, if they are going to build a forecast on projecting interest rate levels in the period ahead, that those be explicitly stated in the Greenbook so that we can have some feel when we run the model or make those judgmental changes, how we might compare with the Greenbook It would be very helpful if there were explicit indications in the Greenbook of what those assumptions were   Yes, indeed it would   As a matter of fact, I think that's the way it used to be done; [an assumption of] no change in policy   It could be done orally, Mr Chairman   Staff to staff   At least--   Thank you, Mr Chairman There is not a great deal new or different with respect to the regional economy Agriculture, for example, is very strong There's a smile on producers' faces simply because the harvest is in and grain commodity prices are high Along with Bob Boykin, I think the red meat producers probably will be squeezed in the period ahead because of those higher grain prices Our manufacturing sector is fairly strong, particularly in the export-related types of products In autos, all of the plants in our District with the exception of one are working a two-shift arrangement That one produces a car that apparently is not selling, so the workers have simply been given a holiday over Christmas, and just recently that has been extended another four days; so it's the product that they are producing rather than the overall demand for automobiles One other strong area is the high-tech area along the eastern slope of the Rockies and down into New Mexico Those high-tech areas that were depressed a couple of years ago have come back and are doing very well On the weak side, the energy sector in the District and construction, both residential and commercial, are depressed Retail sales I'm told generally are sluggish There was a very big day or week after Thanksgiving, which there always is, but rather than continuing on through, sales have dropped off in the major cities in our area Whether that will come back with an additional weekend to shop before Christmas, our retailers don't know; they are still optimistic Inventories are in good shape  With regard to the national economy, we are very, very close to the Greenbook forecast, but we didn't build in any restraint which means they are stronger than we would see the economy But given the comments from directors, businessmen, and others there is a very  -44-    12/13-14/88  strong feeling that the Federal Reserve has a role to play and it will play that role in restraining inflation As a result everybody talks about it It is a concern and I think that I would come out on the side--even though our region trails the national rate of recovery--of addressing attention more closely to inflation than I would to the level of real output   Mr Chairman, when I came to the meeting I preferred ""B-C"", someplace in between those two But I have no problem with the proposal that you've laid on the table with the exception of the potential need for the second $100 million sometime early in January If it becomes evident that that's an appropriate move, then I think the Board should again look at the use of the discount rate at that time rather than today I'd hold it in abeyance You may find it helpful in supporting the dollar after the turn of the year I would not want to do it now because as has already been mentioned at least it's my impression that other rates around the world probably are going to increase, and I wouldn't want us to be a leader in that parade So, I would hope that we could accept the proposal that you have laid on the table, $100 million now, and a very careful look whether to do the second $100 million or whether to do a discount rate increase sometime in January "
3591,1989-02-07," Thank you, Mr Chairman On the District level, the District economy has continued to improve but at a slow pace-- slower, certainly, than the national average The recoveries in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors continue and the higher oil prices that have fallen out of the late 1988 OPEC agreement have provided some stability to the energy sector In agriculture we are concerned about another year of drought; a more immediate concern is this cold weather For those livestock producers that rely upon farm ponds, for example--since they were not replenished during the past year and with the very cold weather those freeze solid--that means there is no water As a result, some livestock will be sent to market under those conditions, which will accelerate this drawdown on the red meat supplies in the future and push up prices perhaps  With regard to the energy sector, while prices have firmed somewhat, the uncertainty surrounding whether or not OPEC will be able to fulfill the agreement still scares people away from investing substantial sums and putting down new wells or exploring for new reserves In the manufacturing sector there are two really notable developments One is in the automobile manufacturing assembly area where all of the plants--and Missouri, for example, would be the second biggest assembly area in the [country] after Michigan--are operating at a full two-shift operation And there appears to be no slowdown in demand On the other hand, general aviation concluded 1988 with significant increases in their billings, generally as a result of export demand for general aviation products The interesting report on construction in the District is that the value of nonresidential construction in the District rose rather sharply in December and was about 33 percent above the year-earlier level On the other hand, residential construction has fallen slightly and is somewhat below the year-earlier level By and large the financial economic activity within the District is rather good with the exception of those areas such as Oklahoma that have been depressed; they are still sort of on the bottom with respect not only to employment but also to overhang on nonresidential construction-- commercial building, for example But by and large the District is in pretty good shape and continues to improve  With respect to the outlook for the national economy, adopting the interest rate projections that are used by the staff, we come out virtually identically, with some minor differences We have consumption a little higher and inventories a bit lower during 1989 But by and large we would be in the middle of the projections for the Committee members as a whole There is a concern, at least on my part, with respect to prices--that is, inflation in the period coming up In the services sector, for example, the benefits tacked on to otherwise projected wage increases give a strong indication that the risk is for higher prices rather than lower prices I'd rather be ahead of the curve than behind the curve And the increase in interest rates that is incorporated in our outlook as well as in the Board staff's outlook seems to be quite reasonable to me   Thank you, Mr Chairman I think credibility is important I think we've established credibility and it is important to keep it As I look at what we did in July in projecting for 1989-- that is, taking a full percentage point off of both the upper and lower limits--I'm not persuaded that hitting it again at this point another 1/2 percentage point or so as, say, is suggested in alternative ""II"" is either (1) necessary or (2) desirable, given the staff's projections in the Greenbook Lastly, it seems to me that the opportunity to move down somewhat again next year, given what we hope will happen, is important And if we take that extra cut now I think it limits somewhat our ability to go down next year given the projection for somewhat greater growth in M2 through 1990 So I would stick with alternative ""I,"" 3 to 7 percent   What are the alternatives other than money funds?  SPEAKER(?) Treasury securities   Government securities  -39-    2/7-8/89   Thank you, Mr Chairman Coming into the meeting this morning I guess I was looking for something between ""B"" and ""C"" on the short run, with some immediate movement toward ""C"" following this meeting In view of your plea for accommodation, although I'm not a voting member, I could almost interpret your proposal as being a ""B-C"" stance--taking a look at it again in a couple of weeks And from that standpoint it would be very acceptable to me I'd just like to lay on the table the way the tightening might take place in the period ahead I understand that using the discount  -58-    2/7-8/89  rate probably doesn't meet with much favor among those who have to vote on it--that is, the Board members--given the comments that have been made the last couple of days But there is a time beyond which I think we will not be able to move the discount rate and close any gap, if that's a concern to anybody When I talk about ""B-C,"" a bit of snugging now, I would like to consider that we could deal with a discount rate [increase of] 1/2 percent and not let it all show through--in other words, come to a funds rate level of something like 9-1/4 to 9-3/8 percent The further you go, if indeed you believe the staff's forecast, you've neutered yourself on using the discount rate as an instrument, I think And if we're ever going to do it, now would be the time to do it, given the projection that I think most of the people around the table believe "
3617,1989-03-28," Sam, can you remind us what is the intermeeting limit?   In all currencies?   In '89, how weak?   Thank you, Mr Chairman Mike, how much of the decline that you're showing in your forecast for 1989 and 1990 from last time is attributed to your assumption of an additional one percentage point increase in interest rates?   Jerry, would you speak up a little? We'd like to hear what you're saying  -26-    3/28/89   Thank you, Mr Chairman With respect to the District economy, it continues to improve albeit at a rate somewhat slower than the national rate of growth The strength comes largely from the agricultural and manufacturing sectors whereas the weakness is where it has been in the past couple of years--in the energy and construction areas There is an event that I think is worth noting that somebody spoke of a moment ago, and that's the drought That will affect portions of the Tenth District, largely an area from about the plains in Kansas to the northeast through Kansas, northern Missouri, and portions of southeastern Iowa and western Illinois If we do not get rain, some generous spring rains, fairly soon the agricultural situation will be fairly grim For example, in Kansas about 3/4 of the wheat crop is now estimated to be either poor or very poor, which are two of the lowest categories of estimates of that particular hard winter wheat crop The one event that was frightening occurred about two weeks ago--and I suspect most of you know this-- when there was a dust storm that was created by 50-60 mile per hour winds that actually darkened the sun in midafternoon in Kansas City In fact, there were some street lights that came on I happen to be old enough to remember the 1930's dust storms and this was very reminiscent of that It happened to be [only] one day; nonetheless, if there is no rain through that belt that I just described I think we will have very serious problems The estimate of food prices, for example, might be way off Beyond that, there is strength in the manufacturing sector, and I'm thinking primarily of general aviation Auto production, up until a couple of weeks ago at least, was going full bore with auto plants operating at two full shifts That would appear to be slowing now; I don't know what's going to happen in the future but there is a very large inventory, as you know, of unsold autos The energy sector shows little or no improvement As a matter of fact, it continues to decrease in terms of exploration activity It has always been thought that a price around $17 a barrel would regenerate the interest in exploration; but the uncertainties about OPEC and what may happen to oil prices simply are keeping those individuals out of that particular activity and the number of active rigs that are drilling continues to decrease  With regard to the national outlook, there is no real difference between the staff forecast and our own for the horizon of  -30-    3/28/89  the forecast with the exception that we're a bit stronger on both growth and prices In fact, there is some encouraging evidence that has already been cited with respect to a slowdown But it isn't very convincing, at least yet I think we still have to wait for some additional information on that In our forecast, we'd put the risks on the high side rather than the low side, with rather a bit stronger growth and stronger prices   Mr Chairman, I would favor ""B"" and an asymmetric directive I'd just like to highlight the point that Tom Melzer made, however We have in the past been fairly quick to act on a single number that has been published, given the background of the tightening that we've done over the last year And that's 3  -40-    3/28/89  percentage points over the last year in the federal funds rate alone-- or 2 percentage points over the last 8 or 9 months I think it is time to pause and see what these numbers really mean I would like to see a little more accumulation of evidence of this slowing or the lack of slowing before we take any further action I don't know what that means [in terms of timing] but I think it should be at least a month before we do anything In my mind that would give us the employment numbers and the next PPI number, I guess In other words, I need a cumulation of numbers going one way, really, before taking any dramatic action on the asymmetrical language "
3643,1989-05-16," Yes, Mr Chairman This may be to Sam or to you, I guess I don't quite understand the objective of our intervention, particularly to the level that we have intervened over this intermeeting period I understand that our objective is to    5/16/89  moderate the movements But the pressures are coming not from the speculators, as I understand it, but rather from those who see the dollar as a good investment at the moment Maybe I didn't understand you totally, Sam, but I thought you said that we are intervening more heavily than the remainder of our G-7 partners and I don't know why we should have that big a burden, given the rest of the environment My last question is Who calls the shots on this? Is it the Treasury that believes that intervention at this level is appropriate?   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Tenth District is continuing to improve but rather slowly The strong farm income last year has positioned the agricultural sector to withstand probably the impact of the drought, given otherwise good weather throughout most of the crop areas In Kansas, for example, which is a very large red winter wheat producer, the latest estimates are for production of about 200 million bushels and that's down from about 325 million the year before That's the latest official forecast However, in talking with some of the producers and some of the grain people throughout Kansas, their projection is that if they get no further measurable rain in the next couple of weeks they would be very happy with 150 to 180 million bushels But the interesting aspect of that is that, given the drought conditions in the high plains areas producing red winter wheat--basically Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming and Oklahoma--the total production would be down about 8 percent But if you look at wheat totally, which includes spring wheat, the total wheat production would be up about 13 percent As for the rest of the small grains corn, for example, will be up about 60 percent from last year; beans will be up 27 percent; and oats will be up 100 percent They are projecting a very strong farm production year given, of course, that the drought doesn't affect it measurably So, in the agricultural sector things are looking pretty good That does not mean, however, that spots such as Kansas won't feel the impact of this drought; but the nation as a whole probably will not As a matter of fact, given those projections, we would see very modest increases in food costs, not unlike what I think the staff has projected--about 3-1/4 percent   Yes, with the exception of whatever damage has already occurred to the winter wheat crop, which is large in the high plains states as I just mentioned Ninety percent of that winter wheat crop, by official estimate, is rated poor or very poor as a result But that's only a part of the wheat production for the nation as a whole  -17-    5/16/89   That's correct--some further rainfall   I guess I don't understand your question   Well, I don't think I know that Maybe Governor Angell does The fact of the matter is that the 200 million bushel estimate for the state of Kansas is based upon the damage that has already occurred to the wheat Given further normal rainfall from here until harvest they come out with 200 or 202 million bushels   Normal--that's right But you see we're only about 2 or 3 weeks away from the start of the harvest of that crop That's an early June start in Oklahoma   Kansas will be when, Wayne?   Yes, let me just proceed In the energy sector there's a bit of an uptick For example, just in the last month the rig count within the District has moved from 211 to 245 That's still well below year-ago levels, but nonetheless there is some exploration  -18-    5/16/89  taking place The manufacturing sector continues to improve and that's largely related to the commercial aircraft and high-tech industries On the other side, the construction industry--both commercial as well as residential--is very weak  On the national level we have no real difference in our projection for the upcoming period from the staff's forecast I have a little problem--the question has been raised and there will be further discussion--with respect to the current status of this weakening or not weakening And it bothers me a little when we talk about another 3/4 or full percentage point increase without some fairly good evidence I would be not very happy with that   But that has only been in the last 10 days   Before that they did not   It's not a question I just want to follow up on your comments, Mr Chairman   Okay Sticking with ""B,"" with the $600 million, seems to me to be appropriate I'm not sure, however, that going to a symmetrical directive at this particular meeting is what I would recommend It seems to me that the data we are relying on as [indicative of] a slowdown are nothing more than three weeks' to a month's data To be sure, the aggregates are slow; but the projection by the staff is that the growth of M2 will return to the 6 to 7 percent area within the next 30 days Given the attention that the markets pay to the directive, it seems to me that a directive very much like that adopted at the last meeting--that is, [with a tilt] toward restraint--would be appropriate this time It would give us flexibility; if we want to go the other way that's available via a telephone call I can't remember how it was but it was something like ""somewhat and would"" and ""somewhat and might"" in the language of the directive itself I would prefer asymmetrical toward restraint as it was last meeting   Just a point of clarification Is it implied from what you just stated that there will be no change in policy absent a telephone call?   ""Somewhat/might"" "
3670,1989-06-05," Mr Chairman, Roger Guffey   You have made your proposal and it does encompass a lower interest rate level I understand that, I think I really believe the data that we look at can be read both ways But I don't really understand the urgency of moving at this time given the    6/5/89  uncertainty about inflation and the uncertainty about the strength of the economy generally It still isn't clear to me that we're in anything other than a pause As a result, there seems to me to be some risk of this economy really [unintelligible] in the period ahead and having to reverse our stance   Mr Chairman?   Roger Guffey again Let me say that I don't necessarily agree with the action you're proposing Let me raise another point The dropping of the borrowing level to $500 million, given that seasonal borrowing is now up at least to the $375 million level, leaves roughly only about $100-$125 million of adjustment borrowing, which is marginal it seems to me If we're going to move this way, what you're really talking about is an interest rate target for the short run rather than a borrowing target And I know the Desk would treat it [unintelligible]-- "
3686,1989-07-05," This question may already have been answered, Mr Chairman, but regarding the notation in the Bluebook that, given the baseline forecast, you might expect short-term interest rates to tick back up because of overplay by the markets Is the baseline forecast still consistent with, say, Bluebook alternative B?  SPEAKER(?) [Yes]   It is And that contemplates an uptick some time in the future, and probably the near-term future, of short-term interest rates?   A quarter or two up?   Thank you very much   Thank you, Mr Chairman On the regional side, the Tenth District is continuing to improve To be sure, it's still lagging the national scene; but given where we started a couple of years ago we're still improving On the food and agricultural side the outlook is good, notwithstanding all the talk of what has happened in the drought areas For example, drought has [hit] in Kansas and the northern sector of Missouri and it extends up pretty much across Iowa But given the additional acreage that has been planted, the outlook for production of agricultural products is really very good in light of the rain that has fallen in a good part of the United States outside of the Tenth District In wheat specifically, the hard red winter wheat that is principally grown in the Tenth District--in Kansas particularly and in Oklahoma and Texas--that crop to be sure is going to be down considerably because of the drought situation But overall, it's important to note that the production of wheat on the national level is going to be up about 15 percent above what it was last year And that's notwithstanding the fact that Kansas, which is one of the biggest producers of the hard red winter wheat, is going to harvest something less than half of the crop harvested just a year ago Given that kind of an outlook, we would agree with the comments that were made by Mike and others with respect to food prices in the period ahead that they will be moderate, with about a 4 percent increase over the next year The energy industry in the Tenth District has not fully participated in the nationwide improvement in  -21-    7/5-6/89  exploration and development Indeed, in Oklahoma the number of rigs fell substantially over June, for example, whereas nationally that count was up Manufacturing continues to improve, largely in the export-sensitive aircraft and high-tech areas And construction continues to improve very modestly in the District It is above the year-ago level; although commercial construction is down somewhat, overall construction is up  On the national level, I recognize that in all of the numbers that have come in, and that have just been recited for our review, there is a softness that appears to be showing through I would see that as coming close to achieving the objective that we've been striving for, and that is, to bring the overall growth down However, we would see growth in 1989 and into 1990 somewhat greater than the Greenbook forecast, largely reflecting a bit stronger consumption than the Greenbook forecast incorporates Overall, the only real evidence of wage [pressures] and concerns that we have been able to uncover in the Tenth District is in the steel settlement that was announced earlier There's a real concern that a steel producer in the Tenth District who is in the midst of negotiations now will be badly hurt if that type of settlement is imposed upon them That's all I have, Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman I would join those who agree that the announcement effect is important But because of the uncertainty about where we're going to end up in 1989, adopting the 1989 ranges for 1990 with the opportunity to look at them again in February makes sense to me That is not exactly alternative II in the sense that alternative II does drop the ranges of both M2 and debt That doesn't make much sense to me I would just adopt the current ranges I do have some sympathy, however, with the proposal of Bob Black that we move to a multi-year targeting procedure to avoid this base-drift problem that likely will occur at the end of this year and into next year   Thank you, Mr Chairman I agree, essentially, with those who have already spoken with respect to your proposal If I were to believe our own forecast for the quarter immediately ahead, quite likely I would opt for alternative B with symmetric language Essentially, the question in my mind is whether or not we really have the slowing that was detailed yesterday in the numbers that Governor Johnson cited--whether or not that is going to continue throughout this quarter or whether we will pause and get a reacceleration and therefore an inappropriate further dropping of short-term rates at this point Then we'd have to turn it back around But given that uncertainty, your proposal to move cautiously seems to me to be appropriate--symmetric language of the directive and between alternatives A and B One thing that isn't clear to me, however, is how the borrowing level would be treated I know there has been an explanation; I guess I just didn't understand It is dropped by $50 million under your proposal, Mr Chairman Given that the seasonal borrowing is roughly $500 million or a bit above and we have been at $600 million as a borrowing level, are we talking about $550 million or are we talking about staying at $600 million?  SPEAKER(?) 600   600?   Mr Chairman, I'd just like to add one other caveat We do have a fairly important number coming out on Friday-- that is, the employment number Rather than moving to the lower level that you are suggesting before that number comes out, I think I'd wait and take another look before the--   I would agree; that's very satisfactory "
3712,1989-08-22," Ted, I guess I don't understand your statement that you prefer not to have it spelled out in the record I assume this would take a Committee vote?   And, therefore, it will be indeed on the record; and it will reveal not only the authorization for the full $700 million [swap drawing] but also this special--   You ask for a vote now and it's not submitted for the record unless it's activated?   The authorities?   Okay   Mike, [some] of the numbers that have been reported going back to the second quarter may be revised up, and there is some speculation that growth in the second quarter might have been as much as a full percentage point faster than you show in the Greenbook How do you construct your forecast? Do you simply take it  -11-    8/22/89  out of the third quarter or do you project the third and fourth quarters from that higher base, if indeed it is revised?   Do we have any indication of why these numbers have been revised so dramatically over the last two or three months? Is there something going on?   Well, they are of larger magnitude Are they orders?   Thank you, Mr Chairman At the District level, things have not changed greatly We are still in a growth mode; to be sure it is at somewhat less than the national level, but considering where we started that is still a pretty optimistic report Farm conditions in the District continue to improve, largely as a result of some crop prices, which had strengthened following the recently released agricultural report that the rebound in crop production this year would not be as large as had been expected In the energy area, the District's oil drilling activity increased this summer but still remained below year-ago levels due to the continued uncertainty as to price for both natural gas and drilling Manufacturing in the District is going full out, largely as a result of the aircraft manufacturing--both commercial as well as private aircraft Manufacturing activity is at a very high level Auto assemblage is back to being fairly fully employed, in the sense that there had been a shutdown of the GM plant as a result of retooling and some supply constraints but they are back running and are running at full capacity Construction activity in the District weakened slightly in June and into July; but it is still stronger than it was in the first half of 1989 and is stronger than it was a year ago  On the national level, our forecast is not greatly different than the Greenbook forecast; we feel that the upward revisions are appropriate but may not be enough Similar to what Gary Stern mentioned earlier, we think that the risk of recession is not great Indeed, instead of a soft landing, we may be executing a touch and go;  -29-    8/22/89  we think the last half of this year will be stronger than the Greenbook forecast As a result, the outlook for inflation as revealed in the Greenbook--certainly through 1990--shows no improvement And yes indeed, we do read some of [the data to mean] that the rate in the last half of the year could worsen I understand the comments about constraints on wage increases I think we can be fooled We can watch it for a while and all at once it can be out of balance I sense a greater militancy among the unions, although they are a smaller part of the work force But they seem to be more willing to go on strike and stay out without compensation I think the outlook for the latter half of 1989 is stronger than the Greenbook forecast and the outlook for an improvement in prices isn't any better, if as great   Mr Chairman, I agree in that ""B"" would be my preference but I feel a bit more strongly than you do with respect to asymmetric language toward ease I would oppose asymmetric toward ease That view simply is based upon some of the comments that I made earlier that I see the economy a bit stronger than others, perhaps, in the third and fourth quarters To me, a change in the language now would mean something to the markets and mislead them   I favor symmetrical and would strongly oppose an asymmetrical directive toward easing   Will there be a vote on the other language with respect to progress? "
3738,1989-10-03," Thank you, Mr Chairman I guess virtually everything has been said around the table I don't have too much concern about the actual profits and losses that the System will sustain in terms of a rising dollar I'm not terribly concerned about the price stability issue in the sense that with sterilized intervention I think for some long period in the future we can go about a price stability objective without much problem What I am really concerned about, however, is bringing this issue to a confrontational stage outside of the confines of this Committee and the Treasury, because as soon as the public and the market perceive that there's a split I think we have the real possibility of a currency crunch that we will not want to face We'll have to go together at that time   Yes, I know I'd like to ask a question How far can the Treasury go in the sense that they have a stabilization fund that is authorized by Congress? Is there no limit to what--   Well, they still have to get authorization for the Treasury to get dollars for us to warehouse   So there is a limitation   The Tenth District economic conditions continue to improve slowly; I think they trail the national improvement Nonetheless, improvement does show in retail sales, which were up over a year ago with inventories, we're told, well in line With respect to [agriculture], the good news is that the drought has been broken, although crop estimates for the spring-planted crops are a fourth to a third below what would be an average crop The bad news is that the rains have been so excessive that [farmers] are going to have a hard time getting the milo bean and corn out of their fields As a result, I'm not sure what their conditions will be But farm land values have continued to increase; in our last quarterly survey they were up over the three categories, roughly 2 percent over the quarter before, and that's eight consecutive quarters in which those land values have improved The OPEC agreement to raise its production ceilings had very little effect on oil prices, but the drilling activity has increased modestly most recently The rig count is about 259 in the District, about 5 percent below a year ago; but it is improving on a month-to-month basis Most of that exploration is for gas; they have found a big gas field over in eastern Oklahoma and Texas which is being exploited apparently by some of our drillers who are going south and going to help your economy, Bob Construction activity has been mixed, to be sure; nonresidential construction has increased from our last meeting here, whereas residential construction has fallen off  With regard to my view of the national economy, I would accept readily the Greenbook forecast; I think it's appropriate There are some within our own Bank who believe that forecast is a little stronger than they would project But my own view is that it's about on track; given the underlying assumptions, I think it's a good forecast and one we ought to be happy with   We're having trouble seeing that   [Unintelligible] and I think most of the comments around the table about using monetary policy with respect to the dollar are right on the mark I don't think the old adage ""you can't serve two masters"" is to be taken lightly I think monetary policy should be devoted to domestic economic policy and not to the dollar And further, with respect to the prescription for the period ahead, I would accept ""B"" but would want a symmetric directive I wanted that last time, as you may remember, and I've seen no accumulating evidence that suggests we are any closer to a recession at this meeting than we were at the last meeting As a matter of fact, in my own view, we're further away from it As a result, I think there's a greater demand for a symmetric directive than there was last time Therefore, I would prefer ""B"" symmetric "
3787,1989-11-14," Just as a matter of interest, Mr Chairman, there have been some comments about trying to project what this German situation may mean for their economy and our economy I have heard a few comments with respect to the demand that will be generated by these 200,000 or 250,000 immigrants [from East Germany] that are hopefully skilled and will go to work and produce They will be in a position of demanding the [unintelligible] if nothing else  SPEAKER(?) Housing   Beyond housing   What does that imply for their economy and our economy or for interest rates in that market?   Thank you, Mr Chairman There hasn't been a great deal of change in the Tenth District since the last meeting There are two or three things that I'd like to comment upon, however One of them is an analysis of our third-quarter farm credit survey that we do on a quarterly basis That clearly is showing that a recovery in the agricultural sector is continuing, as evidenced by the fact that this was the 11th consecutive quarter where farmland values have increased; they are currently about 8 percent above year-ago  -21-    11/14/89  levels and roughly 23 percent above year-end levels of 1986 One of the other things that's rather striking is that the loan-to-deposits ratio in agricultural banks, as opposed to all District banks, is only 514 percent, and that happens to be a high for the last three or four years They are looking for loans and there is some takedown of credit within the farm area However, agriculture has had a bumper year, notwithstanding the two years of drought, largely because product prices together with red meat prices--particularly cattle, and until recent times, pork--have been very high and sustained Retail sales District-wide are roughly flat However, in talking with the major retailers, they think their inventories are in line; they are looking for a normal or usual Christmas selling season and they feel very good about the positions they now occupy With regard to manufacturing, it has steadily increased There is the problem of Boeing--with Wichita being fairly heavily dominated by Boeing--and their being out on strike On the other hand, the auto assembly plants that we have are still going full tilt, meaning two full shifts The exception to that is a GM plant in Kansas City that is now on a two-week shutdown and I'm told that they anticipate an additional two weeks at or near year-end They are cutting back their production to meet the forecast of auto sales on a national level With regard to prices, we don't have any clear evidence that there is any strong pressure on prices The real problem that is beginning to show through on the wages is the cost of fringe benefits and that will be amplified a bit in the first quarter with the additional social security requirement  With regard to the national forecast, we have no quarrel with the projections that are contained in the Greenbook For the fourth quarter we might be a couple of tenths weaker than the Greenbook would show That simply tells me that if our primary objective is to slow the economy below its natural rate, then we're on track; I don't think we should panic As a result, hopefully, we will get some indication of lower inflation rates However, this forecast doesn't reveal that as far as I'm concerned The Vice Chairman of the Board made some comments about evidence of lower prices; he reads the numbers differently than I do, I guess Regional management differs--   I understand The last thing I would note is that unemployment in the Tenth District in all four of the major cities in which the Bank operates is below the national rate of unemployment Some of that may be as a result of out-migration that took place in the more difficult times; but there is potential for some price/wage increases as a result of our labor shortage That's all I have, Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman I've been looking for some time for an opportunity to agree nearly 100 percent with Wayne Angell And I do   I think you stated it very well We have had easing over the last four or five months of roughly 1-1/4 or 1-3/8 percent, which on a base of something less than 9 percent is a substantial easing To be sure, the outlook is for [the expansion] to be slow in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter; in my view, that's what's needed I'm not sure that that's enough to get us to the objective that I think we all would like to achieve--and that is something closer to price stability, however defined As a result, given that we sort of preempted this meeting by an easing a week or so ago, clearly I'd favor maintaining what we have now with a B alternative I would still opt for a symmetric directive because I don't know what an asymmetric directive now means, Mr Chairman We took two cuts in the intermeeting period which is a little beyond what I thought even an asymmetric directive meant without a vote "
3813,1989-12-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman I think some [good] questions [have been asked] and perhaps some satisfactory answers have been given; but I want to join those who suggested that we have not quantified the benefits of zero inflation or price stability I think intuitively we all would agree that it has benefits; but when we talk about the costs then in some way we have to quantify the benefits, it seems to me I don't mean to say that we shouldn't move toward price stability--or zero inflation, if that is price stability--but rather that when we set upon a course such as this we ought to know what we're going to achieve if we get to the goal My own view, looking at this exercise, is that however good or bad it may be, if we're really  -18-    12/18-19/89  serious about price stability we ought to set off on the course of a tight money policy and get it over with and move on to an economy that could perform for another number of years in a very satisfactory manner, if we could check on this beyond five years But that also says to me that in the short run, as we think about what policy should be put in place now, it doesn't worry me as much that with a tight policy now we might skim along the edge to a recession That is to say, in the immediate upcoming periods, the fear of recession simply isn't as great after seeing this exercise as it might have been before; because if I understand this correctly, in a recession we would expect to get some of the benefit of moving toward price stability As Ed Boehne or somebody said, I don't think that any of us is looking for a recession, but I don't think we should shy away from it either   Thank you, Mr Chairman In response to your specific questions, my desire would be to achieve some stability in the general price level provided that that means [stability] at a low inflation rate Just to stabilize a general price level could be at any level If we were to set upon that course today, I'd assume that what we would do is maintain price level stability between 4 and 5 percent, which would be acceptable to me at least With regard to the timetable, I like the idea of some statement much like Jerry Corrigan has set forth--that is, the mid-1990s As you testify twice a year in Humphrey-Hawkins, for example, and many other times that you have to make public statements, I think you could address those issues that either bring us closer to that goal of price stability in the mid- 1990s or away from it I think it's going to be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve price stability at some level absent some help from the fiscal side And I think time after time you have to beat that drum This gives you the opportunity to do that There is one other issue that keeps coming to mind and that is whether or not we have the authority--and I'm talking about legal authority, implicit or otherwise--to adopt a goal of price stability, price stability being zero inflation We have a number of pieces of legislation that tell us what our goals should be And they number as many as 10 if you get all the pieces of legislation together So, if we were to say that as of now we're going to set upon the course of trying to achieve price stability, meaning zero inflation or thereabouts, by the mid-1990s, and as a result--whether by our making it or not--we got into a recession, I think we'd be challenged as to whether or not our goal was legal We can say internally all we want about price stability being at or near zero, but when we get in public I think you're talking about something else  -38-    12/18-19/89   Jerry, it would be helpful if you'd speak up a little   A question Have you even thought about, or can you determine, why adjustment borrowing is so low? Is there simply so much liquidity out there either domestically or from abroad that they don't need the window?   Thank you, Mr Chairman The District economy continues to improve modestly but the pace of improvement seems to be slowing somewhat The farm sector remains a source of strength and the energy industry continues to improve But growth in the manufacturing sector has slowed somewhat In the agricultural sector a pattern has emerged with respect to the winter wheat and the very dry soil conditions that prevail Because the weather has been so cold the snow has been very dry, which hasn't provided much strength to winter wheat [Unintelligible] virtually no winter wheat being at pasture simply because it didn't get [unintelligible] So far as the recent slump in cattle prices, a short supply of [unintelligible] could boost direct levels of prices in the first quarter of 1990 In the meantime, most District farm [incomes] were strong in 1989 and the prospects remain bright for 1990 Stable oil prices and increases in drilling for natural gas continue to buoy the District's energy industry For example, the average number of active drilling rigs in the nation increased from 984 to 1,042 in November and in the District from 312 to 326 Both the US and the District rig counts were significantly above year-ago levels Most of that is in the natural gas exploration area Manufacturing, particularly in the auto plants, is a downside element as has been noted before I would say that we have no evidence of layoffs in that area; however, the temporary shutdowns that are planned for the auto assembly plants are in [train] For example, a GM plant in Kansas City that would normally have a one-week temporary shutdown will take that one week and then two additional weeks in January, which supports the idea that the January production schedule is being cut back and that autos will be a source of weakness in the first quarter On the other hand, the manufacturers of general aviation aircraft expect in 1989 to exceed the 1988 production level Construction is up in our District and continues to improve The October value of nonresidential construction contracts in the District stood 26 percent above the value in October of 1988 and residential contracts were about 20 percent above the year-ago levels I would note that unemployment levels in all major areas of the District are below the national average With respect to Christmas retail sales, the information that we have gathered suggests that the retailers are looking for sales that are modestly above last year's levels, which were considered fairly good  As to the national economy, we would be very close to the Greenbook forecast And we have the feeling that the risk is pretty well balanced yet with respect to the upside or downside movement of the economy   Thank you, Mr Chairman I came into this meeting with the thought of retaining policy about where we are now with an asymmetric directive But I could accept your proposal--that is, coming down a 1/4 point now with a symmetric directive in the period ahead I'm not too opposed to giving the nation a little Christmas present, which is not necessarily--   I would not support moving it up, particularly at this time I agree with what Manley Johnson said about moving it up for visibility purposes at a time when we have a [unintelligible] and it will be known that the aggregates are growing above our projected target for them It seems to me it's an inappropriate time I don't mind putting a bit more emphasis on the aggregates, but I don't think now is the time to do it "
3841,1990-02-06," Thank you, Mr Chairman With regard to the forecast over the upcoming forecast period, for 1990 we're very close to the Greenbook forecast--a tick stronger in real growth and very close to the projection for prices There is very little difference in the CPI less food and energy  Turning now to the District economy, as I think all of you know, agriculture has been on a recovery path now for a year and a half except in those areas where there have been dry conditions The concern was that we would start a third year of drought there Much of that has been relieved with snow and rain across much of the Wheat Belt, although the sub-soil moisture reserves are still very low They will need more moisture to produce this wheat crop, apparently But, given the moisture that has already fallen, there are some brighter prospects there Grain prices have slumped because of the moisture that has fallen but also because of improved soybean conditions in South America and a backlog of corn-laden ships in Russia, all of which have begun to dampen commodity prices On the other hand, cattle prices are virtually at an all-time high and, given the selloff, there's a good outlook for the agricultural sector in the period ahead  Energy prices, as everybody is aware, picked up in both December and January because of the cold weather Most of the operators in our area believe that's only temporary and it has not encouraged them to expand their projections for additional drilling exploration or pumping from existing resources As a matter of fact, the District rig count fell about 10 percent in December from 337 to 303, if those numbers are to be believed The manufacturing story is the same in the Tenth District as it is elsewhere, particularly with respect to the auto assembly problems We are heavily involved with  -18-    2/6-7/90  auto assemblies in the District There had been temporary layoffs and I'm told that a relatively new, about a 3-year old, General Motors plant in Kansas City will lay off an additional 700 at the end of February One plant has been closed, though not this year; nonetheless it has taken its toll in that community Unit sales of general aviation aircraft increased about 45 percent nationwide in 1989 over 1988, but most of that increase--and we're fairly heavily involved with general aviation aircraft manufacturing in the Wichita area--has been single-engine piston driven aircraft and fewer large jets As a result, the value of shipments is down from 1988 The construction industry, both non-residential and residential, is depressed in each of the major cities in the area There isn't a great expectation for that to come back in the period ahead, particularly in the residential sector, as evidenced by the fact that a third fewer housing permits actually have been granted for residential construction As a result that sector is kind of on its ear On the other hand, in each of the major metropolitan areas in the District we have an unemployment figure that is less than the national average That does say that there is some income being generated; [unintelligible] we probably will drag well behind the continued recovery on the national level   Thank you, Mr Chairman It seems to me that the critical question for this Committee at this juncture is whether or not we're really dedicated to bringing inflation down to zero or its equivalent--to achieve price stability, whatever its definition may be--or whether or not we're simply willing [to accept] and be happy with having inflation where we find it now I look at the exercise--and I think it is helpful to go out to 5 years--but the fact of the matter is that if one considers the cost of taking action to bring inflation down from the current level, none of these strategies gives me very much comfort That is to say, we're not making much progress against inflation or toward price stability, given any one of these three strategies As a result, I would have to conclude that maybe our best efforts should be to cap inflation now with the thought that the only way we're going to get inflation down is with a recession and that quite likely a recession will occur within the next 5 years--particularly if we hold growth below the trend line for this long a period of time I don't think there's a time in modern policy history in which we have gone for that length of time with growth below the trend line without falling into recession So, I think recession is a real possibility in this timeframe As a matter of fact, it may be something that gets us toward price stability So, alternative II for the upcoming period is the most appropriate one, in my mind And that says, really, that we're preparing in the near future to cap inflation and that the Committee hopes there's some exogenous event that causes a recession and we won't get blamed for it and yet we capture the progress toward price stability The other thing about alternative II is that the reduction of M3 seems reasonable to me It does show the flag a bit in the sense that we have taken a step in reducing the ranges of growth in M3 and debt You can make whatever you want of that; it isn't much, I think Nonetheless, for some people hearing your testimony it may be worthwhile   ""B,"" symmetric "
3865,1990-03-27," Thank you, Mr Chairman I only want to say that since Mike has said that he builds his forecast upon what he thinks to be the center of the sentiment of the Committee, I'd like to be counted on the side that has been set forth by Governors Angell and Johnson, and perhaps Lee Hoskins, for the period ahead I think the numbers we are looking at with respect to inflation are discouraging over the horizon As a result, if indeed it's going to take some snugging up, the sooner we do it the better That's a little into the next part of the meeting, but I just wanted to be counted in the group so that this center comes a little closer to what I'd like   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Tenth District continues to improve [unintelligible], but nonetheless is showing improvement with some mixed performance in the various sectors For example, in the agricultural sector there has been a turnaround in the moisture; there has been good moisture across virtually all of the Tenth District and particularly through the wheat region both from rain as well as snow That has a diverse impact, however, on wheat prices So in terms of net farm income it may wash out But the prospects for the wheat crop, which will start to be harvested in about six weeks, look very good On the other hand, there is some  -29-    3/27/90  weakness in cattle prices, as a result of a surge in the feed cattle production There are some projections that cattle prices will fall about midyear With the lower wheat price and lower cattle price, the outlook for net farm income may not be quite as good as some might expect Nonetheless, the outlook is quite likely going to be very good in the agricultural sector  In the energy sector, the rig counts have fallen again most recently That is, in the Tenth District the rig count has actually fallen in roughly three [unintelligible] from 298 to 255 in number, although it is still higher than the count a year ago So, there is some year-over-year improvement; it's better than it was before The manufacturing sector is still fairly slow, particularly with respect to automobile assemblies There have been some cutbacks in production in the plants in the District In one in Kansas City they actually have laid off 700 people and cut [production] from roughly 800 cars a day down to 600 for the second-line adjustment But the 700 layoff is already significant On the other hand, aircraft manufacturing in the District continues to be strong and vigorous As a matter of fact, Beech just received a new contract for $1-1/2 billion to supply business-type aircraft to the Air Force for training purposes That, of course, will stretch over time, but it is a new order of significance for that area There is some improvement and strength in both residential and nonresidential construction in the District, which continues to amaze me given some overhang in the commercial [side] at least But it may have been affected by the warm January temperatures Nonetheless, there are those contracts out there and [work] will be performed in the period ahead So overall, the District continues to improve--slowly to be sure, with disparate results depending upon what area of the economy you look at  As for the Greenbook forecast, we really have no quarrel with it It's a bit stronger maybe than we originally had thought, particularly in view of the fact that we ran these numbers and got about the same result but without any interest rate increase So by building in an interest rate increase, maybe the Board staff's forecast is a little stronger than ours But given the timing--as I understand it, maybe a 1/4 point late in the third quarter and maybe another 1/4 point in the fourth--it won't have a lot of impact in 1990 As a result, we're fairly close together; I have no problem [with the staff's forecast]   Mr Chairman, you might have detected from some earlier comments that I made that with respect to this particular meeting I started out leaning a bit toward ""C"" or something in the neighborhood of a ""B-C"" directive simply because of the lack of evidence that we have made any progress on inflation--nor will we in the next two years Nor indeed is there clear evidence that we have capped inflation as some people would like to believe As a result, it seems to me that making some sort of preemptive strike, if you will, by moving rates up at the the present time would have some beneficial effect But given a couple of things that will occur in the future, it seems to me that that probably is inappropriate Given the closeness of the G-7 meeting, I think you might have some real difficulty during that period of time Also, there will be an employment report that comes out April 6th, just before your G-7 meeting that will give some better information with respect to what happened in January and February; it will either confirm or not confirm those numbers, it seems to me Therefore, I would like to propose that we have ""B"" with an asymmetric directive so that if we do get information in the intermeeting period that suggests that we have  -41-    3/27/90  a much stronger economy than we think we have, then we could move Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, is that this would be a leading bit of information to the market as they see this directive following the next meeting They would know which way the wind is blowing and what the next move could be It has informational content, if you will, whether we move or not in the intermeeting period; an asymmetric directive seems to me to have some advantage   You can withdraw now, Tom!  -61-    3/27/90 "
3899,1990-05-15," Thank you, Mr Chairman In the Tenth District, the economy continues to grow moderately slowly Recent developments have been somewhat mixed There has been a good deal of press given to the agricultural sector The wheat crop, for example, has been estimated by the Agriculture Department as being near double last year's crop That optimism isn't totally shared by some of the wheat growers themselves, although we're within probably 30 days of harvest in much of the Tenth District area It does look very good, and I think the farmers are pleased with it It's a question of how it comes out We are always reminded that a wheat farmer has to lose his crop at least nine times; in other words, he's very pessimistic until it's in the bin They're still not prepared to say it's going to be double what it was last year The outlook for farm income for 1990 is very good not only because of the wheat but also other crops, so the last two-year drought will not affect the 1990 crops yet to be planted and harvested On top of that, crop prices have firmed up recently and there's a good deal of excitement about red meat prices For example, prices of cattle, including replacement cattle for the feed lots, are essentially at an all-time high Inventories of the latter have not been rebuilt; they were run down over the last three or four years So, if you combine not only a good crop year together with livestock prices, then the outlook for agriculture is very bright for our area A somewhat damping effect is the rain that Bob talked about in Texas, which also has occurred through much of the Tenth District That has restored the moisture level, but now farmers can't get the crops in [the ground], so it's uncertain With respect to energy, despite the weaker oil prices, the District rig count did increase in April and remains above the year-ago level We do have a good deal of auto assembly [capacity] in the District and that [activity] has been very sluggish, as has been detailed around the table In the manufacturing sector that's laid against a very brisk business in aircraft manufacturing In residential construction, contracts fell slightly in March, but nonresidential contracts increased, which doesn't tell the same story that apparently is told elsewhere in the nation We do still have a large overhang of commercial properties in cities such as Denver, Oklahoma City, and Tulsa But District-wide, the nonresidential commercial contracts have increased recently  With regard to the national economy, I have little or no quarrel with the Greenbook forecast We go through an exercise in which we hold monetary policy steady as it has been going into a meeting such as this Then, after we receive the information with respect to how the staff has treated monetary policy in the Greenbook, we do another exercise and lay them side-to-side This time they come out fairly close, with the exception that we have a little less growth in 1990 That may reflect your pattern of increased interest rates; that isn't clear to us, I guess, when we get your information But on that we don't quarrel We think there will be a little less growth in 1990 The growth and the inflation aspects of 1991 look to be about the same, given the staff's pattern of the interest rate levels  We have found little evidence of a credit crunch, particularly in the agricultural sector The agricultural banks are very liquid; they say they can't find the loans to absorb their liquid assets into loans Where we do hear some evidence that credit is not available is in areas such as Denver that have just come off the bottom and where the larger banks have been hit and now have a rating that makes them very cautious about credit I don't think it has  -18-    5/15/90  anything to do with examiners coming in and knocking them It's simply a fallout of what they've been through in the last year or two They are on the way up but they're very cautious in their credit terms It is not price as far as we can tell   My preference would be alternative B, asymmetric, given that I believe we're going to have to have some greater restraint in the period ahead if indeed we're going to make any progress toward lower inflation rates However, I don't see anything on the horizon that would urge us to move in the intermeeting period--between now and early July, for example I can't imagine that these numbers are going to reverse so quickly that they would trigger a further increase in the intermeeting period There are ways, however, to get the message to the market for the credibility argument One is, as you've suggested, that it be stressed in the policy record which is read by the market; on the other hand, we could have an asymmetric directive Either would give the view that we're still interested and concerned about our credibility and will move against inflation As I say, I would prefer ""B"" with an asymmetric tilt simply because of the communication But I could, and would, accept your proposal that it be stressed in the policy record "
3923,1990-07-02," Mr Chairman, the good news is that the drought is over as far as our District is concerned We had ""ponding"" and ""puddling"" but the fact of the matter is that the farm sector still remains the primary source of the strength in this rather slow-growing District economy With respect to the agricultural sector, the wheat crop, which has been mentioned here already today, is in a sense [unintelligible] Mother Nature plays tricks on the farmers as she does annually, I guess But overall the wheat crop is projected to be at or near a record level As a matter of fact, earlier today I received a report that wheat in western Kansas had yielded 10 percent more than it ever had before   The fact of the matter is that some of the wheat crop, which 30 days ago looked outstanding throughout most of our District, has been lost because of high winds and wet weather But overall it apparently will come out very well In addition, there has been a delay in planting corn and the corn acreage will be down this year, but that is [offset] by the soybean crop because of the later planting date for that crop Red meat prices for the farmers still are very good and as a result the agricultural economy looks very strong  With respect to the credit crunch that has been mentioned, with some diligence [in our search] we simply don't see it in our area of the country As a matter of fact, the complaint is that there is very little loan demand and liquidity is very high in most of the small agricultural banks particularly, as well as in some of the bigger banks Employment continues to grow throughout the District;  -19-    7/2-3/90  in fact, in each of the metropolitan areas the unemployment rate is lower than the national rate, and there is some strain on skilled labor in the District The District automobile manufacturing sector remains in the doldrums There is some continued modest improvement in the general aviation manufacturing area As for construction, home building is at a low level and there is very little commercial construction taking place because of the overhang that still exists in the energy areas such as Denver, Oklahoma City, and Tulsa Although there is some [construction] in Kansas City and a little in Omaha, by and large it does not measure up to year-ago levels In the energy sector, the OPEC overproduction has driven down prices, as noted earlier today However, the rig count in the District still remains fairly stable and in fact is higher than a year ago Overall, I would characterize the District as being in fairly good shape in most areas I hear very few comments from people that I or my staff have been in contact with concerning the economy itself People are pretty well satisfied, but one has to lay that against the fact that some of them suffered rather dramatically in the 1980s, so they think current conditions are pretty good  On the national level, we have no real divergence from what was presented in the Greenbook with the exception that in 1990 we're about 1/4 percentage point stronger [on GNP] than the Greenbook and inflation is roughly 1/4 percentage point more We're back together in 1991, however So, over the total horizon our forecast is not greatly different than the one the Greenbook portrays   Thank you, Mr Chairman I'd like to join those who start from the premise that strategy II on the long run--the one labeled ""tighter"" [in the Bluebook]--is consistent with our objective I also would join those who have indicated that where we are today is about where we want to be and about where we had projected in the past I think it's rather remarkable With that background, I would prefer to take the opportunity that I think is now available to ratchet down M2, simply because over the long term 6 percent growth in M2 is the maximum growth that we can sustain and still achieve the  -35-    7/2-3/90  objectives that we're looking for As a result, I would ratchet down M2 by 1 percentage point on both the top and the bottom for both 1990 and 1991, simply taking advantage of the window that seems to me to be available With regard to M3, there's some debate as to whether or not we should keep M3 There are those who have spoken on that in the past--particularly Governor Angell, who says that he would not pursue his feeling about doing away with M3 I would want to keep M3 But as has been indicated in the discussions before by the staff and others, it seems that M3 needs to be adjusted because of the uncertainties that have occurred I don't like the proposal by the staff of a 0 to 4 percent range; I don't like the 0 As a result, I would like to see an adjustment to a 1 to 5 percent range for M3 and I would maintain debt at 5 to 9 percent I would do both of those adjustments, to M2 and M3, now rather than later   Debt at 5 to 9 percent   Both years   Thank you, Mr Chairman This may be hair- splitting a bit, but my preference would be ""B"" with a symmetric directive I don't see that there is accumulating evidence of a tightening of credit markets As a result, a symmetric directive--to the extent that it will be read six weeks from now as a sort of ""steady-as-you-go"" policy--seems to me to be a reasonable outcome [of our meeting] On the other hand, if I have understood the discussions around this table in the past, particularly as articulated by Don, with a symmetric directive you have the ability to take one cut--if you will, a quarter point [on the funds rate], which is what we are talking about--without the necessity of a conference call or consultation As a result, it seems to me that ""B"" with a symmetric directive gives you what you want and I wouldn't object to that "
3946,1990-08-21," Mr Chairman, I would like to ask a question of the staff with respect to the forecast that has been laid out To give us the export numbers that are contained in the staff's forecast, it seems to me that the forecast assumes that growth in other industrialized countries will continue fairly strong I know there has been discussion of it already, but given the uncertainty about the oil situation and the reactions of Germany and Japan for example with respect to their interest rates, how comfortable are you that we will maintain exports at the level that you are projecting?   Thank you, Mr Chairman Well, [economic activity] in the Tenth District is not a great deal different than reported in prior meetings We continue to have moderate growth with mixed performance in individual industries within the District However, the higher oil prices will likely slow job growth in the District, particularly in states such as Missouri, Nebraska, and Colorado And that will not be offset in our opinion by the District's increase in energy production in states such as Oklahoma, Wyoming, New Mexico, and Kansas In the energy area, the District rig count did increase before the Middle East situation; the rig count went up from 266 in May to about 290 in June, largely in the natural gas area, however That level of 290 in June is only about [20] percent of the level in the peak years of 1982 and 1983 when the number of rigs operating in the District was something over 1500 Automobile manufacturing has been curtailed within the District, principally in Missouri, as has been reported For example, the GM plant has been closed for two weeks' vacation related to a lack of parts There is some suspicion that it's simply because the dealers just don't want to take down additional inventory On the other hand, Ford has closed its plant for a week because of the slow orders from dealers  In the agricultural sector, there has been a very large wheat crop, as I think everybody knows Prospects for corn and soybeans and other feed crops have been very good As reported earlier, because of a wet spring and late planting there is a good growing season, and it appears that we will have a very good crop in all of these different commodities providing we don't get an early frost, which would kill off this late planted corn and soybean crop One interesting thing that I'd like to report on is a second-quarter survey of farm land values, which showed a continued increase of 3 percent overall But that's a slowing in the rate of increase of agricultural land prices For example, in the same period in 1988 the year-over-year increase was 5-1/2 percent; for the same period in 1989 it was up 4 percent; and this year the increase slowed to about 3 percent  -24-    8/21/90  Given all of that, we don't see any great deterioration of economic activity, which is very much as it has been in the past What will happen with respect to the energy sector as a result of oil prices is still uncertain, obviously But as also reported earlier, we will not be able to get back into a boom condition of drilling oil wells simply because the level of skilled labor has vanished since that earlier period and there is not the equipment to put in the field to bring forward new wells  With regard to the national outlook, as Bob Forrestal said, in the interest of full disclosure I should report that our staff believes the outlook is a little weaker than shown in the Greenbook, marginally so However, I'm more supportive of the Greenbook forecast And it does show, of course, the kind of outcome that we would hope for That's all given against the background of the great uncertainty of the Middle East situation Talking about a recession, given what's going on in the Middle East and the prospects for a shooting war, I don't know that we have any history of going into a recession during a shooting war As a result, this adds a bit more uncertainty, but I come out [with the view] that the Greenbook forecast is very believable   Mr Chairman, I also would support your proposal I think the most important thing that you may have indicated is the need for stability If we were to move, it seems to me that the markets would read it as sort of a double whammy On the  -40-    8/21/90  one hand, I would assume a move toward ease would indicate to some that we are more concerned about a recession and, therefore, people will accumulate the thoughts [and tend to react in ways] that will make it come true On the other hand, another part of the market would read the easing as being inflationary over time and that will build inflationary expectations I think nothing good could come out of a move right now And as a result, stability is where we should be and where we should stay unless some very dramatic changes take place in the near future "
3969,1990-09-07," Roger Guffey, Mr Chairman I don't think there is'anything substantially different in our District than what was reported on before The general tenor in the Tenth District as to the outlook is that it's fairly promising I also would agree with your position of no change And we shouldn't overlook what a change might portend for the dollar, which is weak already "
3988,1990-09-17," Mr Chairman, Roger Guffey   [Unintelligible] the District economy will show relatively [unintelligible], albeit slow Agriculture is the bright part, though it is still uncertain because of conditions in the Middle East On the question that you asked Ed Boehne, I line up about right in the center of that It's quite clear to me, given the weakness in the dollar and the uncertainty about the Middle East and the budget accord, that one simply would push long-term interest rates higher-- and perhaps even much higher--and the dollar lower I don't think this is the time to take that kind of action "
4012,1990-10-02," Looking at the forecast, Mike, it appears to me that a good deal of emphasis was put on the net export sector You have it coming back fairly quickly What kind of assurances do you have, given the uncertainty of the Middle East problem, that that's really going to come about? You have it coming back very quickly, it seems to me   Thank you, Mr Chairman With respect to the District itself, the economy continues to grow moderately and there are mixed results in individual industries or economic areas of activity In the energy sector, for example, the higher oil prices have pushed up the rig count modestly For example, in August the count was 282 in the District and in September 301 However, that followed a drop in the rig count from July to August But it has come back and, as has been stated around this table before, the question is whether or not there is enough equipment and skilled labor to meet the demand The last and important part of that equation is whether or not there are enough lenders out there willing to finance oil speculation exploration Having been burned in past years, I'm not sure that that kind of financing will come from District banks Whether it will come from Boston's probably is not very clear either!  With regard to the agricultural sector, farmers have put in the bin the largest wheat crop since 1982 The corn and soybean crop look very good, with some concern about the bean crop being nipped with a little early frost But with regard to the wheat crop, given the lack of exports to Iraq that has already been mentioned and the projection of restricted or lower levels of exports to the Soviet Union, the reaction in the market is simply to [unintelligible] the big harvest The lower exports and less demand clearly have dropped  -29-    10/2/90  the price of those commodities substantially In the livestock industry, on the other hand, both hogs and cattle are going great guns, particularly with the prospect for cheaper feed in the future  As for automobile assembly activity in the District, auto makers continue to shut lines down or to shut down entire assembly factories For example, in Oklahoma City a plant will go down a full week in October and in Kansas City a Ford plant will shut down a week or two weeks, depending upon their order levels As a result, it's off and on There isn't much lost income when those auto workers are not working, however, because of the arrangements under the auto contracts So, it's really not a matter of cutting their purchasing power but rather a question of how much they're actually working and what kind of orders they're getting for particular automobiles or trucks On the other hand, in the aircraft industry, which was mentioned this morning by Mike--and Wichita is a big player in this-- the billings for 1990 and 1991 are projected to be about 30 percent higher than last year, year-over-year So, that industry is still clicking along very well With regard to construction, activity is up rather significantly over year-ago levels about 30 percent in nonresidential and 5 to 7 percent in residential  So all in all, the District, although not booming by any stretch of the imagination, is doing as well as or better than the nation And that is important with regard to the outlook in the sense that a lot of people I talk to say ""Well, we're doing pretty well, but I think we're in a recession"" When you press them on why they believe we're in a recession they say they watch the news or read the newspapers and given what's happening in the Middle East they simply think that times are [not] as good as they otherwise would have been But there's no real evidence that we're in a recession  With regard to the national economy, we go through the same exercise that the staff here does with regard to projections and with basically the same assumptions One thing we did not build in this month was the fiscal restraint that would take place with regard to a $35 billion budget agreement Even with that, we're a little less optimistic than the staff in the sense that we would project an additional quarter of flat growth--not negative, not positive, but flat--in the second quarter of 1991 Otherwise, it looks very similar But given the uncertainties that are out there, I don't think one can put a lot of faith in the long-run projection There are too many uncertainties As a result, it seems to me we probably should be doing nothing   We talk about the prospects for the longer end and the dollar if we ease Do you have any concern, given all the commentary that has taken place with respect to the fragility of the banking sector, that if we were to do anything before the budget is really set in concrete that it would be misinterpreted? Maybe misinterpreted is not the right word Rather, would it be thought that we reacted to the fragility of the banking system and as a result would that propel the market into greater negativism and [unintelligible]?   May I have a clarification, Mr Chairman? Are you talking about Friday or are you talking about early the following week?   Okay   Mr Chairman, given that you're thinking about moving on Tuesday after a holiday on Monday, we won't know then how the markets will react to the budget resolution being passed Would you consider--   Well, 24 hours can make a difference in the way the market reacts to digesting what happens on Friday That is my point And I would delay [our move]   Yes Also, it complicates the Desk's problems, being the last day of the reserve period   Oh, that's right Okay I'd just like to see how the market reacts to the budget activity before we go forward and complicate matters if it is a negative reaction   Mr Chairman, I would prefer to delay the 1/4 point [move] until there is something more concrete to support it in the economic data than what we're looking at now I don't see that we would be creating a greater supply, given the credit crunch, simply by dropping the rate 1/4 or even 1/2 point It's rather like pushing on a string As a result, I'd wait until either one or two things happened until either the economic data suggested that it's appropriate to ease or until the budget agreement itself is actually put together with some certainty Now, that may be three weeks; that may not be until the 19th of October It's October 2 now, so that's about 2-1/2 weeks away "
4037,1990-11-13," Just a follow up We have the authority to back currency with foreign assets, right?   Does any additional action need to be taken in order to implement that?   Thank you, Mr Chairman I want to go back to the discussion that took place between Governor Mullins and the staff with regard to the plant closings on automobiles and trucks There was some implication that there would be fewer consumer purchases simply because of that event It's my understanding that [auto workers] will continue to draw between 90 and 95 percent of their pay during these one-week or two-week closedown periods So, there is not a great diminution of purchasing power   Thank you, Mr Chairman On the national level, given the uncertainties and the assumptions contained in the Greenbook, the staff forecast seems to me as plausible a projection as one could make  On the District level, the economy continues to grow at a moderate pace Agriculture and energy are giving it a bit of a boost On the other hand, manufacturing and construction activities are sluggish and actually are deteriorating somewhat In the agricultural area, District farmers are completing the third [quarter]--and maybe the fourth, depending upon the area of the District--of an excellent year Farm income will be strong for 1990, although livestock producers will have a better year than crop producers largely because the wheat harvest came in at or near a record, which has depressed the price That feeds over, of course, into the [costs in the] livestock area for finishing off the cattle and hog in the red meat area As a result, the livestock producers will probably do better than the crop producers; but taken in the aggregate the farm sector has done very well in 1990 There is some concern, as Si Keehn mentioned, about the budget package as put together and what that will mean for subsidies in the period ahead Quite clearly, subsidies are going to be less in the future than they have been, but [questions about] how they're administered and the Administration's timing of those subsidies have created a lot of uncertainty And that does feed back into farm machinery sales, which have been almost at a standstill as far as we can tell  In the energy sector, because in October domestic oil prices were roughly double what they were back in June, there has been some modest increase in activity, principally in drilling For example, in the District in October there were 325 rigs working; that was up from 305 in September There has been a modest increase in the national rig count, and I'm sure the staff has those numbers  With respect to manufacturing, as I've indicated before, District auto plants are taking one-week or two-week sabbaticals-- well, layoffs There is a shutdown at both the Ford and the GM plants in Kansas City; neither worked the first week in November and the GM plant has continued to be closed for the second week of November On the other hand, the general aviation industry, which is a fairly large component part of our District economic activity, has begun to rebound although the light aircraft sector continues to decline Sales of turbo props and business jets are up very significantly and plants in Wichita will build the front section of the new Boeing 777 airplane for which they have substantial orders already on the books So, there is a very favorable outlook for the period ahead In construction, both residential and nonresidential contracts awarded in the District fell in September; they're at levels now about 13 percent below what they were one year ago There isn't really any evidence at the moment that either of those two sectors will see any revival until at least the spring of 1991   I would also support it I do have a question, however, Mr Chairman Why an asymmetrical directive?   I think I understand that we eased two weeks ago, and I assume you're proposing under this recommendation to ease tomorrow or sometime when it's convenient to the Desk That's essentially two easing moves within 2 or 2-1/2 weeks and there may be a further opportunity in the period ahead before the December 18th meeting But I would prefer if we're going to ease now--and I would delay it for a few days, by the way, and not do it right at this meeting but wait until we get some additional numbers on retail sales which come out tomorrow and do it next week--to accept your recommendation and then have a consultation before we ease again In other words, it could be three times in something over a month   What is the exact effect of an asymmetrical directive, then?   I understand that, and you have been very prompt to call a consultation under the circumstances you've just described I guess maybe I need some clarification of what a symmetrical and asymmetrical directive mean then Because if I understood what has been discussed before an asymmetrical directive would give the Chairman the flexibility to move without consultation one time in the intermeeting period "
4058,1990-12-07," Mr Chairman, Roger Guffey I essentially agree with the last two speakers, with a bit of a twist, however I would like to see an action taken today coupled with a discount rate move; if [the Board cut the discount rate] 1/2 point, I'd offset half of it through open market operations That option is still open for the period ahead, it seems to me   Well, it would be my feeling that we shouldn't unless things deteriorate much further than they have at this point I guess I still take some comfort from the fact that we are about on track in terms of where we want to be And to start easing very aggressively as we did in 1976 I think would be inappropriate   Sam, do you have any sense of what the Japanese and Germans might do with their rate structures? "
4075,1990-12-18," Peter, I don't think I understand the Japanese [unintelligible] in the market that has pushed the rates up Are [US money markets] providing liquidity to offshore Japanese banks or are they only providing liquidity to the Japanese banks here in the United States?   Thank you, Mr Chairman In the Tenth District, in contrast to several other Districts, we still have growth--though to be sure it's rather modest But we always had modest growth, I think, relative to the nation; this time we happen to be positive while the nation might be negative A lot of this largely comes from a very good harvest For virtually all of the crops grown within the Tenth District, the harvest is completed The exception is the cotton crop down in southern Oklahoma, which is an outstanding crop apparently, and the prices are very high for cotton because of some reduced crops in other parts of the country All in all, the agricultural sector is very healthy Cattle and hog prices remain very strong Wheat, corn, and other small grain prices have diminished because of the large world output in agricultural products However, there is some hope--not euphoria--that with the export credits that have just recently been granted to the USSR that exports of agricultural products will pick up and will impact our part of the world  On the energy side, there has been some modest pickup in exploration drilling I'm not sure that that will last very long For example, the rig count in the Tenth District went up modestly from 325 rigs to 336 rigs in the month just passed But the employment pickup in the energy sector probably is related more to the reworking of old wells than it is to new drilling or exploration That is, you can take a well that may be producing 6 to 10 or 12 barrels a day, rework it for $10,000, and increase that production to 18 or 20 barrels a day; it makes sense given the oil prices currently  Retail sales within the District, as best as we have been able to determine, are essentially flat I'm talking about the Christmas season, ex autos Autos are very soft as they are around the country I might just indicate, however, that the best anecdotal evidence about the agricultural sector [arose at] our branch board meetings There was one report that new pickup trucks were actually being sold for cash, which is something that hasn't happened in 6 to 8 years in the Tenth District As for retail sales being flat, the report that I received most recently about the Christmas season not being very strong [is partly related to] the very warm weather we have had Retailers expect or at least hope that in the last seven days-- and there is a cold front coming through the Midwest--those sales will pick up and that the Christmas or holiday season will indeed turn out better than most people expected, at least in our part of the country  -16-    12/18/90  With regard to manufacturing, automobile assembly plants have been closed down periodically because of cutbacks by the manufacturers, and the extended holiday will continue well into the first of the year for all of the auto plants within our District Construction is essentially flat, both commercial as well as residential There is some hope, particularly in the state of Kansas; there is a very big highway project there as a result of this public works project The value of the nonbuilding contracts in that state is well ahead of last year  All in all, the Tenth District is doing fairly well All the major cities that are metropolitan areas have unemployment rates well below the national rate And there's fairly good optimism--at least based on comments of our board members, not only at the head office but at each of the branch boards  With regard to the national outlook, we differ a bit in our view of that but the depth of the recession is not greatly different from peak to trough than what is projected in the Greenbook We have had some concern, and our numbers would reflect it, that the recession will be a little longer by one quarter In other words, rather than turning up in the second quarter of next year we would not expect to see that uptick until the third quarter; and then the latter two quarters of the year would be fairly close in the aggregate to what the Greenbook projects With regard to prices, in the Tenth District we don't see any price pressures and we don't quarrel with the projections in the Greenbook   As I remember your earlier comment, Peter, the year-end positioning has almost run its course, is that right?  -32-    12/18/90   Well, given that, my question is How soon after the first of the year would you see that unwinding being completed? What I'm really driving at is whether to delay a discount rate action and a reduction of the funds rate until after the first of the year, which is two weeks, roughly, given the several days on which the market would [not] operate in any event because of the holidays   I guess I was suggesting that since the activity has not been as intense this year as in past years it might unwind more quickly after the first of year--in a shorter period of time   I would support your recommendation, Mr Chairman I would go one step further, however, given the background that we have reduced the fed funds rate by roughly 3/4 of a percentage point in a six-week period starting with October 29 and that hasn't shown through yet Another 1/4 point doesn't bother me, but if we continue I do have a concern about overshooting and I also have a concern about moving the fed funds rate to the level of the discount rate or making the discount rate a penalty rate I would feel a lot more comfortable about your recommendation if indeed I was assured that the Board would act rather promptly to reduce the discount rate and that only half of it, 1/4 point, would show through   I don't see standing on ceremonies, which I think Wayne Angell has brought forth in the distinction between the Board and the FOMC Now is the time to set policy and I'd like to see it established here "
4095,1991-01-09," Mr Chairman, Roger Guffey I have been listening to all of the comments and I do have some concern about the aggregates, although it seems to me that it is pretty soft information to be taking a policy action on But beyond that, it seems to me that almost everything that was expressed this morning by the various participants was based upon uncertainty And I don't think we should be making policy [based] on uncertainty So, I hope that we hold steady for a period of time in the future "
4117,1991-02-05," Sam, what's magic about $10 billion as opposed to $5 billion, for example?   A follow-up question If we were to authorize $10 billion, then it's up to them? We don't trigger it but they do? They could do this anytime they want to and we have to take it?   Thank you, Mr Chairman The overall pace of economic growth in the District appears to be slowing somewhat, due mostly to weakness in manufacturing and construction Automobile  -27-    2/5-6/91  manufacturing, for example, which we share with the St Louis District, has weakened further But the District aircraft manufacturers reported improvement in sales of business jet aircraft and as a result are showing a good deal of strength Construction activity in the District remains weak overall but public works projects, such as a large public project in Kansas, continue to offset the weakness in both residential and nonresidential building activity I might also say in reference to state and local spending that throughout several of our metropolitan areas there appears to be on the shelf--the bonds have been sold--infrastructure construction that will be commencing in 1991 and will hold up that sector somewhat The oil price volatility and uncertainty about the outlook for oil prices is slowing activity in the District's oil patch And sluggish export demand has led to weak prices in wheat, corn, and soybeans On the other hand, the livestock prices continue to bolster farm income, and I would characterize the rural areas as being fairly optimistic  There is one vignette I'll add to Bob's In talking with a restauranteur who has stores across the United States in the mid to upper range of restaurants, they also found that [their business] virtually closed down on January 16th, 17th, and 18th But by the first of February they were back at a level that they found encouraging They attributed it largely to CNN and people sitting in front of the TV to determine what was happening in the Gulf war  As to the Greenbook forecast, we also believe it to be rosy That is, the pickup in the second quarter seems unlikely to us but we believe there will be the start of a pickup in the second half-- probably in the mid to late part of the third quarter We have growth about a percentage point below the growth projected in the Greenbook for the year 1991 but a percentage point above that projected in the Greenbook for 1992 So, averaging it out, the staff forecast does not look unreasonable to us; it is simply the timing and the contour of the recovery that we believe may be different than in the Greenbook I would say that if the war continues beyond midyear, then all bets are off as far as we can tell As I understand it, the best guess is that it should be over by mid-April   Thank you, Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman I think Wayne Angell has probably made my comments--rather well, as a matter of fact It seems to me that there are only two real and important aspects to the range for M2--and that's the only aggregate I'd be concerned about One is the midpoint, which gives us ample opportunity to achieve the staff's forecast for the year, and the other is the top of the range The real test if we do get the bounceback [in the economy], which implies vigorous growth of M2, is going to be whether or not we have the courage to do what I think we should do fairly quickly The second part of that is that we only have 5 months, or 6 months maybe, before we take a look at these ranges again I think the message that would be received well by the markets is that we are indeed still concerned about inflation All the rhetoric about the short recession I think plays well with the longer-term view that inflation is our major target   Alternative B I would prefer a symmetric directive, given the background of the easing that already has taken place and the closeness of the easing just last Friday A symmetric directive does not imply that you do not have the flexibility to take a cut at easing between now and the next meeting on your own And that is the insurance that I would feel comfortable with rather than the asymmetric directive "
4144,1991-03-26," I guess I don't know what the term ""enhanced consultation"" really means I don't want to define it and put it in stone, but it has the right ring to it in the sense that I don't think the discount rate should dominate open market activities in the intermeeting period or vice-versa necessarily And as a result, it does require some discussion and more frequent discussions; but whether or not this [enhanced consultation suggestion] implies that isn't clear to me I happen to agree with Bob Black's comment with respect to the further action taken before the last FOMC meeting   To raise an old technical question maybe, given that we neatly divide the holdings between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve Do we have sole authority to determine the foreign currency holdings of the Federal Reserve System or is this a national policy that must be coordinated with the Administration? Where do we stand? Can we just sell off $24 billion of mark and yen and forget it if we want to?   How does that [differ]?   Well, let me put it another way Can we sell off $48 billion, which is the Treasury's holdings as well as our own?   If we were to choose to sell off $5 billion of our own, how do you maintain the 50/50 split between the two?   Yes   Well, the answer to my question then is that if we decided to reduce our Federal Reserve holdings of foreign currencies, this Committee could do that and you could effect it   Mr Chairman, in the Tenth District, the economy continues to outperform the national economy modestly and that is a bit of a departure from the long-term trend; we normally lag the [national] economy But both the personal income as well as the employment numbers show that the economy during the fourth quarter continued to add jobs and that that will continue in the first quarter The District added jobs at an annual rate of about 1-1/2 percent during the fourth quarter as the recession took over nationally and, as I understand it, the national employment figures dropped about 16 percent So, in terms of the overall health of the  -33-    3/26/91  Tenth District relative to the nation, I think we're still doing fairly well but at a very slow pace There were jobs added in each of our seven states with the exception of Oklahoma Overall, the region in terms of economic health is being held down a little in the manufacturing sector because of our area of Missouri  It is, however, a time when the sap begins to rise and the euphoria comes on the agricultural sector In agriculture, cattle and hogs, the red meats, are still the most important addition to the economy in the sense that feeder cattle, for example, are now selling for over $100 per 100 pounds, which is an all-time high On the other hand, small grain, and principally wheat, does have some serious problems because of the drought Governor Angell's farm probably ended up partially in Oklahoma City a couple of weeks ago when there was a big dust storm coming out of western Kansas and western Oklahoma! If that area continues without moisture, clearly, the outlook for wheat will be hurt With regard to manufacturing, perhaps the story has been told many times with regard to auto assembly Clearly, each of the assembly plants in our District is cutting back; they actually are cutting out shifts and/or closing down for short periods of time I do understand, however, that the inventory of cars being held now by the manufacturer and the dealer is coming down to a very low level If there is a pickup in consumer confidence, that should be a real kick in terms of the manufacturers coming back on stream The energy area is essentially flat; there hasn't been much activity Drilling activity had actually decreased month-over-month, but that is so small that it makes very little difference probably The one area that may be a catalyst, or an area of the economy that could give a kick start to the Tenth District, would be oil field construction and drilling equipment orders that may come as a result of the Kuwait/Iraq situation We do have several rather large oil drilling construction companies in the District  As far as the national economy is concerned, I would agree with those who say that the second quarter probably will be flat and the third and fourth quarters will be a little less vigorous than the Greenbook forecast But overall the Greenbook is about as good a guess as I have or as most everybody else has, I think I'd be willing to buy it   ""B"" symmetric "
4166,1991-04-12," Mr Chairman, Roger Guffey I had the opportunity over the last couple of days to have discussions with directors from across the District as well as to meet with regional businessmen and bankers It's fairly clear that, at least in this District, there is a continued modest improvement in our economy and very little sentiment for any further ease It does seem to me that past monetary policy actions perhaps have not worked themselves through As a result, on balance, I would not prefer the action that    4/12/91  you have proposed On the other hand, another 1/4 percentage point doesn't bother me much, provided we are clearly committed to moving the rate back up promptly when we find that the turning point has indeed begun to surface I'm really concerned, I suppose as much as anything else, about our acting because the market has expectations that we should act We should do what we think is appropriate And if we're going to move, I would prefer to wait until maybe sometime toward the end of next week "
4199,1991-05-14," Thank you, Mr Chairman In the District itself we continue to see some modest pickup in economic activity In manufacturing, for example, the auto plants are not back full out, but the Ford plants are running two shifts and a large General Motors plant in Kansas City itself is beginning to put people back on [the payroll] It also has raised a problem in that they simply have begun to use overtime rather than put a second shift back on And the unions have become very upset because auto manufacturers haven't put the second shift people back to work As a result, I think they're trying to manage [unintelligible] It does seem quite clear to me that although the auto makers' projections are not strong, there will be some positive impact on our output in the period ahead simply because they are starting from a very low base and they are at work and are producing In the aviation area, general business aviation-- the small jets, for example--is still very good They had very good bookings and sales in the first quarter and that is projected to continue Construction remains sluggish, particularly in the commercial area, but in the residential and other nonresidential areas some pickup is evident  -13-    5/14/91  The agricultural area has already been discussed The winter wheat crop looks to be fairly good and is spotty only in the sense that we've had some fairly severe weather come through the Midwest and that could be devastating to wheat at this stage in its development simply because of the hail and strong winds But by and large there is a fairly optimistic view of that crop The problem, obviously, is the weak commodity price for wheat Nonetheless, it's better to produce than not to produce Cattle producers, as I've indicated before, are doing very well, and that's projected to continue  In the energy area, drilling has slacked off I think simply because the stability of the imported oil prices at $20 a barrel or thereabouts does not encourage very much exploratory drilling There has been some development drilling That is, after a field is discovered, it has to be developed, and there is some modest activity going on in that area The other area of optimism in the energy field is the oil field suppliers who take some encouragement from the Gulf contacts that they established as a result of the Persian Gulf oil catastrophe  With regard to the national picture, I have no great quarrel with the Greenbook forecast As a matter of fact, I think it's a good deal better than it has been in the past We believe that the staff is a little over-optimistic on the timing in that their second-quarter forecast is considerably stronger than we have, although the second half of the year really comes out about the same So, it's simply [a difference in] timing When we scaled back the second quarter we scaled back a bit from where we were before But, on balance, it's as good a forecast as I think one can make, and it's a believable forecast   I have just one [comment] I happen to agree with what you said with the exception that if the aggregates--in particular M2--do not come in as projected over the next couple of months, I would have some concern about the outlook   I think there's some informational value over the next couple of months "
4237,1991-07-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman The District's economic growth continues to improve, with agriculture being the dominant source of that strength, but manufacturing and construction continue to show some additional improvement In the agricultural sector, the harvest of wheat--a major agricultural product in the District--has been virtually completed They've gone through Oklahoma, Kansas, and are now in eastern Nebraska That wheat crop is estimated to be something like 25 percent less than last year--last year being a bumper crop But the more important aspect is that wheat prices are at very low levels As a matter of fact, I think they're now at the level that Wayne Angell experienced when he got out of high school 10 years ago! [Laughter] The fact of the matter is that there will be a cash flow but it's just not an outstanding crop Part of the diminishment in the actual grain production of about 25 percent comes from less planting acreage, but also there are fairly spotty areas across the District in terms of either wet or dry [conditions] or some infestation Beyond that in the agricultural sector, cattle prices have declined from their record levels but still remain a principal source of cash flow for the farmers  In manufacturing, the District automobile plants, with the exception of the one in Kansas City, have been operating on a full two-shift production schedule And that plant in Kansas City, which is a new GM plant, will be putting its second shift back on in September, suggesting that those production schedules are gearing up  -15-    7/2-3/91  to meet what they hope to be sales Construction activity in the District also continues to improve The building contract awards in the District in April, for example, were nearly 25 percent above year- ago levels and that was principally a result of public works projects, or infrastructure kinds of projects However, the residential and the nonresidential contracts have shown improvement over year-ago levels, so there is some hope that those will continue and we will not have another downturn in that area The energy sector has been a dead issue in the sense that prices are such that it just does not encourage any new exploration; indeed, they've shut down some of the small producing, stripper-type wells as a result of the current oil prices and projections of prices in the future On the other side, natural gas prices, which the Tenth District probably is better known for--it has a greater supply of natural gas certainly than of petroleum--continue to deteriorate and as a result there's not great euphoria in that area  On the national level, we're not greatly different from the Greenbook forecast but, like Mr Forrestal, we have a little different pattern For example, we do not show in the last half of 1991 as much vigor in the economy as the staff does As best as I can determine, looking at the relative figures, the staff has a fairly sharp comeback in inventories which we do not have On the other hand, in 1992 we're a bit stronger than they are and the averages for the next six quarters together are right on the button at about 3-3/4 percent growth through that period and in 1993   I think perhaps everything has been said and there's nothing more new, particularly with respect to my view that your proposal is the correct one That is, we've come to mid-July when you will testify and there are still such uncertainties about this recovery that to suggest that we can say the recovery is well underway and we can look forward 18 months ahead and say we're going to bring money growth down seems to me to be the wrong signal to be giving at this time That does not say, however, that if I were here in February that I would not be going to the 2 to 6 percent range, because I think it is over the long run the appropriate way to go-- providing we do have the recovery that has been projected by the staff in the Greenbook   ""B"" symmetric "
4258,1991-08-05," Mr Chairman, Roger Guffey If I may, I will follow up on Gary's comments They fairly well characterize what we find here, with the exception of some drought conditions in eastern Kansas through Missouri that I think is a part of what Si Keehn has already detailed Otherwise, we don't see any lack of optimism here The District continues to go along not at a rapid clip, but nonetheless in a positive growth pattern With respect to the money numbers, I think it's obvious to everybody--at least it is to me--that up until the month of July we were fairly well on track But we've had one month's experience and a projection that nobody knows how [accurate] it may or may not be I would just like to ask Don if the staff has done any work on lending by other than banks in the sense    8/5/91  that banks have become less important in the credit extension process Is there something going on beyond the numbers that we look at and that, given the monthly measures, could change the view a bit? "
4278,1991-08-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman With respect to the Greenbook forecast, our staff forecast is very close to it but continues to be, as it has in the past, a bit weaker in the latter half of '91 and therefore all of '91 and a little stronger in '92; it is really a shift, I think, of some of the component parts of the forecast So, the Greenbook forecast, as far as I'm concerned at least, looks to be the most likely outcome, and I think that the risks are basically balanced on either side at this point and that there's not a greater risk on one side than the other As a matter of fact, we took a look at the double-dip scenario, which Bob McTeer mentioned before, and we could not see anything that resembled what the historical experience has been on double-dips So, we believe that the projection for continued slow growth over the next six quarters is the most likely outcome  With respect to conditions in the District, the economy seems to be slowing somewhat from what was observed before It is due to a stalling in the [production of] natural grains in the agricultural sector and the sluggish energy and manufacturing sectors We're projecting somewhat weaker export markets And now this new event has taken place You will recall that the President did agree to provide $900 million of export guarantees to the Soviet Union; that has been put on hold as I understand it or has been or will be withdrawn, depending upon the [political] outcome in the Soviet Union If that is the case, then the crop prices that we're concerned about, particularly corn, would be weakened somewhat simply because the market has been diminished And that's notwithstanding the drought conditions that we still have; that may not be quite as broadly spread as in the Chicago District, but it is nonetheless real; it is spotty, and its [impact in terms of] diminishing crops is uncertain At the District automobile manufacturing plants, production remains weak, although each of them has come forth with a increased production schedule starting in September For example, in the Kansas City area, a second shift will be put back to work in a GM plant that has been on layoff now for six to eight months The outlook for construction activity in the District continues to improve, mostly because of gains in residential and the non-building contract awards; the latter include infrastructure improvements on the table now for bidding, which will be concluded over the upcoming period And despite a recent modest increase in the number of active drilling rigs in the District, energy activity remains sluggish and well below the level of a year ago That's largely because of the uncertainty in the cost of imported crude, and there's a very weak market in natural gas So, there's not much to encourage somebody to do any exploratory development or drilling at the moment  -27-    8/20/91  With regard to the agricultural financial sector, the loan- to-deposit ratio in those banks is only at about the 52 percent level They're looking for loans In the whole District the loan-to-deposit ratio is at fairly low levels There just is not the demand; there's plenty of liquidity, apparently Lastly, our quarterly agricultural survey indicates that land prices have stabilized after coming off very low levels over the past two to three years Prices are now about 35 percent higher than they were at that low; we had seen continued increases in agricultural land prices until this past quarter, when they essentially flattened out   I would opt for ""B"" with a symmetric directive, given the fact that you have the authority under the procedures to move without consultation of the Committee I would marginally favor version II "
