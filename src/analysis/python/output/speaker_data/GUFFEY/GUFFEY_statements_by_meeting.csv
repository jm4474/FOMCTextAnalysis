22,1987-08-18," It is a simple matter, however, to get that authority by wire if the need exists "
23,1987-08-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman Let me comment that I think our forecast parallels the forecast that appears in the Greenbook this time But a question, I guess to Mike With regard to the really sharp swing that you have between the third and fourth quarters in personal consumption expenditures, and the resulting buildup in inventories, which we have somewhat [unintelligible] for the period ahead, is that in your forecast totally as a result of the auto sales picture that you've described?   No other factors--   The other question I would pose has to do with your outlook on inflation and your rather sharp jump in the unit labor    8/18/87  cost that appears between the third and fourth quarters and continues on out through the projected period It's my impression, at least, that other than the autos that come up in September, the union-labor negotiations [calendar] is very thin, and we can't see where you're getting that kind of a jump in the output, the decrease in productivity, and so forth   Thank you, Mr Chairman I've already made comments with respect to our outlook and our general agreement with the Greenbook forecast I'd like to make this very brief, in view of the time The regional economy that we're experiencing in the Tenth District has some positive outlook to it in the sense that, as others have already commented, the agricultural sector is having and will have one of its best years, with this major rise in net farm income There has been a good crop The red meat industry is in very, very good shape As a result, there has been some uptick, or at least modest turnaround, in what had been falling agricultural land values One survey shows that from the first quarter to the second quarter, agricultural land values have increased about 1-1/2 percent; and that's to be contrasted with a long period of declining land values I would just note, however, that the sales that have translated into that greater land value number are one of two kinds 1) cash transactions in which neighboring producers are picking up depressed or troubled land ownership; or 2) the Farm Credit System is offering very attractive financing rates to move land off of their books in order to avoid any additional loss I would just note that, as a result of this, the margins in the production of red meat are very good at the moment However, the inventory is beginning to build, and we would expect that there would be little or no additional pressure on prices from the food sector as a result of the [uninteligible]--no real hope of increased commodity prices either in terms of crops or red meat Lastly, there is some optimism being generated in the energy sector There is some drilling now taking place; the rig count is up modestly from a month or two ago So, psychologically, given what we see, we would expect things to continue to improve but at a very slow rate In the commercial real estate area, we have overbuilding in Denver, Oklahoma City, and Tulsa, which is depressing that market; and those conditions, obviously, rose out of the depressed conditions of agriculture and energy that they depend on greatly We believe things are looking up, but we have a long upward pull to get back to better conditions than we have now "
24,1987-08-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman A good deal of comment has already been made about the growth--that it's perhaps a bit stronger than we were expecting last month But, I would just note that if you believe the forecast, and I think virtually everybody agrees with the Greenbook, you're only looking at 2-3/4 percent growth in the third and fourth quarters That doesn't seem to me to be overly expansive And, there is considerable uncertainty as to the inflation outlook, at least in my mind To be sure, prices are quite likely to be up, but as a result of feeding through on import prices; and I'm not at all sure that a bit tighter monetary policy is an appropriate prescription under those circumstances As a result, I would favor ""B"", with $500 million borrowing, until some additional evidence comes along I would note, in that respect, for those who believe that the aggregates are important and that there is some informational content in them, that they're growing at a very nominal rate now As a result, to further tighten at this point, in anticipation of some higher prices, seems to me to be inappropriate So I would go for ""B"" with a $500 million borrowing level until some more information surfaces that would lead us away from that Lastly, I would prefer to leave the language with respect to the dollar in the directive because, in my view, monetary policy has to act against a depreciation in the dollar that becomes fast, no matter what the cause And, as a result, I would leave it in, and I would even leave it at a fairly high level of visibility in the directive   The alternative is to state it in terms of about 5 percent for both "
76,1987-09-22," There is some comment in the press saying that the G-10 or the G-7 had adjusted their target levels from 140 or 160 to 13150 Is that rumor, or is that--? "
77,1987-09-22," Mr Chairman, I have a couple of questions for Mike with respect to the sections that caught my eye in the forecast You mentioned that a further decline in the dollar was assumed in your forecast As I remember, the Greenbook only made reference to a decline much like that projected in the last Greenbook Further, as I remember, that decline was 10 percent on an annual basis, and most of that had been completed in the first half of the year Am I correct, or is there further decline assumed?   My second question has to do with your assumption about rising interest rates in the fourth quarter To be very specific, do you have a level of interest rates in the fourth quarter that you assumed in this forecast?   In the first quarter?   My last question has to do with your comment about inflation picking up--I guess that's in 1988, if I read the Greenbook numbers correctly, because your forecast has it actually declining in the last quarter of this year, as measured by the fixed- weight index or the deflator itself    9/22/87   So is it fair to say, Mike, that inflation in the second half, and particularly in the last quarter and maybe even into the first quarter of 1988, is reasonably stable in your forecast?   Thank you, Mr Chairman I will try to be very brief in view of the coffee being outside! With respect to the Tenth District, we do see some very, very modest recovery Looking at various sectors of the economy, starting with agriculture commodity prices are up; red meat prices are very good; government transfer payments are outstanding; and, as a result, there is some comfort in the agricultural sector--or at least among those who are still in the sector Lastly, I would say that our most recent survey indicates that agricultural land prices have stabilized, and there is a modest uptick in those prices as well So, agriculture, from a very low level, has a good outlook for the rest of 1987 and quite likely in 1988, depending upon what the farm subsidy program will be in 1988 When you look at energy, the same is true from a very, very low base it looks a bit better In July, for example, there were 373 rigs working in the Tenth District as opposed to [unintelligible] in June That's not much of an uptick, to be sure, and it is only 20 percent of the level that was achieved in 1982, which was the peak of the energy boom So, it is still at a very low level [Unintelligible] supporting a bit Commercial real estate has been very depressed in Denver, Oklahoma City, and Tulsa--those areas that built on expectations [generated by] the energy and agricultural booms back in the early 1980s, inflationary expectations, [unintelligible] There is a very slow absorption rate of some very nice and new commercial structures In the Kansas City area there has been some damping in commercial construction, but nonetheless, it still looks very prosperous In some areas, there has been a bit of damping in residential starts and sales, but activity is still above a year ago throughout the District in the aggregate One last point that I would make with respect to economic activity in the District would be on the manufacturing sector the automobile industry is not working at full production and, as a matter of fact, there continue to be layoffs in plants, particularly in the Kansas City area, in the GM plants specifically There has been a bit of light at the end of the tunnel in the aircraft industry in the sense that sales most recently have been up in dollar volume but down in unit sales, largely because the sales are of jet aircraft as opposed to the smaller units  Let me just address, then, our view of the staff forecast They are a bit more bullish than we are We look for about 2-3/4  -27-    9/22/87  percent growth not only for the remainder of 1987 but into 1988 In trying to look at their forecast in relation to our numbers, I believe the difference is that they have a buildup in inventories in the fourth quarter that goes out into 1988 That may be the difference in their forecast and ours, but it is such a modest difference that I don't think there would be a lot to argue about To be perfectly honest, I hope their forecast occurs I don't feel there is much risk on the upside, however, of this getting away from us  Lastly, as to your question on long-term bond rates, I suspect it is a part of all three of the things that have been mentioned I guess I would come out on the side of giving more weight to the view that it is an increase in real rates necessary to attract funds to support this federal budget deficit as opposed to just inflationary expectations The uncertainty created by all of this largely accounts for it; how you disaggregate it, I don't know "
78,1987-09-22," Mr Chairman, I would support the proposition I would prefer, however, to drop back to the $500 million borrowing  -34-    9/22/87  level You said it doesn't take us much from where we are currently, but if, indeed, $100 million equates to about 1/4 percent [on the federal funds rate] you are looking at least at that amount more yet to take place that the market has not perceived And, since the market doesn't know we have been at $600 million, the $500 million seems more appropriate to me, and that would be my choice   But he hasn't been too well the last two maintenance periods, have you, Peter? "
133,1987-11-03," Well, Mr Chairman, I don't think that I can; so I will respectfully pass "
134,1987-11-03," Thank you, Mr Chairman I would join those who would opt for ""B"" with asymmetric language towards ease--that is, if ""B"" as it has been defined means a funds rate around 6-3/4 percent or a bit higher, and I think it clearly does I also would adopt the Corrigan language, particularly if I understood Jerry correctly, that he wants to delete from Variant I the language referring to relatively frequent consultations I think that highlights something that six weeks or eight weeks from now, when this is released, perhaps will have more meaning than we want to give to it On the federal funds rate range--although quite clearly we are targeting the federal funds rate within some very narrow range, it is under very unusual circumstances--to change that language in the last sentence from 5 to 9 percent to 4 to 8 percent is a bit meaningless and, in my view, unnecessary I'd leave it at the present range and keep it as broad at it is   I'd prefer just to maintain 5 to 9 percent "
187,1987-12-15," Thank you, Mr Chairman As to the fundamental question of whether to stay with the federal funds rate or go to a nonborrowed or a borrowed reserve target, I think I would be one of only three or four here who sat around this table when we targeted federal funds back in the 1970s And I can tell you that our experience was not very good, as everybody knows There was a lot of tugging and pulling to go an eighth of a point on the federal funds rate As a matter of fact, we even got to the point of setting a zone of indifference where the federal funds could move a quarter of a point between two established points And the fact is that the information that came from that procedure was well behind the facts and got us into trouble, in my view I think we have to move back to a procedure of targeting nonborrowed reserves Also, I would join Tom Melzer in his proposal to do it, first of all, as quickly as possible, and secondly, under the umbrella of uncertainty that surrounds the year-end I would opt for alternative (3) in the sense that we shouldn't totally ignore the federal funds rate over this next three- to four-week period But I think the focus should be on the borrowing level and--   No, no, I beg your pardon, I didn't I should not have said that; I meant a borrowing target And I'd do it under the umbrella, or the smokescreen, of the year-end uncertainty   That would be the zone of indifference   I can tell you, Frank, having had several of these special situations, that the market knows about as early as the Federal Reserve does that a bank is in for special borrowing They do discount it, in a sense, I think   Pardon me?  STERNLIGHT(?) When it gets to--   Before it gets to extended credit, it's fairly well known and the banks are fairly well identified But suggesting that we would actually--   Yes, the dollars--   Some of you don't   Could you speak up a little, Jerry, please?   I've forgotten what I was going to say Well, given the fact that we have to set growth targets for something under the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, what has come out of this paper, it seems to me at least, is that M2 is perhaps the best of what may be bad choices M1A may be about the same, but given the fact that M2 is better understood by the public and the markets, I would continue with M2 There's one other aspect--and I'm not quite sure that this is correct, but my recollection is that Canada has in recent years set a target over a longer horizon than one year I think perhaps it's a two-year target with a moving base and they use that merely for the purpose of determining whether they are above or below the trend line of growth that they were shooting for That has some attractiveness to me, and I think that may be what we should be doing with M2 over a longer-term horizon I think Canada abandoned that, simply because they determined that it was more important for them in current times to focus on exchange rates, relative to the dollar principally, rather than to hit a monetary target, however they defined it So, it seems to me that we are talking about two different things One is how we would manage monetary policy in the very short run through these intermediate periods; the other is what we should be focusing on, and that is a horizon, and probably for M2, over a one-year or two-year period   Sure  -32-    12/15-16/87   And, in the short run--   Because of deregulation?   I would just ask Sam How much do we have--I am talking about the System and the Exchange Stabilization Fund--as a cache of marks and yen that we can draw upon in the future without swap arrangements?   That means, if we were to continue [intervention purchases of dollars] for a very long period of time, we would have to use our swaps "
188,1987-12-15," Well, it's getting late, Mr Chairman I would just add to the optimism in a sense, particularly from the District perspective, although we are lagging the national recovery both in terms of employment gains as well as personal income gains Nonetheless, looking back from where we started, in energy, agriculture, aircraft, and so forth, things are looking much better That's particularly true in the agricultural area, where things such as agricultural real estate values actually have increased in the second quarter--very modestly to be sure, but nonetheless there is an increase Energy rig exploration is something in the neighborhood of 35 percent greater than a year ago However, given what's happening now with the potential fall in the oil prices, I'm not sure that will continue With regard to retail sales, the report that we have is  -68-    12/15-16/87  that they are modestly higher, some 5 percent higher, than the same time last year, with a lot of sales and discounting, which means volume should be moving through those retail elements As a result, I guess I would say we feel better than we did a year ago, and better than we did six months ago The clouds on the horizon might be a drop in energy prices as the result of OPEC's problems and/or a change in the agricultural subsidy provisions from the federal government, both of which would impact the Tenth District However, looking at 1988, the latter would suggest that it will be a fairly good year, given current commodity prices--if they hold up Agricultural exports are very encouraging to the people in our area Those are mostly government-subsidized exports, I might say, but the inventories that built up in the last couple of years are being worked off "
189,1987-12-15," Well, the summary would be very short I would favor alternative ""B"", with a symmetric directive With respect to the operating procedures, like several others, I would like to move to alternative (4) as quickly as possible I'd do it under the cover of the year-end uncertainty Alternative (3) has some attractiveness to me, but it seems to me that this Committee ought to be making the decisions rather than putting that burden upon you, Mr Chairman, and Peter on a day-to-day basis As a result, I think alternative (4) ultimately is where we should be And with regard to alternative ""B"", I'd associate that with a federal funds rate in the range of 6-3/4 to 7 percent, with whatever borrowing is commensurate with that, which I assume would be around $350 million to $400 million   Well, this number doesn't appear in the policy record or the directive; it's not in either one   Yes, but it only talks about the level of the borrowing target "
254,1988-02-09," Thank you, Mr Chairman I guess, like a couple of others who have sat around this table too long, I'm maybe getting  -39-    2/9-10/88  jaded Let me first say that setting ranges is legally necessary to have some constraining effect on the Committee and monetary policy Therefore, I accept that as being something very good But listening to the discussion around the table brings to mind what I believe was a statement in the Bluebook that the staff forecast falls in any one of these three [alternatives] You're talking about a difference of 1/2 of a percentage point in the midpoint from one to the other And it's minutia The fact of the matter is that any one of them will fit  So, I think Ed Boehne is right As the Bard said, ""all the world's a stage"" and I think that's what we're doing here today That is, [the issue] is what kind of message you give as you testify regarding the intention of the Federal Reserve in the period ahead with respect to economic growth and inflation My own view is that since we already established alternative II in July, we probably don't know much more about what's ahead now than we did in July with respect to a decision on these aggregate ranges Going on a holiday as Jerry suggested, or at least the Federal Reserve doing nothing very dramatic, seems to me to be a very good thing to happen in the period ahead I would reestablish the ranges of alternative II; I think you can do anything you want to with them I think they serve the purpose; and the message that you give in testimony is the more important one  I would not rebase; we've been through that many, many times in the past with a great deal of consternation by Congress and others about what they thought we were rebasing And I don't think we ought to get into that kind of controversy As a result, I could accept the widening of the range to 4 to 8 percent; but to avoid any ripples I'd do 5 to 8 percent--alternative II straight down the line   Mr Chairman, with regard to Lee Hoskins' question about changing the borrowing target--I don't want to focus on whether or not reducing the target $50 million was right or not right for the long-run best interests of the economy--but I am concerned that it was done in such a way that it did not take into consideration the decision made by this Committee and the directive that was issued [when the Committee consulted in early January] There are four kinds of developments in that directive that permit you [as Chairman] to move the borrowing target and I think that decision is left principally in your hands I think there was no evidence--at least it certainly wasn't clear in Kansas City that there was incoming evidence from the fourth-quarter numbers, for example--for the borrowing target to be adjusted down $50 million for the next two-week period It seems to me that decision was outside the confines of the directive itself I raise this without trying to make any other issue out of it But it seems to me it is an important issue that we have to keep in mind   In my view, it's particularly important, given the background of the political pressure that had come from the Treasury people and so forth, that such a decision be a broader-based decision I understand the flexibility that you must have, Mr Chairman, and that the Desk must have This is a structural issue and I only want to raise it "
255,1988-02-09," Thank you, Mr Chairman However, it's always difficult to follow the Eleventh District Over the years, we in the Tenth District have lagged the national economy, both in personal income as well as employment growth, generally throughout the cycle That's true again this time However, there is some optimism it seems to me, given [developments in] two or three primary sectors of our economy For example, in agriculture, which has already been spoken of here, land prices are up; commodity prices are up; and exports appear to be very vigorous and have taken with them the red meat prices, particularly for cattle and hogs The farmers have recovered from a very low level of activity and they're feeling very good, even in the middle of the winter with cold weather I think an important observation, which Gary Stern made, is that there are some real paybacks to the agricultural banks--their outstanding agricultural credit--and that is flowing back into main streets of these small communities Although that sector is not totally reviving, there is some optimism appearing there On the other hand, in the energy sector, apparently because of the lack of any substantive agreement among OPEC members to control supply, what we saw as an uptick early in 1987 in drilling exploration activity has dropped off again in the Tenth District People are simply not willing to commit to financing another hole--to put down another hole to discover whether there is any more resource there One of the bright spots, as mentioned earlier, is in the aircraft orders that have been booked, which impacted our District rather significantly through Boeing, Beech, and other aircraft manufacturers It has given some real hope for an uptick in that sector Commercial construction is winding down in our District It should have wound down in Denver, Oklahoma City, and Tulsa two years ago, and as a result, there are high vacancy rates there But by and large it's being pretty well managed  On the national level, as far as the forecast is concerned, I have no disagreement with the Greenbook My staff would be a bit more pessimistic than I personally, but the Board staff's forecast is right on, as far as I'm concerned And I'd like to echo those comments that have already been made that we don't become overzealous in the first half of the year, or at least the first quarter, in working off the inventories, if indeed that be the case--jockeying monetary policy around to try to accommodate an unforeseen event I'll talk a little more about that tomorrow "
256,1988-02-09," Mr Chairman, I would opt in the short run for alternative B with the existing borrowing target of $250 million I'm concerned about trying to hit a target below that--and I'm talking about the $100, $150, or $200 million--simply because I think there is a frictional level of borrowing where we lose control, particularly if you get seasonal borrowing as $50, $70, or $100 million of that $100  -62-    2/9-10/88  million borrowing target I think you take a real risk if things do not come in as you want in the first quarter and you choose to move against a recession, then you have to do a discount rate decrease And I think the implications of that for the dollar are very great, as Governor Johnson has pointed out As a result, I would stay right where we are with the borrowing target of $250 million On the long run, I favor alternative II with a 5 to 8 percent range for M2; I could accept the 4 to 8 percent range I agree with the point made by Bob Boykin that we have already gone down a half of a percentage point from the targets set for 1987 and if you do another half point, you give the view that you went on the low side That's something I don't want to do "
313,1988-03-29," There's one other aspect of that the market understood that we were looking at the funds rate And a 16th of a percentage point move in the funds rate moved the market at that time We almost got trapped in our own procedure, in the sense that we had to have a virtual consensus of this Committee and of the then-Chairman to move more than a 16th of a percentage point on the funds rate, simply because the market reacted so violently to it People such as the Chairman used to interpret that data, I'm sure   Thank you, Mr Chairman I agree with a lot that has been said around the table As a matter of fact, some five or six speakers ago Ed Boehne said almost everything that has been said and I agreed with him there   Just in summary, my view is very much as stated by Frank Morris and Bob Forrestal that the current procedure of using the borrowing target as a proxy, if you will, for the federal funds rate or for whatever, gives us some latitude in our operations That seems to me to be desirable at this particular time And I would strongly oppose moving to simply targeting a federal funds rate, or even a federal funds range, because it seems to me that as soon as the market understands that, then it becomes difficult, or almost impossible, to tighten You have to keep it a bit fuzzed up to permit the Committee to operate [unintelligible]  Perhaps the issue that is more important is the question of flexibility And I think the last time I may have made some comments with respect to that and what happened early in February My view has not changed and I hope I stated it clearly then I think the Chairman  -30-    3/29/88  and the Desk need flexibility It's clearly an issue in my mind as to what is a policy change and how that should be communicated, either before or after action is taken; and that has to rest largely on the Chairman's judgment And I'm quite willing to place the responsibility there When you talk about what is a policy change, I don't think that you can quantify that I see in the memorandum that was prepared that there's a suggested procedure on page 7 that if the borrowing target is to be moved, the Chairman would have some latitude to change the borrowing target by $50 million to $100 million I don't know, in some circumstances, whether that's really a policy change But if it were so determined by the Chairman, I would hope that consultation would take place, and take place before the change actually was effected by the Desk  Lastly, I guess I would ask that there be some change in a procedure that I have observed over a number of years, not just the last 6 months or a year at times a policy change, perhaps within the scope of the directive, was made within the week before the FOMC met It was already done before this group gathered around the table I objected strongly to it then, and I would object strongly in the future I would hope that if there is a change, that it would be done either around this table or by consultation on the telephone And I would not be in favor of more meetings in Washington, but it is pretty easy to put together a telephone conference call   Well--   I'd rather do it that way   Yes   In 1985?   Some of them were phone calls; and some of them were recorded because there were actually votes taken Some changes were actually made without telephone calls the week before an FOMC meeting   Everything was-- "
314,1988-03-29," Mr Chairman, we also have revised up our forecast, particularly for the first quarter, but we still don't come to as strong a forecast for the year as a whole as the Board staff does; we're roughly one percent less than that We have not quite as much growth in the first quarter and substantially less in the second quarter; the third and fourth quarters look about the same The difference largely, as has been mentioned already, is in the projection for inventories We would see the growth of inventories to be somewhat less than in the Board staff's forecast I assume the underlying assumption of the Board staff is that the buildup in the fourth quarter largely was voluntary and will continue at fairly high levels in the period ahead We would think that is not the case, and as a result, that is the difference in the forecast  With respect to the Tenth District, there has not been a great deal of change from what was reported last month I will just go through the various activities Agriculture has had a very good year, largely because of government transfer payments, but also because red meat prices, principally cattle, have been very good Export-related activities have picked up; there is some hope that perhaps in 1988 the government subsidy that goes with that will, in a sense, continue to permit agricultural products to be shipped abroad With regard to energy, what had looked at the end of 1987 to be a bit of a recovery, particularly in terms of exploration, has turned back around because of the instability of energy prices For example, in  -47-    3/29/88  December there were 363 rigs working in the Tenth District; in January that fell to 307, and in February it fell to 271 It's simply a matter of the instability in those prices People are not willing to put their money out to put a hole in the ground and hope that there's something at the bottom of it If some stability comes through OPEC pricing, then I think that very quickly they will be back to exploration in our area With regard to commercial real estate, it's flat in most areas with the exception of Omaha and Kansas City But it's overbuilt in Denver, Oklahoma City, and Tulsa; and as a result, as Bob Boykin has mentioned, that is a long-term workout problem that probably isn't going to get any better in 1988  With regard to the overall tenor, it seems to me that from discussions I've had with people in agriculture and manufacturing and retail business, their feeling is that things are indeed better They would expect 1988 to be better There seems to be no constraint on input goods; there doesn't seem to be any upward pressure on prices I would add an observation on the earlier discussion about the natural rate of unemployment It seems to me that because of what we have been through since 1979 and into the early 1980s, there may be a lag after you reach that natural rate before prices really begin to rise Then people realize it and are willing to take the chance of raising prices, and you get the explosion in prices that I think the Chairman mentioned I think we are on very dangerous ground at the moment with regard to the level of unemployment--whether it's at the natural rate or not I don't know I think you can go for a quarter or so beyond the natural rate before you get that explosion in prices, but I think the danger is on that side "
355,1988-05-17," Mr Chairman, I too would join those who have a concern about upward interest rate movement However, it seems to me that the risk is on the upside, and there's enough room to take another cut at some restraint without disrupting the markets As a result, I would like to associate with those who would opt for a B-C alternative, which is the $500 million on borrowing; but I'd also include in that asymmetrical language toward further restraint When I focus on moving from the $400 million to $500 million, I would just note that seasonal credit has taken its normal track and has increased rather dramatically since our last meeting from something less than $100 million to--I don't know what it was at the close of this period, but at times it was over $200 million If you have a $400 million objective for borrowing, and over $200 million of that is seasonal, you really are depending upon how you view the seasonal--whether it's    5/17/88  sensitive to interest rate levels or not I really believe that moving to $500 million rather promptly is not a major move, given the makeup of the borrowing level of $500 million As a result, going to $500 million then, with asymmetrical language, would permit us to move on toward the C alternative depending upon what incoming information we may have in two weeks That would be my prescription "
393,1988-06-29," Maybe a structural question, Mr Chairman Do we have any limiting factors as to how much foreign currency we can accumulate ourselves as opposed to for the Treasury?   Well, isn't it--   Set by this Committee?   Is there a limiting factor as to how much the Treasury can accumulate?   Money? "
394,1988-06-29," Thank you, Mr Chairman With respect to economic activity, particularly in its relation to the Tenth District, as you know, we're dominated by agriculture, energy, mining, and manufacturing Three of those activities--agriculture, energy, and mining--have been at very low levels Agriculture has revived in the sense that it's on the recovery path, with evidence such as agricultural land prices continuing to increase 4 to 5 percent in a quarter, for example Having in mind the impact of the drought, however, it isn't clear that that's going to continue And if the drought does worsen--and that's a very iffy situation in the sense that a week or two of rain could wipe out virtually any impact of the drought in our District and would turn the pessimism back to optimism; and I think agriculture would continue on the recovery track  Energy, on the other hand, is flat because of OPEC's indecision and the softening of oil prices Drilling rigs have decreased in total numbers over the last month or two, although they're still about 8 percent or so above year-ago levels Mining is in a recovery stage, but certainly not very brisk Manufacturing is dominated largely by the auto and aircraft industry in the Tenth District Because of production cutbacks, most auto plants--the ones that haven't been closed--are operating on two shifts But that's far from being flat-out production Aircraft, on the other hand, is booming--from the standpoint that both commercial as well as military orders are very great And as a result, that industry is looking up  With respect to your question about wage inflation or price inflation generally, we simply do not have any good evidence that has emerged that would suggest that that's present now, although I would agree with those who suggest that the feeling is right under the surface People we talk to keep talking about inflation, although they can present no real evidence that it's accelerating It seems to me that it may be one of those situations in which things have gotten better, both nationwide and in my District And as things look pretty  -32-    6/29-30/88  good then--and we can't stand prosperity--you begin to look for those things that can destroy what you think is good today And that may be what we're experiencing right now The real risk, obviously, is that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy We do see some wage increases in the public employment sector and particularly in the health [care] sector Nurses, for example, are in very short supply nationally Their wage demands are astronomical and they quite likely are going to get them simply because of the shortage in the supply of nurses  With regard to the Greenbook forecast and the outlook for the next six quarters, we don't have any great divergence from the view that has been presented by the staff I think our view would be that inflation would be a bit less in the remainder of 1988 but would indeed be greater than the staff forecast for the year 1989 as a whole--roughly 1/2 of a percentage point fourth-quarter over fourth- quarter Some of that comes from the projected impact of the drought on prices Our view is that there will be an uptick; it won't be a heavy impact unless the drought worsens very much in 1988 I think the staff would say that that would all kind of roll out early in 1989, but we think there will be an uptick in 1988; we see that continuing in 1989 And as a result, inflation from that component alone would be a bit higher than the staff forecast But by and large we'd accept that forecast as being reasonable I would agree with the earlier statement of Jerry Corrigan that the risk is on the upside and monetary policy will become a bit tight Inflation will rear its ugly head Vigilance! I quit "
395,1988-06-29," Mr Chairman, I would reaffirm 1988; I can accept alternative III for 1989 However, I would prefer to maintain the current 4 to 8 range for 1989 for the time being, with the appropriate language in your testimony that another look at the beginning of this upcoming year is something that we would look forward to   It's somewhat similar, yes The record of our ability to forecast has not been terribly good over time And the fact that we are looking out 6 quarters, to me [unintelligible] I'd rather keep the flexibility and look again in February   Mr Chairman, I, too, would agree that your proposal is reasonable and quite acceptable, with one proviso, however--that $600 million does indeed mean 7-1/2 percent and not greatly over that level My point is that it seems to me the next step in the tightening process quite likely is the discount rate And in my own view, it would be an inappropriate action to tighten further now As a result, your proposal of going to $600 million, if that really means a funds rate of about 7-1/2 percent and not greatly higher than that, is very acceptable to me   It should be maintaining   Yes, it sounds that way   The borrowing level itself is not published   It has to be interpreted by market participants I thought that your proposal incorporated the underlying assumption that going to $600 million gives you a 7-1/2 percent funds rate, roughly That seems acceptable to me and that translates in my mind to maintain the current-- "
451,1988-08-16," Mr Chairman, with respect to the Greenbook forecast, on a year-over-year basis our forecast would be very  -21-    8/16/88  similar However, looking at the shorter term--and I'm taking about the third and fourth quarters, and particularly the third quarter--our forecast is a bit higher I hate to describe it as substantially higher, but in terms of final sales, for example, consumption is roughly a percentage point higher or so in the third quarter and also somewhat higher in the fourth quarter That suggests that the last half of the year is a bit stronger than the Greenbook forecast And it implies, at least to me, some further pressure on wages and prices that may not otherwise be built into the Greenbook over the forecast period  With regard to the regional forecast, as has been the case over the last couple--and perhaps the last three--years, we are improving in the District, but at a pace somewhat slower than the national recovery rate, as measured by personal income, for example, employment, and other similar measures Retail sales are moderately higher than they were a year ago with inventories reported to be about in line--as a matter of fact, being trimmed within the last month or two Auto sales are holding up; measured year-over-year they are a bit higher than a year ago  Two areas that are particularly important in our District are energy and agriculture The level of energy prices has continued to damp the enthusiasm of people for going out and spending money to stick holes in the ground As a result, there is not much enthusiasm--particularly in that belt which would include Oklahoma, parts of Colorado, and Wyoming, which are still depressed because of energy Laid on top of that, obviously, is the agricultural situation of the drought, which has been very varied across the District If you look for example, at Nebraska, parts of Kansas, and western Oklahoma, they've had ample rain and the crops will reflect that If you look, on the other hand, at eastern Kansas, Missouri, and up into Si's area in Iowa and on east beyond that, the drought has had a very serious impact  Having that in mind, our numbers are a bit stronger than the Greenbook It isn't clear to me whether or not some of that may be explained by the drought impact and the timing of that impact on those numbers By and large in the agricultural sector, there will be an impact on the producers, but if you look into the financial sector that finances agricultural production--as I think Si may have mentioned his survey shows--the banks are in pretty good shape As a matter of fact, they have gotten rid of a lot of the bad loans over the adjustment period They have built their capital back, according to our survey, by over 10 percent And in a sense, they are in very good position to accommodate this drought impact I would find something to worry about if this were to be a two-year drought instead of a one-year drought; then that story would change dramatically "
452,1988-08-16," Ed Boehne has said much of what I wanted to say I think, except that he came out the wrong place I happen to view what has happened over the last few months--that is, the borrowing target as moderated, if you will, by the federal funds level--as providing the flexibility that I think serves this Committee fairly well, at least at this time I must say that over the long haul I would move to the borrowing target But for the near term--the rest of this year at least--I like what we've been doing  I agree with the proposition that moving the borrowing target is much easier, much more acceptable, and perhaps of some greater comfort to the Chairman, than moving the federal funds target But I don't think we ought to be deluded What we are doing when we are moving the borrowing target is targeting what we believe to be a federal funds level But they work together; they have worked together over the recent past, although apparently there's some confusion in the market that I don't quite understand because of the Desk operations I would not want to change at the moment; I'd like to do what we've been doing I have a question I guess for Don, following onto Bob Forrestal's comment with regard to the seasonal borrowing level, which has peaked, and I think is at an historical high   Roughly at $400 million   Traditionally, that starts running off about mid-August on down to the end of the year Given the fact that we might maintain, for example, a $600 million borrowing level, my question is, with that seasonal running off, does that imply that we have a built-in tightening if everything else remains the same?   But over the last two or three months we've been essentially at a frictional level of adjustment borrowing   If you give credence at all to seasonal borrowing [ unintelligible] some slightly different characteristic--   Mr Chairman, I would also prefer your pre- scription, that is ""B""; $600 million; asymmetric It seems clear to me that the next move probably is up, but I have a feeling that we don't really know what the impact of our most recent moves has been It's time to pause a bit and see what impact that has on the markets The other issue--if it's true that the next move is up, and I think there's fairly strong agreement around the table--we are kind of in a box as far as I'm concerned, in the sense that you have this spread between the discount rate and the funds rate which many think does make a lot of difference Over time as that broadens, I don't think we can lose sight of that spread And as a result, after the move that's being talked about here in the intermeeting period, you may have to consider another discount rate increase That has a market impact, an announcement impact, that I think has to be thought about long and hard With respect to the outlook and moving it up, I'd just like to pause and see where we come out  With regard to the aggregate question, I have great faith in talking about the aggregates as an intermediate target for the long run, but I would prefer not to move it up from where it is now for intermeeting guidance for what policy should be I think it's about in the right place, about number four And we ought to keep it there until there's a bit more confidence that it means something for short- term policy guidance   Move it where? Where are you going?   Does that mean that the markets--  -46-    8/16/88 "
501,1988-09-20," In fact, we've always--   No matter what "
502,1988-09-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman With respect to the Tenth District, there is not a great change from last time To summarize, we are still trailing the growth rate of the national economy But in all areas, including energy and agriculture, there is some improvement--to be sure, improvement from a very low base Manu- facturing is doing very well; retail sales have been holding up but not very vigorous By and large, the Tenth District is continuing on a trend to recovery, but a bit slower than the national rate  With regard to the national economy and the projection con- tained in the Greenbook, we would be very close to that except that the pattern we have is a bit different If I understand the Greenbook forecast, the drought effect has largely run its course by the end of the year, whereas we would find the effect to be fairly even in each of the four quarters from the second quarter of 1988 to the second quarter of 1989 Notwithstanding that minor difference, it still seems to me that we are projecting a very vigorous growth well into 1989 And, given the comments around the table and what we hear in the Tenth District with respect to wage and price increases not really showing up yet, it is still a matter of major concern that, on the national level, we're putting considerable pressure on our resources I guess my view is that there is going to have to be some greater restraint in the future in order to get the kind of pattern over the longer term that we'd like to have  I would also like to add, if I may, that I happen to agree with Frank Morris--as painful as it is personally because of the travel--that going back to a monthly meeting schedule makes a lot of sense, given the way we're operating at the moment "
503,1988-09-20, I'll join 
558,1988-11-01," I, Mr Chairman, would also support the change on the basis of the continuity and accountability issues already discussed "
559,1988-11-01," Thank you, Mr Chairman With respect to the national economy we would agree with the Greenbook on growth in 1988 For 1989 we project a bit slower growth than the Greenbook, and that's without the assumption that interest rates would rise in 1989 I guess you could conclude, therefore, that we are [projecting] more than just modestly slower growth than the Greenbook Nonetheless, it's so close that it has no real relevance for this purpose  With regard to the District economy, in the agricultural sector as already has been noted the picture is very bright; it has almost turned upside down from what we were looking at earlier in the year The net farm income for the nation, for example, will be as great as it was last year and last year was a record Having said that, there are some pockets within the District where the drought has had a substantial impact, particularly northern Missouri, northeastern  -36-    11/1/88  Kansas, and on up into Si's area On the other hand, agricultural farmland sales have picked up rather dramatically because of the liquidity that seems to be in that area And prices have begun to accelerate in those sales With regard to the manufacturing sector, it's roughly flat Retail sales are flat It's interesting that we also have found little evidence of price increases showing up in the District However, without exception when you talk with business people in the District, inflation is still on their minds There's an interesting activity going on in the energy sector because of the drop in the [price of] oil OPEC oil prices have created the uncertainty that quite likely will almost close down the new exploration activity within our District It's a fairly sizable part of the economy and largely will affect Oklahoma, Colorado, and Wyoming Those are the areas that were depressed earlier because of agriculture and energy and it won't help their outlook  There is no new information with respect to commercial construction which is a problem in Denver, Oklahoma City, and Tulsa It's going to take a long time to work its way out Overall, I think the Tenth District will continue to trail the national recovery "
560,1988-11-01," I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman I came in with some feeling of moving to a symmetric directive, but I have no quarrel with keeping it asymmetric for this time "
624,1988-12-13," I don't think I can add anything that hasn't already been said other than to state my own position I would oppose moving back to a rigid federal funds rate target I think that what has happened over the last two intermeeting periods particularly has proven the worth of the procedures we've been following And I'd also note that there is nothing new apparently in that world because this idea of broadening the federal funds range and letting the market move it within that range rather than us was a regime that we followed some 10 or so years ago when we called that area in which the federal funds rate could move on its own a ""zone of indifference"" I don't know whether that was a published term or not, but it was certainly featured in discussions around this table That zone of indifference would have been set within a federal funds rate range of 2 to 3 percentage points, and no action would be taken so long as the fed funds rate moved within that zone My recollection, Bob Black may remember, is that the zone of indifference was about one full percentage point The point is that it has been done before It wasn't successful then I might add, and that is one of the reasons I would hate to go back to a rigid federal funds target even with that type of caveat "
625,1988-12-13," Mike, in looking at the staff forecast in the Greenbook, it is difficult to know what you are projecting in terms of interest rate levels and when changes in those would take place It would make quite a difference, it seems to me, as to what one might think would happen if, as I believe you said yesterday, you are looking at a 2 percent rise over a 12- to 18-month horizon Do you have in this forecast much of that coming early on, or it is on out?   Just to follow on, Mr Chairman, I would like to request that the staff, if they are going to build a forecast on projecting interest rate levels in the period ahead, that those be explicitly stated in the Greenbook so that we can have some feel when we run the model or make those judgmental changes, how we might compare with the Greenbook It would be very helpful if there were explicit indications in the Greenbook of what those assumptions were   Yes, indeed it would   As a matter of fact, I think that's the way it used to be done; [an assumption of] no change in policy   It could be done orally, Mr Chairman   Staff to staff   At least--   Thank you, Mr Chairman There is not a great deal new or different with respect to the regional economy Agriculture, for example, is very strong There's a smile on producers' faces simply because the harvest is in and grain commodity prices are high Along with Bob Boykin, I think the red meat producers probably will be squeezed in the period ahead because of those higher grain prices Our manufacturing sector is fairly strong, particularly in the export-related types of products In autos, all of the plants in our District with the exception of one are working a two-shift arrangement That one produces a car that apparently is not selling, so the workers have simply been given a holiday over Christmas, and just recently that has been extended another four days; so it's the product that they are producing rather than the overall demand for automobiles One other strong area is the high-tech area along the eastern slope of the Rockies and down into New Mexico Those high-tech areas that were depressed a couple of years ago have come back and are doing very well On the weak side, the energy sector in the District and construction, both residential and commercial, are depressed Retail sales I'm told generally are sluggish There was a very big day or week after Thanksgiving, which there always is, but rather than continuing on through, sales have dropped off in the major cities in our area Whether that will come back with an additional weekend to shop before Christmas, our retailers don't know; they are still optimistic Inventories are in good shape  With regard to the national economy, we are very, very close to the Greenbook forecast, but we didn't build in any restraint which means they are stronger than we would see the economy But given the comments from directors, businessmen, and others there is a very  -44-    12/13-14/88  strong feeling that the Federal Reserve has a role to play and it will play that role in restraining inflation As a result everybody talks about it It is a concern and I think that I would come out on the side--even though our region trails the national rate of recovery--of addressing attention more closely to inflation than I would to the level of real output "
626,1988-12-13," Mr Chairman, when I came to the meeting I preferred ""B-C"", someplace in between those two But I have no problem with the proposal that you've laid on the table with the exception of the potential need for the second $100 million sometime early in January If it becomes evident that that's an appropriate move, then I think the Board should again look at the use of the discount rate at that time rather than today I'd hold it in abeyance You may find it helpful in supporting the dollar after the turn of the year I would not want to do it now because as has already been mentioned at least it's my impression that other rates around the world probably are going to increase, and I wouldn't want us to be a leader in that parade So, I would hope that we could accept the proposal that you have laid on the table, $100 million now, and a very careful look whether to do the second $100 million or whether to do a discount rate increase sometime in January "
686,1989-02-07," Thank you, Mr Chairman I think credibility is important I think we've established credibility and it is important to keep it As I look at what we did in July in projecting for 1989-- that is, taking a full percentage point off of both the upper and lower limits--I'm not persuaded that hitting it again at this point another 1/2 percentage point or so as, say, is suggested in alternative ""II"" is either (1) necessary or (2) desirable, given the staff's projections in the Greenbook Lastly, it seems to me that the opportunity to move down somewhat again next year, given what we hope will happen, is important And if we take that extra cut now I think it limits somewhat our ability to go down next year given the projection for somewhat greater growth in M2 through 1990 So I would stick with alternative ""I,"" 3 to 7 percent   What are the alternatives other than money funds?  SPEAKER(?) Treasury securities   Government securities  -39-    2/7-8/89 "
687,1989-02-07," Thank you, Mr Chairman On the District level, the District economy has continued to improve but at a slow pace-- slower, certainly, than the national average The recoveries in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors continue and the higher oil prices that have fallen out of the late 1988 OPEC agreement have provided some stability to the energy sector In agriculture we are concerned about another year of drought; a more immediate concern is this cold weather For those livestock producers that rely upon farm ponds, for example--since they were not replenished during the past year and with the very cold weather those freeze solid--that means there is no water As a result, some livestock will be sent to market under those conditions, which will accelerate this drawdown on the red meat supplies in the future and push up prices perhaps  With regard to the energy sector, while prices have firmed somewhat, the uncertainty surrounding whether or not OPEC will be able to fulfill the agreement still scares people away from investing substantial sums and putting down new wells or exploring for new reserves In the manufacturing sector there are two really notable developments One is in the automobile manufacturing assembly area where all of the plants--and Missouri, for example, would be the second biggest assembly area in the [country] after Michigan--are operating at a full two-shift operation And there appears to be no slowdown in demand On the other hand, general aviation concluded 1988 with significant increases in their billings, generally as a result of export demand for general aviation products The interesting report on construction in the District is that the value of nonresidential construction in the District rose rather sharply in December and was about 33 percent above the year-earlier level On the other hand, residential construction has fallen slightly and is somewhat below the year-earlier level By and large the financial economic activity within the District is rather good with the exception of those areas such as Oklahoma that have been depressed; they are still sort of on the bottom with respect not only to employment but also to overhang on nonresidential construction-- commercial building, for example But by and large the District is in pretty good shape and continues to improve  With respect to the outlook for the national economy, adopting the interest rate projections that are used by the staff, we come out virtually identically, with some minor differences We have consumption a little higher and inventories a bit lower during 1989 But by and large we would be in the middle of the projections for the Committee members as a whole There is a concern, at least on my part, with respect to prices--that is, inflation in the period coming up In the services sector, for example, the benefits tacked on to otherwise projected wage increases give a strong indication that the risk is for higher prices rather than lower prices I'd rather be ahead of the curve than behind the curve And the increase in interest rates that is incorporated in our outlook as well as in the Board staff's outlook seems to be quite reasonable to me "
688,1989-02-07," Thank you, Mr Chairman Coming into the meeting this morning I guess I was looking for something between ""B"" and ""C"" on the short run, with some immediate movement toward ""C"" following this meeting In view of your plea for accommodation, although I'm not a voting member, I could almost interpret your proposal as being a ""B-C"" stance--taking a look at it again in a couple of weeks And from that standpoint it would be very acceptable to me I'd just like to lay on the table the way the tightening might take place in the period ahead I understand that using the discount  -58-    2/7-8/89  rate probably doesn't meet with much favor among those who have to vote on it--that is, the Board members--given the comments that have been made the last couple of days But there is a time beyond which I think we will not be able to move the discount rate and close any gap, if that's a concern to anybody When I talk about ""B-C,"" a bit of snugging now, I would like to consider that we could deal with a discount rate [increase of] 1/2 percent and not let it all show through--in other words, come to a funds rate level of something like 9-1/4 to 9-3/8 percent The further you go, if indeed you believe the staff's forecast, you've neutered yourself on using the discount rate as an instrument, I think And if we're ever going to do it, now would be the time to do it, given the projection that I think most of the people around the table believe "
752,1989-03-28," Sam, can you remind us what is the intermeeting limit?   In all currencies? "
753,1989-03-28," In '89, how weak?   Thank you, Mr Chairman Mike, how much of the decline that you're showing in your forecast for 1989 and 1990 from last time is attributed to your assumption of an additional one percentage point increase in interest rates?   Jerry, would you speak up a little? We'd like to hear what you're saying  -26-    3/28/89   Thank you, Mr Chairman With respect to the District economy, it continues to improve albeit at a rate somewhat slower than the national rate of growth The strength comes largely from the agricultural and manufacturing sectors whereas the weakness is where it has been in the past couple of years--in the energy and construction areas There is an event that I think is worth noting that somebody spoke of a moment ago, and that's the drought That will affect portions of the Tenth District, largely an area from about the plains in Kansas to the northeast through Kansas, northern Missouri, and portions of southeastern Iowa and western Illinois If we do not get rain, some generous spring rains, fairly soon the agricultural situation will be fairly grim For example, in Kansas about 3/4 of the wheat crop is now estimated to be either poor or very poor, which are two of the lowest categories of estimates of that particular hard winter wheat crop The one event that was frightening occurred about two weeks ago--and I suspect most of you know this-- when there was a dust storm that was created by 50-60 mile per hour winds that actually darkened the sun in midafternoon in Kansas City In fact, there were some street lights that came on I happen to be old enough to remember the 1930's dust storms and this was very reminiscent of that It happened to be [only] one day; nonetheless, if there is no rain through that belt that I just described I think we will have very serious problems The estimate of food prices, for example, might be way off Beyond that, there is strength in the manufacturing sector, and I'm thinking primarily of general aviation Auto production, up until a couple of weeks ago at least, was going full bore with auto plants operating at two full shifts That would appear to be slowing now; I don't know what's going to happen in the future but there is a very large inventory, as you know, of unsold autos The energy sector shows little or no improvement As a matter of fact, it continues to decrease in terms of exploration activity It has always been thought that a price around $17 a barrel would regenerate the interest in exploration; but the uncertainties about OPEC and what may happen to oil prices simply are keeping those individuals out of that particular activity and the number of active rigs that are drilling continues to decrease  With regard to the national outlook, there is no real difference between the staff forecast and our own for the horizon of  -30-    3/28/89  the forecast with the exception that we're a bit stronger on both growth and prices In fact, there is some encouraging evidence that has already been cited with respect to a slowdown But it isn't very convincing, at least yet I think we still have to wait for some additional information on that In our forecast, we'd put the risks on the high side rather than the low side, with rather a bit stronger growth and stronger prices "
754,1989-03-28," Mr Chairman, I would favor ""B"" and an asymmetric directive I'd just like to highlight the point that Tom Melzer made, however We have in the past been fairly quick to act on a single number that has been published, given the background of the tightening that we've done over the last year And that's 3  -40-    3/28/89  percentage points over the last year in the federal funds rate alone-- or 2 percentage points over the last 8 or 9 months I think it is time to pause and see what these numbers really mean I would like to see a little more accumulation of evidence of this slowing or the lack of slowing before we take any further action I don't know what that means [in terms of timing] but I think it should be at least a month before we do anything In my mind that would give us the employment numbers and the next PPI number, I guess In other words, I need a cumulation of numbers going one way, really, before taking any dramatic action on the asymmetrical language "
817,1989-05-16," Yes, Mr Chairman This may be to Sam or to you, I guess I don't quite understand the objective of our intervention, particularly to the level that we have intervened over this intermeeting period I understand that our objective is to    5/16/89  moderate the movements But the pressures are coming not from the speculators, as I understand it, but rather from those who see the dollar as a good investment at the moment Maybe I didn't understand you totally, Sam, but I thought you said that we are intervening more heavily than the remainder of our G-7 partners and I don't know why we should have that big a burden, given the rest of the environment My last question is Who calls the shots on this? Is it the Treasury that believes that intervention at this level is appropriate? "
818,1989-05-16," Thank you, Mr Chairman The Tenth District is continuing to improve but rather slowly The strong farm income last year has positioned the agricultural sector to withstand probably the impact of the drought, given otherwise good weather throughout most of the crop areas In Kansas, for example, which is a very large red winter wheat producer, the latest estimates are for production of about 200 million bushels and that's down from about 325 million the year before That's the latest official forecast However, in talking with some of the producers and some of the grain people throughout Kansas, their projection is that if they get no further measurable rain in the next couple of weeks they would be very happy with 150 to 180 million bushels But the interesting aspect of that is that, given the drought conditions in the high plains areas producing red winter wheat--basically Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming and Oklahoma--the total production would be down about 8 percent But if you look at wheat totally, which includes spring wheat, the total wheat production would be up about 13 percent As for the rest of the small grains corn, for example, will be up about 60 percent from last year; beans will be up 27 percent; and oats will be up 100 percent They are projecting a very strong farm production year given, of course, that the drought doesn't affect it measurably So, in the agricultural sector things are looking pretty good That does not mean, however, that spots such as Kansas won't feel the impact of this drought; but the nation as a whole probably will not As a matter of fact, given those projections, we would see very modest increases in food costs, not unlike what I think the staff has projected--about 3-1/4 percent   Yes, with the exception of whatever damage has already occurred to the winter wheat crop, which is large in the high plains states as I just mentioned Ninety percent of that winter wheat crop, by official estimate, is rated poor or very poor as a result But that's only a part of the wheat production for the nation as a whole  -17-    5/16/89   That's correct--some further rainfall   I guess I don't understand your question   Well, I don't think I know that Maybe Governor Angell does The fact of the matter is that the 200 million bushel estimate for the state of Kansas is based upon the damage that has already occurred to the wheat Given further normal rainfall from here until harvest they come out with 200 or 202 million bushels   Normal--that's right But you see we're only about 2 or 3 weeks away from the start of the harvest of that crop That's an early June start in Oklahoma   Kansas will be when, Wayne?   Yes, let me just proceed In the energy sector there's a bit of an uptick For example, just in the last month the rig count within the District has moved from 211 to 245 That's still well below year-ago levels, but nonetheless there is some exploration  -18-    5/16/89  taking place The manufacturing sector continues to improve and that's largely related to the commercial aircraft and high-tech industries On the other side, the construction industry--both commercial as well as residential--is very weak  On the national level we have no real difference in our projection for the upcoming period from the staff's forecast I have a little problem--the question has been raised and there will be further discussion--with respect to the current status of this weakening or not weakening And it bothers me a little when we talk about another 3/4 or full percentage point increase without some fairly good evidence I would be not very happy with that "
819,1989-05-16," But that has only been in the last 10 days   Before that they did not   It's not a question I just want to follow up on your comments, Mr Chairman   Okay Sticking with ""B,"" with the $600 million, seems to me to be appropriate I'm not sure, however, that going to a symmetrical directive at this particular meeting is what I would recommend It seems to me that the data we are relying on as [indicative of] a slowdown are nothing more than three weeks' to a month's data To be sure, the aggregates are slow; but the projection by the staff is that the growth of M2 will return to the 6 to 7 percent area within the next 30 days Given the attention that the markets pay to the directive, it seems to me that a directive very much like that adopted at the last meeting--that is, [with a tilt] toward restraint--would be appropriate this time It would give us flexibility; if we want to go the other way that's available via a telephone call I can't remember how it was but it was something like ""somewhat and would"" and ""somewhat and might"" in the language of the directive itself I would prefer asymmetrical toward restraint as it was last meeting   Just a point of clarification Is it implied from what you just stated that there will be no change in policy absent a telephone call?   ""Somewhat/might"" "
881,1989-07-05," Thank you, Mr Chairman I would join those who agree that the announcement effect is important But because of the uncertainty about where we're going to end up in 1989, adopting the 1989 ranges for 1990 with the opportunity to look at them again in February makes sense to me That is not exactly alternative II in the sense that alternative II does drop the ranges of both M2 and debt That doesn't make much sense to me I would just adopt the current ranges I do have some sympathy, however, with the proposal of Bob Black that we move to a multi-year targeting procedure to avoid this base-drift problem that likely will occur at the end of this year and into next year "
882,1989-07-05," This question may already have been answered, Mr Chairman, but regarding the notation in the Bluebook that, given the baseline forecast, you might expect short-term interest rates to tick back up because of overplay by the markets Is the baseline forecast still consistent with, say, Bluebook alternative B?  SPEAKER(?) [Yes]   It is And that contemplates an uptick some time in the future, and probably the near-term future, of short-term interest rates?   A quarter or two up?   Thank you very much   Thank you, Mr Chairman On the regional side, the Tenth District is continuing to improve To be sure, it's still lagging the national scene; but given where we started a couple of years ago we're still improving On the food and agricultural side the outlook is good, notwithstanding all the talk of what has happened in the drought areas For example, drought has [hit] in Kansas and the northern sector of Missouri and it extends up pretty much across Iowa But given the additional acreage that has been planted, the outlook for production of agricultural products is really very good in light of the rain that has fallen in a good part of the United States outside of the Tenth District In wheat specifically, the hard red winter wheat that is principally grown in the Tenth District--in Kansas particularly and in Oklahoma and Texas--that crop to be sure is going to be down considerably because of the drought situation But overall, it's important to note that the production of wheat on the national level is going to be up about 15 percent above what it was last year And that's notwithstanding the fact that Kansas, which is one of the biggest producers of the hard red winter wheat, is going to harvest something less than half of the crop harvested just a year ago Given that kind of an outlook, we would agree with the comments that were made by Mike and others with respect to food prices in the period ahead that they will be moderate, with about a 4 percent increase over the next year The energy industry in the Tenth District has not fully participated in the nationwide improvement in  -21-    7/5-6/89  exploration and development Indeed, in Oklahoma the number of rigs fell substantially over June, for example, whereas nationally that count was up Manufacturing continues to improve, largely in the export-sensitive aircraft and high-tech areas And construction continues to improve very modestly in the District It is above the year-ago level; although commercial construction is down somewhat, overall construction is up  On the national level, I recognize that in all of the numbers that have come in, and that have just been recited for our review, there is a softness that appears to be showing through I would see that as coming close to achieving the objective that we've been striving for, and that is, to bring the overall growth down However, we would see growth in 1989 and into 1990 somewhat greater than the Greenbook forecast, largely reflecting a bit stronger consumption than the Greenbook forecast incorporates Overall, the only real evidence of wage [pressures] and concerns that we have been able to uncover in the Tenth District is in the steel settlement that was announced earlier There's a real concern that a steel producer in the Tenth District who is in the midst of negotiations now will be badly hurt if that type of settlement is imposed upon them That's all I have, Mr Chairman "
883,1989-07-05," Thank you, Mr Chairman I agree, essentially, with those who have already spoken with respect to your proposal If I were to believe our own forecast for the quarter immediately ahead, quite likely I would opt for alternative B with symmetric language Essentially, the question in my mind is whether or not we really have the slowing that was detailed yesterday in the numbers that Governor Johnson cited--whether or not that is going to continue throughout this quarter or whether we will pause and get a reacceleration and therefore an inappropriate further dropping of short-term rates at this point Then we'd have to turn it back around But given that uncertainty, your proposal to move cautiously seems to me to be appropriate--symmetric language of the directive and between alternatives A and B One thing that isn't clear to me, however, is how the borrowing level would be treated I know there has been an explanation; I guess I just didn't understand It is dropped by $50 million under your proposal, Mr Chairman Given that the seasonal borrowing is roughly $500 million or a bit above and we have been at $600 million as a borrowing level, are we talking about $550 million or are we talking about staying at $600 million?  SPEAKER(?) 600   600?   Mr Chairman, I'd just like to add one other caveat We do have a fairly important number coming out on Friday-- that is, the employment number Rather than moving to the lower level that you are suggesting before that number comes out, I think I'd wait and take another look before the--   I would agree; that's very satisfactory "
943,1989-08-22," Ted, I guess I don't understand your statement that you prefer not to have it spelled out in the record I assume this would take a Committee vote?   And, therefore, it will be indeed on the record; and it will reveal not only the authorization for the full $700 million [swap drawing] but also this special--   You ask for a vote now and it's not submitted for the record unless it's activated?   The authorities?   Okay "
944,1989-08-22," Mike, [some] of the numbers that have been reported going back to the second quarter may be revised up, and there is some speculation that growth in the second quarter might have been as much as a full percentage point faster than you show in the Greenbook How do you construct your forecast? Do you simply take it  -11-    8/22/89  out of the third quarter or do you project the third and fourth quarters from that higher base, if indeed it is revised?   Do we have any indication of why these numbers have been revised so dramatically over the last two or three months? Is there something going on?   Well, they are of larger magnitude Are they orders?   Thank you, Mr Chairman At the District level, things have not changed greatly We are still in a growth mode; to be sure it is at somewhat less than the national level, but considering where we started that is still a pretty optimistic report Farm conditions in the District continue to improve, largely as a result of some crop prices, which had strengthened following the recently released agricultural report that the rebound in crop production this year would not be as large as had been expected In the energy area, the District's oil drilling activity increased this summer but still remained below year-ago levels due to the continued uncertainty as to price for both natural gas and drilling Manufacturing in the District is going full out, largely as a result of the aircraft manufacturing--both commercial as well as private aircraft Manufacturing activity is at a very high level Auto assemblage is back to being fairly fully employed, in the sense that there had been a shutdown of the GM plant as a result of retooling and some supply constraints but they are back running and are running at full capacity Construction activity in the District weakened slightly in June and into July; but it is still stronger than it was in the first half of 1989 and is stronger than it was a year ago  On the national level, our forecast is not greatly different than the Greenbook forecast; we feel that the upward revisions are appropriate but may not be enough Similar to what Gary Stern mentioned earlier, we think that the risk of recession is not great Indeed, instead of a soft landing, we may be executing a touch and go;  -29-    8/22/89  we think the last half of this year will be stronger than the Greenbook forecast As a result, the outlook for inflation as revealed in the Greenbook--certainly through 1990--shows no improvement And yes indeed, we do read some of [the data to mean] that the rate in the last half of the year could worsen I understand the comments about constraints on wage increases I think we can be fooled We can watch it for a while and all at once it can be out of balance I sense a greater militancy among the unions, although they are a smaller part of the work force But they seem to be more willing to go on strike and stay out without compensation I think the outlook for the latter half of 1989 is stronger than the Greenbook forecast and the outlook for an improvement in prices isn't any better, if as great "
945,1989-08-22," Mr Chairman, I agree in that ""B"" would be my preference but I feel a bit more strongly than you do with respect to asymmetric language toward ease I would oppose asymmetric toward ease That view simply is based upon some of the comments that I made earlier that I see the economy a bit stronger than others, perhaps, in the third and fourth quarters To me, a change in the language now would mean something to the markets and mislead them   I favor symmetrical and would strongly oppose an asymmetrical directive toward easing   Will there be a vote on the other language with respect to progress? "
1006,1989-10-03," Thank you, Mr Chairman I guess virtually everything has been said around the table I don't have too much concern about the actual profits and losses that the System will sustain in terms of a rising dollar I'm not terribly concerned about the price stability issue in the sense that with sterilized intervention I think for some long period in the future we can go about a price stability objective without much problem What I am really concerned about, however, is bringing this issue to a confrontational stage outside of the confines of this Committee and the Treasury, because as soon as the public and the market perceive that there's a split I think we have the real possibility of a currency crunch that we will not want to face We'll have to go together at that time   Yes, I know I'd like to ask a question How far can the Treasury go in the sense that they have a stabilization fund that is authorized by Congress? Is there no limit to what--   Well, they still have to get authorization for the Treasury to get dollars for us to warehouse   So there is a limitation "
1007,1989-10-03," The Tenth District economic conditions continue to improve slowly; I think they trail the national improvement Nonetheless, improvement does show in retail sales, which were up over a year ago with inventories, we're told, well in line With respect to [agriculture], the good news is that the drought has been broken, although crop estimates for the spring-planted crops are a fourth to a third below what would be an average crop The bad news is that the rains have been so excessive that [farmers] are going to have a hard time getting the milo bean and corn out of their fields As a result, I'm not sure what their conditions will be But farm land values have continued to increase; in our last quarterly survey they were up over the three categories, roughly 2 percent over the quarter before, and that's eight consecutive quarters in which those land values have improved The OPEC agreement to raise its production ceilings had very little effect on oil prices, but the drilling activity has increased modestly most recently The rig count is about 259 in the District, about 5 percent below a year ago; but it is improving on a month-to-month basis Most of that exploration is for gas; they have found a big gas field over in eastern Oklahoma and Texas which is being exploited apparently by some of our drillers who are going south and going to help your economy, Bob Construction activity has been mixed, to be sure; nonresidential construction has increased from our last meeting here, whereas residential construction has fallen off  With regard to my view of the national economy, I would accept readily the Greenbook forecast; I think it's appropriate There are some within our own Bank who believe that forecast is a little stronger than they would project But my own view is that it's about on track; given the underlying assumptions, I think it's a good forecast and one we ought to be happy with "
1008,1989-10-03," We're having trouble seeing that   [Unintelligible] and I think most of the comments around the table about using monetary policy with respect to the dollar are right on the mark I don't think the old adage ""you can't serve two masters"" is to be taken lightly I think monetary policy should be devoted to domestic economic policy and not to the dollar And further, with respect to the prescription for the period ahead, I would accept ""B"" but would want a symmetric directive I wanted that last time, as you may remember, and I've seen no accumulating evidence that suggests we are any closer to a recession at this meeting than we were at the last meeting As a matter of fact, in my own view, we're further away from it As a result, I think there's a greater demand for a symmetric directive than there was last time Therefore, I would prefer ""B"" symmetric "
1065,1989-11-14," Just as a matter of interest, Mr Chairman, there have been some comments about trying to project what this German situation may mean for their economy and our economy I have heard a few comments with respect to the demand that will be generated by these 200,000 or 250,000 immigrants [from East Germany] that are hopefully skilled and will go to work and produce They will be in a position of demanding the [unintelligible] if nothing else  SPEAKER(?) Housing   Beyond housing   What does that imply for their economy and our economy or for interest rates in that market?   Thank you, Mr Chairman There hasn't been a great deal of change in the Tenth District since the last meeting There are two or three things that I'd like to comment upon, however One of them is an analysis of our third-quarter farm credit survey that we do on a quarterly basis That clearly is showing that a recovery in the agricultural sector is continuing, as evidenced by the fact that this was the 11th consecutive quarter where farmland values have increased; they are currently about 8 percent above year-ago  -21-    11/14/89  levels and roughly 23 percent above year-end levels of 1986 One of the other things that's rather striking is that the loan-to-deposits ratio in agricultural banks, as opposed to all District banks, is only 514 percent, and that happens to be a high for the last three or four years They are looking for loans and there is some takedown of credit within the farm area However, agriculture has had a bumper year, notwithstanding the two years of drought, largely because product prices together with red meat prices--particularly cattle, and until recent times, pork--have been very high and sustained Retail sales District-wide are roughly flat However, in talking with the major retailers, they think their inventories are in line; they are looking for a normal or usual Christmas selling season and they feel very good about the positions they now occupy With regard to manufacturing, it has steadily increased There is the problem of Boeing--with Wichita being fairly heavily dominated by Boeing--and their being out on strike On the other hand, the auto assembly plants that we have are still going full tilt, meaning two full shifts The exception to that is a GM plant in Kansas City that is now on a two-week shutdown and I'm told that they anticipate an additional two weeks at or near year-end They are cutting back their production to meet the forecast of auto sales on a national level With regard to prices, we don't have any clear evidence that there is any strong pressure on prices The real problem that is beginning to show through on the wages is the cost of fringe benefits and that will be amplified a bit in the first quarter with the additional social security requirement  With regard to the national forecast, we have no quarrel with the projections that are contained in the Greenbook For the fourth quarter we might be a couple of tenths weaker than the Greenbook would show That simply tells me that if our primary objective is to slow the economy below its natural rate, then we're on track; I don't think we should panic As a result, hopefully, we will get some indication of lower inflation rates However, this forecast doesn't reveal that as far as I'm concerned The Vice Chairman of the Board made some comments about evidence of lower prices; he reads the numbers differently than I do, I guess Regional management differs--   I understand The last thing I would note is that unemployment in the Tenth District in all four of the major cities in which the Bank operates is below the national rate of unemployment Some of that may be as a result of out-migration that took place in the more difficult times; but there is potential for some price/wage increases as a result of our labor shortage That's all I have, Mr Chairman "
1066,1989-11-14," Thank you, Mr Chairman I've been looking for some time for an opportunity to agree nearly 100 percent with Wayne Angell And I do   I think you stated it very well We have had easing over the last four or five months of roughly 1-1/4 or 1-3/8 percent, which on a base of something less than 9 percent is a substantial easing To be sure, the outlook is for [the expansion] to be slow in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter; in my view, that's what's needed I'm not sure that that's enough to get us to the objective that I think we all would like to achieve--and that is something closer to price stability, however defined As a result, given that we sort of preempted this meeting by an easing a week or so ago, clearly I'd favor maintaining what we have now with a B alternative I would still opt for a symmetric directive because I don't know what an asymmetric directive now means, Mr Chairman We took two cuts in the intermeeting period which is a little beyond what I thought even an asymmetric directive meant without a vote "
1124,1989-12-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman I think some [good] questions [have been asked] and perhaps some satisfactory answers have been given; but I want to join those who suggested that we have not quantified the benefits of zero inflation or price stability I think intuitively we all would agree that it has benefits; but when we talk about the costs then in some way we have to quantify the benefits, it seems to me I don't mean to say that we shouldn't move toward price stability--or zero inflation, if that is price stability--but rather that when we set upon a course such as this we ought to know what we're going to achieve if we get to the goal My own view, looking at this exercise, is that however good or bad it may be, if we're really  -18-    12/18-19/89  serious about price stability we ought to set off on the course of a tight money policy and get it over with and move on to an economy that could perform for another number of years in a very satisfactory manner, if we could check on this beyond five years But that also says to me that in the short run, as we think about what policy should be put in place now, it doesn't worry me as much that with a tight policy now we might skim along the edge to a recession That is to say, in the immediate upcoming periods, the fear of recession simply isn't as great after seeing this exercise as it might have been before; because if I understand this correctly, in a recession we would expect to get some of the benefit of moving toward price stability As Ed Boehne or somebody said, I don't think that any of us is looking for a recession, but I don't think we should shy away from it either   Thank you, Mr Chairman In response to your specific questions, my desire would be to achieve some stability in the general price level provided that that means [stability] at a low inflation rate Just to stabilize a general price level could be at any level If we were to set upon that course today, I'd assume that what we would do is maintain price level stability between 4 and 5 percent, which would be acceptable to me at least With regard to the timetable, I like the idea of some statement much like Jerry Corrigan has set forth--that is, the mid-1990s As you testify twice a year in Humphrey-Hawkins, for example, and many other times that you have to make public statements, I think you could address those issues that either bring us closer to that goal of price stability in the mid- 1990s or away from it I think it's going to be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve price stability at some level absent some help from the fiscal side And I think time after time you have to beat that drum This gives you the opportunity to do that There is one other issue that keeps coming to mind and that is whether or not we have the authority--and I'm talking about legal authority, implicit or otherwise--to adopt a goal of price stability, price stability being zero inflation We have a number of pieces of legislation that tell us what our goals should be And they number as many as 10 if you get all the pieces of legislation together So, if we were to say that as of now we're going to set upon the course of trying to achieve price stability, meaning zero inflation or thereabouts, by the mid-1990s, and as a result--whether by our making it or not--we got into a recession, I think we'd be challenged as to whether or not our goal was legal We can say internally all we want about price stability being at or near zero, but when we get in public I think you're talking about something else  -38-    12/18-19/89   Jerry, it would be helpful if you'd speak up a little   A question Have you even thought about, or can you determine, why adjustment borrowing is so low? Is there simply so much liquidity out there either domestically or from abroad that they don't need the window? "
1125,1989-12-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman The District economy continues to improve modestly but the pace of improvement seems to be slowing somewhat The farm sector remains a source of strength and the energy industry continues to improve But growth in the manufacturing sector has slowed somewhat In the agricultural sector a pattern has emerged with respect to the winter wheat and the very dry soil conditions that prevail Because the weather has been so cold the snow has been very dry, which hasn't provided much strength to winter wheat [Unintelligible] virtually no winter wheat being at pasture simply because it didn't get [unintelligible] So far as the recent slump in cattle prices, a short supply of [unintelligible] could boost direct levels of prices in the first quarter of 1990 In the meantime, most District farm [incomes] were strong in 1989 and the prospects remain bright for 1990 Stable oil prices and increases in drilling for natural gas continue to buoy the District's energy industry For example, the average number of active drilling rigs in the nation increased from 984 to 1,042 in November and in the District from 312 to 326 Both the US and the District rig counts were significantly above year-ago levels Most of that is in the natural gas exploration area Manufacturing, particularly in the auto plants, is a downside element as has been noted before I would say that we have no evidence of layoffs in that area; however, the temporary shutdowns that are planned for the auto assembly plants are in [train] For example, a GM plant in Kansas City that would normally have a one-week temporary shutdown will take that one week and then two additional weeks in January, which supports the idea that the January production schedule is being cut back and that autos will be a source of weakness in the first quarter On the other hand, the manufacturers of general aviation aircraft expect in 1989 to exceed the 1988 production level Construction is up in our District and continues to improve The October value of nonresidential construction contracts in the District stood 26 percent above the value in October of 1988 and residential contracts were about 20 percent above the year-ago levels I would note that unemployment levels in all major areas of the District are below the national average With respect to Christmas retail sales, the information that we have gathered suggests that the retailers are looking for sales that are modestly above last year's levels, which were considered fairly good  As to the national economy, we would be very close to the Greenbook forecast And we have the feeling that the risk is pretty well balanced yet with respect to the upside or downside movement of the economy "
1126,1989-12-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman I came into this meeting with the thought of retaining policy about where we are now with an asymmetric directive But I could accept your proposal--that is, coming down a 1/4 point now with a symmetric directive in the period ahead I'm not too opposed to giving the nation a little Christmas present, which is not necessarily--   I would not support moving it up, particularly at this time I agree with what Manley Johnson said about moving it up for visibility purposes at a time when we have a [unintelligible] and it will be known that the aggregates are growing above our projected target for them It seems to me it's an inappropriate time I don't mind putting a bit more emphasis on the aggregates, but I don't think now is the time to do it "
1194,1990-02-06," Thank you, Mr Chairman It seems to me that the critical question for this Committee at this juncture is whether or not we're really dedicated to bringing inflation down to zero or its equivalent--to achieve price stability, whatever its definition may be--or whether or not we're simply willing [to accept] and be happy with having inflation where we find it now I look at the exercise--and I think it is helpful to go out to 5 years--but the fact of the matter is that if one considers the cost of taking action to bring inflation down from the current level, none of these strategies gives me very much comfort That is to say, we're not making much progress against inflation or toward price stability, given any one of these three strategies As a result, I would have to conclude that maybe our best efforts should be to cap inflation now with the thought that the only way we're going to get inflation down is with a recession and that quite likely a recession will occur within the next 5 years--particularly if we hold growth below the trend line for this long a period of time I don't think there's a time in modern policy history in which we have gone for that length of time with growth below the trend line without falling into recession So, I think recession is a real possibility in this timeframe As a matter of fact, it may be something that gets us toward price stability So, alternative II for the upcoming period is the most appropriate one, in my mind And that says, really, that we're preparing in the near future to cap inflation and that the Committee hopes there's some exogenous event that causes a recession and we won't get blamed for it and yet we capture the progress toward price stability The other thing about alternative II is that the reduction of M3 seems reasonable to me It does show the flag a bit in the sense that we have taken a step in reducing the ranges of growth in M3 and debt You can make whatever you want of that; it isn't much, I think Nonetheless, for some people hearing your testimony it may be worthwhile "
1195,1990-02-06," Thank you, Mr Chairman With regard to the forecast over the upcoming forecast period, for 1990 we're very close to the Greenbook forecast--a tick stronger in real growth and very close to the projection for prices There is very little difference in the CPI less food and energy  Turning now to the District economy, as I think all of you know, agriculture has been on a recovery path now for a year and a half except in those areas where there have been dry conditions The concern was that we would start a third year of drought there Much of that has been relieved with snow and rain across much of the Wheat Belt, although the sub-soil moisture reserves are still very low They will need more moisture to produce this wheat crop, apparently But, given the moisture that has already fallen, there are some brighter prospects there Grain prices have slumped because of the moisture that has fallen but also because of improved soybean conditions in South America and a backlog of corn-laden ships in Russia, all of which have begun to dampen commodity prices On the other hand, cattle prices are virtually at an all-time high and, given the selloff, there's a good outlook for the agricultural sector in the period ahead  Energy prices, as everybody is aware, picked up in both December and January because of the cold weather Most of the operators in our area believe that's only temporary and it has not encouraged them to expand their projections for additional drilling exploration or pumping from existing resources As a matter of fact, the District rig count fell about 10 percent in December from 337 to 303, if those numbers are to be believed The manufacturing story is the same in the Tenth District as it is elsewhere, particularly with respect to the auto assembly problems We are heavily involved with  -18-    2/6-7/90  auto assemblies in the District There had been temporary layoffs and I'm told that a relatively new, about a 3-year old, General Motors plant in Kansas City will lay off an additional 700 at the end of February One plant has been closed, though not this year; nonetheless it has taken its toll in that community Unit sales of general aviation aircraft increased about 45 percent nationwide in 1989 over 1988, but most of that increase--and we're fairly heavily involved with general aviation aircraft manufacturing in the Wichita area--has been single-engine piston driven aircraft and fewer large jets As a result, the value of shipments is down from 1988 The construction industry, both non-residential and residential, is depressed in each of the major cities in the area There isn't a great expectation for that to come back in the period ahead, particularly in the residential sector, as evidenced by the fact that a third fewer housing permits actually have been granted for residential construction As a result that sector is kind of on its ear On the other hand, in each of the major metropolitan areas in the District we have an unemployment figure that is less than the national average That does say that there is some income being generated; [unintelligible] we probably will drag well behind the continued recovery on the national level "

1262,1990-03-27," Thank you, Mr Chairman I only want to say that since Mike has said that he builds his forecast upon what he thinks to be the center of the sentiment of the Committee, I'd like to be counted on the side that has been set forth by Governors Angell and Johnson, and perhaps Lee Hoskins, for the period ahead I think the numbers we are looking at with respect to inflation are discouraging over the horizon As a result, if indeed it's going to take some snugging up, the sooner we do it the better That's a little into the next part of the meeting, but I just wanted to be counted in the group so that this center comes a little closer to what I'd like   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Tenth District continues to improve [unintelligible], but nonetheless is showing improvement with some mixed performance in the various sectors For example, in the agricultural sector there has been a turnaround in the moisture; there has been good moisture across virtually all of the Tenth District and particularly through the wheat region both from rain as well as snow That has a diverse impact, however, on wheat prices So in terms of net farm income it may wash out But the prospects for the wheat crop, which will start to be harvested in about six weeks, look very good On the other hand, there is some  -29-    3/27/90  weakness in cattle prices, as a result of a surge in the feed cattle production There are some projections that cattle prices will fall about midyear With the lower wheat price and lower cattle price, the outlook for net farm income may not be quite as good as some might expect Nonetheless, the outlook is quite likely going to be very good in the agricultural sector  In the energy sector, the rig counts have fallen again most recently That is, in the Tenth District the rig count has actually fallen in roughly three [unintelligible] from 298 to 255 in number, although it is still higher than the count a year ago So, there is some year-over-year improvement; it's better than it was before The manufacturing sector is still fairly slow, particularly with respect to automobile assemblies There have been some cutbacks in production in the plants in the District In one in Kansas City they actually have laid off 700 people and cut [production] from roughly 800 cars a day down to 600 for the second-line adjustment But the 700 layoff is already significant On the other hand, aircraft manufacturing in the District continues to be strong and vigorous As a matter of fact, Beech just received a new contract for $1-1/2 billion to supply business-type aircraft to the Air Force for training purposes That, of course, will stretch over time, but it is a new order of significance for that area There is some improvement and strength in both residential and nonresidential construction in the District, which continues to amaze me given some overhang in the commercial [side] at least But it may have been affected by the warm January temperatures Nonetheless, there are those contracts out there and [work] will be performed in the period ahead So overall, the District continues to improve--slowly to be sure, with disparate results depending upon what area of the economy you look at  As for the Greenbook forecast, we really have no quarrel with it It's a bit stronger maybe than we originally had thought, particularly in view of the fact that we ran these numbers and got about the same result but without any interest rate increase So by building in an interest rate increase, maybe the Board staff's forecast is a little stronger than ours But given the timing--as I understand it, maybe a 1/4 point late in the third quarter and maybe another 1/4 point in the fourth--it won't have a lot of impact in 1990 As a result, we're fairly close together; I have no problem [with the staff's forecast] "
1263,1990-03-27," Mr Chairman, you might have detected from some earlier comments that I made that with respect to this particular meeting I started out leaning a bit toward ""C"" or something in the neighborhood of a ""B-C"" directive simply because of the lack of evidence that we have made any progress on inflation--nor will we in the next two years Nor indeed is there clear evidence that we have capped inflation as some people would like to believe As a result, it seems to me that making some sort of preemptive strike, if you will, by moving rates up at the the present time would have some beneficial effect But given a couple of things that will occur in the future, it seems to me that that probably is inappropriate Given the closeness of the G-7 meeting, I think you might have some real difficulty during that period of time Also, there will be an employment report that comes out April 6th, just before your G-7 meeting that will give some better information with respect to what happened in January and February; it will either confirm or not confirm those numbers, it seems to me Therefore, I would like to propose that we have ""B"" with an asymmetric directive so that if we do get information in the intermeeting period that suggests that we have  -41-    3/27/90  a much stronger economy than we think we have, then we could move Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, is that this would be a leading bit of information to the market as they see this directive following the next meeting They would know which way the wind is blowing and what the next move could be It has informational content, if you will, whether we move or not in the intermeeting period; an asymmetric directive seems to me to have some advantage "
1322,1990-05-15," Thank you, Mr Chairman In the Tenth District, the economy continues to grow moderately slowly Recent developments have been somewhat mixed There has been a good deal of press given to the agricultural sector The wheat crop, for example, has been estimated by the Agriculture Department as being near double last year's crop That optimism isn't totally shared by some of the wheat growers themselves, although we're within probably 30 days of harvest in much of the Tenth District area It does look very good, and I think the farmers are pleased with it It's a question of how it comes out We are always reminded that a wheat farmer has to lose his crop at least nine times; in other words, he's very pessimistic until it's in the bin They're still not prepared to say it's going to be double what it was last year The outlook for farm income for 1990 is very good not only because of the wheat but also other crops, so the last two-year drought will not affect the 1990 crops yet to be planted and harvested On top of that, crop prices have firmed up recently and there's a good deal of excitement about red meat prices For example, prices of cattle, including replacement cattle for the feed lots, are essentially at an all-time high Inventories of the latter have not been rebuilt; they were run down over the last three or four years So, if you combine not only a good crop year together with livestock prices, then the outlook for agriculture is very bright for our area A somewhat damping effect is the rain that Bob talked about in Texas, which also has occurred through much of the Tenth District That has restored the moisture level, but now farmers can't get the crops in [the ground], so it's uncertain With respect to energy, despite the weaker oil prices, the District rig count did increase in April and remains above the year-ago level We do have a good deal of auto assembly [capacity] in the District and that [activity] has been very sluggish, as has been detailed around the table In the manufacturing sector that's laid against a very brisk business in aircraft manufacturing In residential construction, contracts fell slightly in March, but nonresidential contracts increased, which doesn't tell the same story that apparently is told elsewhere in the nation We do still have a large overhang of commercial properties in cities such as Denver, Oklahoma City, and Tulsa But District-wide, the nonresidential commercial contracts have increased recently  With regard to the national economy, I have little or no quarrel with the Greenbook forecast We go through an exercise in which we hold monetary policy steady as it has been going into a meeting such as this Then, after we receive the information with respect to how the staff has treated monetary policy in the Greenbook, we do another exercise and lay them side-to-side This time they come out fairly close, with the exception that we have a little less growth in 1990 That may reflect your pattern of increased interest rates; that isn't clear to us, I guess, when we get your information But on that we don't quarrel We think there will be a little less growth in 1990 The growth and the inflation aspects of 1991 look to be about the same, given the staff's pattern of the interest rate levels  We have found little evidence of a credit crunch, particularly in the agricultural sector The agricultural banks are very liquid; they say they can't find the loans to absorb their liquid assets into loans Where we do hear some evidence that credit is not available is in areas such as Denver that have just come off the bottom and where the larger banks have been hit and now have a rating that makes them very cautious about credit I don't think it has  -18-    5/15/90  anything to do with examiners coming in and knocking them It's simply a fallout of what they've been through in the last year or two They are on the way up but they're very cautious in their credit terms It is not price as far as we can tell "
1323,1990-05-15," My preference would be alternative B, asymmetric, given that I believe we're going to have to have some greater restraint in the period ahead if indeed we're going to make any progress toward lower inflation rates However, I don't see anything on the horizon that would urge us to move in the intermeeting period--between now and early July, for example I can't imagine that these numbers are going to reverse so quickly that they would trigger a further increase in the intermeeting period There are ways, however, to get the message to the market for the credibility argument One is, as you've suggested, that it be stressed in the policy record which is read by the market; on the other hand, we could have an asymmetric directive Either would give the view that we're still interested and concerned about our credibility and will move against inflation As I say, I would prefer ""B"" with an asymmetric tilt simply because of the communication But I could, and would, accept your proposal that it be stressed in the policy record "
1379,1990-07-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman I'd like to join those who start from the premise that strategy II on the long run--the one labeled ""tighter"" [in the Bluebook]--is consistent with our objective I also would join those who have indicated that where we are today is about where we want to be and about where we had projected in the past I think it's rather remarkable With that background, I would prefer to take the opportunity that I think is now available to ratchet down M2, simply because over the long term 6 percent growth in M2 is the maximum growth that we can sustain and still achieve the  -35-    7/2-3/90  objectives that we're looking for As a result, I would ratchet down M2 by 1 percentage point on both the top and the bottom for both 1990 and 1991, simply taking advantage of the window that seems to me to be available With regard to M3, there's some debate as to whether or not we should keep M3 There are those who have spoken on that in the past--particularly Governor Angell, who says that he would not pursue his feeling about doing away with M3 I would want to keep M3 But as has been indicated in the discussions before by the staff and others, it seems that M3 needs to be adjusted because of the uncertainties that have occurred I don't like the proposal by the staff of a 0 to 4 percent range; I don't like the 0 As a result, I would like to see an adjustment to a 1 to 5 percent range for M3 and I would maintain debt at 5 to 9 percent I would do both of those adjustments, to M2 and M3, now rather than later   Debt at 5 to 9 percent   Both years "
1380,1990-07-02," Mr Chairman, the good news is that the drought is over as far as our District is concerned We had ""ponding"" and ""puddling"" but the fact of the matter is that the farm sector still remains the primary source of the strength in this rather slow-growing District economy With respect to the agricultural sector, the wheat crop, which has been mentioned here already today, is in a sense [unintelligible] Mother Nature plays tricks on the farmers as she does annually, I guess But overall the wheat crop is projected to be at or near a record level As a matter of fact, earlier today I received a report that wheat in western Kansas had yielded 10 percent more than it ever had before   The fact of the matter is that some of the wheat crop, which 30 days ago looked outstanding throughout most of our District, has been lost because of high winds and wet weather But overall it apparently will come out very well In addition, there has been a delay in planting corn and the corn acreage will be down this year, but that is [offset] by the soybean crop because of the later planting date for that crop Red meat prices for the farmers still are very good and as a result the agricultural economy looks very strong  With respect to the credit crunch that has been mentioned, with some diligence [in our search] we simply don't see it in our area of the country As a matter of fact, the complaint is that there is very little loan demand and liquidity is very high in most of the small agricultural banks particularly, as well as in some of the bigger banks Employment continues to grow throughout the District;  -19-    7/2-3/90  in fact, in each of the metropolitan areas the unemployment rate is lower than the national rate, and there is some strain on skilled labor in the District The District automobile manufacturing sector remains in the doldrums There is some continued modest improvement in the general aviation manufacturing area As for construction, home building is at a low level and there is very little commercial construction taking place because of the overhang that still exists in the energy areas such as Denver, Oklahoma City, and Tulsa Although there is some [construction] in Kansas City and a little in Omaha, by and large it does not measure up to year-ago levels In the energy sector, the OPEC overproduction has driven down prices, as noted earlier today However, the rig count in the District still remains fairly stable and in fact is higher than a year ago Overall, I would characterize the District as being in fairly good shape in most areas I hear very few comments from people that I or my staff have been in contact with concerning the economy itself People are pretty well satisfied, but one has to lay that against the fact that some of them suffered rather dramatically in the 1980s, so they think current conditions are pretty good  On the national level, we have no real divergence from what was presented in the Greenbook with the exception that in 1990 we're about 1/4 percentage point stronger [on GNP] than the Greenbook and inflation is roughly 1/4 percentage point more We're back together in 1991, however So, over the total horizon our forecast is not greatly different than the one the Greenbook portrays "
1381,1990-07-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman This may be hair- splitting a bit, but my preference would be ""B"" with a symmetric directive I don't see that there is accumulating evidence of a tightening of credit markets As a result, a symmetric directive--to the extent that it will be read six weeks from now as a sort of ""steady-as-you-go"" policy--seems to me to be a reasonable outcome [of our meeting] On the other hand, if I have understood the discussions around this table in the past, particularly as articulated by Don, with a symmetric directive you have the ability to take one cut--if you will, a quarter point [on the funds rate], which is what we are talking about--without the necessity of a conference call or consultation As a result, it seems to me that ""B"" with a symmetric directive gives you what you want and I wouldn't object to that "
1434,1990-08-21," Mr Chairman, I would like to ask a question of the staff with respect to the forecast that has been laid out To give us the export numbers that are contained in the staff's forecast, it seems to me that the forecast assumes that growth in other industrialized countries will continue fairly strong I know there has been discussion of it already, but given the uncertainty about the oil situation and the reactions of Germany and Japan for example with respect to their interest rates, how comfortable are you that we will maintain exports at the level that you are projecting?   Thank you, Mr Chairman Well, [economic activity] in the Tenth District is not a great deal different than reported in prior meetings We continue to have moderate growth with mixed performance in individual industries within the District However, the higher oil prices will likely slow job growth in the District, particularly in states such as Missouri, Nebraska, and Colorado And that will not be offset in our opinion by the District's increase in energy production in states such as Oklahoma, Wyoming, New Mexico, and Kansas In the energy area, the District rig count did increase before the Middle East situation; the rig count went up from 266 in May to about 290 in June, largely in the natural gas area, however That level of 290 in June is only about [20] percent of the level in the peak years of 1982 and 1983 when the number of rigs operating in the District was something over 1500 Automobile manufacturing has been curtailed within the District, principally in Missouri, as has been reported For example, the GM plant has been closed for two weeks' vacation related to a lack of parts There is some suspicion that it's simply because the dealers just don't want to take down additional inventory On the other hand, Ford has closed its plant for a week because of the slow orders from dealers  In the agricultural sector, there has been a very large wheat crop, as I think everybody knows Prospects for corn and soybeans and other feed crops have been very good As reported earlier, because of a wet spring and late planting there is a good growing season, and it appears that we will have a very good crop in all of these different commodities providing we don't get an early frost, which would kill off this late planted corn and soybean crop One interesting thing that I'd like to report on is a second-quarter survey of farm land values, which showed a continued increase of 3 percent overall But that's a slowing in the rate of increase of agricultural land prices For example, in the same period in 1988 the year-over-year increase was 5-1/2 percent; for the same period in 1989 it was up 4 percent; and this year the increase slowed to about 3 percent  -24-    8/21/90  Given all of that, we don't see any great deterioration of economic activity, which is very much as it has been in the past What will happen with respect to the energy sector as a result of oil prices is still uncertain, obviously But as also reported earlier, we will not be able to get back into a boom condition of drilling oil wells simply because the level of skilled labor has vanished since that earlier period and there is not the equipment to put in the field to bring forward new wells  With regard to the national outlook, as Bob Forrestal said, in the interest of full disclosure I should report that our staff believes the outlook is a little weaker than shown in the Greenbook, marginally so However, I'm more supportive of the Greenbook forecast And it does show, of course, the kind of outcome that we would hope for That's all given against the background of the great uncertainty of the Middle East situation Talking about a recession, given what's going on in the Middle East and the prospects for a shooting war, I don't know that we have any history of going into a recession during a shooting war As a result, this adds a bit more uncertainty, but I come out [with the view] that the Greenbook forecast is very believable "
1435,1990-08-21," Mr Chairman, I also would support your proposal I think the most important thing that you may have indicated is the need for stability If we were to move, it seems to me that the markets would read it as sort of a double whammy On the  -40-    8/21/90  one hand, I would assume a move toward ease would indicate to some that we are more concerned about a recession and, therefore, people will accumulate the thoughts [and tend to react in ways] that will make it come true On the other hand, another part of the market would read the easing as being inflationary over time and that will build inflationary expectations I think nothing good could come out of a move right now And as a result, stability is where we should be and where we should stay unless some very dramatic changes take place in the near future "
1493,1990-10-02," Looking at the forecast, Mike, it appears to me that a good deal of emphasis was put on the net export sector You have it coming back fairly quickly What kind of assurances do you have, given the uncertainty of the Middle East problem, that that's really going to come about? You have it coming back very quickly, it seems to me   Thank you, Mr Chairman With respect to the District itself, the economy continues to grow moderately and there are mixed results in individual industries or economic areas of activity In the energy sector, for example, the higher oil prices have pushed up the rig count modestly For example, in August the count was 282 in the District and in September 301 However, that followed a drop in the rig count from July to August But it has come back and, as has been stated around this table before, the question is whether or not there is enough equipment and skilled labor to meet the demand The last and important part of that equation is whether or not there are enough lenders out there willing to finance oil speculation exploration Having been burned in past years, I'm not sure that that kind of financing will come from District banks Whether it will come from Boston's probably is not very clear either!  With regard to the agricultural sector, farmers have put in the bin the largest wheat crop since 1982 The corn and soybean crop look very good, with some concern about the bean crop being nipped with a little early frost But with regard to the wheat crop, given the lack of exports to Iraq that has already been mentioned and the projection of restricted or lower levels of exports to the Soviet Union, the reaction in the market is simply to [unintelligible] the big harvest The lower exports and less demand clearly have dropped  -29-    10/2/90  the price of those commodities substantially In the livestock industry, on the other hand, both hogs and cattle are going great guns, particularly with the prospect for cheaper feed in the future  As for automobile assembly activity in the District, auto makers continue to shut lines down or to shut down entire assembly factories For example, in Oklahoma City a plant will go down a full week in October and in Kansas City a Ford plant will shut down a week or two weeks, depending upon their order levels As a result, it's off and on There isn't much lost income when those auto workers are not working, however, because of the arrangements under the auto contracts So, it's really not a matter of cutting their purchasing power but rather a question of how much they're actually working and what kind of orders they're getting for particular automobiles or trucks On the other hand, in the aircraft industry, which was mentioned this morning by Mike--and Wichita is a big player in this-- the billings for 1990 and 1991 are projected to be about 30 percent higher than last year, year-over-year So, that industry is still clicking along very well With regard to construction, activity is up rather significantly over year-ago levels about 30 percent in nonresidential and 5 to 7 percent in residential  So all in all, the District, although not booming by any stretch of the imagination, is doing as well as or better than the nation And that is important with regard to the outlook in the sense that a lot of people I talk to say ""Well, we're doing pretty well, but I think we're in a recession"" When you press them on why they believe we're in a recession they say they watch the news or read the newspapers and given what's happening in the Middle East they simply think that times are [not] as good as they otherwise would have been But there's no real evidence that we're in a recession  With regard to the national economy, we go through the same exercise that the staff here does with regard to projections and with basically the same assumptions One thing we did not build in this month was the fiscal restraint that would take place with regard to a $35 billion budget agreement Even with that, we're a little less optimistic than the staff in the sense that we would project an additional quarter of flat growth--not negative, not positive, but flat--in the second quarter of 1991 Otherwise, it looks very similar But given the uncertainties that are out there, I don't think one can put a lot of faith in the long-run projection There are too many uncertainties As a result, it seems to me we probably should be doing nothing "
1494,1990-10-02," We talk about the prospects for the longer end and the dollar if we ease Do you have any concern, given all the commentary that has taken place with respect to the fragility of the banking sector, that if we were to do anything before the budget is really set in concrete that it would be misinterpreted? Maybe misinterpreted is not the right word Rather, would it be thought that we reacted to the fragility of the banking system and as a result would that propel the market into greater negativism and [unintelligible]?   May I have a clarification, Mr Chairman? Are you talking about Friday or are you talking about early the following week?   Okay   Mr Chairman, given that you're thinking about moving on Tuesday after a holiday on Monday, we won't know then how the markets will react to the budget resolution being passed Would you consider--   Well, 24 hours can make a difference in the way the market reacts to digesting what happens on Friday That is my point And I would delay [our move]   Yes Also, it complicates the Desk's problems, being the last day of the reserve period   Oh, that's right Okay I'd just like to see how the market reacts to the budget activity before we go forward and complicate matters if it is a negative reaction   Mr Chairman, I would prefer to delay the 1/4 point [move] until there is something more concrete to support it in the economic data than what we're looking at now I don't see that we would be creating a greater supply, given the credit crunch, simply by dropping the rate 1/4 or even 1/2 point It's rather like pushing on a string As a result, I'd wait until either one or two things happened until either the economic data suggested that it's appropriate to ease or until the budget agreement itself is actually put together with some certainty Now, that may be three weeks; that may not be until the 19th of October It's October 2 now, so that's about 2-1/2 weeks away "
1554,1990-11-13," Just a follow up We have the authority to back currency with foreign assets, right?   Does any additional action need to be taken in order to implement that? "
1555,1990-11-13," Thank you, Mr Chairman I want to go back to the discussion that took place between Governor Mullins and the staff with regard to the plant closings on automobiles and trucks There was some implication that there would be fewer consumer purchases simply because of that event It's my understanding that [auto workers] will continue to draw between 90 and 95 percent of their pay during these one-week or two-week closedown periods So, there is not a great diminution of purchasing power   Thank you, Mr Chairman On the national level, given the uncertainties and the assumptions contained in the Greenbook, the staff forecast seems to me as plausible a projection as one could make  On the District level, the economy continues to grow at a moderate pace Agriculture and energy are giving it a bit of a boost On the other hand, manufacturing and construction activities are sluggish and actually are deteriorating somewhat In the agricultural area, District farmers are completing the third [quarter]--and maybe the fourth, depending upon the area of the District--of an excellent year Farm income will be strong for 1990, although livestock producers will have a better year than crop producers largely because the wheat harvest came in at or near a record, which has depressed the price That feeds over, of course, into the [costs in the] livestock area for finishing off the cattle and hog in the red meat area As a result, the livestock producers will probably do better than the crop producers; but taken in the aggregate the farm sector has done very well in 1990 There is some concern, as Si Keehn mentioned, about the budget package as put together and what that will mean for subsidies in the period ahead Quite clearly, subsidies are going to be less in the future than they have been, but [questions about] how they're administered and the Administration's timing of those subsidies have created a lot of uncertainty And that does feed back into farm machinery sales, which have been almost at a standstill as far as we can tell  In the energy sector, because in October domestic oil prices were roughly double what they were back in June, there has been some modest increase in activity, principally in drilling For example, in the District in October there were 325 rigs working; that was up from 305 in September There has been a modest increase in the national rig count, and I'm sure the staff has those numbers  With respect to manufacturing, as I've indicated before, District auto plants are taking one-week or two-week sabbaticals-- well, layoffs There is a shutdown at both the Ford and the GM plants in Kansas City; neither worked the first week in November and the GM plant has continued to be closed for the second week of November On the other hand, the general aviation industry, which is a fairly large component part of our District economic activity, has begun to rebound although the light aircraft sector continues to decline Sales of turbo props and business jets are up very significantly and plants in Wichita will build the front section of the new Boeing 777 airplane for which they have substantial orders already on the books So, there is a very favorable outlook for the period ahead In construction, both residential and nonresidential contracts awarded in the District fell in September; they're at levels now about 13 percent below what they were one year ago There isn't really any evidence at the moment that either of those two sectors will see any revival until at least the spring of 1991 "
1556,1990-11-13," I would also support it I do have a question, however, Mr Chairman Why an asymmetrical directive?   I think I understand that we eased two weeks ago, and I assume you're proposing under this recommendation to ease tomorrow or sometime when it's convenient to the Desk That's essentially two easing moves within 2 or 2-1/2 weeks and there may be a further opportunity in the period ahead before the December 18th meeting But I would prefer if we're going to ease now--and I would delay it for a few days, by the way, and not do it right at this meeting but wait until we get some additional numbers on retail sales which come out tomorrow and do it next week--to accept your recommendation and then have a consultation before we ease again In other words, it could be three times in something over a month   What is the exact effect of an asymmetrical directive, then?   I understand that, and you have been very prompt to call a consultation under the circumstances you've just described I guess maybe I need some clarification of what a symmetrical and asymmetrical directive mean then Because if I understood what has been discussed before an asymmetrical directive would give the Chairman the flexibility to move without consultation one time in the intermeeting period "
1617,1990-12-18," Peter, I don't think I understand the Japanese [unintelligible] in the market that has pushed the rates up Are [US money markets] providing liquidity to offshore Japanese banks or are they only providing liquidity to the Japanese banks here in the United States? "
1618,1990-12-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman In the Tenth District, in contrast to several other Districts, we still have growth--though to be sure it's rather modest But we always had modest growth, I think, relative to the nation; this time we happen to be positive while the nation might be negative A lot of this largely comes from a very good harvest For virtually all of the crops grown within the Tenth District, the harvest is completed The exception is the cotton crop down in southern Oklahoma, which is an outstanding crop apparently, and the prices are very high for cotton because of some reduced crops in other parts of the country All in all, the agricultural sector is very healthy Cattle and hog prices remain very strong Wheat, corn, and other small grain prices have diminished because of the large world output in agricultural products However, there is some hope--not euphoria--that with the export credits that have just recently been granted to the USSR that exports of agricultural products will pick up and will impact our part of the world  On the energy side, there has been some modest pickup in exploration drilling I'm not sure that that will last very long For example, the rig count in the Tenth District went up modestly from 325 rigs to 336 rigs in the month just passed But the employment pickup in the energy sector probably is related more to the reworking of old wells than it is to new drilling or exploration That is, you can take a well that may be producing 6 to 10 or 12 barrels a day, rework it for $10,000, and increase that production to 18 or 20 barrels a day; it makes sense given the oil prices currently  Retail sales within the District, as best as we have been able to determine, are essentially flat I'm talking about the Christmas season, ex autos Autos are very soft as they are around the country I might just indicate, however, that the best anecdotal evidence about the agricultural sector [arose at] our branch board meetings There was one report that new pickup trucks were actually being sold for cash, which is something that hasn't happened in 6 to 8 years in the Tenth District As for retail sales being flat, the report that I received most recently about the Christmas season not being very strong [is partly related to] the very warm weather we have had Retailers expect or at least hope that in the last seven days-- and there is a cold front coming through the Midwest--those sales will pick up and that the Christmas or holiday season will indeed turn out better than most people expected, at least in our part of the country  -16-    12/18/90  With regard to manufacturing, automobile assembly plants have been closed down periodically because of cutbacks by the manufacturers, and the extended holiday will continue well into the first of the year for all of the auto plants within our District Construction is essentially flat, both commercial as well as residential There is some hope, particularly in the state of Kansas; there is a very big highway project there as a result of this public works project The value of the nonbuilding contracts in that state is well ahead of last year  All in all, the Tenth District is doing fairly well All the major cities that are metropolitan areas have unemployment rates well below the national rate And there's fairly good optimism--at least based on comments of our board members, not only at the head office but at each of the branch boards  With regard to the national outlook, we differ a bit in our view of that but the depth of the recession is not greatly different from peak to trough than what is projected in the Greenbook We have had some concern, and our numbers would reflect it, that the recession will be a little longer by one quarter In other words, rather than turning up in the second quarter of next year we would not expect to see that uptick until the third quarter; and then the latter two quarters of the year would be fairly close in the aggregate to what the Greenbook projects With regard to prices, in the Tenth District we don't see any price pressures and we don't quarrel with the projections in the Greenbook "
1619,1990-12-18," As I remember your earlier comment, Peter, the year-end positioning has almost run its course, is that right?  -32-    12/18/90   Well, given that, my question is How soon after the first of the year would you see that unwinding being completed? What I'm really driving at is whether to delay a discount rate action and a reduction of the funds rate until after the first of the year, which is two weeks, roughly, given the several days on which the market would [not] operate in any event because of the holidays   I guess I was suggesting that since the activity has not been as intense this year as in past years it might unwind more quickly after the first of year--in a shorter period of time   I would support your recommendation, Mr Chairman I would go one step further, however, given the background that we have reduced the fed funds rate by roughly 3/4 of a percentage point in a six-week period starting with October 29 and that hasn't shown through yet Another 1/4 point doesn't bother me, but if we continue I do have a concern about overshooting and I also have a concern about moving the fed funds rate to the level of the discount rate or making the discount rate a penalty rate I would feel a lot more comfortable about your recommendation if indeed I was assured that the Board would act rather promptly to reduce the discount rate and that only half of it, 1/4 point, would show through   I don't see standing on ceremonies, which I think Wayne Angell has brought forth in the distinction between the Board and the FOMC Now is the time to set policy and I'd like to see it established here "
1674,1991-02-05," Sam, what's magic about $10 billion as opposed to $5 billion, for example?   A follow-up question If we were to authorize $10 billion, then it's up to them? We don't trigger it but they do? They could do this anytime they want to and we have to take it?   Thank you, Mr Chairman I think Wayne Angell has probably made my comments--rather well, as a matter of fact It seems to me that there are only two real and important aspects to the range for M2--and that's the only aggregate I'd be concerned about One is the midpoint, which gives us ample opportunity to achieve the staff's forecast for the year, and the other is the top of the range The real test if we do get the bounceback [in the economy], which implies vigorous growth of M2, is going to be whether or not we have the courage to do what I think we should do fairly quickly The second part of that is that we only have 5 months, or 6 months maybe, before we take a look at these ranges again I think the message that would be received well by the markets is that we are indeed still concerned about inflation All the rhetoric about the short recession I think plays well with the longer-term view that inflation is our major target "
1675,1991-02-05," Thank you, Mr Chairman The overall pace of economic growth in the District appears to be slowing somewhat, due mostly to weakness in manufacturing and construction Automobile  -27-    2/5-6/91  manufacturing, for example, which we share with the St Louis District, has weakened further But the District aircraft manufacturers reported improvement in sales of business jet aircraft and as a result are showing a good deal of strength Construction activity in the District remains weak overall but public works projects, such as a large public project in Kansas, continue to offset the weakness in both residential and nonresidential building activity I might also say in reference to state and local spending that throughout several of our metropolitan areas there appears to be on the shelf--the bonds have been sold--infrastructure construction that will be commencing in 1991 and will hold up that sector somewhat The oil price volatility and uncertainty about the outlook for oil prices is slowing activity in the District's oil patch And sluggish export demand has led to weak prices in wheat, corn, and soybeans On the other hand, the livestock prices continue to bolster farm income, and I would characterize the rural areas as being fairly optimistic  There is one vignette I'll add to Bob's In talking with a restauranteur who has stores across the United States in the mid to upper range of restaurants, they also found that [their business] virtually closed down on January 16th, 17th, and 18th But by the first of February they were back at a level that they found encouraging They attributed it largely to CNN and people sitting in front of the TV to determine what was happening in the Gulf war  As to the Greenbook forecast, we also believe it to be rosy That is, the pickup in the second quarter seems unlikely to us but we believe there will be the start of a pickup in the second half-- probably in the mid to late part of the third quarter We have growth about a percentage point below the growth projected in the Greenbook for the year 1991 but a percentage point above that projected in the Greenbook for 1992 So, averaging it out, the staff forecast does not look unreasonable to us; it is simply the timing and the contour of the recovery that we believe may be different than in the Greenbook I would say that if the war continues beyond midyear, then all bets are off as far as we can tell As I understand it, the best guess is that it should be over by mid-April   Thank you, Mr Chairman "
1676,1991-02-05," Alternative B I would prefer a symmetric directive, given the background of the easing that already has taken place and the closeness of the easing just last Friday A symmetric directive does not imply that you do not have the flexibility to take a cut at easing between now and the next meeting on your own And that is the insurance that I would feel comfortable with rather than the asymmetric directive "
1742,1991-03-26," I guess I don't know what the term ""enhanced consultation"" really means I don't want to define it and put it in stone, but it has the right ring to it in the sense that I don't think the discount rate should dominate open market activities in the intermeeting period or vice-versa necessarily And as a result, it does require some discussion and more frequent discussions; but whether or not this [enhanced consultation suggestion] implies that isn't clear to me I happen to agree with Bob Black's comment with respect to the further action taken before the last FOMC meeting   To raise an old technical question maybe, given that we neatly divide the holdings between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve Do we have sole authority to determine the foreign currency holdings of the Federal Reserve System or is this a national policy that must be coordinated with the Administration? Where do we stand? Can we just sell off $24 billion of mark and yen and forget it if we want to?   How does that [differ]?   Well, let me put it another way Can we sell off $48 billion, which is the Treasury's holdings as well as our own?   If we were to choose to sell off $5 billion of our own, how do you maintain the 50/50 split between the two?   Yes   Well, the answer to my question then is that if we decided to reduce our Federal Reserve holdings of foreign currencies, this Committee could do that and you could effect it "
1743,1991-03-26," Mr Chairman, in the Tenth District, the economy continues to outperform the national economy modestly and that is a bit of a departure from the long-term trend; we normally lag the [national] economy But both the personal income as well as the employment numbers show that the economy during the fourth quarter continued to add jobs and that that will continue in the first quarter The District added jobs at an annual rate of about 1-1/2 percent during the fourth quarter as the recession took over nationally and, as I understand it, the national employment figures dropped about 16 percent So, in terms of the overall health of the  -33-    3/26/91  Tenth District relative to the nation, I think we're still doing fairly well but at a very slow pace There were jobs added in each of our seven states with the exception of Oklahoma Overall, the region in terms of economic health is being held down a little in the manufacturing sector because of our area of Missouri  It is, however, a time when the sap begins to rise and the euphoria comes on the agricultural sector In agriculture, cattle and hogs, the red meats, are still the most important addition to the economy in the sense that feeder cattle, for example, are now selling for over $100 per 100 pounds, which is an all-time high On the other hand, small grain, and principally wheat, does have some serious problems because of the drought Governor Angell's farm probably ended up partially in Oklahoma City a couple of weeks ago when there was a big dust storm coming out of western Kansas and western Oklahoma! If that area continues without moisture, clearly, the outlook for wheat will be hurt With regard to manufacturing, perhaps the story has been told many times with regard to auto assembly Clearly, each of the assembly plants in our District is cutting back; they actually are cutting out shifts and/or closing down for short periods of time I do understand, however, that the inventory of cars being held now by the manufacturer and the dealer is coming down to a very low level If there is a pickup in consumer confidence, that should be a real kick in terms of the manufacturers coming back on stream The energy area is essentially flat; there hasn't been much activity Drilling activity had actually decreased month-over-month, but that is so small that it makes very little difference probably The one area that may be a catalyst, or an area of the economy that could give a kick start to the Tenth District, would be oil field construction and drilling equipment orders that may come as a result of the Kuwait/Iraq situation We do have several rather large oil drilling construction companies in the District  As far as the national economy is concerned, I would agree with those who say that the second quarter probably will be flat and the third and fourth quarters will be a little less vigorous than the Greenbook forecast But overall the Greenbook is about as good a guess as I have or as most everybody else has, I think I'd be willing to buy it "
1744,1991-03-26," ""B"" symmetric "
1795,1991-05-14," Thank you, Mr Chairman In the District itself we continue to see some modest pickup in economic activity In manufacturing, for example, the auto plants are not back full out, but the Ford plants are running two shifts and a large General Motors plant in Kansas City itself is beginning to put people back on [the payroll] It also has raised a problem in that they simply have begun to use overtime rather than put a second shift back on And the unions have become very upset because auto manufacturers haven't put the second shift people back to work As a result, I think they're trying to manage [unintelligible] It does seem quite clear to me that although the auto makers' projections are not strong, there will be some positive impact on our output in the period ahead simply because they are starting from a very low base and they are at work and are producing In the aviation area, general business aviation-- the small jets, for example--is still very good They had very good bookings and sales in the first quarter and that is projected to continue Construction remains sluggish, particularly in the commercial area, but in the residential and other nonresidential areas some pickup is evident  -13-    5/14/91  The agricultural area has already been discussed The winter wheat crop looks to be fairly good and is spotty only in the sense that we've had some fairly severe weather come through the Midwest and that could be devastating to wheat at this stage in its development simply because of the hail and strong winds But by and large there is a fairly optimistic view of that crop The problem, obviously, is the weak commodity price for wheat Nonetheless, it's better to produce than not to produce Cattle producers, as I've indicated before, are doing very well, and that's projected to continue  In the energy area, drilling has slacked off I think simply because the stability of the imported oil prices at $20 a barrel or thereabouts does not encourage very much exploratory drilling There has been some development drilling That is, after a field is discovered, it has to be developed, and there is some modest activity going on in that area The other area of optimism in the energy field is the oil field suppliers who take some encouragement from the Gulf contacts that they established as a result of the Persian Gulf oil catastrophe  With regard to the national picture, I have no great quarrel with the Greenbook forecast As a matter of fact, I think it's a good deal better than it has been in the past We believe that the staff is a little over-optimistic on the timing in that their second-quarter forecast is considerably stronger than we have, although the second half of the year really comes out about the same So, it's simply [a difference in] timing When we scaled back the second quarter we scaled back a bit from where we were before But, on balance, it's as good a forecast as I think one can make, and it's a believable forecast "
1796,1991-05-14," I have just one [comment] I happen to agree with what you said with the exception that if the aggregates--in particular M2--do not come in as projected over the next couple of months, I would have some concern about the outlook   I think there's some informational value over the next couple of months "
1844,1991-07-02," I think perhaps everything has been said and there's nothing more new, particularly with respect to my view that your proposal is the correct one That is, we've come to mid-July when you will testify and there are still such uncertainties about this recovery that to suggest that we can say the recovery is well underway and we can look forward 18 months ahead and say we're going to bring money growth down seems to me to be the wrong signal to be giving at this time That does not say, however, that if I were here in February that I would not be going to the 2 to 6 percent range, because I think it is over the long run the appropriate way to go-- providing we do have the recovery that has been projected by the staff in the Greenbook "
1845,1991-07-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman The District's economic growth continues to improve, with agriculture being the dominant source of that strength, but manufacturing and construction continue to show some additional improvement In the agricultural sector, the harvest of wheat--a major agricultural product in the District--has been virtually completed They've gone through Oklahoma, Kansas, and are now in eastern Nebraska That wheat crop is estimated to be something like 25 percent less than last year--last year being a bumper crop But the more important aspect is that wheat prices are at very low levels As a matter of fact, I think they're now at the level that Wayne Angell experienced when he got out of high school 10 years ago! [Laughter] The fact of the matter is that there will be a cash flow but it's just not an outstanding crop Part of the diminishment in the actual grain production of about 25 percent comes from less planting acreage, but also there are fairly spotty areas across the District in terms of either wet or dry [conditions] or some infestation Beyond that in the agricultural sector, cattle prices have declined from their record levels but still remain a principal source of cash flow for the farmers  In manufacturing, the District automobile plants, with the exception of the one in Kansas City, have been operating on a full two-shift production schedule And that plant in Kansas City, which is a new GM plant, will be putting its second shift back on in September, suggesting that those production schedules are gearing up  -15-    7/2-3/91  to meet what they hope to be sales Construction activity in the District also continues to improve The building contract awards in the District in April, for example, were nearly 25 percent above year- ago levels and that was principally a result of public works projects, or infrastructure kinds of projects However, the residential and the nonresidential contracts have shown improvement over year-ago levels, so there is some hope that those will continue and we will not have another downturn in that area The energy sector has been a dead issue in the sense that prices are such that it just does not encourage any new exploration; indeed, they've shut down some of the small producing, stripper-type wells as a result of the current oil prices and projections of prices in the future On the other side, natural gas prices, which the Tenth District probably is better known for--it has a greater supply of natural gas certainly than of petroleum--continue to deteriorate and as a result there's not great euphoria in that area  On the national level, we're not greatly different from the Greenbook forecast but, like Mr Forrestal, we have a little different pattern For example, we do not show in the last half of 1991 as much vigor in the economy as the staff does As best as I can determine, looking at the relative figures, the staff has a fairly sharp comeback in inventories which we do not have On the other hand, in 1992 we're a bit stronger than they are and the averages for the next six quarters together are right on the button at about 3-3/4 percent growth through that period and in 1993 "
1846,1991-07-02," ""B"" symmetric "
1906,1991-08-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman With respect to the Greenbook forecast, our staff forecast is very close to it but continues to be, as it has in the past, a bit weaker in the latter half of '91 and therefore all of '91 and a little stronger in '92; it is really a shift, I think, of some of the component parts of the forecast So, the Greenbook forecast, as far as I'm concerned at least, looks to be the most likely outcome, and I think that the risks are basically balanced on either side at this point and that there's not a greater risk on one side than the other As a matter of fact, we took a look at the double-dip scenario, which Bob McTeer mentioned before, and we could not see anything that resembled what the historical experience has been on double-dips So, we believe that the projection for continued slow growth over the next six quarters is the most likely outcome  With respect to conditions in the District, the economy seems to be slowing somewhat from what was observed before It is due to a stalling in the [production of] natural grains in the agricultural sector and the sluggish energy and manufacturing sectors We're projecting somewhat weaker export markets And now this new event has taken place You will recall that the President did agree to provide $900 million of export guarantees to the Soviet Union; that has been put on hold as I understand it or has been or will be withdrawn, depending upon the [political] outcome in the Soviet Union If that is the case, then the crop prices that we're concerned about, particularly corn, would be weakened somewhat simply because the market has been diminished And that's notwithstanding the drought conditions that we still have; that may not be quite as broadly spread as in the Chicago District, but it is nonetheless real; it is spotty, and its [impact in terms of] diminishing crops is uncertain At the District automobile manufacturing plants, production remains weak, although each of them has come forth with a increased production schedule starting in September For example, in the Kansas City area, a second shift will be put back to work in a GM plant that has been on layoff now for six to eight months The outlook for construction activity in the District continues to improve, mostly because of gains in residential and the non-building contract awards; the latter include infrastructure improvements on the table now for bidding, which will be concluded over the upcoming period And despite a recent modest increase in the number of active drilling rigs in the District, energy activity remains sluggish and well below the level of a year ago That's largely because of the uncertainty in the cost of imported crude, and there's a very weak market in natural gas So, there's not much to encourage somebody to do any exploratory development or drilling at the moment  -27-    8/20/91  With regard to the agricultural financial sector, the loan- to-deposit ratio in those banks is only at about the 52 percent level They're looking for loans In the whole District the loan-to-deposit ratio is at fairly low levels There just is not the demand; there's plenty of liquidity, apparently Lastly, our quarterly agricultural survey indicates that land prices have stabilized after coming off very low levels over the past two to three years Prices are now about 35 percent higher than they were at that low; we had seen continued increases in agricultural land prices until this past quarter, when they essentially flattened out "
1907,1991-08-20," I would opt for ""B"" with a symmetric directive, given the fact that you have the authority under the procedures to move without consultation of the Committee I would marginally favor version II "
