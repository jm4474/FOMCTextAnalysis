2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the table and  chart labeled “Material for Monetary Policy Briefing”  As background for your  policy decision today, I thought it might be useful to review in a bit more detail how  market participants reacted to your decisions at the November meeting  On the eve of  that meeting, a small minority of investors anticipated no change in the stance of  policy, most looked for a 25 basis point easing, and some expected a larger move   Survey results suggested that market participants were essentially unanimous that you  would retain a balance of risks toward weakness, and market yields appeared to  incorporate expectations that you would reduce rates by a cumulative 50 basis points  by early next year   Thus, the announcement of an immediate 50 basis point move and a shift to   balanced risks surprised market participants  As shown in line 1, column 5, of the    2 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)                              December 10, 2002 68 of 87  first exhibit, over the afternoon of the announcement, the expected fed funds rate for  the month of December dropped 14 basis points  Column 4, lines 4 through 6,  indicates that Treasury coupon yields declined modestly in the first few minutes after  the announcement, and equity prices, line 7, increased a fraction of a percent  Bond  yields then apparently reacted to the advance in equities and the implied spur to  activity by more than reversing their previous declines, and Treasury coupon rates  finished the afternoon actually up a bit, column 5   Market participants seemed somewhat divided on how to interpret the risk  assessment  Policy expectations derived from the February fed funds contract, line 3,  should not have been contaminated by turn-of-the-year effects, unlike those for  December and January, and the 118 percent value derived from the February contract  seems to imply that markets on the whole did not take the assessment as indicating  that the easing cycle necessarily had ended   Over the next few weeks, economic reports and news bearing on earnings boosted  investors’ spirits, and longer-term policy expectations, indexed in exhibit 2 by the  expected funds rate for August—the dotted line—moved higher on balance  Over the  past ten or so days, however, investors saw the news as more downbeat  As a result,  equity prices most recently have declined, leaving broad indexes off about 2 percent  on the period and pulling policy expectations back down  On the positive side, as a  number of you have noted, credit spreads have fallen considerably and liquidity in  bond markets has increased, sparking a pickup in corporate issuance  Thus, your  November action could be judged as having contributed to a modest net improvement  in financial market conditions   With that improvement and the outlook for the economy not too different on  balance from that just after your November easing, market participants all but  unanimously expect that you will keep the stance of policy unchanged today  And a  large majority reportedly think you will again judge the risks to be balanced  A  policy decision consistent with those expectations could be justified in terms of an  economic outlook similar to that of the Greenbook  The Committee might find the  gradual increase in resource utilization and the modest decline in core inflation in that  forecast credible and appealing  And even if it preferred a faster decline in  unemployment, it might be skeptical about its ability to calibrate an additional dose of  stimulus to achieve the desired small boost to growth and not much more, given the  uncertainties about underlying trends and the amount of stimulus still in the pipeline   At the same time, the Committee might find the risks around that forecast still to  be about roughly balanced, perhaps with the possibility of greater fiscal stimulus that  President Minehan and others noted offsetting the downside risks stemming from  geopolitical threats Or, as noted in the Bluebook, it might see the current stance of  policy as roughly balancing the low odds but high costs of marked further disinflation  accompanied by economic weakness against the arguably higher odds but lower costs  of an unexpected overshoot of growth and inflation  Even if the Committee has a  somewhat stronger outlook than the staff—which, based on your comments today,                       December 10, 2002 69 of 87  appears not to be the case—it might find holding to its policy stance for a while   longer to be warranted, given the likely persistence of slack for at least several   quarters    If the Committee conversely is of the view that the outlook remains a bit too  weak, it might choose to ease policy another quarter point at this meeting  While  credit market conditions have improved on net over the intermeeting period, the  improvement has been modest and perhaps less than would have been anticipated in  view of the November policy move  And although the acceleration in activity in the  Greenbook is plausible, as was noted it is still largely a forecast  Moreover, the  pickup is rather gradual, and some slack remains even two years hence  The resulting  continued decline in inflation could constrain the Committee’s ability to engineer  lower real interest rates should a negative shock at some point require another  aggressive easing of policy The Committee might prefer to preserve a somewhat  greater inflation buffer and make faster progress against economic slack by easing  policy again   A policy adjustment at this meeting, of course, would surprise market  participants A 25 basis point move could feed through almost fully to other short- term rates, especially if investors extrapolated the two consecutive policy actions   The response of bond yields is difficult to predict, but an increase could not be ruled  out if equity markets rally, as was the case following the November move  Of course,  leaving the stance of monetary policy unchanged, with a statement of balanced risks,  would be right in line with participants’ expectations, and market prices probably  would change little in response As always, market participants will be looking  carefully at the wording of the announcement for clues about the Committee’s  outlook Thank you, Mr Chairman    Your first question relates to why the baseline assumption for   monetary policy was chosen I’ll pass to Dave Stockton for that   2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the material  labeled “Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives,” which was distributed during the  break  The sharp rise in market interest rates was, without a doubt, the major                                                     2 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   August 12, 2003 67 of 110    development in financial markets over the intermeeting period  As shown in the top  left-hand panel of your first exhibit, yields on ten-year Treasuries and other high- grade bonds generally climbed about 110 basis points on balance  The increase took  place amid considerable volatility, the right-hand panel  As Dino noted, the steep  advance in yields triggered a cascade of portfolio adjustments, including in particular  a large volume of hedging transactions by mortgage investors, and the volume of  those transactions and the high degree of volatility briefly took a toll on liquidity in a  number of fixed-income markets  The stresses were particularly visible in a spike in  swap spreads, the middle left-hand panel, but market functioning has improved  considerably in the past few days     One potentially significant development is the substantial increase in   compensation that bond investors require for inflation, the solid and dotted lines in  the middle right-hand panel  However, the most recent results from the Michigan  survey, shown in the inset, suggest no pickup in households’ longer-term inflation  expectations and, in fact, indicate some further decline in their anticipated short-term  inflation rates  As shown in the bottom panel, the sharp increase in yields over the  intermeeting period to an important degree represented a reversal of a considerable  decline over the previous period, as a number of you mentioned earlier  The recent  run-up in rates, while sparked by Federal Reserve words and actions, also reflected  incoming corporate earnings reports that were better than anticipated, some of the  economic data releases, and perhaps the news that the federal deficit was widening  substantially  Thus rates are now higher than they were in early May     The reversal in market sentiment showed through clearly in expectations for   monetary policy  As indicated by the dotted line in the top left-hand panel in your  next exhibit, just before your last meeting many investors apparently anticipated that  the funds rate would be eased to 75 basis points before long and that the rate would  remain low for an extended period of time  By contrast, the solid line suggests that  markets now think you probably will begin to firm policy next spring  Although the  direction of the revision is not surprising, its extent may be  And the fact that markets  see tightening as commencing in less than a year apparently indicates that they see the  expected rebound in growth as potentially leading directly to inflationary pressures  without much of a role for a persistent output gap in determining price changes      The top right-hand panel provides additional information about market   participants’ expectations for your policy stance in the near term  According to a  survey conducted by the Desk, all twenty-two primary dealers anticipate that you will  leave the target for the federal funds rate unchanged at today’s meeting  Sixteen  expect that the risk assessment will also be unchanged—that you will again see  balanced risks to sustainable growth, downside risks to inflation, and downside risks  overall  Four seem to think that you will shift your view of the risks to growth to the  downside, while two believe that you will move to a judgment that the two  components, as well as the overall assessment, are balanced        August 12, 2003 68 of 110    The market’s view of the likely course of monetary policy contrasts with the  Greenbook assumption that you will keep the funds rate at 1 percent through 2004   As David Wilcox discussed earlier, the staff forecasts that such a policy stance, in  combination with the monetary and fiscal stimulus that is either in place or coming on  line, should result in a considerable acceleration of aggregate demand  However,  because the staff also projects continued strong expansion of productivity and hence  aggregate supply, an output gap lingers throughout the projection period  That leaves  the civilian unemployment rate at 55 percent at the end of 2004—a touch higher than  in the June projection—and brings core PCE inflation to a tad below 1 percent next  year     Some discomfort with that higher track of unemployed resources is the first of   three basic arguments outlined in the middle left-hand panel that might support an  inclination to ease policy at this meeting  Even if you find the Greenbook forecast to  be credible, you might prefer to pursue more-rapid gains against economic slack— and, perhaps, to increase slightly the inflation buffer in view of concerns about the  zero bound to nominal interest rates  A FRB/US simulation not reported in the  Greenbook indicates that a 25 basis point lower path for the federal funds rate would  boost GDP growth ¼ percentage point over 2004  Also, even if you view the  Greenbook outcome as acceptable, you might want a little more insurance that it will  eventuate  Second, you might be concerned that aggregate demand could turn out to  be weaker than in the staff forecast, perhaps because of a larger impact of the recent  advance in long rates than in the Greenbook, or because the expected, and seemingly  emerging, brightening of business sentiment fails to materialize  Third, you might  see a good chance that aggregate supply could be even stronger and inflation even  lower than projected by the staff, reflecting robust productivity gains and, perhaps,  declining inflation expectations on Main Street, if not on Wall Street, feeding through  to wages and prices     On the other hand, you might see the Greenbook projection of accelerating output   and decreasing slack as supporting an unchanged stance of policy, as indicated in the  first bullet in the right-hand panel  Some of the data that have become available since  the last meeting may be early evidence that economic activity is now in the process of  accelerating, as the staff has been projecting  Also, the additional fiscal impetus now  being implemented should help sustain the projected improvement, and you might  want to see some evidence of the effects of that stimulus before undertaking further  action  Moreover, the recent increases in long rates could be seen as a possible signal  of a pickup in business confidence and a strengthening of spending that may outrun  those forecast by the staff  A calculation reported in the Bluebook suggests that if  bond investors use something like a Taylor rule in forecasting future monetary policy,  then the recent run-up in interest rates implies that their expected level of output a  year and a half ahead has revised up as much as 1 percent  If the Committee places  appreciable weight on this possible signal, it might be inclined to leave the stance of  policy unchanged at this meeting  Finally, the recent increases in inflation  compensation implied by indexed securities, while not confirmed by other gauges of  inflation expectations, may incline the Committee toward moving gingerly in   August 12, 2003 69 of 110    providing any further stimulus  In these circumstances, the Committee may wish to  defer action at this meeting and assess the data over coming weeks to determine  whether adjustments to the stance of policy are necessary     As I mentioned, such a policy decision is uniformly anticipated in financial   markets, and most investors expect that you will couple it with unchanged  assessments of the risks to attainment of your objectives for growth and inflation  As  noted in the bottom panel, such an evaluation of risks would seem consistent with  developments over the intermeeting period  The encouraging incoming data on  spending and the backup in market rates may be viewed as having roughly offsetting  effects with respect to the risks to the attainment of sustainable growth, leaving them  balanced  And the continued very low rates of inflation, accumulating evidence that  productivity growth remains strong, persistently weak labor market performance, and  a small downward revision to the staff economic forecast may be seen as arguing that  the risks to inflation remain tilted to the downside     While certain developments over the intermeeting period—particularly the sharp   backup in interest rates and the rise in inflation compensation—could be taken instead  to argue for adjustments to the risk assessment, in the current environment any  change might well prompt a sizable market reaction and possibly reignite recent  volatility  The prospect of a strong response presumably would not deter the  Committee from revising its assessment if the case was clear  However, should the  case for change be seen as marginal, the possibility of an outsized reaction—together  with the Committee’s intention to revisit its communication policy at its next  meeting—might set a relatively high hurdle for the FOMC to reach a judgment at  today’s meeting that the risks had changed  Thank you, Mr Chairman  That  concludes my prepared remarks       I don’t have too much to add to that  I would just note that probably   the mortgage-hedging activities that were very prominent in the summer did play a role, and that   makes it a little difficult to interpret the exact timing of the movements in the inflation   expectations series  But I personally wouldn’t be inclined to completely rule out the possibility   that market participants may be looking at longer-run inflation trends and that a slightly larger   premium may be built in there now     Coming back to your question on forward rates, Mr Chairman, over   the past year it looks as if one-year forward rates of the ten-year maturity haven’t really done   anything on balance  They did decline in the spring and then moved back up in the summer    They have been roughly flat in recent months   December 9, 2003 30 of 133    2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the material  that is being distributed now  Financial markets were subject to two strong  crosscurrents over the intermeeting period generally robust economic data and  policymakers’ statements emphasizing that policy could remain accommodative for a  long time  As of the close of the Bluebook on Thursday evening, the economic data  had predominated  Although market participants saw no chance of policy tightening  at this meeting, a majority thought that, in view of evidence that the economy has  turned the corner, you would modify or drop the “considerable period” sentence  today to begin laying the groundwork for an eventual move away from  accommodation  As shown in the top left-hand panel of exhibit 1, the expected path  of the federal funds rate estimated from futures market quotes (the blue line) had  steepened a little relative to that prevailing at the previous meeting (the red line)  The  top right-hand panel shows that yields on Treasury coupon issues were up 10 to  25 basis points for the period     However, Friday’s employment data proved disappointing to traders, and the   picture in financial markets has changed noticeably as a result  Treasury yields now  are about unchanged to up several basis points for the period  The expected path of  the funds rate over the next eighteen months (the red line in the left-hand panel) has  tilted down a touch  Its trajectory remains notably flat for the next few months,  testifying to the efficacy of your statements in anchoring near-term expectations   Indeed, as indicated by the probability distribution in the bottom left-hand panel,  markets see good odds that the target funds rate will still be at 1 percent around  midyear  Still, the five bars to the right of 1 percent indicate that markets place  considerable weight on a tightening over the next six months                                                        2 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   December 9, 2003 84 of 133    Much of the market debate on monetary policy over the past six weeks has  focused on just when this firming process will begin and, especially, on how you will  adjust the statement in advance of that tightening  As shown in the bottom right-hand  panel, about half the primary dealers now expect you to modify or drop the  “considerable period” language at this meeting  That fraction was noticeably larger  before Friday, but the employment data prompted some to revise their predictions   Only a few anticipate any change in your individual risk assessments at this meeting,  and five of the twenty-two expect you to shift to an indication that, overall, the risks  are balanced     The Bluebook similarly devoted much attention to alternative balance of risk   assessments and “considerable period” statements  By the way, as noted in the top  panel of your next exhibit, the Bluebook also discussed two policy alternatives  an  unchanged stance of policy and a 25 basis point easing  Our decision to include some  discussion of easing was motivated partly by the Committee’s existing risk  assessments and “considerable period” language  Support for that alternative came as  well from the staff’s projection that an output gap would persist over the next year  and that, as a consequence, inflation would tend to edge down further from an already  low level  From one perspective, a case could also have been made for consideration  of a tightening  Aggregate demand has heated up, the real funds rate appears to be  below its longer-run equilibrium; and in the Greenbook, the next policy move is the  first in a sequence of tightenings  Nonetheless, we didn’t discuss the pros and cons of  policy firming at this meeting because any near-term move in that direction would  seem completely out of sync with both the existing balance of risks statement and the  FOMC’s indication that policy can remain accommodative for a considerable period     Indeed, judging by your comments so far at this meeting, the issue on the table   today would appear to be not what to do but what to say in the rationale paragraph of  your announcement, in your risk assessments, and in the “considerable period”  sentence  The main changes to the rationale paragraph, outlined in the top right  panel, presumably would be to update the analysis to reflect the recent data—for  example, by characterizing the expansion as now “brisk,” or something along those  lines, rather than as “firming,” and perhaps by describing the labor market as  “improving modestly” rather than as “stabilizing”     The balance of risks assessment, however, is considerably more complicated  To help   address this issue, the middle panel repeats table 1 from the Bluebook  The two columns  present what would appear to be the plausible choices for the balance of risks on inflation— the risk of unwelcome further disinflation and balanced risks  The two rows refer to  balanced risks to sustainable economic growth and upside growth risks  As Vincent noted at  your last meeting, the Committee’s current communications structure gives it plenty of  toggle switches, and those rows and columns, together with the numerous entries in the table,  plus some less plausible choices that have been omitted, reflect that multitude of options     Beginning with the current configuration, indicated in the top left-hand cell, the   Committee could choose to retain its assessment that the risks to sustainable growth are   December 9, 2003 85 of 133    balanced, that the risks to inflation are weighted toward an unwelcome fall, and that a decline  in inflation is the predominant concern  This assessment would seem especially warranted if  the Committee interprets the phrase “sustainable economic growth” as allowing for  expansion for a time at a rate above potential—an outcome that recent data seem to be  suggesting—so long as growth is expected to moderate to a pace that would eventually bring  the level of output into line with that of potential  In this case, the likely persistence of an  output gap for several more quarters even in the context of above-trend growth—and the  possibility that productivity could continue to come in above expectations—would seem  consistent with downside inflation risks  With these individual risks, the Committee  presumably would again indicate that the risks are weighted toward an unwelcome decline in  inflation, although it could also assess the risks as about balanced if it saw the downside  inflation risks, while still present, as having diminished substantially     You might instead view the risks to inflation as now balanced  Although you   might project that an output gap could well persist for some time, tending to tilt  inflation down, you might also now see some upside risks  These upside risks could  stem from a variety of sources, including the possibility of speed effects caused by  strong economic growth, inflation expectations that may have edged up—at least as  inferred from financial markets—dollar depreciation, or even economic growth that  could turn out to be rapid enough to push the level of output above its potential in the  foreseeable future  As shown in the upper right-hand cell, the combination of  judgments that inflation risks as well as growth risks are now balanced presumably  would be accompanied by an assessment that the overall risks have been equalized     The bottom two cells pertain to cases in which the Committee judges that the risks   to the attainment of sustainable growth have shifted to the upside  This assessment  might be appropriate if the Committee sees a strong chance that the economic  advance will remain rapid for a while and would be especially consistent with an  interpretation of “sustainable economic growth” as strictly denoting growth at the  same rate as that of potential output  Even with this appraisal of output risks, the  Committee could still see the risks to inflation as weighted to the downside in view of  the likely effects of the output gap, as noted in the bottom left cell  With these two  component judgments, the Committee would likely conclude either that the overall  risks are balanced or that undesirably low inflation remains the predominant concern   The choice between those two conclusions would depend on the Committee’s  assessment of the relative probabilities as well as the relative costs of the various  possible outcomes  In particular, the Committee might feel that the risks are still  predominantly to the downside if it saw the potential economic costs associated with  significant further disinflation as especially acute  But if the Committee saw the  downside inflation risks as now smaller, it might view the overall risks as balanced   As noted in the Bluebook, a third net assessment—that unsustainably rapid growth is  now the main concern—would also be a logical possibility in this cell  But it seems  unlikely that the Committee would make such a sharp change in its assessment of the  overall risks while making no change to the risks to inflation  The final set of  choices, shown in the bottom right-hand cell, would arise if the Committee concludes  that the risks to growth had moved to the upside and that the inflation risks were now   December 9, 2003 86 of 133    balanced  Particularly if the Committee had arrived at this judgment partly because it  interpreted “sustainable economic growth” as the growth rate of potential, then it  might gauge the overall risks as balanced That’s because the expansion of output at a  pace above potential would presumably not involve any significant economic costs as  long as the level of output remained at or below that of potential  However, if the  Committee had concluded that the risks to growth were to the upside even using a  more liberal definition of sustainable expansion, then it might also see the overall  risks as skewed to the upside     As noted just below the table, the Committee could also choose to qualify any of   its judgments about the risks—for example, by indicating that the risks to inflation are  now only marginally to the downside  Particularly if the Committee saw one of the  component risks as just slightly out of kilter, there are cases in which gauging the  overall risks would seem to involve excessive hair-splitting  If so, you might see  advantages in refraining from characterizing the overall balance of risks, letting the  individual assessments in the context of the overall announcement convey your sense  of the risks  In that regard, your treatment of the “considerable period” sentence will  be key in terms of the market reaction  Some options for this decision are outlined in  the final panel  Obviously, retention of the sentence is one option  It would seem to  be warranted if you saw a reasonably high likelihood that the stance of policy could  be left unchanged for some time  Repeating it might seem particularly appropriate if  you were fairly confident that markets have built in a steeper trajectory for the funds  rate than will prove necessary  However, you might be inclined to modify or delete  the sentence for any of several reasons  You might be uncomfortable as a matter of  principle with a policy precommitment, particularly one that seems tied simply to the  passage of time rather than to economic developments  Alternatively, you might feel,  at a more practical level, that the statement has served its purpose but is no longer  necessary  Or in view of the recent economic data and the relatively low real federal  funds rate, you might think that the time at which policy might need to start moving  toward neutral is drawing closer     A range of possible modifications to the sentence in question also could be   considered by the Committee, with the intention that the sentence could be further  adjusted in the future and eventually dropped  One approach would be simply to vary  the words slightly, say, by substituting “for a while” instead of “for a considerable  period”  Even such a slight change would be read in the markets as significant   Another option is to explain why policy accommodation can be maintained by  incorporating a preface to the sentence  “With inflation quite low and resource use  slack,” etc  A similar approach would be to declare that, in view of the substantial  slack and low inflation, the Committee can be patient in adjusting the stance of  policy  These formulations would hint not only that policy tightening need not start  soon but also that it could be implemented at a measured pace when it does begin   Still another approach would be to condition the maintenance of policy  accommodation not on the passage of time but on economic developments, such as a  substantial reduction in disinflationary risks  A final option would be just to drop the  sentence   December 9, 2003 87 of 133      As I mentioned above, the Committee now has several dimensions along which it   can adjust the communication of its monetary policy intentions  Because of this  complexity, predicting the market response to any particular configuration has  become even more difficult  Nonetheless, the “considerable period” sentence  probably is key  Given current market expectations, interest rates likely would tend  to fall somewhat in response to combinations that leave that sentence more or less in  place, although that effect could be offset at least partly by other changes to the  announcement  But dropping or significantly modifying the “considerable period”  sentence at this time could prompt a noticeable sell-off in fixed-income and equity  markets       Those who participate in drafting the Bluebook would share that view   3  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the material that  was passed out at the break labeled “Material for FOMC Briefing on Monetary Policy  Alternatives”  As shown in the top panels of exhibit 1, the incoming indications of  softer-than-expected economic growth—especially Friday’s employment report— have had a pronounced effect on financial markets  Over the intermeeting period, the  yield on nominal ten-year Treasuries, the solid black line in the left-hand panel,  dropped nearly 45 basis points, to about 44 percent—its lowest level since early  spring  At the same time, equity prices, shown in the right-hand panel, dove sharply  lower, as investors reacted to the sluggish data, rising energy prices, and corporate  guidance suggesting a less robust outlook for earnings  The S&P 500 index fell more  than 6 percent, while the Nasdaq plunged nearly 13 percent  But with business  balance sheets perceived as mostly being in excellent condition, credit spreads on  investment-grade issues were about unchanged; and yields on such securities, the  dotted red line in the top left panel, declined virtually point for point with those on  Treasury bonds  Spreads on speculative-grade issues (not shown) widened a little but  stayed relatively narrow       As is evident in the middle left-hand panel, the signs of persistent sluggishness in   the economy prompted a significant tilt down in market expectations for the path of  the federal funds rate  The blue line, showing quotes for last night’s close, suggests  that market participants now fully subscribe to the FOMC’s view that policy can be  tightened at a measured pace  Investors apparently have come to believe that two  years will elapse before the funds rate will reach 3½ percent  In other words, they  now see you moving ¼ point at roughly every other meeting  At the same time,  though, market participants appear to have read your recent policy announcements, as  well as your public statements that the flagging in growth is likely to be temporary, as  implying that policy will be tightened another notch at this meeting  As illustrated by  the blue bars in the chart to the right, options on federal funds futures point to very  high odds among investors that you will firm policy 25 basis points today  As shown  in the bottom left-hand panel, the Desk’s survey of primary dealers, which was  updated on Friday following the labor market report, indicates that dealers  unanimously share the expectation of another ¼ point move today  All of the dealers  also think that you will again characterize the risks to growth and inflation as  balanced, and most expect that you will retain the “measured pace” language or some  variant of it  The solid blue line in the bottom right-hand panel again shows the  current path for the expected funds rate derived from futures contracts but focuses on  just the next few months and assumes that policy moves will be made only at  meetings  The expected value of 161 percent for the September 21 meeting suggests  that market participants see only about a 2 in 5 chance that you will boost the funds   August 10, 2004 66 of 103          rate another ¼ point six weeks from now  And the value of 189 percent for the  December 14 meeting indicates that markets have built in only two and one-half  tightenings of 25 basis points over the four meetings remaining this year  By  contrast, at the time of the June meeting, investors anticipated an average of a ¼ point  move at each of the remaining five meetings      The same factors that have spurred market participants to ratchet down their   expectations for the pace of tightening might lead you to contemplate leaving policy  unchanged at this meeting, as discussed in exhibit 2  As portrayed in the top left  panel, the surge in payrolls earlier this year has tailed off sharply in the past three  months  And incoming NIPA data for the first half of the year (the second line of the  right-hand panel) revealed that economic growth was ¾ percentage point slower than  had been estimated by the staff in the June Greenbook  In response to the weak  employment data for June and July as well as to other indicators, the staff has revised  down appreciably its forecast for economic growth in the second half of this year (the  third line) from 5 percent in June to about 4 percent currently  As reviewed in the  middle panel, the staff forecast suggests that a considerable amount of economic  slack will linger over coming quarters  The output gap is projected to shrink slowly  and still be around 1 percent at the end of next year  Partly reflecting that slack, both  core inflation and overall inflation are forecast to move lower over the second half of  this year and during 2005 (the bottom left-hand panel), with the rate of core PCE  inflation edging back below 1½ percent by the end of next year  Particularly with this  price forecast, the Committee may not be satisfied with a prospect for continued slack  and may wish to foster increased resource utilization by pursuing a slightly easier  path than in the staff forecast, starting with an unchanged stance of policy at this  meeting      Market expectations for inflation could be read as giving the Committee some   latitude in the timing of its policy tightening  As shown by the black and blue dashed  lines in the bottom right-hand panel, the difference between yields on nominal and  indexed Treasury securities suggests that inflation expectations in financial markets  have reversed course over the past few months, declining significantly from their  recent peaks, while the solid red line indicates that households’ longer-term inflation  expectations have remained fairly stable at a level just under 3 percent      At the same time, though, the Committee might find the persistent relatively high   level of inflation expectations to be troubling and one of a number of factors that  incline it toward the continued tightening of policy at this meeting that is discussed in  exhibit 3  With the economic expansion now apparently well established, even if its  pace is somewhat below earlier expectations, the Committee may still believe that the  dominant policy consideration is the need to reduce the existing degree of monetary  accommodation  As shown by the solid line in the top panel, the real federal funds  rate is not only low but negative, and it has edged down on balance over the past year  as inflation has increased  Moreover, it is noticeably below even the lower edge of a  range of estimates of its equilibrium value  The 25 basis point firming of  alternative B would move the real rate toward zero, whereas a 50 basis point action   August 10, 2004 67 of 103          would leave it at about zero and just within the range of estimates of its equilibrium   In addition, as shown in the middle panel, a firming would be consistent with results  from a range of monetary policy rules that are reported in each Bluebook      As indicated in the bottom left-hand panel, the Committee may be attracted to the   50 basis point increase in the funds rate at this meeting of alternative C if it is  especially concerned about the highly accommodative posture of monetary policy  implied by a negative real federal funds rate  The Committee might also feel that the  staff has read too much into the recent run of weak economic indicators  By many  measures, financial conditions remain quite supportive of growth, and the Committee  may judge that it is just a matter of time before very low real rates of interest, if  maintained much longer, show through in accelerating economic growth and,  possibly, higher inflationary expectations and actual inflation      In view of the spate of soft indicators, though, the Committee may judge that the   25 basis point firming of alternative B is appropriate for this meeting  As noted  previously, inflation expectations, for now, appear to be well contained  And while  the Committee may feel that the existing degree of monetary accommodation needs to  be reduced over time, it may also believe that incoming data have tended to confirm  its previous judgment that policy can be tightened at a measured pace  Assuming a  gradual tightening of policy, the staff forecasts a moderate economic rebound,  persisting resource slack, and a resumption next year of some net downward  pressures on core inflation  Moreover, market participants have come to believe that  policy will be firmed at a gradual pace, and a larger move at this time would likely  prompt a sharp adjustment in market prices and could provoke considerable  uncertainty about the Committee’s motivations and intended policy path      Should the Committee choose to move by 25 basis points at this meeting, the   remaining issues have to do with the language of your announcement  These issues  are addressed in your final exhibit—the third revision of Bluebook table 1   [Laughter]  The second revision, which was circulated to the Committee yesterday,  responded further to the weak employment report and in particular to the suggestions  of several policymakers  This third revision is substantively similar to the second,  with the change in wording intended primarily to simplify the language  As shown in  rows 3 and 4 of alternative B, the rationale section of this version reads as follows  “In recent months, output growth has moderated and the pace of improvement in  labor market conditions has slowed  This softness likely owes importantly to the  substantial rise in energy prices  The economy nevertheless appears poised to resume  a stronger pace of expansion going forward  Inflation has been somewhat elevated  this year, though a portion of the rise in prices seems to reflect transitory factors”   Here I ask that you note a slight fourth revision—“seems to reflect” rather than  “evidently reflects” transitory factors  As shown in rows 5 and 6 under alternative B,  June’s assessment of continued balanced risks to both sustainable growth and price  stability would be retained today, together with the indication of the Committee’s  judgment that policy accommodation can be removed at a measured pace  Certainly,  both upside and downside risks to growth as well as inflation can be identified, and   August 10, 2004 68 of 103          recent developments would seem to support a continued belief about proceeding at a  measured pace        In a memorandum distributed to the Committee last week, Vincent Reinhart   discussed alternative wording that could eventually supplant the current risks  assessment and facilitate the deletion of the “measured pace” language  That wording  is shown in row 5 of alternative C  In brief, it would separately characterize the risks  to sustainable growth and to price stability—and potentially the overall risks—on the  explicit assumption that the stance of policy was maintained for several quarters  In  current circumstances, with the real funds rate estimated to be well below  equilibrium, those risks would most likely be viewed as to the upside  That new  wording could conceivably be used for a time simultaneously with the existing  “measured pace” sentences or be substituted for them immediately  Although the  Committee may see advantages to moving to the new formulation over time, one  consideration in a contemplation of adopting it today is that any change in the form of  the risk assessment is, at present, completely unanticipated by the markets  Without  the ability in the announcement to explain in detail the conditionality of the  forecasting exercise in the alternative wording, yields could back up somewhat if an  assessment of upside risks were introduced without warning at this time       By contrast, it seems likely that a choice of alternative B today, accompanied by   an announcement that included an assessment of balanced risks, that continued to  suggest that policy can be firmed at a measured pace, and that took note of the recent  moderation in growth and in the improvement in labor market conditions would elicit  little immediate reaction in financial markets  That concludes my prepared remarks       I don’t have that either, Mr Chairman, but I would note that our   estimates of growth in foreign-held currency are actually still somewhat larger for this year than for   domestic currency, despite the negative net shipments that Dino referred to  For instance, we are   projecting that foreign currency is growing about 6¾ percent for 2004 as a whole, whereas domestic   currency growth we estimate at about 4 percent   2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Financial markets were subject to  a number of crosscurrents over the intermeeting period  Nonetheless, most financial  market prices showed relatively small net movements over the period  As indicated  in the top left-hand panel of exhibit 1, line 1, yields on short-term Treasury coupon  issues were up somewhat as investors concluded that a pause in policy tightening was  not imminent  At the ten-year mark, however, yields on nominal Treasuries (line 3)  and TIPS (line 5) declined modestly, apparently reflecting in part investors’ sense that  growth in real activity was likely to be a bit less vigorous than they had previously  anticipated  As noted, implied inflation expectations for the next five years continued  to edge higher, while those for the succeeding five years were little changed   Meanwhile, the Wilshire index (line 6) rose 2½ percent, while the Nasdaq (line 7)  rose 4 percent, with equity prices supported particularly by falling oil prices  Risk  spreads on corporate, GSE, and emerging-market debt, not shown, declined virtually  across the board   December 14, 2004 59 of 118           As portrayed in the top right-hand panel, money market futures rates indicate that  the expected path of monetary policy edged up on balance for the next year but  declined slightly over a longer period, roughly consistent with the flattening of the  Treasury yield curve  Futures quotes imply that a ¼ point firming today is essentially  built into market interest rates, and as indicated by the first bullet in the middle panel,  a Desk survey taken last week similarly reveals that all twenty-two primary dealers  expect a 25 basis point move today  All of the dealers also think that you will retain  the assessment that the risks to both sustainable growth and price stability are  balanced and that you will keep the “measured pace” language  And the survey  responses and conversations with the dealers indicate that none expects you to use  today’s announcement to signal a pause in tightening going forward       Still, market participants do not think you will tighten ¼ point at each meeting   indefinitely into the new year  As noted in the bottom panel, two of the primary  dealers expect you to pause in February—even absent a signal today—and seven  anticipate that you will do so in March  Futures quotes can be interpreted as implying  that you will most likely tighten 25 basis points in February, pause in March, and  slow your pace to roughly a ¼ point move at every other meeting over the rest of the  year  The quarterly average funds rates in the Blue Chip consensus released on  December 1 suggest that private forecasters expect a bit faster pace of tightening than  built into futures rates, but that consensus still is consistent with your pausing twice  before the fall  The issue of whether and how soon to slow the pace of policy  tightening was the theme of the Bluebook presented to the Committee for this  meeting  Alternative A was distinguished by a pause at this meeting  Alternatives B  and C both involved a ¼ point firming today, but only alternative B included  language that would suggest a pause in the near term     A case for continuing to firm policy by raising the target funds rate another   ¼ point at this meeting is summarized in the top panel of exhibit 2  Most  importantly, the expansion now seems to be well entrenched, with labor market  conditions improving gradually  The forces that had previously been restraining  spending appear to have weakened considerably, and the Committee might thus  believe that it can continue to reduce the unusual degree of monetary accommodation  put in place in the past several years without jeopardizing satisfactory growth  The  Committee might also be concerned about a possible buildup of inflationary pressures  for several reasons  For instance, members may feel that the staff could be overly  optimistic regarding trend productivity and worry that slowing productivity could  begin to put upward pressure on unit labor costs  Also, some anecdotal information  suggests that increased business costs continue to put upward pressures on prices in  some industries  Moreover, actual inflation has risen over the past year, and the  recent inflation data have tended to come in a bit above market expectations,  potentially giving momentum to inflation expectations  Indeed, while long-term  inflation expectations have been essentially flat, the rise in actual inflation apparently  has fed through to some degree into shorter-term expectations  Finally, ongoing  downward pressures on the dollar seem to have augmented market concerns about   December 14, 2004 60 of 118           inflation  All of these factors suggest the possibility of some upside risks to the staff  inflation forecast       The Committee may also interpret the staff’s revised estimates of equilibrium real   interest rates as pointing toward continued monetary tightening over time  The  estimates of short-run r* presented in the middle panel suggest that equilibrium real  rates have climbed sharply since early 2003 as the economy has strengthened   Although your monetary policy actions have boosted the actual real rate as well, that  increase has lagged the advance in measures of r*  Consequently, the actual rate  remains a bit below the 70 percent confidence interval of the model-based estimates  (the darker blue band) and noticeably below the estimate implicit in the Greenbook  forecast (the dashed line)  These measures suggest that policy will need to be firmed  substantially over time; but as emphasized in the Bluebook and the staff memos, the  estimates of equilibrium real rates should not be interpreted as prescriptions for the  current stance of monetary policy  Rather, these measures estimate the real funds rate  that, if maintained over the next three years, would close the output gap at the end of  that time period  Interpreted a bit more loosely, the r* estimates attempt to measure  the weighted average real rate over the next several years consistent with closing the  output gap at the end of that period and thus do not have a direct implication for the  setting of the funds rate today     Even assuming that such estimates are accurate, bringing the real rate quickly to   some estimate of r* would likely be undesirable for several reasons  First, the  Committee might be dissatisfied with the persistence of a positive output gap for  another three years  Second, the Committee might be concerned about the downward  pressure on inflation that could result from that persistence  And, third, for a variety  of reasons the Committee may consider gradual adjustment of the funds rate toward  its ultimate equilibrium to be the preferred policy approach  From that perspective,  these r* estimates may be most useful in providing a benchmark for thinking about  the appropriate trajectory of policy over the next several years, for example, by  considering the average amount of stimulus that ought to be applied during that  period as policy moves gradually toward a stance thought likely to be consistent with  medium-run equilibrium  But even if you find these measures generally helpful in  thinking about policy, as we obviously hope, you will still need to weigh a number of  other factors in setting policy—for example, how your outlook differs from those  embedded in the models and the Greenbook, how quickly any output gap should be  closed, where inflation is now relative to your preferred level, and where it would end  up under a policy derived from considering these measures     The question of the appropriate trajectory of policy going forward is what   motivated the staff to present alternatives B and C as distinct policy choices in this  Bluebook  As noted in the bottom left-hand panel, if the Committee believes that  policy tightening can proceed at a slower pace than it has over the past six months, it  might wish to combine a ¼ point move at this meeting with a signal of a possible  pause in the firming process before long  Policymakers might think that the process  of firming can now proceed at a slower pace for at least several reasons  First, some   December 14, 2004 61 of 118           output gap apparently remains, and it does not appear to be closing particularly  rapidly  Second, the four rate hikes so far may be seen as having already reduced  significantly the degree of policy accommodation  That would be the case if, for  instance, members had a weaker outlook than the models and thought short-run r*  was near the lower edge of the 70 percent confidence band in the middle panel  A  relatively low r* could result from a continuation of the range of factors that have  apparently been restraining the expansion over the past few years—for example, the  persistence of unusual business caution  Such considerations might incline the  Committee to shift to a somewhat slower pace of policy firming and signal such a  shift today through the wording suggested under alternative B       However, policymakers may instead believe that the recent pace of tightening   should be maintained, at least for a while longer, or even stepped up—and  consequently that, as in alternative C, the Committee should not give any signal at  this meeting of an imminent pause  As noted in the right-hand panel, the existing  degree of policy accommodation is substantial, at least as judged by the difference  between the real funds rate and the range of point estimates indicated by the red band  in the middle panel  All economists agree that monetary policy works with long lags,  and members may be concerned that the considerable amount of monetary stimulus  could be cumulating into an inflationary impetus that will become fully evident only  with the passage of time  Policymakers may see the recent inflation data, as well as  the downward pressures on the dollar, as possibly the leading edge of a ramp-up in  underlying inflation trends  Finally, the seemingly buoyant attitudes toward risk in  financial markets may argue at the margin for a firmer path of policy     Your last exhibit repeats table 1 from the Bluebook  Should the Committee wish   to suggest the possibility of a pause at an upcoming meeting, as in alternative B, it  could do so by indicating, as shown by the red text, that “the Committee’s policy  actions since mid-2004 have resulted in a significant reduction in the degree of  monetary policy accommodation” while noting that “nonetheless, the    stance of  monetary policy remains somewhat accommodative”  The economic description  could be updated by referring to the “earlier” rise in energy prices and by indicating  that labor market conditions “continue to improve gradually”  Although market  participants appear to anticipate some slowing in the pace of policy firming in 2005,  few if any expect you to signal a downshift today  Hence, selection of this alternative  likely would lead investors to mark up the probability of a near-term pause  Short-  and intermediate-term interest rates would likely decline noticeably, stock prices  could rise, and downward pressure on the dollar could resume     If the Committee, in contrast, believes that policy tightening should continue at   the recent pace—and perhaps even wishes to allow for a potential acceleration in  policy tightening—and hence does not wish to signal the possibility of a pause, only  modest changes to the statement would appear necessary, as in alternative C  Choice  of this alternative today likely would have minimal market impact  Should the  Committee harbor significant concerns about inflation, it could indicate that “the  earlier rise in energy prices and an escalation of business costs have the potential to   December 14, 2004 62 of 118           contribute to upward pressure on prices”  It could also state that “labor market  conditions continue to improve,” thereby hinting that conditions on the real side of  the economy are not likely to impede continued policy tightening at upcoming  meetings     In closing, it might also be worth noting that the Committee would not necessarily   have to signal a pause in advance through its announcement  First, the phrase  “measured pace” presumably was intended, at least originally, to allow for the  possibility that policy might not be firmed at each meeting—although some market  participants have come to read it as implying regular policy moves  Second, the  market’s expectations for policy have not been completely immobilized by the  existing language  Market yields still fluctuate to some degree with incoming  economic and financial information, given the implicit conditionality in the language,  and thus markets could come to anticipate a pause—even without a signal—should  the data point fairly clearly toward the desirability of a slower pace of tightening       Yes  I wouldn’t focus solely on energy costs, but that was the intent—to   highlight that in particular as well as other elements of costs that are putting pressure on prices     We’d simply say, “Output appears to be growing at a moderate pace, but   the earlier rise in energy prices and an acceleration of business costs have the potential to contribute   to upward pressure on prices”     That’s correct   December 14, 2004 63 of 118            I think that’s right This has been an evolving pattern over the past   several futures settlements  There was a pattern in the last few months of pronounced tightness   in the particular issue that we’re talking about, which is the February 2012 note  And it is the   case that currently the cheapest-to-deliver issue into the September contract has an even smaller   outstanding size So this situation will bear some watching    Yes, potentially  These issues that enjoy a lot of “specialness” in the   repo market because they can be financed cheaply tend to trade noticeably below the yield curve,   at least at times   3  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the package  of charts distributed during the break entitled “Material for Briefing on  Monetary Policy Alternatives”    Your monetary policy discussion today takes place against a backdrop of  significant revisions to the economic outlook and substantial changes in  financial market prices  As shown in the upper left-hand panel of exhibit 1,  market interest rates rose considerably over the intermeeting period, pushed  higher by a steady stream of data releases suggesting greater momentum to  aggregate spending and output, some signs of heightened inflation pressures,  and indications from policymakers that measured firming would continue in  coming months  Yields on nominal Treasury securities climbed 45 to 50 basis  points, bringing the 10-year yield above 44 percent  As shown in the upper  right-hand panel, one-year forward rates ending one year ahead through 10  years increased appreciably, although the larger part of the increase occurred  near the front end of the curve—a common pattern when yields respond to signs  of strength in the economy   The middle left-hand panel indicates that real yields as read from inflation- indexed Treasury issues rose about in line with nominal rates  As shown in the  middle right-hand panel, market participants evidently expect that you will  counter the perceived increase in aggregate demand and inflation pressures with  additional policy restraint, as CPI-based inflation compensation rose less than  10 basis points on net over the intermeeting period  Inflation expectations thus  appear to have been remarkably little affected by the $5 per barrel further rise in  spot oil prices over the intermeeting period (the black line in the lower left-hand  panel) and the more than $3 increase in far futures crude prices (the red line) to  record high levels   Likewise, equity prices, shown in the lower right-hand panel, seem to have  been held back little by the further rise in energy prices  Indeed, boosted by  strong earnings reports, the Wilshire 5000 index climbed 2¼ percent while the  Nasdaq surged 4½ percent The apparent enthusiasm about business prospects  was mirrored in corporate bond spreads, not shown, with the spread on high- yield issues dropping more than 60 basis points   3 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)                               August 9, 2005 76 of 110  Market participants sharply marked up their expectations for monetary policy  firming  As shown in the upper left-hand panel of your next exhibit, investors  appear to have boosted their forecast for the peak federal funds rate from around  3¾ percent as of the last FOMC meeting (the dotted line) to just above 4¼  percent (the solid line) And whereas previously investors had anticipated a  slowing in the pace of tightening this autumn, the steepening visible in the left- hand part of the panel indicates that market participants have significantly raised  their expectations for policy action over the next several months   This revision in near-term policy expectations can be seen even more clearly  in the step-path in the upper right-hand panel, which portrays market  expectations for your actions at each of the four remaining meetings this year,  as given by our reading of fed funds futures quotes  The uptick for the August  meeting from 346 percent to 349 percent indicates that investors have gone  from fairly sure to essentially certain of a 25 basis point move at this meeting   Especially striking are the upward revisions to expectations for the November  and December meetings  Previously, only a very small probability was assigned  to a move in December, but that likelihood has now been marked up to above  50 percent Despite these upward revisions, the 409 percent rate after the  December meeting suggests that investors still see high odds that you will take a  pass at one of the meetings over the balance of the year, most likely in  December     This pattern of expectations is reflected in the Desk’s survey of the 22 primary  dealers As shown in the lower left-hand panel, on average dealers assigned a  93 percent probability to a 25 basis point move at this meeting, 84 percent for  September, and 76 percent for November  For each of those meetings, both no  action and a 50 basis point move were also seen as possibilities, with the  likelihood of a pause still slightly outweighing that of a policy acceleration   As indicated in the middle panel, for today’s meeting, dealers almost  unanimously expect you once again to judge the current stance of policy as  accommodative, to assess the risks as balanced, and to retain the “measured  pace” language   As shown in the right-hand panel, dealers were also surveyed as to their  estimates of the neutral nominal funds rate  Their average estimate of the most  likely neutral nominal federal funds rate—4¼ percent—is consistent with that  suggested by the pattern of money market futures quotes  However, dealers  were also asked about their range of estimates, and the average responses,  indicated by the “low” and “high” entries, suggest a significant degree of  uncertainty Dealers’ average forecast that core PCE inflation will be about 2  percent in mid-2006, not shown, seems to suggest that their 4¼ percent average  estimate for the nominal funds rate translates into roughly a 2¼ percent estimate  for the equilibrium real funds rate                            August 9, 2005 77 of 110  As shown in the top panel of exhibit 3, an equilibrium real federal funds rate  in a range of roughly 2 to 2¼ percent is also consistent with both a range of  model-based staff estimates (the red band) and the Greenbook forecast (the  green dashed line) As indicated in the upper part of the lower panel, the range  of model estimates has narrowed substantially this round  In the June  Bluebook, the right-hand column, the estimates went from 15 percent at the low  end to 28 percent at the high end, but in this Bluebook they are relatively  tightly clustered roughly between 2 to 2¼ percent   The width of the red band, however, should not be interpreted as a confidence  interval Rather, 70 and 90 percent confidence intervals capturing uncertainty  about model specification, coefficients, and the level of potential output are  denoted, as usual, by the dark and light shaded areas in the chart  According to  these rather wide intervals, the real funds rate could already be above its  equilibrium level or remain well below it   Moreover, at least some of these estimates of the equilibrium funds rate are  subject to uncertainty regarding the outlook for a range of exogenous variables   This point is made using a different framework in exhibit 4  This exhibit shows  the results of a benchmark scenario and two alternative scenarios that are  prepared using the version of the FRB/US model with forward-looking  investors and assuming optimizing policymakers whose outlook is similar to the  staff’s The benchmark scenario, denoted by the black lines, captures economic  conditions and inflation pressures as interpreted judgmentally in the Greenbook  and extended through 2012 But in the benchmark scenario as well as the two  alternatives, policymakers pursue an optimal policy rather than following the  funds rate path of the Greenbook or a Taylor rule  Specifically, policymakers  minimize the sum of squared deviations of unemployment from the NAIRU,  deviations of inflation from an assumed 1½ percent target, and changes in the  federal funds rate Under that benchmark scenario, the federal funds rate moves  up gradually to about 4½ percent, a little higher than in the Greenbook, and then  drops back to 4 percent, as core PCE inflation tilts down toward its assumed  target of 1½ percent and the unemployment rate varies narrowly between 5 and  5¼ percent This scenario, by the way, assumes that the currently very low term  premium in bond yields rises gradually, reaching its historical average level in  10 years   The red lines are based on the “stronger demand” scenario that was discussed  in the Greenbook, with personal consumption, residential investment, and  business investment expenditures all considerably stronger than in the baseline  scenario Here, policy tightens much more steeply than in the baseline  And,  with financial markets immediately recognizing both the positive shock to  demand and the resulting tightening of monetary policy, nominal bond yields  promptly jump to about 5¼ percent  As shown in the lower panel, inflation  initially drops below baseline under this scenario because the sharp tightening  of monetary policy induces a substantial appreciation of the dollar and because                                         August 9, 2005 78 of 110  the modest initial decline in unemployment below the NAIRU, the middle  panel, imparts little momentum to inflation   The blue lines in this chart focus on a topical issue—the unusually low term  premium in bond rates  This scenario addresses the question  What would  happen if the term premium jumps 80 basis points, thus reverting immediately  to its historical average? Here, the assumption of forward-looking policymakers  and markets is key  To offset the incipient upward pressure on bond yields  arising from the increased term premium, the Committee eases policy  considerably relative to baseline  Investors see right away that you are, and will  be, taking countervailing action  Consequently, as shown in the upper right- hand panel, the effect of the higher term premium on bond yields is essentially  offset by markets’ correct anticipation that the stance of policy, as gauged by  the nominal funds rate, will be easier over the next 10 years  As shown by the  lower and middle panels, this policy is nearly completely successful in  eliminating the effects of the term premium shock on the real economy and  inflation   Certainly, these alternative simulations contain some extreme elements—the  large shock to aggregate demand in the first, the immediate substantial jump in  the term premium in the second, and the assumption of immediate recognition  of the shocks and a high degree of forward-looking behavior in both  simulations  But they nonetheless illustrate some useful lessons  First, it is easy  to imagine that the economy or financial markets could evolve in such a way as  to require a federal funds rate notably above or below the rather concentrated 4  to 4¼ percent center of gravity that currently seems to be suggested by the R*  measures, fed funds futures, and dealers’ expectations  And the second scenario  in particular suggests the potential value to policymakers of being able to  decompose changes in nominal bond yields into expectation and term-premium  components   Even acknowledging the uncertainties illustrated by these scenarios, though,  the weight of the evidence seems to suggest that monetary policy will need to  firm at least somewhat further in coming months  Accordingly, the Bluebook  once again presented three policy alternatives, summarized in your final exhibit,  that each would involve a further increase in the federal funds rate at this  meeting   As shown in the second column, under alternative A the funds rate would be  boosted a quarter point today, but the language in your announcement would  hint at an imminent downshift in the pace of tightening  With the real funds rate  currently at only about 1¼ percent, it seemed implausible to propose statement  language suggesting that the end of the tightening cycle was just around the  corner; a suggestion of a pause, with further tightenings to come, seemed a bit  more relevant to current circumstances                                          August 9, 2005 79 of 110  At the other end of the spectrum, alternative C, the fourth column, could be   motivated by a sense that the real funds rate is currently well below its   equilibrium, possibly far enough below that an intensification of inflation   pressures could already be in train  To move more rapidly to close the real rate   gap, this alternative would raise the funds rate 50 basis points at this meeting    Moreover, the statement would convey fairly serious concern about both the   strength of aggregate demand and rising cost pressures  With a move of this   size, the Committee would presumably no longer express a view that future   policy moves would occur at a measured pace and might take the opportunity to   eliminate other forward-looking elements of the statement as well    Under alternative B, the Committee would stick with its established program   by firming policy another 25 basis points today, retaining the assessment that   the risks to growth and inflation should be balanced with appropriate policy   action, and reiterating that policy firming likely can continue at a measured   pace However, the proposed language in the “rationale” sentences of the   announcement—those characterizing real activity and inflation—have been   modified significantly  These changes could be read by investors as conveying   a bit more concern about the pace of demand growth and the degree of inflation   pressures than they had expected    In weighing alternative approaches to near-term policy, policymakers as usual   would seem to have to make some key judgments  These include, for example,   whether the staff is correct in its assessments that only a bit of slack remains in   the economy, that current financial conditions are consistent with a near-term   slowing in the growth of aggregate demand to a pace in line with that of the   economy’s potential, and that core PCE inflation will probably remain near 2   percent over the forecast horizon with a continuation of gradual tightening  The   staff could be wrong in those assessments, but if so it will likely have a good   deal of company among financial market participants     That concludes my prepared remarks    I think that would not be notably different from the Greenbook   scenario where essentially we do have the term premium going away but very slowly    Yes    That’s right    Yes, that’s correct    I might add, President Poole, that we do make estimates of the growth rate   of the domestic component as well as the growth rate of the foreign component  According to our   estimates, the deceleration over the past several years has occurred in both components  But we   estimate that growth for the domestic component would be about flat or slightly negative for this year   for the first time in many years—maybe ever—whereas the foreign component, according to our   estimates, has slowed from growth rates of around 9 percent earlier around the turn of the decade to a   little less than 6 percent recently  Of course, these estimates have to be taken with a big grain of salt   for the reason Dino indicated                                    December 13, 2005 9 of 100  2  Mr Chairman, earlier you referred to the comedic talents of my  two colleagues to the right For my part, in drafting the Bluebook over the past week, I  fear that I may have been engaged in tragedy  [Laughter]  That is, there certainly was  drama depicting a protagonist—yours truly—engaging in a significant struggle ending  in ruin or utter disappointment    For the remainder of my remarks, I’ll be referring to the material that was handed   out at the break    Over the intermeeting period, indications of considerable momentum in economic  activity led market participants to build in a little more near-term monetary tightening,  as shown in the upper left-hand panel of exhibit 1  Market participants now appear to  believe that the funds rate will peak at about 4¾ percent in mid-2006 but be rolled back  slightly thereafter  The consensus Blue Chip forecast released on December 1, not  shown, also indicates a median anticipation that about three more quarter-point moves  are in store, but those forecasters don’t have the Committee easing until early 2007     For the near term, as shown in the upper right-hand panel, fed funds futures indicate  that investors are all but certain that you will firm another 25 basis points today  They  see about an 80 percent chance of another such step in January and put better-than-even  odds on one more move in March   And seemingly everyone recognizes that your statement is in play today  The  financial press and market letters in recent days have devoted most of their monetary  policy analysis not to your rate adjustment but to your choice of words  As shown in  the middle left-hand panel, the Desk’s survey indicated that most primary dealers  expect that today you will modify or drop the references to “accommodative” monetary  policy and that half look for the “measured pace” language to be changed or deleted   But there is little indication that market participants anticipate a structural change to  your risk assessment   A case for firming policy today is outlined in the middle right-hand panel    According to staff estimates, the economy appears to have little remaining slack, with    2 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)                            December 13, 2005 63 of 100  the unemployment rate in the vicinity of the NAIRU and real GDP just a fraction of a  percent below the level of its potential Moreover, the economy appears to have  considerable momentum that, without further firming, could carry aggregate demand  beyond the level of potential output Such momentum might be seen as consistent with  a real federal funds rate that is still relatively low  As shown in the lower panel, the  real funds rate is within, but near the lower end of, the range of staff estimates of its  equilibrium  With some of the indirect effects of higher crude and natural gas prices  still in prospect and likely providing some impetus to the inflationary process, you  might be particularly concerned about the implications of resource pressures for  inflation On the whole, though, incoming data over the intermeeting period have  seemed broadly consistent with your earlier expectations that the economy and inflation  would evolve in such a way as to warrant further measured firming  And financial  markets have inferred from those developments and your policy communications that a  quarter-point move today is a sure thing   A more difficult question—one that could bear particularly on your statement this  afternoon—is how much more tightening is likely to prove necessary  Even  recognizing the substantial firming of policy to date as well as the lags in the effects of  policy—an issue flagged by a number of you this morning—you may still believe that  considerable further policy tightening lies ahead  If so, you might be attracted to the  language of the Bluebook’s alternative C, shown in the right-hand column of exhibit 2   In the rationale section, row 2, this announcement would point to vigorous growth in  the real economy and would retain the references to policy accommodation and robust  underlying productivity growth  The recent strength in aggregate demand might  suggest a relatively high level for the equilibrium funds rate and thus imply that policy  remains accommodative  And, certainly, the remarkable figures for the third quarter  could support a judgment that underlying productivity growth remains robust  In row  3, alternative C would point to “relatively high levels of resource utilization” as another  reason for policy firming  In rows 4 and 5, this alternative would retain both the form  and substance of the Committee’s assessment of risks from recent policy statements,  including the judgment that policy accommodation could probably continue to be  removed at a measured pace  Markets would be quite surprised by such an  announcement, and rates would likely back up considerably   If, however, you believe that the end of this tightening cycle is not far off—or if  you simply believe that the time has come to jettison the reference to accommodative  policy and some other stale language—then you may prefer the wording of alternative  B This statement would differ significantly from recent announcements  As shown in  row 2, the Committee would indicate that the expansion appears solid despite the  effects of the hurricanes and high energy prices, while deleting the references to  accommodative policy and underlying productivity growth  In row 3, the statement  would again acknowledge that core inflation has been low of late and that longer-term  inflation expectations remain contained It would express concern, however, that  “possible increases in resource utilization as well as elevated energy prices have the  potential to add to inflation pressures”                         December 13, 2005 64 of 100  The assessment of risks would be modified notably  Rather than making the  arguably tautological assertion that the risks appear balanced assuming “appropriate  monetary policy,” it would indicate that the “Committee judges that some further  measured policy firming is likely to be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of  both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance”  I emphasize  “measured” because views on the Committee regarding the inclusion of this word  clearly vary As a staff memorandum indicated last week, the Chairman requests that  in your comments in the upcoming round you express your preferences on this score   In your consideration of this matter, you might see “measured” as representing a  needless restraint on your possible actions  But, as shown in row 5, the Committee  would in effect also indicate that—as has always been the case—the risk assessment is  not a commitment but a conditional expectation and that, should incoming data diverge  from expectations, the Committee would commensurately recalibrate its actual and  anticipated actions Moreover, you might see little prospect that policy will actually  need to move in 50 basis point steps but be concerned that, if the Committee were to  drop the word now, especially in the context of the other proposed changes to the  statement, market participants could conclude that you saw the potential need for such  large moves     One factor that could influence the Committee’s decision about the new  assessment-of-risks language is whether you anticipate any problem adjusting that  language as circumstances evolve in coming months  This appears unlikely to be a  major problem  If, contrary to current expectations, more aggressive policy tightening  comes to appear appropriate, the Committee could change the reference in row 4 to  something like “considerable further tightening”  Or, should the end point seem to  move out in time a little, the Committee could simply repeat the proposed assessment   And, finally, if and when it appears that policy has reached a resting point, the  Committee could firm a final 25 basis points and change row 4 to something like the  following “Under these circumstances, the Committee judges that the current stance of  policy roughly balances the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth  and price stability” And at that point the “measured” terminology could be honorably  discharged from service   Given the large number of changes in the announcement proposed for alternative B,  it is difficult to be confident in anticipating the market reaction that it would engender   Indeed, investors also seem to be rather uncertain about the market effect of this  afternoon’s announcement, but markets are striving for completeness by offering  insurance on the direct effect of your imminent policy action  Specifically, an option is  being traded on the change in the 10-year Treasury yield in a two-hour window around  your announcement today  The pricing of that option suggests a one-third probability  that the 10-year yield will move one way or another by more than 43 basis points   [Laughter] For our part, the staff’s guess is that the announcement proposed for  alternative B would likely boost interest rates, but not by much   Finally, let me say a word about procedure  As you will recall, the survey of the  FOMC that the staff conducted last month regarding statement language included,                                               December 13, 2005 65 of 100  among other things, questions on the scope of the Committee’s policy vote—that is,  whether the Committee should vote on just the directive and the risk assessment, or  whether the vote should be expanded to cover all forward-looking elements or the  entire statement  In preparation for a possible change, Chairman Greenspan has asked  the staff to provide to the Committee early next year a memorandum that will discuss  the pros and cons of alternative approaches to this issue      Thank you That concludes my prepared remarks    I expected no less  [Laughter]
