7217,2003-12-09,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Overall for the current quarter economic   conditions have continued to improve in the Ninth District  This improvement is attributable   primarily to continued strength in residential real estate markets, an uptick in manufacturing, a   modest increase in consumption, and an improved agricultural picture  Other sectors—including   commercial real estate, mining, and energy—are holding steady  There are no reports of   significant increases in prices or wages  I’ll have a little more to say about wages and prices in a   minute, but first and perhaps most important, it appears that labor markets have stabilized  One   of our Minnesota directors noted recently that for the first time in a number of months none of   his contacts had plans to decrease jobs at their companies  He did add, however, that employers   he spoke with were still cautious about hiring additional employees    Next week we’ll announce the results of our annual Ninth District business survey    Preliminary results show that 34 percent of the respondents expect to increase employment at   their firms in 2004, whereas 16 percent plan to reduce jobs over the coming year  If the stories   we’re hearing from our directors are any indication, some of the job losses will be due to   outsourcing and the movement of operations overseas   Other anecdotal information we’ve received lately reflects a similar moderately   optimistic tone  For example, business conditions in the information technology sector are   reportedly improving, albeit slowly  And some business expansion was noted, including by a   telecommunications firm in southwestern Wisconsin and a window manufacturer in Minnesota    Agricultural conditions appear favorable, with a solid grain harvest and high cattle prices   bringing mostly good news from our Agricultural Advisory Council—a relatively rare event    December 9, 2003 63 of 133    According to our advisers, this good news for agricultural producers is creating positive spillover   effects in rural communities   Returning to the question of wage and price increases, according to our recent business   poll, almost 80 percent of respondents expect wages at businesses in their communities to   increase between 2 and 3 percent  Only 4 percent of the respondents predict that wages will   grow 4 percent or more  At the same time, respondents report significant productivity increases   this year and plan to increase capital investment in 2004  Lastly, more than half the respondents   predict that prices for their products and services will remain unchanged, whereas 30 percent   expect price increases next year     Turning to the national outlook, there are many indications that the solid expansion will   continue over the next several quarters  Firms are hiring again, payroll employment has   increased in each of the past four months, and hours worked are up sharply  Initial claims for   employment benefits have been generally declining, and the unemployment rate has fallen   slightly  The weak manufacturing sector appears to be turning up  While consumer spending   has slowed, data on orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods indicate that last quarter’s   rebound in business spending on equipment and software is continuing into the current quarter    Further, residential construction continues to be quite strong  There are also indications that real   growth in foreign economies is picking up, which should improve exports     We are optimistic about the performance of the real economy next year, but we’re not   quite as optimistic as the Greenbook  Moreover, we see weaker growth in employment and   hours worked and stronger growth in productivity next year than the Board staff does  With   respect to inflation, we’re also somewhat less optimistic than the Greenbook  We see headline   rates of inflation either unchanged or modestly higher over the next few quarters  This view is   December 9, 2003 64 of 133    based both on our models and on recent movements in market interest rates  We see core   inflation rates remaining roughly at current levels  Thank you    Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  The proposed language   captures our view of the impact of recent developments and, as you have outlined, preserves   policy flexibility  "
8589,2009-09-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me first address the District outlook    Consistent with the incoming national data, the Ninth District economy is showing some signs of   improvement  For instance, survey data indicate that manufacturing activity in the Dakotas has   increased and has remained steady in Minnesota  We are seeing a modest, but nevertheless   perceptible, increase in anecdotal reports of businesses’ plans to expand production  Activity in   the energy and mining sectors of the District economy is also showing a slight increase    Exploration activity is up somewhat, and there are scattered reports of plans to restart idle   production and expand facilities For example, a large iron ore mine in northern Minnesota has   resumed production  The health-care sector appears to have weathered the recession relatively   well Residential construction activity appears to have stabilized, albeit at low levels  While the        September 22–23, 2009 105 of 212  results vary across the District, we are now seeing some improvement in the level of home sales   in various metropolitan areas Commercial real estate, in contrast, continues to be weak    Commercial real estate markets have been depressed by a combination of lower economic   activity, rising vacancy rates, tighter credit conditions, and rapidly falling property values  On   the flip side, lower rental rates should help the profitability of businesses that need space   Despite the recent improvement in the national data, District consumer spending has been   soft, with the exception of auto sales, which have been buoyed by the “cash-for-clunkers”   program  Anecdotal reports on same-store retail sales indicate declines of 4 to 8 percent   compared with a year ago  Across the District, our contacts report that while the number of   tourists has increased, the level of tourism-related spending remains somewhat soft relative to   prior norms  In agriculture, crop development is about two weeks behind normal due to late   planting and a cool summer  An early frost could significantly reduce production, which would   negatively affect food processors, ethanol plants, and ranchers  Unemployment levels across the   District, from Minnesota to Montana, remain low compared with the national average, with the   most recent readings from 43 percent in North Dakota to 8 percent in Minnesota   Turning to the national economy, most of the incoming data remain consistent with our   forecast of a near-term increase in output and subdued inflation  A reduction in the rate of   business inventory liquidation, firming of consumer spending, and some growth in federal   spending should support the resumption of economic growth during the remainder of the year    Developments since the last meeting have served to reinforce this view  The August uptick in   retail sales, data on orders and shipments of capital goods, business sentiment, and the rise in   sales and starts of single-family homes, are all consistent with improvement in the level of           September 22–23, 2009 106 of 212  economic activity  The gradual reduction of the adverse impacts of declines in wealth should   also support a rise in consumer spending   As President Stern noted in August, our forecast in recent months has been for a bit more   rapid growth than in the prior Greenbook Given the markup in the Greenbook forecast since the   last meeting, our forecast and that of the Greenbook are now more closely aligned  While the   outlook has improved since the last meeting, in my view the principal risks to our forecast are to   the downside Going forward, the expiration of some of the government programs that have   been providing support to the economy creates uncertainty in the outlook  Moreover, beyond the   third quarter, the ongoing weakness in labor markets, particularly the very low rate of gross   hiring by private firms, raises questions about where household earnings growth will come from   and where workers, who are no longer building houses, strip malls, and SUVs, will be   reemployed  Prolonged uncertainty about job prospects and tight consumer credit markets could   lead consumers to reverse course and cut spending this year or next, and this, in turn, could feed   another round of production and inventory cuts  While I believe that these risks can be avoided,   I will feel significantly more confident in this view with a few more months of positive   developments   Consistent with the Greenbook forecast, I expect improvements in employment will be   gradual, and I believe that this is the inevitable byproduct of a necessary process of resource   reallocation  As such, I believe that, at least to some extent, we must be prepared simply to   allow this process to unfold, recognizing that it may not be particularly responsive to incremental   additional stimulus  Despite the improved outlook for economic activity, I expect inflation   expectations to remain well anchored and agree with the Greenbook forecast that inflation will   remain within acceptable bounds  Thank you     September 22–23, 2009 107 of 212  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also favor alternative B  Although the recent   data have generally surprised on the upside, I’m hesitant to place too much emphasis on one or   two months’ worth of data  We have been unpleasantly surprised several times in the last two   years, and in part, as a result, I’m disinclined to change policy quite yet   I think that market expectations are particularly important at times like these, and I place   a fair amount of weight on the fact that alternative B is most closely aligned with existing market   expectations In this regard, while I prefer the retention of the “up to” language due to its   consistency with prior statements, I would not object to the removal of this language               September 22–23, 2009 166 of 212  The tapering strategy for the purchases of agency MBS and agency debt specified in   alternative B strikes me as prudent and appropriate  I support ending these purchases in the first   quarter of next year Based on Brian’s presentation yesterday, I don’t see the need or the   justification to extend them further   Given that neither inflation nor inflation expectations have increased, worries about the   size of our balance sheet seem to me to be premature  In my view, we have viable exit strategies   available that we can implement as conditions warrant  Thank you  "
