  Might I ask the Secretary a question, Mr Chairman?  In some of the  segregable facts, such as one to the plaintiff, there are included factual statements [For  example,] the German Central Bank was intervening in modest amounts--it’s certainly a factual  statement  Did the Committee staff ascertain whether that was a fact still being held as  confidential by the foreign central banks?     As to whether or not it was already a matter of, I’ll say, general  knowledge, of public--     That’s all I wanted to know  And in each case it was     Thank you  And none of that [unintelligible] so all that is stuff that the  New York Bank staff regards as already in the public domain with respect to foreign central bank  intervention     Well, did you leave [in the memorandum] any [information] that the  New York staff did not think was in the public domain?     Yes     Mr Chairman, I have been mulling over that question ever since the  Committee had that preliminary discussion at its last meeting, and [I have been] trying to benefit  from the comments that had been made to me by members of the Committee as to their  questions, their aspirations, their understanding, and their own preferences  Taking all that into  account, along with the actual contents of the report of my subcommittee, I believe I’d  recommend that this Committee end today’s discussion [by voting to take] three concrete  actions    [First,] beginning with the preparation for the next meeting of the FOMC, that we replace  RPD [reserves available to support private nonbank deposits] with nonborrowed reserves  wherever RPD appears in the materials prepared for the FOMC--that is, in the specification  sheet, the Bluebook, the Manager’s report, and the Record of Policy Actions  I believe RPD is  non-operational, and I believe we are at a stage where we can fairly replace it with nonborrowed  reserves  And [we could] say, if we need to, in a brief public announcement, that the operating  reserve measure we want the Manager [of the System Open Market Account] to take account of  henceforth is nonborrowed reserves, not RPD  That leaves for later--     I suspect that is correct     In saying this, I am deliberately leaving our subcommittee’s separable  second decision to whenever the Committee feels comfortable [with it] [That is] to begin putting  more weight on the operating reserve measure, in this case nonborrowed reserves, letting the  [federal] funds rate work as a constraint, as outlined by the subcommittee I believe that is a  second and separable decision that this Committee can reach when it feels comfortable with it  If  it feels comfortable with it today, grand, but my impression is that you can benefit from a little  more thinking and, indeed, experience     To come as close as one can to get experience with that, my second recommendation  would be that the Committee tell its staff that, in all the materials it prepares for the FOMC, it  should supply the information that would enable the FOMC to actually use nonborrowed  reserves and the related analytical techniques, as recommended by our subcommittee  That is, in  the Bluebook, in the Greenbook, in the Manager’s reports and the Record of Policy Actions  drafts, there would be information provided concerning nonborrowed reserves and its relation to  the monetary aggregates and in relation to the fundamental economic variables     I’d extend that even to the Manager’s weekly and monthly reports, where he would  [explain how he would] have operated if nonborrowed reserves had indeed been his primary  target since the last meeting and what he thinks might have happened to money market  conditions had he followed that  That is as close to a hands-on experiment as this Committee can  get  And for a number of months now, he has been including in the reports [from] the Desk a  paragraph that tries to do this  It may or may not have caught your attention, but this  [recommendation] would urge him to include even a little more amplified description of that and  would urge each member of the Committee to give that serious attention so that, as you come to  each meeting of the Committee, you can decide whether you are prepared to put more emphasis  on [nonborrowed] reserves as an operating target     Third, I’d suggest that you encourage the staff to continue exploring some of these newer  techniques for judging the interaction of monetary magnitudes, interest rates, and economic  variables and [ask the staff] to report to you occasionally on their findings  This whole body of  research--which academics have rather idealistically labeled optimal control theory--is, as has  often been said at this table, not yet a workable scheme of things, but I believe it can provide  insights in the months and years ahead that would be useful to this Committee    Finally, I hope you will tell my subcommittee to just keep working away to finish the rest  of its assignment  We are a good bit through but not entirely through, so that’s in effect a four- part recommendation     Good--so the other three recommendations--     I thought about that  The reason I didn’t recommend it is that I think  the Committee would be badly served if its only announced operating target was a federal funds  rate--that it is a matter of prudence--     I stand on what I said--I think it is, in practice, our only operating  target, and we need to have a structure that has a reserve measure in it that is workable and that  the Committee can work towards     I am trying to come as close to that as I can without the Committee  doing it--so that the Committee can have the benefit of as close to an online experiment as  possible without committing itself until it feels comfortable doing so     If it’s that many pages, it’s probably the staff supporting document     The results are weak--     No, Jack, don’t you want to answer that question the other way around?   This 1975 was a year in which the Desk probably placed more weight on the federal funds rate  than it would under the proposed technique, and therefore you did more to allow reserves to  move around, because of your federal funds constraint, than would be implied by the Committee  [directive], and that if the Manager were targeting on one of these measures, probably interest  rates would bounce more, but these relationships would be tighter  Have I said that correctly?     If I may Mr Chairman, I think there are a couple of perspectives in  regard to this discussion  One is that no short-run or immediate operating target that we have  been able to conceive and test has anything other than wide ranges of error  [We have] an  inability to hit M1 with any short-run target or indeed in its relationship with the fundamental  economic objectives of employment and prices  They all have major variances, major errors  associated with them  We’re dealing with a set of very imperfect relationships as tested  statistically  We each have our own judgmental impressions of how those go and how those  change  Those, too, I think most of us would say, have turned out in our own experiences to be  pretty loose     So we’re dealing with an imperfect mechanism with a lot of slippages  I think that such  work as the subcommittee has done has suggested that if we stick to one of these things month  after month, the errors gradually start to offset each other and you tend to settle down a bit over  the longer run  And that’s something of what underlies Steve’s comment that over a span of  months, he thinks he could come reasonably close to it     I think there’s another consideration at some stage in our discussion,  and before we’re under the Government in the Sunshine [law], so, Art, I’m not in the minutes at  this point here  [I] thought this could be said [just] across the table  You’ll recognize there’s a  place or two in our subcommittee report where we said that some of the desired results in terms  of aggregates could probably be gotten using either a reserve operating target or a federal funds  operating target  Theoretically we could get the kind of results to which the Committee aspired  with either one of those two alternative operating mechanisms  One of the main reasons we  opted for nonborrowed reserves instead of federal funds as a short-range target was a reason that  can only be called a matter of political science and not economics  Secondly, when it comes to  describing the ultimate target--     Well, I was going to come to that in a minute  And I was going to say  there is also [an option] in terms of whether or not we specify our long-run objectives [in terms  of] income and employment, and price increases The reasons why this report opts not to do  those are reasons rooted as much or more in political science as in economics  The reason on the  short-run side, the political science reasons for not naming the federal funds rate as our exclusive  operating target are two, fundamentally, I think     One is, we felt the System would occasionally be [beset], if it so overtly accepted the  responsibility for hitting an interest rate--for setting an interest rate, if you will, and for setting  the federal funds rate that is recognized as a key in the whole interest rate framework  An  interest rate setting is a kind of lightning rod in terms of some of the public discussion about  monetary policy, and its problems and its consequences, and we would simply increase the  chances for involving this Committee and the Federal Reserve [unintelligible] if we had an  interest rate operating target  That’s one of the reasons we thought it was wise to keep a reserve  target in place for use by the Committee in order not to be so closely associated with a particular  interest rate target     Well, I think there’s been kind of an evolution over the past few years   But I would say that, in the last year or two, we have basically been moving the funds rate  around in the interest of trying to generate monetary aggregate results we were satisfied with,  subject to a constraint on the amount of interest rate change we’d make in any short-run period   What we published doesn’t say that quite that clearly, but I could say in practice that’s what  we’ve been moving toward  And I think it would be desirable to keep a reserve target--a short- run reserve target--in the picture in order to stay away from naming a short-run interest rate  target so overtly as the System’s objective     3/29/76 - 24 -      No, no  There would be a federal funds range under the  subcommittee’s proposal, and it’s a range that starts out being plus or minus 1 percent but within  which the funds rate might move  We suggested a quarter percent a week--that’s not much  different than the pace of change we’ve had at times in the past  So we weren’t going to cut it  out differently, although we did contemplate that experience might lead us to widen that federal  funds range a little bit  We also contemplated that there might be times when the Committee  would be concerned with the money market and it wouldn’t want that range to be that way, and  we felt that the controlled procedure we specify allows for that too  But we thought in general  that it would be wiser--safer, if you will--for the Committee to have something besides an  interest rate as a short-range operating target  And, indeed, I think the Committee itself has often  times reflected that same kind of attitude     Definitely     It wouldn’t differ very much, I mean, except we would be missing  nonborrowed reserves instead of RPD  The Committee would have, however, I think added  [unintelligible] hand to you     Well, now it’s a little worse than that, Mr Chairman  RPD is non- operational, but it is very existent in our records, in our policy statements     Well, I think you’re thinking in terms of operational results, Mr  Chairman, and I’m trying to think of two things one, operational significance, and second, sort     3/29/76 - 25 -    of public significance  RPD is still playing a public role  It provides a complement to the funds  rate so we don’t appear to be aiming exclusively at the funds rate     That’s true  Now what the subcommittee is recommending is that the  Committee work toward the time when it can tell its Manager, pay some attention to  nonborrowed reserves  So the subcommittee clearly wants that to happen and the only question  about how soon it tells him to start paying attention to it is a question of the Committee’s own  learning period     Operationally--I think we might be a little slower to get to the time  when we actually do it--we said something like that to the Manager last summer  We said to the  staff, we’ll keep track of nonborrowed reserves and see how it goes--and I believe the  Committee’s members really had not done that, that we need to do a little more  Press the  Committee a little more to raise its attention to nonborrowed reserves so it gets comfortable  enough with the magnitude and what it does so it can make a decision on it  That’s answer  number one     Number two, in the public arena, I think that it would be unfortunate if the Committee  dropped a reference--any reference--to a short-term reserve target, so that the only short-term  operating target we were then publishing was a federal funds target  That makes us an interest  rate [targeter]     I believe it could publish a nonborrowed reserves figure and----to the  extent that the Committee directs the Manager to give weight to an operating reserve measure in  its day-to-day operations--say to the public that this is the operating reserves measure that we are  going to tell him to pay attention to     I think what we need a little more of is the Committee getting used to  nonborrowed reserves     Because I think that over the last six months we’ve demonstrated  that  [nonborrowed reserves] has to [be] pushed harder on the [thinking of] Committee members than  it has to date for them to acquire that kind of feeling and comfort with it and that kind of  awareness of some of its strengths and some of its weakness     If I have misread the willingness of the Committee to pledge allegiance  to nonborrowed reserves, I retreat, but I don’t think I have, and I believe the Committee will  move in that direction better if it, in effect, puts it in place  And I believe that if it doesn’t put it  in place now, it is going to be more awkward for us, distinctly more awkward for us, to do so as  time goes on     But that’s kind of calling nothing something, I think, Alan  I think the  Committee--     No, I mean there wouldn’t be anything at all in the Committee’s  specifications in that sense  But suggesting a reserve aggregate that the Committee was tracking  and following along--it seems to me that is of underlying help, underlying value to the  Committee     No, no, Mr Chairman I said [unintelligible] and have it up, so as soon  as the Committee is ready to pledge allegiance to it, its results are there  And in the meantime,  the Committee can follow how Alan’s reports say he would have used it, and they can see what  the staff would serve up     I see no distinction, Mr Chairman--or, if you’re drawing a distinction, I  miss it--between what I was suggesting that Alan do in terms of keeping track of how he would  operate and what the results might be, and what you’re implying when you say simulate  I think  the intellectual operation comes to the same thing     The reason is--what we’re struggling with--is trying to find ways to  make this Committee feel as sure as it’s likely to be able to feel in a highly uncertain world of  what’s going to happen before it makes that decision to change the emphasis that it has now  come to place on federal funds and shift it instead in the direction of a short-term aggregate  reserve target     Neither does short-term interest--neither does the funds rate as a guide     No, I don’t think that would be true if you ran through all the evidence     3/29/76 - 29 -      I don’t think there’s any question, John, that that’s the way the results  would come out  There is a lot of noise in the month-to-month bounces that smooth out a bit  over some span of time Whatever operating instrument you’re talking about has a lot more  short-run noise than long-run persisting influence  Henry is harking at something that I meant to  be subsuming under my comments about political science reasons for talking about a reserve  target as well as a federal funds rate target  I believe myself, from sitting and watching this  Committee in years past, that when the federal funds rate was its predominant operating target,  you could pick critical points when that has led the Committee to be too slow and too late in  making its major cyclical adjustments in monetary policy       No, that’s an expression of judgment  Because it’s not the kind of thing  you can empirically test, or run against an equation  That’s another way of saying the same kind  of thing Henry’s trying to say  And it is one of the things that led me and, I believe, other  members of the subcommittee to urge that a reserve operating instrument be available to the  Committee as well as a funds rate--because of that pattern back over time     No     Would the mechanism put in place by the Committee--     The FOMC could occasionally vote to narrow its range, it could vote its  federal funds rate ranges and it could widen them     Yes, we’d be having a number of meetings to deal with the  inconsistencies in the specifications, undoubtedly, but the Committee could do that     I’m conditioned very much on this recommendation by two underlying things  One, time  and again, this Committee is going to have to reach mental compromises on how it feels about  what’s happening in the aggregates and how it feels about what’s happening to interest rates and  attach a relative weight in terms of those two effects on the real economy  We’ve done it in the  past and we’re going to have to do it in the future  It seems to me to be as clear as can be that  that’s going to happen, and we need to be using a mechanism that the Committee can work with  as sometimes [the Committee] accentuates one and sometimes the other  I believe this  mechanism we’re suggesting to the Committee lends itself better to that than the mechanism we  have now     Second, when the Committee is making mistakes, I believe the mechanism our  subcommittee is suggesting will work a little better than the mechanism we have now or the  mechanism we’ve had in the past  If the Committee always has everything figured out, then it  doesn’t make any difference which variable you start with because you’ll have the linkages  figured out, and you’ll get the right results  The real critical--     Well, luck has saved us more than once, and I hope she does again   One of the critical points of distinction [between mechanisms] comes when the Committee is  wrong and the real economy is doing something and the financial system is doing something  different from what this Committee has foreseen, what it wants, and what its staff projections  suggest ought to happen  When you have that kind of error developing, I believe the kind of  technique the subcommittee is putting forward to the Committee will surface that error for the  Committee’s attention a little sooner and a little more closely than the mechanism we’re using  now     The subcommittee has been unable to produce objective empirical  evidence on that, Willis  That’s one to which we hope to turn  At the moment, we’re operating  under conviction, personal conviction, that too much short-term bounce in interest rates hurts     Well, I regret your removing RPD and not putting nonborrowed  reserves in its place  I think the Committee is going to suffer from that vacancy because I think  it’s hard enough for the Committee to move ahead as it is without taking that  And I’m afraid  you’ll produce a little public reaction to the fact that we are now not using reserves in any way as  an operating instrument     I think it’s only [with regard to] the market participants that you can use  the verb “know”     No, I think the Committee would pay a little more attention if it is  bumped again, that’s true  But my larger concern is that how we may appear to outside groups     No, I think that’s true  I think we could also ask the staff to do a quick  review of what Alan has said in that fashion in the last eight or 10 months or so that he’s been  sticking a word or two in his report  And you can get a chance to see how his observations  accumulated over a number of months, which might be helpful      Well, as a nag about our debts on the swap line drawings, I am pleased  enough with the progress on the Belgian side to be glad to move its renewal  And I’m happy I  won’t be here to have to move the umpteenth renewal of the Swiss one     Mr Chairman, may I just say that Peter’s playing “what might have  been” is a hard game, and I thought you made a valiant effort to try to relive that span with  another life  I think as you keep at it and put it down, it may fall into a better shape     I would say I believe it’s going to [require] looking back over more than one episode,  probably several episodes in a row  Then we will begin to see whether, on balance, that world of  “what might have been” has a real meaningful attraction to the Committee  One of the things it’s  bound to produce are [periods] when one of our specifications or one of our instruments is a bit  out of sync with the others, that’s one of the things that evidence has made very clear, and I think  it will take several episodes to put it in the proper perspective     Well, I think that over this past year the Committee and the Chairman  have converted these long-range target ranges--which we [resisted] a bit when they first got  introduced--into an extraordinarily helpful communications device, certainly to the public and  even occasionally to ourselves  And I think this is one of those occasions when they can serve  that kind of purpose     I think it’s time to work down the upper end of those ranges a bit  I believe this is a time,  monetarily, for a sort of a stitch-in-time action on the part of the FOMC because economic  activity is moving up now into new high ground  And we need to begin to try to adjust to a  further gradual reduction in unemployment and hopefully gradually further iron out that  inflationary bulge  I don’t think we ought to aspire to accommodate the usual cyclical     4/20/76 - 27 -           expansion  We’re still, I believe, afflicted with more fundamental problems that we need to keep  working away at, and it seems to me that working down the top end of the ranges for M1 and M2  makes good sense     I could be talked into working down the top end of the range for M3, but I think there’s a  good case for leaving it there as well  And I point out to you that we do have also a long-range  target, I think, in the credit proxy, and we aren’t lowering that either  Now, there’s a similarity  here that’s saying, in effect, that the big difference between a credit proxy and M2 is big CDs at  commercial banks  S&Ls don’t have any big CDs     So what, in effect, we’re suggesting with the credit proxy staying unchanged, as I think it  should, and M3 staying unchanged is that we expect the total liabilities of both the banking  system and the nonbank thrift institutions to continue to rise in about the range we’ve specified  before  And I think there’s a little harmony in that it has an economic logic all its own  If we  start to get some other kind of firming in credit demand that the staff expects, I think that we’ll  probably see a little bit of life come up in big CD expansion, and that will at the same time make  banks a little more acquiescent in a touch softer performance in their other M2 liabilities     I’d like to see the ranges narrowed  I think we widened them when we were uncertain, but  I think on balance it makes sense for them to be a little narrower  This is always a sort of  balancing act between making them wide enough so we don’t ever get caught off base and  making them narrow enough to be reasonable targets  And it seems to me [that making them] a  bit narrower than we now have is a good idea     Finally, I should just as a grace note say I like what I heard Chuck say about the  relationship of second-quarter projections to year[-long] projections  I think that’s just the right  way to look at it  Thank you     I think I am  In pouring over the numbers, I think that’s the right way  to come out     4/20/76 - 28 -             I don’t think you’d better, Mr Chairman  I think I’d better pass  I’ll  gladly pass on my information to the staff, and you can consume it indirectly     Well, may I just interject one more--I agree we ought to get to where  we’re publishing them, but I believe it wouldn’t be a good idea for the Committee to simply vote  on them today and put them out in the form [in which they appear] in that specification sheet     I believe the right vehicle for conveying these in public form is to fold them into the  language of the directive, and I assume that most members of the Committee would like to see  how they would appear, folded into that directive, before they decided to do it  I make that  suggestion for two reasons  One, I believe it’s only when you wrap a few words around those  numbers that they have some of the protection that--      Well, Chuck, I’ll come to that in a minute  I’m trying to think now  about the specification sheet  The specification sheet is not a good vehicle for release in my  judgment because it’s too bold, it’s too bald  They are simply numbers and have none of the  qualifications around them that appear in the language that is used in the Record of Policy  Actions entry  However, you could pick up the language in the policy record entry that is now     4/20/76 - 34 -           used there, marry it right with the directive  The staff has already done experiments in that  fashion and produced, I think, an acceptable kind of version     Now, the reason against voting and then just telling the staff to put them into the policy  record entry is, I believe, a reason that looks forward to the kinds of pressure this Committee  may be under from courts and from the citizenry in terms of making information available   Formal vote information may indeed be pried out of you at some stage sooner than the reasons   And it is the development of the reasons and the background that make the policy record late--in  terms of 30 or 45 days, whatever the Committee decides to do  Therefore, it seems to me, the  Committee would be well advised to adopt these numbers in a form where it would not feel  embarrassed or open to misinterpretation if indeed they were pried out of us on the very  afternoon of the meeting  By folding them into the Record of Policy Actions, the language  would be acceptable     Yes     As I recall, we asked the Archives people once how many came in, and  you could count on the fingers of one hand the number for one year, and that included college  students--     Could I try that suggestion another way?  It seems to me you could  make a case for incorporating the Record of Policy Actions entry by reference into the Minutes  of Actions at such time as the policy record entry was ready  The two [the Minutes of Actions  and the Record of Policy Actions] have different preparation schedules, and because they have  different times of preparation, that means they have different dates of exposure to appeal under  the Freedom of Information Act, and even more under the [proposed] Government in the  Sunshine Act  Regularly the policy record entry would be ready later than the kind of thing in  the Minutes of Actions  But I see no reason why the Minutes of Actions couldn’t incorporate as  an appendix or by record the policy record entry for that action and thereby become a consistent  holdover time  At the same time offering--     No, the other way around     The other way around     Yes, so you have one record, and I believe that would conform with the  chronology of when the staff would finish it     But Ernie, I don’t believe that’s according to the statute  That is, I think  the timing for release, under the Freedom of Information Act, of each decision has to be justified  in terms of the content of each decision, so that for the minutes--the approval of the minutes at a  meeting or the setting of the date of the next meeting has--once you take that decision at this     4/20/76 - 64 -           table, it has its own discipline under the Freedom of Information Act as to when that must be  made public     After signing some of the affidavits I’ve had to sign as to what this  Committee does and doesn’t do, and listen to some of the trouble that Art and Tom have been  through, to me it’s very clear that courts are going to be inclined, at least the kind of court we’re  up against, are going to be inclined on these issues not to regard documents as a whole, but to tell     4/20/76 - 65 -           us to reach into them and pick out what can be available on the shorter time schedule  And I  think they do that to us in terms of all the product of this Committee     It seems to me, therefore, that it’s very wise to keep the Record of Policy Actions entry  separate, albeit attached as an appendix when it’s finally produced  Because that is the one thing  [that] takes some time to work up  It is something which I think we can plausibly maintain and  needs to be reviewed and acted on by the Committee because it’s an endeavor to create--not  something they’ve said here word for word at the table, but a synthesis of views  I think it’s  most likely to be recognized by courts as something that should come back to this Committee at  its next meeting to look over and say okay, and not until then does that exist as an official  document  Before that, it’s staff’s surmise, you know  If we keep that document just that way, it  seems to me, that kind of delay is likely to be more defensible than if we put anything else in it   And I think we can then afford to put all the rest of the stuff in the separate minutes to which this  might later be appendixed      And if worse comes to worst, the court might force us to release our directive the same  afternoon  As it’s now constituted, I believe the proposal before us would even admit to that  without being a body blow to this Committee  That is, that the directives as they are now worded  are qualitative and mellifluous, you know--don’t exactly tell where the funds rate’s going to go   You know, we can honestly say, that is what the Committee adopted today  The Record of  Policy Actions entry comes along 30 days later and provides the background, and I think that’s  the situation in which the Committee might find itself reasonably well postured before a court  It  leaves no role for the Minutes of Actions, which I agree aren’t full enough to satisfy Government  in the Sunshine but are full enough to be catnip under the Freedom of Information Act  It looks  to me like they’ve outlived their usefulness     There’s a possibility, Ernie, that they might rip that out of us too  If  they do, I don’t even think that is an impossible final adjustment to make  That means, taking  what’s now the specification sheet and putting all those numbers with a few qualifying and  modifying words around them in the directive, as we were talking about this morning, and letting  that go out and then putting all the expanded reasoning and discussion of the economic situation  out in the Record of Policy Actions entry later     You may not want to start with that at the moment, but I think that even if you get driven  to that, it is not an impossible world to live in, particularly if the Committee expresses its  operating instruments--if you forgive the plug--in terms of reserve objectives with a federal  funds range  So the market doesn’t get a federal funds target that the Committee is aiming at but  rather a range within which open market operations are supposed to live       I think the Committee should be prepared to hear a complaint from an  occasional economic historian  This Committee had a consultant group of economic historians a  number of years ago to look into this and they praised the fullness of this Memorandum of  Discussion  It is well nigh unique in the annals of government  But they themselves used it only  very rarely, and that’s kind of a small voice, and I believe what we’re facing here is an issue of,  in effect, current information against the matter of [unintelligible]  An expanded Record of  Policy Actions I believe is sufficient     Yes, that’s right     Their report to this Committee was, wait longer and put out more  And  I believe that that is literally outdated in terms of the sense of public purpose that’s in the country  today, and we have to recognize it     I think that was after my time when you started raising that question     I shall make provisions for it   SPEAKER(?)  I nominate George Garvey     I recommend the Chairman sample his consensus in whatever way he  can for a vote     I don’t think there’s any question but what we get some market  advantages in terms of working this around one way or another  But it also has to be done for  reasons that are plausible to the court, I think, given the kind of stuff we’re up against  We  haven’t been very successful thus far in persuading the court that it should account for market  disruption [arising from] information that is a few days earlier or a few days later  They have,  however, seemed to be quite willing to accept the argument [that the information should be  released] as soon as it was ready  And if Mr Broida is as artful as usual, it will get ready by the  time, I imagine, for the Committee to approve it at the meeting, [get it] assembled, and get it out  a day or two after
