1842,1981-07-06," Not quite yet, just having come in last week  Well, having been in the chair about three or four days, I'm sure you can appreciate that my impressions and opinions are rather freshly minted But I must say, reading the forecast and hearing it today, that I find it exceptionally gloomy; the figures we submitted were slightly on the more optimistic side But as I relate this to the individual industries in our area--and I think you have heard in the past that some of our industries are indeed troubled, and certainly since the last meeting, if anything, they have deteriorated further--I really end up not finding any particular disagreement with the way the forecast looks  But just to add a comment to what Lyle said earlier, there is a growing impatience, if you will, in our area about the high level of rates Many of our industries which are troubled now really are imperilled by the high level of rates Though our board, for example, understands the need for this, they are taking the view that at some point we have to bring rates down or we're going to cause some very significant problems with some basic industries in our area On a lighter note, at our board meeting a week or so ago at which we discussed the discount rate, there was a comment--more in desperation than I think as a serious comment--that we should recommend a reduction in the discount rate of about 4 percentage points But in thinking about that, it did occur to our directors that if I walked in for my first meeting with that kind of suggestion, you might really look up to see what just came in the door! I did want to report, however, that the interest rate scenario is of increasing concern and is increasingly worrying the people in the Middle West  Well, I'd best be brief! With regard to 1981, it seems to me that from the earlier discussion, we're clearly in a learning phase [regarding the relationship] between M-1B and M2 And  -58-    7/6-7/81  until we learn more about the downward shifts, it's awfully hard to be precise To change either range at this point implies a greater degree of precision than may perhaps be the case I don't see how we can logically change one without the other Being new to this, I think the outside perception is that the actual results count much more than how they actually relate to our ranges So, I'd be in favor of not making any change at this point  With regard to 1982, it seems to me that a great deal has already been accomplished and that for all the reasons that have been stated we will have lost a great deal if we do not continue the downward shift The visibility of reducing the numbers somewhat has a great positive effect Therefore, I'd be in favor of alternative I for M-1B but would leave the other ranges where they currently are for fear that if we raise them at all, it would have a negative market reaction  Well, for the reasons that have been reasonably covered, I would be in favor of alternative C with a federal funds range of 16 to 22 percent; and if mathematically the $15 billion borrowing level results from that, I'd be in favor of that "
1882,1981-08-18," To add a very negative note, but certainly one you've heard with some consistency from the Middle West, our basic industries continue to be very, very hard hit and are really deteriorating further I'll just comment on a few On the automotive  -24-    8/18/81  side, which we've talked about at some length, I think any improvement that has occurred in auto sales really is a result of rebates I'm told that the rebate structures that now exist and will be put in place in the near future cannot be afforded by the industry but they simply have to use them On the capital goods side, machine tools are very, very soft; farm equipment is down again, of course; construction equipment is grim and I'm told that among some of the smaller companies in that industry bankruptcies are coming because enough has taken place that nothing can really turn them [around] Railroad equipment [manufacturing] isn't just slow, it has all but stopped It's an industry that is in really deep trouble On the agricultural side, though production is up, which ought to bode well for prices, interest rates are having a negative impact on the cost of carry for that industry as well Net, with regard to the Middle West, there's a growing fragility, if you will, in the system At some point I think we are going to see some bankruptcies erupt across some of the industries that are the most troubled, and the fabric will be torn in such a way that it's very possible we will not get the kind of recovery that we need for good sustained growth So, the word from the Middle West is really one of a very somber outlook  If you're asking about the credit, they have not completed the renegotiation of credit Some banks are giving them a very difficult time on it  Well, employment is down  It's down 4 percent as compared to '79, and that would be substantially lower than the rest of the country  I can give you an anecdote I just bought a house and there has been no decline in the prices! Seriously, I think the rate of increase is clearly being tempered Sales of houses, particularly in the middle price sector, are very, very slow and the prices are beginning to come down  17 percent plus 3 points  -25-    8/18/81 "
1908,1981-10-05," I want to make just one additional comment about the agricultural sector because it's a change from what I have reported at previous meetings I have commented in the past that rates have had a negative impact, but within the last few weeks there has been a growing wave of pessimism I'm really now talking about the grain side as opposed to the meat side Production figures keep going up and, therefore, prices keep coming down And net cash income for the farmers in our area is being reduced rather continually It now looks as if income for this year will be lower than in any year since 1977 And that's unadjusted for inflation If you adjust for inflation, you have to go back a long, long way to have a year that is going to be like this year About 40 percent of the farms are debt free and are not impacted by [high interest rates]; 60 percent have some debt and, therefore, this is a very significant problem for them Here again, the lenders are beginning to get very uneasy about their agricultural credits They're worried about debt coverage ratios, the leverage, etc So, the farm industry in our area is getting very concerned  Given where we are now, and supporting Governor Schultz's comments about the possibility of making significant gains [on the wage/price front] next year, if I had to come down on one of the alternatives, I would come down on ""C"" But if there is a growing feeling that we could have something midway between ""B"" and ""C,"" I would opt for that I sense that there is enough noise and confusion in M2 that I would put greater emphasis on M-1B and would suggest that when we set the target for that aggregate we really try to achieve it "
1934,1981-11-17," Just to comment on the situation in the Chicago District, the problems, of course, have been serious all year but there certainly has been further deterioration since our last meeting And it's clear that [just about] all of the sectors have now been affected, with very few exceptions Turning to the auto situation, October can only be classified as a disaster Any hope for 1981 at this point, of course, is gone The optimism that some of them have for 1982 is significantly eroded and I think the automotive situation, therefore, is very serious Capital expenditures in our area have been further curtailed, particularly in the automotive industry, with significant cutbacks The Christmas shutdown schedules, which were already going to be heavy, have been extended considerably This recession is a little different in the Midwest than other recessions have been In the past the agricultural sector has offset the industrial sector This time that is not the case Because of high production, farm incomes are down and, as a result, the agricultural area is also in a very serious predicament And that has impacts on  -21-    11/17/81  people who manufacture products for that sector, several of whom have gotten themselves into very weakened, precarious positions In turn, the banks that extend credit to the farms are beginning to see some slowdown in payments, and I think it is inevitable that there will be some problem loans developing among those banks as they go through a foreclosure procedure  I am considerably more pessimistic than most with regard to the outlook for '82 I admittedly come from an area where there is a very heavy concentration of industries that have been most affected But I am beginning to wonder if the consensus view that we will all come to work on the first of July and find that someone has turned the lights on is really going to come to pass I think we're placing an awful lot of hope that the tax cut will produce significant benefits I think the recovery will begin to take place as we see a permanent or more lasting impact on inflation And until we get into the contract settlements next year, I don't think one can forecast how that will come about I don't want to imply that any of this should indicate a significant change in policy for us On the contrary, we continue to have the broad support of the business and financial industry and I think they would encourage us to stay with the general direction of our current policy But my hunch is that with the economy as weak as it is rates will continue to come down and we can continue to maintain a fairly restrictive stance on the aggregates without necessarily having a negative impact on the recovery prospects So, I would urge that we continue with this But I do want to report that the situation in the Chicago District continues to be serious and is deteriorating  Can't we to some extent cover the problem of appearing to be tightening by commenting about moving into next year? Consistent with what you said, we could say we are positioning ourselves by this particular choice to move into the band that we will select for next year  No, I'd say we would be positioning ourselves to move into the band that we will select for next year  To restrain ourselves this late in the year without putting that comment in about leading us into next year would be bad I'd be very much in favor of including those words  Well, as I said earlier, it seems to me that the direction we're going will tend to put us toward that range We can phrase it in a way that we are aiming toward that range, not necessarily that we'll fall under it  The language doesn't say that  It seems to me there's a real risk in putting out a [number in the] directive that we know we can't achieve Apparently we're far enough through the period that the opportunity of having the 7 percent come in is very remote If that's the case, are we better off using a number which is more achievable and gives us more credibility?  Well, when we say 7 percent, is it going to be the wording that's here of September to December?  Or November and December  Yes, but I think we talked about November and December  Are you dropping from the directive the comments about next year? "
1961,1981-12-21," On the specific question--I'll comment [on my general views] later--I think there has been within the last 30 to 45 days a decided shift on the part of labor out our way Their focus is now shifting from concentration on the financial aspects of the package to the job per se For example, the UAW has indicated a willingness to reopen the auto workers contract; the Teamsters have reopened [their contract] and the trucking people that I talk to expect some significant concessions there The UAW has specifically said they will reopen the Harvester contract; there they are going to try to get rid of the last increase that was given in October and there is going to be a discussion about the COLA increase coming up in the next couple of months as well as the pension increase that is scheduled for April Harvester expects to get a hundred million dollars a year out of the renegotiation the union has authorized I would echo Tony's comments; the industrial CEOs I have talked to are extremely gloomy and are expecting a very difficult 1982--a far deeper recession than most of the financial people I've talked to anticipate Therefore, I think they are going to go into negotiations with a tougher attitude than they might have had six or eight months ago I think there has been a big change on that front  I think there have been some developments on the price side as well There is the price cutting in retail; with Christmas sales it is hard to tell how it is going to work out but there are clearly some price cuts there In the automotive industry it has been demonstrated that when the manufacturers go to rebates, etc, that kind of price [cutting] tends to bring higher levels of sales, and I think [price cutbacks] are beginning to [reach] back into the raw materials There is a very big overhang internationally in aluminum ingots, for example; the book price, I think, is 74 cents a pound and the trades are taking place at about 49 cents a pound So there's a very appreciable difference in some of the raw materials areas, which ultimately ought to show up So I think there has been progress on that front as well  In our District, when land that was valued at $3500 to $4000 an acre comes up for sale, the price goes down; and they pull it off the market at $2700 or $2800 an acre The price just doesn't clear the market  With regard to M1-B, based on the results for this year as a whole and the expectations for next year, I fail to see any compelling reason to expand the width of the target range And lacking any compelling reason to do it, in my view we would make a mistake to do that Therefore, I would be in favor of keeping the spread at 2-1/2 percentage points as it is currently Lending credence to the credibility theme that any change might be regarded as tinkering at this point, I would keep the spread at the same magnitude But I would continue the program of restraint, which I think has been effectively established and, therefore, I would be in favor of moving the range down to, say, 3 to 5-1/2 percent  With regard to M2, again given the results of this year--with growth running at or near the top of the range all year long--it seems to me that the relationship between M1-B and M2 this year has [not]    12/21-22/81  been terribly tight And because of the questions about what is likely to occur next year in the components of M2, which we have talked about a good deal, and the fact that we have established enough press regarding the ""noise,"" if you will, in M2, I think this would be an appropriate time to make a change Therefore, I would be in favor of maintaining the 3-point spread but moving the range up a bit to, say, 7 to 10 percent as a way of trying to get it back to a more comfortable level for an uncertain year  I'd be comfortable with Mr Solomon's proposal for both M1 and M2, given the current state of the economy, with the thought that a little reduction in the fed funds rate might provide  -57-    12/21-22/81  some encouragement I'd be in favor of a $350 to $400 million borrowing range and a federal funds target range of 10 to 14 percent "
1989,1982-02-01," I think there's more comment along that line, Fred, than there has been before When you stop to think about it, Penn Central was an isolated incident It was a tremendous shock, but it did occur all by itself Herstatt, while a tremendous shock,    2/1-2/82  occurred all by itself But a whole series of companies now are moving toward this line, along with the S&Ls One does worry that the clock is running on all these companies and that if there isn't some relief soon, it could begin to get ahead of itself and a lot could occur all of a sudden  In the surveys that we did with the banks in our area, we were impressed by the consistency of the compensating balance comment Apparently corporations allowed their compensating balances to fall during the latter part of the year We were surprised by how many banks commented on that and by how many companies apparently drew on their lines of credit to build up their [cash] balances, even their compensating balances, over the year-end period Secondly, IRAs have    2/1-2/82  been receiving a lot of publicity in the Midwest, and one institution that we talked with in January has accumulated $60 million in IRA accounts They conjectured that if they were any sample at all, this is going to be a very big program And there has been a lot of money parked in various NOW accounts waiting for the IRA programs  One bank had $60 million in IRA accounts  Yes, and they are a very major savings bank, so they have a big base The program was very big and they conjecture that if they are symptomatic--and perhaps [their flows] are heavier than most--there are a lot of people who had money saved up waiting for January and the opportunity to begin to open these IRAs  No, this was heavier than typical  They used to but they've done away with it  Having established the preliminary targets that we did last July, I'd be very reluctant to make a change at this time unless there are good supportable reasons for so doing And I'm unpersuaded by what I've heard today that, with regard to M1, a change would be in order It seems to me that we are in an environment where absolutely everything we do is so carefully scrutinized that we'd have to have very supportable reasons for making a change A change upward would be inappropriate, particularly given the economic forecast we have for 1982 Therefore, I'd be in favor of leaving the M1 target as we had established it But with M2 it does seem to me that there are some supportable reasons for a change, namely, that we did not come in within that range last year and that from the figures that we have for this year [an unchanged range] would be very tight at best And I think it would be too bad to go through the year having to explain constantly why we are out of the range on M2 Therefore, I would be in favor of making a change upward with regard to that target to, say, a 7 to 10 percent range, to give us a little room to operate  Where we are now  Well, philosophically, I'm very close to what Ed has just suggested I'd feel far more comfortable with alternative B I would like a directive that would emphasize that we're trying to maintain the current level as opposed to being slavish to any particular number I would be comfortable with the borrowing level of $15 billion I would feel very strongly that we should not eliminate the fed funds range I'd be in favor of maintaining that at 12 to 16 percent; given the current rate, that seems reasonable "
2016,1982-03-29," Well, I ought to add to what Mr Corrigan has just said and report that with regard to the Chicago District, the situation continues to be very, very serious There is the common perception that the economy's decline may have ended, but I'd  -18-    3/29-30/82  emphasize the words ""may have"" Every article one reads leads one toward this consensus view that the economy is near the bottom and heading back up But in our area there is absolutely no tangible evidence that that has in fact occurred Mr Kichline has gone over the major sectors, but I must say that the automotive area is very weak, capital goods are just terrible, and in railroad equipment, for example, there have been absolutely no orders for railroad equipment in months Virtually all of the plants are now closed and they are closed indefinitely The heavy castings orders are down almost 70 percent in some areas  Conditions in the agricultural sector, just to add a bit to that, are looking much more serious There has been something of an improvement on the livestock front but on the grain side it's going to be a very bleak year Land values are continuing to decline Although there are not very many sales, those that do occur are at very significantly lower prices and, as a result, there is a growing problem with regard to agricultural loans Farm credit last year went up about $20 billion or 11-1/2 percent, and it has almost doubled in the last 5 years Most of this increase has been taken by either the PCAs or other government agencies, who are now by far the largest lenders to the agricultural sector And as these conditions in the area continue to deteriorate, we think the collection problems are going to mount And that is going to raise some very interesting questions with regard to how the government is going to deal with this problem There's likely to be very heavy pressure for a bail-out by the agencies for these different credits  So, as we look at it, there really are no tangible signs at all that we have reached the turning point, and the mood of the general population out our way could not be grimmer It's getting much more serious The morale and the attitudes are at a very low level and they are still going down; and there is a concern that any recovery that we might see in the country will leave the Midwest behind There is a growing fear that although the historical evidence would lead one to believe we are approaching the turnaround point, this time it may be different in that we are in a fundamentally different period and it is going to be much more difficult to get out of this particular recession  I think pretty considerably There has been a significant change in attitude on the part of organized labor, not only regarding terms and conditions, but in their whole approach to the situation I'm told, for example, with regard to the automotive industry, that Ford and GM renegotiations have been important financially, but much more importantly the attitude of the UAW is different now They are much more realistic currently than they were; even 4 or 5 months ago they took a very hard attitude on plant closings Now they come in and say Gee, isn't there a way that we can work something out so that you don't have to close that plant?  I hear a lot of gossip Harvester, frankly can't [mirror] the GM and Ford settlements They've got to get more [concessions]  They have to get a lot more Whether they can or not I don't know, because the attitude between management and the UAW, as you know, is very poor there I don't know of any tangible information about those discussions  Well, most schools are now in the process of approving their tuition for next year and a lot are going to be up 10, 12, 14 percent I think most schools also recognize that this is the last shot at this particular process and that because of the change in the demographics and changing inflation, they won't get away with it again  Yes But what I'm commenting on is frankly pretty anecdotal At our board meetings, two or three of the people who are directly involved suggest that there aren't very many sales but when there are, the prices are down very, very, substantially  We don't know what price people are referring to in terms of the base from which it has come down--whether it's a recent price or if it happens to be an individual transaction at a very high level But I don't think there's any question that when the  -20-    3/29-30/82  transactions do occur they are at lower levels; a figure of 10 to 25 percent is one that is commonly tossed out  Well, I think it may be going on now and it's too soon for it to be showing up  Yes There are increases in delinquencies, foreclosures, and bankruptcies But, honestly, the increases are from a very low base So, it's not yet a broad, pervasive problem But the actual numbers are beginning to increase  There are a lot of auctions, but then [the property] is pulled back when the price comes in at a lower level than is acceptable Therefore, the banks are beginning to back into the agricultural business  That's an important consideration But having said that, the banks--rightly or wrongly--lent money at 80 percent of a higher level and, therefore, they have a problem  I will admit to a significant bias caused by the circumstances in the Middle Western District And though I certainly don't disagree in any way with the fundamentals of the staff economic forecast, I am skeptical or merely unconvinced with regard to the timing as well as the strength of the recovery Also, it seems to me that an awful lot of uncertainty about the composition of M1 and M2 has been expressed around the table Meanwhile, we have an economy that is operating under the very most difficult circumstances possible While I'm not in any way suggesting a major change in what we are doing or how we are doing it, I do think that we have to provide at least a modest degree of relief, and it seems to me that alternative A is a way of doing that I would be very strongly in favor of alternative A as a way of trying to accommodate a possible bulge that could occur in April, but particularly because M2 is in a reasonable position within its range So, I would very much be in favor of alternative A "
2041,1982-05-18," Well, the news from the Midwest, which has been grim all along, continues to be very, very grim On the agricultural side, though, there has been some very modest improvement from a depressed level Livestock prices are better; and with the expectation of some improvement on the export side, grain prices could be better Having said that, farm incomes continue to be very low Capital expenditures for tractors and combines and the like are exceptionally low And farm land values declined significantly in the first quarter On an appraisal basis there are few transactions and when they do occur--and the number of farms for sale is up--the sales are taking place at declines in prices of between 15 and 25 percent On the industrial side, the District has been in a state of real depression for three years; in terms of employment and unemployment we are comparatively far worse off than the rest of the country The weakness has now become very pervasive The number of bankruptcies is going up, particularly among the smaller companies In the month of March in [our] District there were more bankruptcies than in all of 1981 In the capital sector, railroad equipment is all but dead Trucks, construction equipment, etc are in an extremely depressed state Last week we had a meeting of business economists, which we do on a monthly basis, and the general tone was very, very depressing In fact, it was generally regarded as the worst session that we have had in a great many years of that particular group So, to add to what Ed Boehne has said, there is in the Midwest also a deterioration in attitude The great concern is that the recovery is not at hand  -16-    5/18/82  and that, indeed, we could get ourselves into a cumulative downturn here  Yes, there's a sense of greatly depressed morale, if you will, about the [near-term] outlook and further beyond I'd agree with that, Chuck  Nancy, I can't give you a figure as to the number of people actually moving out Having said that, our employment numbers, as we commented in the Redbook, are just simply atrocious And the unemployment also is a great deal higher One would anticipate that in those kinds of circumstances people will leave But unless there are opportunities in other places that can absorb them, not as many leave as one would expect  Well, it's a difficult choice It's interesting Alternative C certainly doesn't seem to have had any friends today Given the gains that we have achieved on the inflation front and, most importantly, given the current state of the economy, I do think we are at a point where we could provide some room for the economy to grow and hopefully some scope for interest rates to go down Since most of the growth in M1 so far this year has been in OCDs as opposed to currency and demand deposits, it seems to me that we could provide some scope there I would be in favor of alternative A, and I do think we can accomplish that without any significant adverse reaction  -38-    5/18/82  We simply will be getting back to the target at a later date, and in my view there would not be undue negative reaction on the part of the markets I'd stick with the funds rate range of 10 to 14 percent That kind of band has been appropriate so far and I don't see any particular reason for making a change in that now A borrowing level of, say, $500 million would be appropriate "
2066,1982-06-30," To start first with the economic situation My comments are repetitive of what I've said in the past and repetitive of what we've already heard The situation in the Midwest continues to be very, very serious I keep reading about the recovery that is going to occur but I am coming to the view that it is something we all hope will come but perhaps may not Indeed, I'm beginning to have a lurking suspicion that we could be on the front edge of something much worse than we realize Virtually all of the sectors in the Midwest [economy] are continuing to deteriorate The capital goods figures were in the paper All the major companies are continuing to review their capital expenditure programs and each review results in a further curtailment The steel industry is operating at a capacity level not seen since the 1930s; that speaks for itself In the agricultural sector, the situation is a touch better on the livestock side but not on the grain side And the farm implement manufacturers really are in a very, very difficult state  -12-    6/30-7/1/82  So, my comments, regrettably, are unchanged from what I have said before; indeed I think things are a little more serious One CEO perhaps summed it up best by telling me the other day that in his view the situation is terrible, that it is getting much worse, and that an attitude of fright is now beginning to spread over the business community I think perhaps we have a new problem, though I admit it's a bit anecdotal, in that I'm hearing some comments from various bankers that I've talked to about the buildup in problem assets I've been astounded by the increase in total loans that has taken place this year in the face of the recession that we're dealing with I have just a hunch that there are a lot of loans that are, to use the euphemistic phrase, desperation loans, and that we could be seeing some nonperforming assets resulting in some losses Summarizing my comments about the District The situation is very, very serious  With regard to our strategy, unless I were to hear some very specific definitional and structural reasons to change our targets this year--and I haven't heard them so far--I think that we are the only credible game in town and that to change the ranges this year would run a very significant risk I would leave the ranges this year as is, but I would certainly aim at the high side and wouldn't be the least bit upset if we were to miss or go over Looking ahead to next year, in light of my comments, I think to reduce the ranges for next year would be a very serious step and I certainly would be inclined to leave them just where they are  For reasons based on the current economic situation, as I commented yesterday, I think we should set a target that has a reasonable possibility of getting us back down to the top of the range by the end of the year I would not choose a target now that would deliberately put us over the range by the end of the year And going along with Governor Martin's comments, I certainly wouldn't be slavish with regard to staying in the range By that I mean that if we were to run over as we go from now to the end of the year, so be it Having said that, I also wouldn't choose a target that would leave very little flexibility if the July bulge turns out to be very high So, I end up between alternatives ""A"" and ""B,"" probably ""A-"" rather than ""B+"" and an M1, say, of 4-1/2 to 5 percent I would broaden the federal funds range from 10 to 15 percent to 10 to 16 percent And I would be strongly opposed at this point to trying to set any kind of interest rate cap for fear that that would signal too major a change My borrowing range would be, say, $600 to $800 million "
2092,1982-07-15, I agree with that also 
2109,1982-08-24," Wednesday [levels] only  Yes, [the level] at the end of that day    8/24/82  So, if they are [not borrowing] on Wednesday, there will be no way in which one could--  Chuck, in the Midwest, most of the companies are operating at such a low level of capacity that there is just very little enthusiasm for any capital expenditures Until that begins to pick up in some material way, we will not see an improvement on the capital expenditure side  Yes Many of the industries are continuing to experience a decline I think, certainly, the rate of decline has slowed but there is still for some industries a perceptible continuing decline  Between the two alternatives, I certainly am emotionally pushed toward alternative A because, given the circumstances in the Midwest, I think we want to do everything possible to encourage and sustain lower interest rates and to try to improve the outlook for the recovery I have to admit that I am far gloomier than the staff forecast with regard to the outlook for both this year and on into next year Having said that, I find the shift in the implied growth rate for M1 between now and the end of September under alternative A just a little abrupt And if we run into a period during which M1 begins to grow, I wonder whether we won't have to react in a way that would cause rates to back up So, though [the difference between] the two alternatives is fairly narrow, I might come down about in the middle between the two, just to split a fine hair even finer I'd suggest that M1 growth of maybe 6-1/2 to 6-3/4 percent would be appropriate so that we can see how it goes between now and the end of September With that a fed funds range of 7 to 12 percent and a borrowing range of $300 to $350 million would be appropriate "
2147,1982-10-05," But even with the profitable ones, the level of malaise is rising very dramatically So, I sense that with the passage of time--  At Caterpillar, for example, they are not [unintelligible], but they are being particularly hard hit Their sales [in the third quarter] and their estimated sales in the fourth quarter of this year will be 50 percent under the sales for the third quarter of last year That's a massive decrease They went back through their records and the last time that they had a decrease was in '29 and in '30 And then they had their first loss year-end '32 They're going to have another loss year this year, and they are at the end of their string  Yes, but they are not posturing for negotiations Their comments are based on their--  Yes, the union is basing its position on '81 results, which were pretty good comparatively, and they are not being--  Also, Caterpillar is being killed by the yen- dollar rate [A Japanese company] has just taken their ears off  Given my sense of the general economic scenery, I certainly am in the camp that thinks that we simply must bring rates down I think we are at a point where we cannot go much longer in the way the economy is currently performing or we're going to see some very serious results emerging Therefore, I think it's exceptionally important that we move toward bringing rates down I certainly would understand and agree that there is a risk to this in that the markets, as we know, could see it adversely But I would agree with Governor Martin that mature and careful thinking is likely to [bring the market] to the view that this seems to be a realistic change, given the circumstances we're dealing with And I think the result could be positive as opposed to being negative So, I support the directive as it has been laid out It seems to me that the last sentence is a very important conclusion; [I'd leave it] rather than delete it It is our view that this is a major change that we're making but one that is appropriate and very important "
2173,1982-11-16," Well, I have [heard] the comments that would suggest that emotionally there is perhaps a better tone in the market, but I really think it's only because the previous period had been so very, very bad In answer to Nancy's question, I think [the weakness] is entirely interest-rate driven With rates having been so high, that created such a very bad attitude that a reduction, even a modest one, has been well received But looking aside from the emotion into the basics, I think the situation is continuing to deteriorate The basic industries, particularly those in the Midwest, are continuing to decline That tone comes through in the Redbook; the Redbook made for pretty consistently gloomy reading this particular time I think we are at a point where, if the rate structure doesn't stabilize or indeed doesn't continue to go down, this emotional improvement is going to deteriorate pretty rapidly  Well, I don't know what I can add to what seems to be an emerging consensus for alternative A  I think interest rates really do matter And given the noise in the aggregate numbers, we really can't be in the business of slavishly following statistics that may or may not make sense whereas interest rates, as I say, really do have a significant impact All the sectors I deal with in the Midwest are precariously    11/16/82  positioned The agricultural situation is serious; the industrial situation is serious also; and the consumer is at this point just plain scared And I think consumers are not going to begin to move out until they get some confidence Nothing will build confidence like a slightly lower rate structure and, therefore, I would be in favor of ""A"" I certainly hope that the fed funds rate would be under the 9-1/2 percent level--that it would tend to be around 8-3/4 or 9 percent and no higher than that I think the borrowing level to accomplish that would be $150 to $200 million  How about using the fed funds range of alternative A the way it is written [in the Bluebook]? "
2199,1982-12-20," If you're looking for bad news--  I would suggest that there has been a deterioration, whereas at the last meeting I had a tinge of feeling that maybe things were getting better The housing side may be better, but I think Nancy Teeters is absolutely right that we have a seasonal adjustment factor that complicates that scene The auto side certainly is better In retail sales, the optimism that was evident as people were getting ready for the Christmas season has begun to deteriorate People on the retail sales side that I talked with are clearly disappointed by the way they see Christmas shaping up On the industrial side, capital goods are declining further There is absolutely no evidence of a turnaround among the people I talk with, and the pessimism is getting to be very, very pervasive I think some of these people are beginning to run out of gas They just are terribly, terribly discouraged    12/20-21/82  I will be brief It seems to me, for all the reasons we've said, that we are going through a period of very high uncertainty And during this transition period, while certainly we shouldn't abandon M1, I think we should deemphasize it considerably I don't know how long it's going to take before we can re-utilize it, if in fact we can, in the way that we have in the past But I agree with Governor Martin that the length of time required will be much longer rather than shorter Certainly for the foreseeable future we should deemphasize it It seems to me that we have pulled off this deemphasis of M1 pretty well; I am impressed by that I think the markets have by and large accepted it to a greater degree than I expected In all the public comments that you have made and everybody else has made we are putting greater emphasis on M2, which I would agree we should do, with a balanced view And I think there is some considerable market expectation now that we will be following M2 The the very last thing we ought to do at this point is to introduce some new esoteric aggregate that we plan to follow, which could serve to confuse the markets So, having introduced M2 in this way, I think we should carry through with it and use it as our principal guide It also seems to me, in looking ahead, that we ought to be contemplating an increase in the range on M2 next year--in my view by a considerable amount Meanwhile, we have an economy that is awfully sick in my view We could very well be in a recovery phase But the people I talk to, particularly on the industrial side, as I said earlier, continue to be very, very pessimistic I think we should put a very heavy eye on interest rates, not only domestically but as they pertain internationally We simply cannot at this point afford to have any increase in the rates we have some level of control over--mainly on the short-term side--for fear of the possibility that a recovery will be snuffed out So, I'd be in favor of M2 but I also would be putting a very careful eye on following the interest rates "
2222,1983-01-14," This is Si Keehn The people I talk with say that they have their inventories down at such a very, very low level that any increase in final demand at all would result in a pickup in their production On the capital goods side, they don't yet see that [pickup] "
2251,1983-02-08," I think there's another side to this, which is hard to get a handle on We've gone through the break-even that Ed talked about--the reductions in the break-even capacity, if you will There are an awful lot of people I have talked to who, as we get into a recovery, are very anxious to raise prices And as soon as they sense an environment in which they can raise prices, they tend to go at it with a vengeance Therefore, we are on the high side with regard to inflation--we were on the low side with regard to real GNP-- because I think we're going to see some price increases in '83 and '84 that are a little hard to forecast at this point  Really?  I would join the consensus in favor of continuing with the targeting [of the aggregates] I've certainly been impressed with the analysis that was done with regard to the shifts that are taking place in the aggregates Nonetheless, we are in a period with an extraordinary amount of noise and uncertainty Therefore, I would be in favor of continuing to target Ml, M2, and M3, but I would move the bases as far forward as we possibly can to get behind us as much of the shift that has been and is taking place I would keep a heavy eye, or if not heavy certainly a concerned eye, on interest rates because unless we get the recovery more solidly in place than it is now, we'll have a great deal of trouble And in all of our public utterances we ought to make it perfectly clear that as we go through the year we are going to be adjusting the ranges, the base, and our whole approach to this to provide for the shifts that are taking place  Maybe it's a minor point, but in lines 53 and 54 we use the phrase ""after the period of highly aggressive marketing of [money market deposit accounts] has been completed"" We are implying that by using February and March as the base that the aggressive marketing will be over then I'm not sure we can say that  I'd give it a more temporary--  Yes  Tony, are they going after the other $200 million or are the participants about where they're going to end up? "
2277,1983-03-28," Could I ask about capital goods? I think you indicated that as we get further into recovery you expect an improvement But with the level of capacity utilization where it is currently, when would you expect this to occur? Is it an '83 event or are you thinking about later?  I can even report a better attitude on the part of the Chicago directors at our meeting about 10 days ago They were more positive in their outlook than they've been since I've been there, and it's really a very surprising change A lot of it comes from the agricultural side through the PIC program, in which the participation is becoming very heavy I think that has changed the attitude in the agricultural sector very dramatically  In fact, whereas our original guess was that the PIC program wouldn't have any effect [until] 1984, we now have the feeling that we will see some effect from PIC this year On the cautionary side, though, it may be darkest before the dawn but the people I talked to still say that the capital goods side is very, very sick and they don't see any near-term outlook for an improvement That is why I asked the question about capital goods On the inflation side, I have just a word of caution there We are beginning to see increases in prices of some of the basic commodities like steel and nonferrous building materials It's not so much that the prices themselves are going up, but the discounts that had been offered very broadly as we were going through a difficult period are beginning to be eliminated So, I think we can expect to see some increase on the price front as we get into this recovery  I certainly am in agreement that the recovery is in place but I tend to be much more on the cautious side than other people as to just how strong a literal recovery we have It seems to me that so far the growth has been entirely on the interest sensitive side of the economy and so far it has been uneven The capital goods sector continues to be very weak and, therefore, at this point I think we just couldn't run the risk of having rates go up significantly By that I mean that I think the upper end of the fed funds range in alternative C would be unacceptably high I think we can continue to sustain the recovery if we have fed funds broadly in the area of where they are now, in the 8-1/2 to 8-3/4 percent area or something like that On the other side, I do think there's an awful lot of noise, and I'm suitably confused by the level of noise in the aggregate numbers But there is rather compelling evidence that we have been through a period of pretty rapid expansion and I think we have to begin to set the stage to react to that at some point lest we let it get out of control So, I think we ought to become a little more directed in our language as to what we're going to do I would be in favor of alternative II Having said that, though, with regard to the directive under alternative II, I'd leave in both parenthetical expressions I would be in favor of [the specifications of] alternative B, but I would tend to let the initial borrowing level go up to, say, $300 million, or broadly about where it is now That seems to me to be an acceptable course given the circumstances "
2314,1983-05-24," On the domestic side I can confirm that the good news is even arriving in the Middle West but with one caution The capital goods side is still exceptionally weak The people I talk to  -8-    5/24/83  who are in the very heavy side of capital goods see no improvement now and they really are very discouraged about the outlook, particularly with low operating ratios Some of the people who have never really been concerned about exports before--never relied on those markets-- see this as an opportunity And because of the exchange rate, they feel that they are precluded from any relief on that side So, the people in heavy capital goods are still pretty discouraged about the outlook But other than that, I think the general environment in the Middle West is significantly better than the last time we met  I would be in substantial agreement with what Jerry has said It seems to me the last time we established the directive based on a reasonably uncertain economic environment--though the news looked good at the time--and since then it certainly has gotten a lot better I think we now have a reasonably broad-based economic recovery in place, with certain cautions, and on top of that we have a highly stimulative fiscal policy that's going to get more stimulative as the year goes along Certainly that will be the case next year as we get closer to the election And though all the papers I've read support the thought that Ml has changed, nonetheless, nothing persuades me that it is no longer useful in any way I think we have to begin to establish a framework in which we are focusing slightly more attention on that I'd be in favor of some modest snugging up, and alternative B or B+ in terms of the percentages would be reasonable But I would be inclined to establish a borrowing level of, say, $400-$450 million as a way of establishing a higher level of focus on it and beginning to snug up a bit  If we went to $400 million, I think that would represent an $8 million snugging, which is fairly modest "
2329,1983-06-23," [Unintelligible] conversation, but what part of the borrowing would you interpret, Peter, [as related] to various computer and systems problems that we've experienced?  At the last meeting there was some considerable sentiment by a number of people to move toward a higher borrowing level And we finally did compromise at the $350 million level But it seems to me that events that have transpired since then would be consistent with your suggestion that we move the borrowing level up to the $400 to $500 million area So, I would be in favor of that  Mr Chairman, this is Si Keehn We're in the middle of a director's meeting and I wonder if I could be excused to get back there before--  Okay, thank you "
2349,1983-07-12," May I go back to capacity utilization? You show a reasonably good increase in capacity utilization in 1983 and 1984 The capital expenditure line looks awfully steep Do you have a pretty good confidence factor on that?  Your confidence factor is pretty high?  Steve, are you saying that if we rebased using the second quarter, July would come in above 8 percent?  Not to complicate it, but what if we use the 5 to 9 percent for this year and then suggest that if velocity begins to return to a more normal pattern as we get into 1984 we might contemplate a reduction and go back to the 4 to 8 percent?  I'd be more inclined toward alternative B I'd feel more comfortable with a fed funds rate of 9-1/2 percent or maybe a touch higher And if a $750 to $800 million borrowing level would accomplish that, I think that's where I'd be comfortable  Yes, 5 to 9 and 4 to 8--  SPEAKER(?) How many people have that?  That would be my preference "
2376,1983-08-23," By way of a District report, I must say that economic conditions in the Middle West are very significantly improved and would be broadly consistent with the outline that Jim has given [for the nation] The only point I'd make--and I think Jim used the phrase ""capital goods are poised for recovery""--is that the people who are running the major capital goods firms in the Middle West really are becoming very, very discouraged by the outlook I'm now talking about the heavy capital side foundry equipment, railroad equipment, and heavy trucks Though things may look a little better off a very weak base, people on that side of life are becoming terribly discouraged that 1983 is by now largely gone and the early part of 1984 is to a large extent gone as well Most of them say the earliest they expect recovery is in late 1984 So, they continue to be very pessimistic Perhaps that's typical for this point in a recovery but, as a consequence of all this, our outlook for 1984 would be modestly lower than the Board staff's outlook  It's a different segment of the capital goods side I'm talking about machine tools, foundry equipment; I don't think perhaps you are  Perhaps so, but it has been lagging so long that the guys are getting awfully discouraged For example, to give you just one quick figure The delivery of railroad cars this year will be 5,000 units It typically runs about 80,000 to 85,000 units and in 1980 it ran 120,000 This year's figure will be lower than any year since 1933 and I'm not sure the figures in 1933 were that good This provides the kind of environment in which people are thinking and they've become very discouraged about it  No, orders have been absolutely flat Now, there are some reasons for that; nonetheless, it provides a very difficult environment in which people are operating "
2404,1983-10-04," I want to add that I think a recurring theme on capital goods--certainly in the fundamental heavy capital goods industry--in the Middle West is that the situation seems to be very slow I think the decline is beginning to level out somewhat but at a very, very low level At this point, there is no discernible improvement Some of the people who are directly involved in these companies are beginning to think the recovery may pass them by altogether As people see increasing comments about a recession in '85 and '86, I think there is some concern that they won't actually experience a pickup in the heavy capital goods side As a consequence, they are beginning to focus on interest rates Nancy Teeters was in Milwaukee a week or so ago and we heard a lot about interest rates there I think they really do feel that if we can get rates down, we could sustain a recovery that would bring some improvement on the capital goods side But that continues to be very slow to move up  Not quite yet  We do have a meeting next month and one wonders whether anything is going to happen between now and then that we have to worry too much about "
2431,1983-11-14," Perhaps you said it and I missed it What is your expectation with regard to labor contract settlements over this period? The question has a basis--namely, that an awful lot of people I've talked to are currently settling contracts in the 6 percent area with 3-year contract periods But they do suggest that, whereas they are sanguine about being able to hold this for the rest of this year and for 1984, as they get further out corporate profits really begin to improve I guess most people expect corporate profits to be very  -13-    11/14-15/83  good over the next few years and [thus] it's going to be very, very hard to maintain that [pattern of wage increases] There are still some COLAs around, and the expectation is that contract settlements will begin to move back up What kind of settlement number do you have in mind during this period?  I keep reading that there's a large German bank that has some problems and I assume it's not Schroeder Is there any truth to that?  What about the reserve issues? I remember there is a difference between the Senate bill and the House bill  This is action we are taking, as opposed to action that is a part of the IMF legislation?  I just have a comment on capital goods, particularly for those industries or those companies in the Middle West While there has been some improvement, I think, nonetheless in a broader perspective many of these industries are still doing very, very poorly We took a look at four components of the industrial production index--farm equipment, construction equipment, metal works, and railroad equipment--all of which are terribly important in the Middle West We compared their current levels of operations with the third quarter of 1981, which was for many of them a high point And these four individual sectors are still operating at a very, very depressed level I'm sure they will come along, as Jim is suggesting, but I also think some of them have undergone some pretty important structural changes They are still operating at very low levels and the people running these companies continue to be quite depressed about the outlook So, if there's any error at all, in my judgment it certainly is in that area on that side  Farm equipment, construction equipment, metal working, and railroad equipment Railroad equipment, for example, is currently operating at 81 percent under where it was in the third quarter of 1981 It has some very individualistic circumstances, which caused that, but it's an industry that is--  They are going to deliver about 5,000 freight cars this year, and it's an industry that has frequently delivered, say, 80,000 in a year; and that has been as high as 120,000 in a year  Third  Well, I would end up associating myself with those who are in favor of continuing the current policy, probably alternative B I think we are in a period in which things are going well, and that suggests that change would not be appropriate It's clear that the economy is far better now than we expected earlier and it is continuing to improve If this continues into the time of the next meeting, we may want to move modestly toward tightening But I think there still are enough uncertainties that I'd like to see a few more cards before taking that move Therefore, I favor alternative B with a borrowing level at about its current target level "
2462,1983-12-19," Well, it seems to me that CRR more than implies a higher level of control of the aggregates and, whether we like it or not, it's going to be with us on February 1st There has been an enormous effort expended by us and by the commercial banks And I would hope that for all of this trial and tribulation and money we'd be able to deliver something It seems to me that all this does imply a much greater emphasis on Ml than we have been giving it recently We have been through a period of significant adjustment; I think we would be making a mistake if we did not use this as an opportunity to move to reemphasize Ml I would in no way suggest that we ought to put the system on automatic but I wouldn't lose the opportunity I'd begin to reemphasize Ml as our principal aggregate I would plant the potato  Well, as I've reported for the last year or so, the Middle West has been very slow to join this particular party But I do think there has been a significant improvement over the last few weeks or months, and at this point we really are on board On the consumer side, all the current reports we get for retail sales are very, very strong, and double-digit increases are fairly common Just wandering around stores, as I have done the last week or so, one can see that the traffic is very, very high Even in the industrial sector there is an improvement; most of the basic sectors in the Middle West are doing better They still are at comparatively low levels; compared to, say, 1978 or 1979, they are operating at 40 to 50 percent of what they used to think was a good level But still, that is an improvement from what they were experiencing just a year ago So, I think on the industrial side, there is improvement also  With regard to the risks, I think they are the same ones that have been pointed out Interest rates are high I think people are amazed that we've had as good a recovery as we have had so far at this particular rate level That suggests in their minds, and mine as well, that if there were any significant increase in rates, it would have the impact of shutting this [recovery] down somewhat On the inflation side, I think there is a high level of suspicion that the stated rate of inflation somewhat understates what people think is a more practical rate of inflation On the price side, most of the people I've talked with are sitting on the price button ready to go as soon as they can get increases across The operating ratios are low enough that they can't pull it off; but as these ratios begin to creep up, I think they are going to try to push price increases forward as fast as they can On the wage side, most of the people I've talked to suggest that they are still able to get 6 percent settlements by and large but they are having to work very hard to accomplish that And as has been pointed out, there is an expectation that as profits begin to improve in a very significant way, that will form a pretty difficult environment in which to continue to pull off these very tough settlements But as I add up these risks, I still think the fundamentals are in place for a continuation of recovery The risks, [as] we look at them, are not significant enough to have a major impact on what I think is going to be a pretty good 1984--not very different from what the staff forecast suggests  -24-    12/19-20/83  I can't remember the exact words we used when we announced the preliminary targets for 1984 but I have a hunch that the words we used suggested that the reduction in the ranges was consistent with our long-term program to reduce the level of price inflation, and at this point I really don't see that we have a basis for changing them [again] To make a significant downward reduction in the ranges would imply a higher level of restraint than we would want to have in mind To increase them by any magnitude would indicate a very fundamental shift in policy, which I think would be a big mistake So, I would be inclined to go with the ranges as we have announced them For the reasons that Steve has suggested and that Governor Teeters has suggested, I would be inclined perhaps to reverse the ranges for M2 and M3 But I would at this point place a much higher reliance on Ml I think we should put more emphasis on Ml and that particularly relates to the conversation we had with regard to CRR yesterday In light of the timing involved, we are getting to a point where CRR is going to come into place pretty rapidly, and  -44-    12/19-20/83  perhaps we should begin to [increase the focus on Ml] as soon as today when we talk about the intermeeting targets  Regarding 1985, I think it's far too early to be specific about what we would suggest by way of ranges for the year but I think we want to continue to emphasize the long-range program we have in mind I certainly wouldn't give Congress any reason not to deal with the fiscal problem and I would not in any way suggest that if they don't deal with it, we will have to back off on our objective for 1985 I would say that we have every intention of continuing the program and that we will continue to reduce the ranges, but I wouldn't be specific with regard to amounts this far in advance of the year  Paul, are you going to cover later the current status of the various external financing packages of Brazil, etc?  For the reasons that you outlined at the outset, I would be very much in favor of alternative B Having said that, I would be in favor of modifying the directive, as I have suggested a couple of times so far, to indicate greater emphasis on Ml Also, it does occur to me that this [directive] will be coming out probably in late January or early February after we have embarked on a major operating change, and I think we ought to reflect that now So, again, I'd change the directive I'd leave the borrowing level at about $650 million, but I would change the fed funds range to 7 to 11 percent--not to indicate any policy change but simply to give us more room in which to operate, because I have a hunch that the funds rate, at least for the next few weeks, will rise pretty close to that 10 percent ceiling "
2487,1984-01-30," I have a question on capital expenditures Maybe it's a question of the scale, but capacity utilization in the period doesn't go back to the '79 level yet the capital expenditure line appears to be going up fairly steeply Are you pretty confident about that real business fixed investment [projection]?    1/30-31/84  Well, if there's any word that's consistent in all of our comments it is the word ""flexibility"" I concur that we are at a point where we need a maximum amount of flexibility and that we ought to preserve our options as long as we can I might do it a bit differently I would raise M1 from a monitoring status, and I would rather deemphasize M2 and M3  That is a way of saying that I would prefer the [Bluebook] alternative for the directive that accomplishes that but with softer language We can change the words to shift the emphasis in a way that I would suggest It just seems to me that if we're working with three [variables] we have more options and more flexibility than if we're working with two But having said that, I think we certainly are in a period and will continue to be in a period where we're going to want to look through all of this to the underlying economy and to use the flexibility that I hope we will be able to accomplish by choosing this particular alternative With regard to the specifics, I'd be in favor of alternative II I'd prefer the broader range, the 4 to 8 percent range, [for M1] Again, I think it's consistent with a higher level of flexibility The 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent range for M2 is reasonable, but I would be in favor  -33-    1/30-31/84  of using M1 to a higher degree than we have, and I'd be in favor of alternative II  What if we left off the phrase after the comma ""aggregates, which for the time being would continue to receive more substantial weight""? Doesn't the first part of that sentence give us the flexibility we need?  By showing M1 below M2 and M3 and by having a sentence in there which deals with the uncertainty of its velocity, it seems to me we are setting the reader up for what is the [unintelligible] fact if we drop the whole phrase The additional phrase is not necessary  Not incidentally, in the third paragraph when we're dealing with the short-term ranges we use M1, M2, and M3 in that order  M1, M2, and M3  Would it be too revolutionary to take the whole thing out?  Well, it seems to me we would do what this says anyway It's part of our normal operating procedure And if we take the whole thing out, we're going to operate in the way that we normally would  Yes "
2514,1984-03-26," Tony, it's not part of what you've taken a look at, I'm sure, but did you also consider the way in which we distribute the Bluebooks? The point I would make is that they are distributed at a time at which our security is at its very lowest level I would think--namely, over the weekend And each time we have to develop a procedure by which we're going to handle them I wonder if there's a way we can distribute them to the Banks at a time when our procedures are best geared to handle them  They come in via something called Cannonball Express And Cannonball Express delivers at a variety of times; it could be either Saturday afternoon or anytime on Sunday  I hope it is And we have to go through a procedure to deal with that  I suggest it as a possible alternative because we have some problems If they were distributed Thursday night by pouch, I think that would eliminate all the problems and deal with the concern we were suggesting  I thought I might amplify a bit on the comments that I made on the phone last week about the agricultural sector In our area there are some parts of the District where the agricultural problems are getting somewhat on the serious side but there are some contradictions that are developing on the positive side Commodity prices have improved from what were very low levels The opportunity for exports seems improved, particularly to the Soviet Union and to Africa, and certainly that picture ought to be improving rather than deteriorating And we expect that the participation in the 1984 grain program will be higher than we might have thought several weeks ago So, in the short term, the situation seems to be better and would provide for an improved situation But having said that, there are some serious longer-term problems I think it is fair to say that some parts of the area are going through a significant transition In Iowa, for example, 50 percent of the farm land is debt free and for 35 percent [more] the debt level is reasonable Then you get down to the 15 percent where the troubles really are developing There the debt levels are high and the debt was created as a result of purchasing land at values that were exceptionally high The land values had gotten out of the economic production scheme and were really pretty much relating to inflation As inflation has backed off, farm values have gone down and the debt has built up That, as a consequence, is causing the problems that you see [reported] so much in the press, which are not necessarily reflective of the agricultural sector as a whole There are also a couple of timing considerations First, this is line renewal time for most of the agricultural banks and I think  -36-    3/26-27/84  the banks put a pretty special focus on their credit exposures Also, it's a time when farm auctions are typically taking place so that the whole problem and the emotionalism that is involved with that comes back into focus And then, frankly, it's a slow time of the year It is February or March before things begin to pick up and as a consequence that gives people an opportunity to talk about it I don't in any way suggest that the problems aren't serious They are But I think they are not necessarily reflective of the conditions throughout our District as a whole  Well, I'm really referring to Iowa particularly  Yes, Chuck I think it's a fair comment with regard to the industrial sector that those parts that are susceptible to a cyclical improvement are indeed experiencing it Many of them, particularly those that are consumer-related, are doing very well In fact, many are right up to the top on capacity The sectors that are having a problem are those that are dealing with some pretty secular problems; they are doing better this year than they were last year but nowhere near as well as some of the other parts But I think they are beyond the scope of monetary policy They have some special problems all their own  I must say I've been very impressed with the continued progress on the wage side People I talk to are still settling contracts in the 4 to 5 percent area but nearer 4 than 5 And they expect to have a pretty good year this year, although they are all very, very apprehensive about the auto negotiations They can do well now but if the auto negotiations go badly, that would create a different environment On the price side, though, those sectors that are doing well and are up toward the top of their capacity are beginning to move through price increases with some success They feel growingly encouraged that they are going to be able to put the price increases in and make them stick So, particularly in those sectors that are doing well, the price pressures are beginning to grow; and with the passage of time that could be a significant risk Broadly, I think the answer to your question is that the industrial outlook in the Middle West is far better than it has been  -37-    3/26-27/84  For all the reasons that have been stated, I certainly think it's an appropriate time to be taking some action Inflationary pressures are clearly building, and I think it would be very, very unfortunate to see these pressures and not do something about them So, it seems to me that the timing is appropriate despite the risks--and there are many, and they are serious I think we'd be better off taking some action now rather than waiting and perhaps having to react a bit more vigorously I certainly think that we should be aiming toward alternative C over a period of time but, like others, I would find that a pretty abrupt step to be taking today As I was thinking about this earlier, I frankly wrote down the numbers that Henry Wallich has suggested as a course between ""B"" and ""C,"" with M1 at about 6 percent, M2 something under 8 percent, M3 under 8-1/2 percent, borrowing about $1 billion or a little over and the fed funds rate between 8 and 12 percent "
2542,1984-05-21," It's not worth quite that much  There was an article in the paper, maybe today, saying that based on the most recent increase in the prime the four major countries are going to get together and try to form a user's group, if you will Is that a serious threat or just more talk?  My comments would very largely parallel Ed Boehne's There is a growing feeling from the people I talked with that we are in fact reaching a plateau and that from this point further growth will be tougher and tougher to achieve Nonetheless, I think virtually all the sectors that I am familiar with are doing better this year than was the case, say, last year But a lot of them have not yet had an opportunity to recover fully and those are the people who are very worried that the economy may be in an area where perhaps the sustainability of the recovery is getting increasingly fragile On the price side, there are some price changes going on that may not be reflected in the figures but that could be rather significant for those industries that are operating at pretty high levels I will cite two examples of this Liner board for boxes was selling at $300 per ton in 1979, went down to $240 last year, and is now back to $320; oil well casing was $1400 per ton two years ago, $800 last year, and is now back to $1200 to $1300 And during this whole period the list prices were unchanged It's a way of saying that price increases--in some cases significant increases--are being accomplished but without any changes in the list prices, so these increases may not be reflected in our standard indicators  I don't know the list price of those particular products but it hasn't changed during this whole period  They have a list price But in 1982 no one was selling at list and in 1983 people were selling a little under list In 1984 they are now selling at [unintelligible] list Despite this, nobody that I talked to suggests that we have any risks of runaway inflation Everybody expects that prices will be higher as the year unfolds, but not by a very significant amount On the wage side, I continue to be impressed by how well people are able to renegotiate their contracts The industries that are soft are renegotiating contracts of 1 to 3 or 4 percent on a three-year basis The industries that are a bit tighter are in the area of 3 to 5 percent annually, and again those are on a three-year basis So, the wage side continues to be favorable and, with productivity increases, all of this I think looks pretty good  On the agricultural side, I don't know what I can add to the comments I made at the last meeting Iowa continues to go through a very rugged adjustment phase Land values there are continuing to go down, interest rates are going up, and for those farmers who are indebted it is a very tough environment Having said that, there has been some legislation that may ease these problems to some extent But, net, I would agree with the staff forecast in the Greenbook I think the [prospect for] sustainability this year continues to be pretty good but I have this feeling that we have reached or are  -14-    5/21-22/84  reaching a plateau from which it will be tougher to achieve gains from this point forward  No [The FDIC] put cash in  I would certainly agree that the circumstances are such that it would be very appropriate to continue the present course and I agree that alternative B is the appropriate alternative If we were going to go to one side or the other, I would tend to lean a little toward ""C"" but primarily on ""B"" with a borrowing level of $1 billion The question in my mind is whether we ought to attribute this to any extent to the financial situation On the one hand I would say that might be a mistake because that calls undue attention to the problem But having said that, I think perhaps by doing that we preserve an alternative--that with the passage of time if this thing unwinds, we can withdraw that caveat and keep an option open to ourselves I think for right now alternative B would be the appropriate alternative "
2567,1984-07-16," Our forecast with regard to the GNP this year and next year is perhaps a touch higher than the staff's, and our inflation [forecast] is broadly consistent--a bit higher But amongst all the good news, and I really do think we have a very powerful economic expansion in place, I continue to be distressed by the unevenness of it all The people I talk to, particularly those people who run large capital intensive heavy industry companies, are continuing to experience very, very difficult times; by no means have they in any way really caught up with the euphoria that seems to be present in other areas I tried to look at this a bit We took the industrial production index and assumed that 1979 was 100 and then looked at the April physical output numbers in various parts of that index A lot of these are the industries that are central to the Midwest For example, in the primary metal category, consumer durable steel was 75 percent for April of 1984 versus 100 for 1979; equipment  -13-    7/16-17/84  steel was 53 percent versus 100 for 1979; farm tractors were 35 percent; construction and equipment were 78 percent; the big tractors like the kind Caterpillar makes were 40 percent; railroad equipment, which I have commented on in the past, was 15 percent  SPEAKER(?) Fifteen?  It was 15, but that's not quite fair because 1979 was, for some tax reasons, a uniquely high year But as you go down these individual categories in the industrial production index, many of these big, heavy [machinery] companies are still operating at very, very low rates Universally, the people I talk with say that the value of the dollar is of extreme concern And we think that will be key to our forecast for next year Caterpillar, for example, is a classic example of a company that just has been decimated, both domestically and in the export markets Therefore, I look at the numbers and statistically they all seem to make great sense and I can find no overall reason to disagree But I have this nagging feeling as I look around at many of these big companies that, with the continuation of the trends with regard to interest rates and the value of the dollar or both, something could come a little unglued here as we look to the forecast--not so much this year, but next year It's this unevenness that I find in the industrial component that has me particularly worried  In my view, the options are between alternatives I and II One could make a compelling argument for ""I"" on the theory that, given the forecasting uncertainties that we talked about yesterday as well as the now compounding velocity considerations, we could just simply leave the present ranges in place and suggest that when the year is over and we're setting the targets more firmly in February, we will take another look But a bit more compelling is the message that would be conveyed Therefore, I would come down on option II with the thought that it is a continuation of a program that we have been embarked on I [support] Tony's argument that if, as we get into next February, the history is such that we could go down to 7 percent, that would be appropriate too So, I think it's a close balance, but of the two I'd come down for option number II  It's in that magnitude The loss category for Continental, including oil credits, is going to be $575 million And that is largely the result of a different set of standards for credits  Right That's as opposed to the deterioration of the assets themselves; it's a very significant amount  Maybe I'm missing something, but it does seem to be that there's a bit of a divergence of opinion around the table as to whether or not we have an overheated economy or one that is moving along quite well For the reasons I stated yesterday, I fall in the latter category I think the numbers are good and they're solid; but it's very, very uneven, particularly in the industrial sector As a consequence, I would be very reluctant to see us make a move toward snugging at this particular point for that reason and for the reasons that you suggested at the beginning Importantly, also, I think my outlook for inflation is perhaps a bit more positive than some I just don't see in the current signs or the prospective signs that  -64-    7/16-17/84  inflation really is likely to get away from us So, as a consequence, I really do think this is good time to maintain a course that seems to be working I would be in favor of alternative B with borrowing at a level of about $10 to $11 billion "
2595,1984-08-21," The big banks have not been in  In fact, proportionately the District borrowings are down  This is really an observation With Continental's large and prospectively even larger borrowing and with Financial Corporation of America likely to come in, several people have asked the basic question of what our technical limitation is by way of a borrowing level What is the operational limit? If there is a possibility of a problem, it might be helpful if we had a rather uniform statement as to how we might reply to this type of inquiry  I would certainly support your observation that there is a more moderate tone out there Certainly, in the Middle West, those sectors of the economy that have been doing well--  Thank you Those sectors that have been doing well are continuing to do well but in terms of output, employment, income, and orders, there is far less optimism than has been the case in the past But as always, to repeat a comment, I continue to be impressed by how uneven all of this is The folks in the capital goods industries--those impacted by both a high level of imports and a reduced level of exports--and anybody who is at all involved in the agricultural sector are continuing to be very, very gloomy about how things are going And I suppose to say the obvious with regard to the inflation outlook, the UAW negotiations are quite key And I can't get a very good feel as to what is going on out there Those I talk to conjecture that there's a pretty good opportunity of getting through [the negotiations] without a strike and they say that if there is a settlement, it will be in the 4 to 6 percent area and [the companies] can make that up on productivity But on the other side of that coin, the strike fund is at a record level The union leadership that negotiated the concessions by and large has been voted out and on top of that the negotiations are described as being terribly, terribly complicated I think that's an uncertain scenario, and certainly key to the wage outlook would be the results of that particular negotiation  They are  Well, I would agree with Bob Black It seems to me that we happen to be in one of those times when everything seems to be going very, very well--indeed, just about right The comments at our last meeting suggested that the economic expansion was going to be a bit more robust than perhaps has been the case with the passage of time I have some feeling that our comments today may suggest a greater degree of moderation than may be the case I do think there is an element of moderation out there Nonetheless, it seems to me that the outlook is excellent; there are inflation risks but the outlook seems to be favorable Therefore, I would suggest--since we happen to be at about the midpoint of the range for M1--that continuing that as an objective and as a target between now and the end of the year is a very desirable alternative That would put me in the camp of suggesting that alternative B would be the most appropriate The borrowing level would be, say, $1 billion I would leave the fed funds range as it is I do think that the directive should be balanced but also that it should be worded in a way that would clearly suggest that we didn't change our basic objectives at this point; some of the wording could be adjusted accordingly  -30    8/21/84 "
2620,1984-10-02," Well, in the words of one of my associates ""The Middle West has dropped out of the economic expansion"" But as I hear the comments, maybe we aren't the only ones to have dropped out I think it's now clear that overall economic activity in the Middle West has been at least leveling off since the early part of the summer Steel production is down and down significantly Imports are taking a very much larger part of that market The heavy capital goods sector continues to be relatively weak One part of that sector, indeed, has turned around Orders for large trucks, which had been very strong, have now turned around and are on the way down Residential construction is down, the result of high interest rates Our gains in employment rates have slowed down Our unemployment rate is down, but it's probably more a factor of people just dropping out of the work force and not the result of higher employment numbers Retail sales are uneven There was a pickup during the back-to-school period Nonetheless, the September numbers, according to what we're hearing, are again on the soft side In the agricultural sector, the outlook continues to be relatively poor and the land values are continuing to go down The outlook for farm incomes is not positive and that is backed up even more in the farm equipment sector where production is being further curtailed Some major manufacturers are continuing to lay off workers Broadly, the news is a bit more modest I would not suggest by any of this that we are heading back into a recession I think it would be far too early to suggest that But certainly, at least in our area, the expansion has faded And I think we are going to have to watch the numbers pretty carefully in the upcoming period  For reasons that have been well stated, I think alternative B would be the most desirable alternative at this point Clearly, there has been a moderation in the rate of economic growth I think there is a disagreement around the table as to whether or not we are headed toward a more negative environment or indeed just down to a more sustainable rate of growth But it does seem to me that from a monetary policy point of view, things are lined up awfully well at this point and the fundamentals are really right and that it would be premature to be making any kind of significant change We are in a period where we would want to watch it pretty carefully but, fortunately, we have another meeting coming up in a fairly brief period of time As a consequence, at this meeting alternative B seems to me to be the most appropriate alternative with borrowing of, say, $750 million, but I'd have a high element of flexibility on that borrowing And I would attempt very hard to achieve a growth rate of M1 in the 6 percent area "
2644,1984-11-07," Perhaps in line with previous comments, I'm beginning to sense what I think is quite a different tone in our area than what I reported at the previous meeting I have suggested in the past that the Middle West has not participated very fully in the recovery and expansion, and that continues to be the case But some things may be developing that signal broader problems The bad business has continued to be bad The backlogs of orders are running down But those businesses that have done better than others are beginning to feel the slowdown One CEO that I talked with who works with what he calls pressure curves, which are some kind of regression analysis on the rate of incoming orders, says those are beginning to indicate to him that we are heading into a downturn Specifically The appliance business is noticeably weaker; heavy trucks, which were    11/7/84  very strong early in the year, are now turning down; and the truck trailer business market was up because of a legislative change but is clearly turning around and slowing down  Truck trailer  There was a legislative change that provided for double bottoms and that really ballooned the market That is coming down  Orders booked for very heavy trucks, Class 8 trucks, are down substantially and their production is down A large retailer--which is frankly a euphemism for  We had a meeting of [local] economists a week or so ago and their representative, who had been quite optimistic about the Christmas outlook, is now a lot less optimistic  They are expressing some doubts about the outlook for retail sales This suggests that while we thought the soft landing--or the reduction from the very high first and second quarters--was a welcome thing, it may be something a bit more fundamental I'm beginning to wonder about that I don't disagree with the staff forecast, but it tends to be a little on the high side, to me at least The GNP numbers look high both for this quarter and for next year Housing starts and auto sales look a little high So, consistent with [the views of] Governor Rice and Governor Martin, I think there is an increasing risk of low or perhaps even negative growth rates  I just can't let the moment go by without commenting that conditions in the agricultural sector are continuing to deteriorate What has been a very difficult situation has only gotten worse with the passage of time The rains are now complicating the harvest season; commodity prices are down; meat prices are down; and land values are continuing to decline [The latter] is particularly true in Iowa where admittedly they have come down from pretty high levels, but they are in a decline that's very significant This is beginning to back up even more with regard to nonperforming loans in the agricultural banks The banks keep saying that their problems are manageable; nonetheless, these are the kinds of things that can turn around pretty rapidly Based on the calendar we are at a time of the year when for the next few months things [should] only get better They ought to be better now than they are And the fact that they are bad would indicate that in the next few months things are going to get    11/7/84  worse Agricultural equipment manufacturers are continuing to go through just a very dismal period The outlook is poor and they are pulling down their production schedules very significantly There is plenty of tractor and combine equipment at the retail level, so production is going to be very weak well into 1985 Our agricultural economist, who is a pretty conservative guy not given to extremes, said that in his view we are facing the worst set of circumstances in this area that he has known in his whole experience at the Bank I don't think that we are at a turning point here, but I would certainly think that the odds have changed significantly and that the probability of going into a period of lower rates of growth than we thought in the past is increasing It is certainly higher than it was at the past meeting or two  Although there is some uncertainty as to where the economy is going, from the earlier comments it does seem to me that on balance the tone has changed very substantially from our past meeting and that we are in an environment where some easing is a reasonable expectation I wouldn't make too much of the M1 number for one month but, as has been pointed out, this [weakness] has been persisting for some period of time now and just maybe it's telling us  -37-    11/7/84  something I would not in turn overreact, but as I look at the dots on the charts it seems to me that neither alternative A nor alternative B is an overreaction Rather, I would think we ought to be aiming toward the middle of the range over a longer period of time as we look into the next year And that leads me to alternative A I would reduce the federal funds range to recognize a reduction that has taken place in the market--not so much because I think that 7 percent would be an operative rate But if the federal funds rate were to get back into the 11 percent area with any persistence, I certainly think that would be an opportunity for a telephone call With regard to the borrowings, I think going down to the level suggested in the Bluebook under alternative A is pretty severe; therefore, I would think a borrowing level of, say, $500 to $550 million would be appropriate  Not to stir the soup but--  SPEAKER(?) But it will  On this M3 number of 9 percent, I'd ask what the basis for that is Neither alternative A nor B would suggest that  The fact that we had it the last time I don't find necessarily compelling  Just to carry over the language doesn't seem to be a clean way of developing a directive "
2670,1984-12-17," It seems to me that for many of the reasons that have been stated these are the kinds of decisions that lend themselves to judgment based on a variety of circumstances that can change very significantly from time to time and it's very hard to prejudge them The only other thing I might add is that moving to some kind of mechanical procedure, which I think is what this suggests, is a bit of a slippery slope If we begin to move in this direction and become very mechanical, it opens up the possibility that our critics would suggest that the whole procedure runs itself from a higher level of mechanical procedure than we're using So, I would be very much in favor of staying with the procedures we're presently using  It has a role involving something from which we make a judgment?  Starting first with the economy I would have said a month or six weeks ago that there was every opportunity that we could fall back into a recession And though the recent indicators have been somewhat ambiguous, [not] doing a lot, I certainly have changed my view I think there is every opportunity here to stabilize and, indeed, to begin to come out a bit on the high side With regard to the forecast, I think the staff's forecast is a very reasonable assessment of the way 1985 may actually work out, though some of the underlying statistics in the forecast seem a little on the high side For example, they are suggesting auto sales next year of about 11 million That would go back to the rate in 1978 which, if you  -49-    12/17-18/84  remember, was a very, very strong year I think that looks a little high Housing starts of 18 million also look a bit high I think the tax bill will cause considerable uncertainty in that area But net, I think 3 percent is a reasonable assessment of what may work out With regard to inflation, though I certainly agree with Jerry that the level is high, on the current trend I think the news is uniformly good; I am extremely impressed on both the price and the wage side People I talk with are simply unable to get price increases of any magnitude to stick at all, even in some of the tighter industries On the wage side, people I've talked to say that contracts that have been renegotiated in 1984 are continuing very favorable trends--better than those that were renegotiated in 1983 in terms of the length of the contract and the wage costs I think the productivity side of that is going to continue to be good and, therefore, most people are going to be able to go into 1985 without increases of unit labor costs I think the trends [in inflation] are very, very positive I would have said that is the most important thing that we're trying to do Even if we deliberately gun the aggregates to try to increase the growth beyond what is suggested, it seems to me we run a very substantial risk of losing what we have already accomplished on the inflation front So, that leads me to say that I would leave the ranges where they are, based on what we know now; things may change between now and February There have been some compelling arguments to raise them and I understand that; nonetheless, I would leave them where they are now  With regard to the relative weights, I would not be slavish to M1 but among the aggregates that we use it seems to me M1 has the greatest reliability in terms of how we operate monetary policy and, therefore, I would place greater reliance on M1 next year than we have The risks here, and I think everybody has said it, are certainly in the exchange rate and the balance of trade Clearly, there are some excesses here that cannot continue I don't know quite why they have continued as long as they have An aside for a moment on the foreign trade side As we look at the agricultural sector--and I won't spend any time on that--the conditions in the agricultural sector are much, much worse than they have been Indeed, we are facing some very serious risks in that area We think that the loss of the foreign market was the single most important cause of the problems that the agricultural sector is currently dealing with So, the risks as I look at '85 are in the exchange rate and balance of trade areas If that unwinds, particularly in a hurry, it could cause some unfortunate reactions I hear what you're saying, Mr Chairman, with regard to the need to have this imbalance to finance our fiscal deficit I wouldn't mind bringing that problem into greater exposure as a way of trying to get Congress to do a little more than they are likely to do to bring down the fiscal deficit Finally, on the international area, if we have continued growth of about the magnitude that we're suggesting, if inflation remains at the level that we anticipate, and if rates continue to come down, it does seem to me that we ought to be providing the stimulus for a continuation of the worldwide recovery Therefore, that would not, on balance, be a bad performance "
2690,1985-01-18, On in Chicago 
2710,1985-02-12," On the business fixed investment chart I continue to be amazed by this very favorable red trend line that we've watched the last couple of years, which seems completely out of context with our experience Mike, I think you did comment as you went through the charts that most of that line, or a significant part of it, is in the communications/computer area My question is If you were to separate out what I would call for lack of a better term the ""grunt stuff""--the heavy capital production type of equipment--from the computer area and then, in turn, take a look at the part of that heavy equipment that is being supplied by the international market, wouldn't the line in fact be very, very different? And wouldn't that be a way of dramatizing how terribly uneven all of this is, despite the fact that we have a trend line that looks very favorable?  Thank you  -13-    2/12-13/85  I think it is higher than that  That's the problem  Just to comment generally on the outlook, the staff forecast is really quite consistent with ours Our GNP is a little lower and our inflation is a little higher but not materially enough to comment on But, as you can gather by my earlier comments, I am still just staggered by the continuing unevenness of it all Many of the industries on the capital goods side are very weak and I think a lot of them have come to the conclusion that they are going to be left out and that this recovery is going to completely pass them by I was talking with a man who runs a very large diversified company, including an extensive foundry operation, and they have concluded that they had better get ready for the next recession and now are in the process of closing permanently about half of their foundries They just feel that that business is never going to come back  A risk I would point out--and I would say it's a local risk, certainly not a macro or a broad risk--is this agricultural situation  -16-    2/12-13/85  I almost don't dare mention it because I'm sure I can't say anything new or surprising and you've heard a lot about it But it is very serious and is continuing to deteriorate And it is one that I find very hard to get a handle on; I find it difficult to measure just how difficult and serious the problem is other than I have a hunch that the statistics we look at really don't adequately describe the problem The land surveys that we look at suggest that land values are down 30 to 40 percent from the peak But there isn't much land selling; and when land does sell, it's selling at 50 to 60 percent under the peak People purposely are trying to hold land off the market [because] the real values are substantially lower  As the land value goes down, the debt [unintelligible] will get very, very high at the agricultural banks Cash flow just isn't going to be adequate to service the debt The concern among the ag banks is getting very high I went to the Iowa bankers meeting in Sioux City last weekend and I was pleased to get out of town in one piece! They are pretty close-mouthed about the problem but they all can see that the losses are going to be very substantial when they total the direct loans to the farmers and the indirect loans to suppliers and merchants and the like Also in the Midwest there has been a lot of this trading of banks around that is supported by loans on bank stock, and I have a hunch that that will be a problem that's going to grow in magnitude When you add those together, I think the losses on the portfolios are going to be very substantial Another way of saying that the numbers hide the nature of the problem a little is this Of the 530 state banks in Iowa only 15 have capital of 7 percent or less; and of those 15, 12 are between 6 and 7 percent, which would suggest that there isn't a problem from a capital point of view But when asset quality problems arise, a bank can go through capital awfully darn fast and all of a sudden there is an escalating problem The Superintendent of Banks in Iowa suggests that about 140 of their 530 banks are what he would call problem banks and by that he means that 60 percent of capital is classified But he thinks that number is going to go up and that by the end of the year about half of their banks will be in the problem category These are all, I think, small banks and this is somewhat of a regional problem as opposed to one with broad national implications But I do suggest to you that this agricultural problem--and, again, it can't be news to you--is serious and is escalating and that the number of bank failures is going to be significantly higher in the Midwest this year than was the case last year It is not at a level nor of the type of institution that could be destabilizing, but I think it is a risk that merits notice  Well, Mr Chairman, I would be with those who endorse alternative II It seems to me that the reasons are very compelling to utilize that alternative, and I'm not sure I'm impressed by any compelling reasons to make a change at this point The economic outlook as we discussed it around the table seems pretty solid The inflation outlook is not unreasonable, although it certainly continues to be an area that we need to focus on And the velocity patterns seem to be more predictable than has been the case So, I would be in favor of alternative II I certainly would think that raising the M3 and credit aggregate ranges would be appropriate And I think we should begin to place much greater emphasis on M1 and that that should be clear in the message that you will be giving I would think that the longer-run objective for the year ought to be toward the middle part and I would prefer that we not necessarily specify that we would be in the upper or lower part of the range I would be bilateral on that, depending on how the velocity outlook develops during the year Our objective should be toward the middle; by so doing, we continue to give emphasis and credibility to the objective of returning to reasonable price stability  Well, I was in favor of alternative II before and alternative B here seems to fit that pattern appropriately So, for the reasons I've stated, I'd be in favor of alternative B  If we're contemplating a shift to parallel lines, do you have to spend a lot of time talking about where we are in relationship to the cone?

2736,1985-03-26," Not on that point But with regard to the holdings, I would like to raise a question with regard to Farm Credit Bank holdings in the System Account Given the circumstances, I wonder whether it would be appropriate to add to those holdings during the current year  I would just like to raise a question--not on the current holdings of Farm Credit Bank bonds--but whether adding to those holdings is appropriate I don't know what the credit status of those bonds is but everything I hear leads me to believe that there are some questions about it It is conceivable that we might get into a position later on where we will have to be financing that and we could be in the awkward position of holding the bonds and having added to the bond holdings during the year and at the same time we would be financing it I just raise the question as to whether this is appropriate  I would think that if there is any substantial question about the credit standing of the Farm Credit Banks, maybe it would be appropriate not to be adding to those holdings  Well, I think the attitude [should be] to try to reduce gradually our holdings without creating any tremor in the market  I don't mean by selling But where it is possible without creating any market image problems, that seems to me appropriate  Well, the snow is gone in Chicago and I was feeling pretty good until I got here! I think any comments I would make on the economic scene are probably consistent with what I've said at previous meetings The expansion in the Middle West continues, albeit at a more modest rate than is true with regard to the national figures But these imbalances also continue Some of the good businesses are doing quite well; autos and retail sales are examples of that and they anticipate a good year The bad businesses, though, are not doing well In some cases they are really doing very, very badly Agriculture and anything to do with agriculture--capital goods, machine tools, and the like--are examples of that  A couple of more specific comments Consistent with what other people have suggested, I certainly am hearing more and more about the impact this high value of the dollar is having with regard to both imports and exports And I think there's somewhat of a grim, growing realization with the passage of time that the impact caused by this is becoming a little more permanent There is an awful lot of foreign inventory that has been shipped and is wandering around the country Distribution channels by and large are in place and I think have been established in a way that is going to be very difficult to break A lot of production facilities have been closed; I think that's another way of saying that we may have become more dependent on foreign markets than we earlier realized And I think there's a growing realization of that Another mini-comment regarding the economic outlook relates to railroad car loadings I was talking to the CEO of a large company the other day that has a major operating railroad and he commented that this is the third consecutive month of decline in car loadings after 18 consecutive months of increases There is some noise in the numbers; trucks and barges are taking a bigger part of all this and it's a little hard to track that But still, there are some commodities that don't lend themselves to either truck or barge traffic that are showing declines This guy would not suggest that this is a forecast of a turn in the economy Nonetheless, in the past, it has been a pretty good indicator and I think it's something we ought to keep our eye on  Yes, year-over-year Turning to monetary policy, it does seem to me that despite these cautionary comments, no one that I talk to is suggesting that we face a recession I think they can  -19-    3/26/85  see far enough through the year with regard to their order books and backlogs that they anticipate a continuation of the expansion It does seem to me that growth in the aggregates has been pretty strong-- although perhaps March will come in at a lower number--and that unless we begin to take some corrective actions here and now, we could be in a position later on of having to be a bit more abrupt Therefore, I'd suggest not something overt but just a little gentle leaning to begin to be sure that we do have control of the aggregates and to preclude the possibility of inflationary pressures later on in the year  I'm a little unclear on the current borrowing level and where we really are; perhaps Steve and Peter could clarify it I have somewhat the feeling that we have been operating at a higher level since the last meeting than perhaps the target and that, as a consequence, the current level would take us someplace between ""B"" and ""C"" If that's right, that might suggest that ""B"" in fact would represent a slight easing from where we are Is that a reasonable statement of the case?  Well, let me try to make a case for something between ""B"" and ""C"" if I could First, we did establish the ranges for the aggregates just a few weeks ago And in your testimony I think you made it clear with regard to M1 that, with some caveats, we would be within the range but certainly within the upper part of the range I think the earlier conversation around the table would have suggested that there are some greater risks this time than perhaps at the last meeting; nonetheless, nothing that I heard would cause a specific downward reduction in our forecast The risks may be on the down side but they are not enough to suggest a downward revision in the forecast itself  Well, I'm talking about in a really major sense I have a feeling that maybe we are currently between ""B"" and ""C"" and I would be in favor of maintaining the position that we have now with perhaps a slightly higher degree of pressure Therefore, I might suggest for M1 a growth rate of, say, 6 percent, and a borrowing level of between $500 and $600 million, or in that area  Chuck, we have had a lot of inquiries; there is a tremendous amount of interest I think people have reaffirmed that the problem was not liquidity but rather asset quality Nonetheless, there have been a lot of inquiries and a general appreciation that, having faced the problem, we've developed a solution to try and deal with it But no takers--  I would think the $350 to $500 million would be a good compromise for the difference  Isn't $350 to $400 million a very narrow range? Really?  Yes "
2760,1985-05-21," Well, I do think we are in a period when the signals are decidedly mixed at best and are very conflicting The good businesses are continuing to do pretty well and are continuing at a pretty good level; the automobile business is good even though it has leveled off a bit Those in the industry do say that the dip in the early part of May should not be taken as a change in the trend They view it rather as a comparative issue, given a very strong period the year before Retail sales in our District, if you put March and April together and adjust for Easter, are really very strong; commercial building is particularly strong--indeed I think perhaps too strong; steel output is rising a bit; and the service sector is strong But on the negative side, I think the news is very serious The capital goods people are experiencing a slowdown this year as    5/21/85  compared to last year, and last year certainly was not very strong One CEO I talked to who has a very heavy commitment to the capital goods sector said that his company had a really dreadful month in April and if they had another month or two like that, he would be very, very worried about the outlook  The agricultural situation is deteriorating further Land values are down We had a good planting season this year and are considerably ahead of last year; some 83 percent of the farm planting is done Therefore, over the long time between now and harvest the outlook is for higher levels of production, which will have a depressing effect on commodity prices Anybody who has anything to do with the agricultural sector is having a very tough time The implement people are operating their plants at about 30 percent of capacity and there is a significant number of plants that have just simply shut down I commented last time that railroad shipping and car-loadings were down; we have had another period here in which the railroad shippings are down There's an interesting import implication here that one man told me about Whereas before they were shipping [unintelligible], now the parts are coming in in a finished state and are by and large being shipped by truck  On the inflation front, I think the news is mixed I agree with Mike that many of the positive factors may be behind us and that there are some very significant increases taking place in the services side, in pretty steep amounts But more positively, I am impressed with the number of people I have talked to who are still renegotiating contracts for three years in the 3 to 4 percent area And they are finding their union negotiators to be very, very flexible with regard to work rules They are getting very significant productivity increases as a consequence of this And the pricing out there is terribly competitive; the people I have talked to just simply can't get price increases through in a full sense If there are any trends that are persistent in all this, I think one is that expectations are being revised downward I haven't talked with anybody who is revising his expectations upward No one that I talked with suggests that we are on the edge of a recession; nonetheless, they do think that the outlook for the rest of the year and next year is more modest  I think that the most significant trend is this export-import problem and the dollar value I have a couple of anecdotes First, cement--and I have always had the feeling that cement was a commodity that was very, very transportation sensitive in that beyond 200 miles [shipments] fell off the edge of the table Fifteen percent of the cement consumption this year is going to be from imports, which I find rather staggering Also, we had our first meeting of our small business advisory council, a group that I would have thought would be absolutely insulated from this dollar problem We had a representative from Indiana, and one from Iowa and both of them said that without a single doubt the most difficult problem they are having is the export-import problem--the value of the dollar Their industries and businesses are being very hard hit by imports As I look at it, I think this high value of the dollar is the most pervasive problem that we are dealing with The economic news is pretty mixed and the inflation news is pretty mixed, and I think that we are probably in a period where it is awfully difficult to tell how the future is going to unfold    5/21/85  Well, I do think we are probably at a time where maintaining the existing degree of reserve pressure is appropriate I am a little unclear as to whether that is ""B"" or ""C"" at this point I am a bit uncertain about the thrift aspect of the borrowing level, so I think I would favor alternative B If I were going to vary from that, I would have a slight tendency toward ""C,"" which maybe suggests raising the borrowing level a bit from the earlier recommendations to the area of $400 million That seems to me probably about where we are, adjusting for the thrift borrowing  But is 6 to 7 percent consistent with ""maintain the existing""? It seems to me that that doesn't line up "
2782,1985-07-09," Mike, I have a question with regard to labor productivity and unit labor costs With productivity continuing to increase and with compensation continuing to be fairly level through '86 [in your forecast], I am a little surprised that the unit labor cost doesn't show more improvement than it does or, in fact, come down a bit If these numbers are right, I'm also a bit surprised that your expectation regarding inflation isn't a little higher Can you rationalize that?  That is the question that I asked  Well, without getting into the issue of whether or not 2-1/2 percent growth is enough or whether or not we can do anything about it, our forecast is quite parallel to the Board staff's--a touch on the higher side The unevenness that we have had in the District continues, and at this point there is no reason to expect any fundamental change in that between now and the end of the current cycle, particularly in light of the high value of the dollar Many of the companies that are in the heavy capital area really don't think that they are going to get back to the levels of 1978 and 1979 But there are other parts of the economy--autos, for example--that are doing well and as I talk to people about next year they continue to think they are going to have a good year next year Residential building is going to be strong Many retail people think that this year will continue to be good and that next year will be good There are some risks out there I won't belabor the agricultural problem, at least at this point But I do think that as we look at it, the opportunity for a continued expansion at about the rate that is forecast is entirely reasonable We are doing this against the background of a highly stimulative fiscal policy and a monetary policy that I think is at least accommodative and, as a consequence, at this point the risk of a recession or any significant downside run from the forecast is somewhat unlikely Therefore, I agree with Mr Morris that the opportunity is for a continued expansion, perhaps at about the rate that is suggested  Right If we have any bias, it's that the inflation rate will be higher than the staff is suggesting Our GNP number in terms of real growth is just a touch on the higher side  Well, I think the exchange rate situation is likely to turn around a little; it seems to me that there are some underlying pressures there that will add to prices And, frankly, it does seem to me that we have a monetary policy that provides a background in which the opportunity for price increases is really there Over the last two or three months we have put a lot of money into the system and, if history is any guide, that ultimately ought to result in a higher level of prices  I would like to see it up  What's the outlook for, say, July?  As I hear the numbers, it appears that if we rebase--and I think there are some compelling reasons to rebase--and maintain the same 4 to 7 percent range, there is a high probability that we would be about in the range Or a possibility--  While the objective in proposal 2 as stated--that we would expect M1 growth to slow down in the second half--is  -41-    7/9-10/85  obviously something we desire, that proposal seems a bit on the vague side Perhaps we do need to be just a bit more specific about what we plan to do and how we plan to do it Just to say it again It seems to me that the arguments for rebasing are compelling and I would be in favor of rebasing; I quite recognize that this may not be the last time that we have to do it I don't think we ought to get into the business of rebasing every other meeting--nor would I expect that to occur--but I don't see anything wrong with rebasing now and perhaps having to rebase some time in the future if there is a recurrence of some of these events But I do think that we need to be a little more specific as to how we are going to be conducting monetary policy I think rebasing is a way of recognizing that something has taken place that we need to deal with Reestablishing a range provides some guidance as to what we plan to do, though always being able to use judgment as we go along So I would be in favor of rebasing, reaffirming the ranges at least for this year, and going into next year very likely with the same ranges in place for next year that we have for this year  In that this is a preliminary look at next year, it seems to me that establishing a range of 4 to 7 percent now would be appropriate If the circumstances are significantly changed at the end of the year and we want to have a higher range next year, we will be perfectly free to do that when we get into the February meeting  I would be in favor of that I'd be a little clearer in my judgment if I knew what we were going to do with regard to the rebasing of ranges But basically, I'd be in favor of ""B""  Right, with a trending up in the borrowing along the lines you described  Tolerance of--  7 percent  What's the message that moving the band from 3 points to 5 points conveys to the markets?  It's a fairly heavy change  Then what do we do about the range for next year if we have 3 to 8 percent for the rest of this year?  Again, this is preliminary What if we did go to 3 to 8 percent now and 4 to 7 percent but use some caveats that if the normal relationships didn't reemerge, we might consider a wider band?  Well, they might  -70-    7/9-10/85  But in the interim, don't you think it would be useful to have a message out there that we intend to continue moving toward price stability? This is a way we can accomplish that  3 to 7  It's too early to form a judgment "
2807,1985-08-20," Did they defer a long-term issue within the last week or so?  Well, I am certainly in no way disagreeing with Jim's forecast and there really is very little I can add to previous reports that I have given at other meetings Weak sectors in the Midwest are continuing to be very weak, with no particular signs of improvement And I think at this point some of these very heavy industries really won't experience a significant change this cycle But offsetting that, those parts of the economy that have been doing better continue to do well, and from that perspective the current outlook is pretty good In autos, for example, the people I've talked to say that despite some aberrations in the current numbers, the underlying demand continues to be pretty good Construction activity is relatively strong and consumer spending seems to be okay But perhaps for emphasis, I would echo Roger's comments about the agricultural situation Land values as we look at them continue to decline In Iowa, for example, in a statistical sense land values are down almost 30 percent from last year and some 45 percent from the peak I agree with Roger that this is a statistical look at land values; the transactions that are occurring, are in fact [at prices that are] substantially under that And given the pressure on commodity prices, I would think that land values are going to continue to come down Whereas in the past we have had the view that this is all containable and not systemic, I do think it is beginning to back up--both from the banking sector as well as from the farm credit situation In sum, with the passage of time and with continued deterioration, it begins to take on some systemic implications  My view would be very consistent with Emmett's comments It does seem that we want to be very careful of what we do But we have a high trajectory of the aggregates, particularly M1, and I also think that we need to begin to scale down as we come toward the end of the year So I would end up being in favor of alternative B I'd also move up the borrowings just very slightly to about the $500 million range, as a way to begin to take these initial steps  If, say, M1 in September came in on the low side, the way that Steve suggested in the Bluebook, does that mean that in fact we would move the borrowing down to $350 million, whereas if that  -34-    8/20/85  expectation does not come to pass--if we have a higher number--we would aim toward the $500 million? Is that the operative translation?  I was assuming all other things might be equal  Hearing the way you described that range, certainly from my point of view that would be an acceptable approach  How about that word ""markedly""?  Yes, but it is subject to judgment, and people will interpret it one way that may not be appropriate I'd eliminate it  It's not a strong preference, but I would prefer ""would""  Right "
2833,1985-10-01," I raise the same question on the capacity For example, the automobile industry domestically is operating about flat out currently They are trying to speed up their lines and they are adding shifts But fundamentally, the people I've talked to are saying that never again will they add another dollar's worth of capacity on the domestic side If there is any shift, they will begin to bring in more products from Mexico and Korea They are not going to add to their capacity So, I think there are an awful lot of industries that have quietly--and some not so quietly--taken capacity off the line So, if we get a resurgence of demand for domestic output, the capacity would really--  In a broad context, certainly, our outlook for the economy would be very consistent with the forecast that Jim gave earlier in the meeting But as has been the case, we have had in the Midwest this terrible unevenness, and that certainly has continued Some of the areas are doing very well We've already commented about the auto sector, but I've just been staggered by how effective the price incentive has been It is surely causing some imbalance in  -14-    10/1/85  sales Nonetheless, looking ahead to next year, the people I talked to expect--and I think our forecast suggests--a very, very good auto year of, say, 104 to 106 million in sales or something like that So the high sales level this year isn't taking too much from that In retail sales, the people I talked with say that year-to-date sales are running 6 to 7 percent ahead of last year That outlook looks pretty good Looking ahead to Christmas, even though it's awfully early to see that far ahead, I think they are looking for a 4 to 5 percent increase, even though there is a shorter selling period Commercial construction, particularly in Chicago, continues to be very, very strong I am afraid a lot of it is tax-oriented, but buildings are going up at a pretty rapid rate On the bad side, there is agriculture There is nothing new I can shed on that particular problem other than to say that, as these harvests are beginning to come in, the news is very very bad; I think we are going to see a continued deterioration in that whole sector  On the inflation front, I really continue to be very impressed by how good the news looks The people I talked with, even those who have businesses that are doing pretty well, are negotiating contracts with annual increases as low as 2 percent, with 3 to 3-1/2 percent fairly typical for under-3-year contracts They are getting very good changes in work rules and, therefore, have high confidence that productivity will enable them to overcome even those modest increases And materials costs continue to be very, very tight; 1 or 2 percent increases in materials costs are pretty typical; 3 to 4 percent would be very much on the high side So everybody I talked to is very optimistic, really, on the inflation front All of that, of course, is excluding our comments earlier this morning  Moving to monetary policy, it does seem to me that we are in a period when, because of the various circumstances, we have a buildup--both in terms of number and magnitude--of problems that are at the least very, very worrisome Given that array of problems, I think frankly that we have to be very rate sensitive; I don't think that we can afford to change the status quo too much M1 is going through an erratic period and we ought to recognize that it is very erratic Therefore, I would be in favor of maintaining the status quo in terms of the borrowing level and the fed funds rate and I think alternative B addresses that objective I would suggest a borrowing level of, say, $500 million and a fed funds rate at the current level without tolerating much of an increase  Do we really want to say a marked slowing of M1 growth is expected?  SPEAKER(?) Sure  Couldn't we say something like ""It's entirely possible that M1 growth might slow""?  No, I'm having a very difficult time determining the differences between these two  I think that might be fine But I really do have a bit of a problem with this phrase, ""marked slowing of M1 growth"" in variant II  I suppose what you're saying is that even if it goes from 20 percent to 15 percent, 5 percent is a significant amount But that, I think, has a kind of improper implication I just think it would be better if we were a bit vaguer on that, say, ""It's entirely possible that Ml""-- "
2857,1985-11-04," There really is very little to report in the way of change in our District since the last meeting Those businesses that have been showing some strength continue to do reasonably well But there is certainly no noticeable improvement for the beleaguered The steel industry and most lines of mechanical equipment remain awfully weak On the steel side, the import restraints have had some effect but they have been far from perfect And pricing conditions in the industry are very intense Agriculture, I think, speaks for itself The harvests have been late because of wet weather Nonetheless, the crop estimates are being increased a bit, so that the pressure will continue on commodity prices More positively--we've commented on the construction industry--certainly commercial construction in Chicago is very strong I saw a presentation the other day showing that Chicago is going through a building period that has been unsurpassed since the great fire An awful lot of buildings are going up Just to add a comment to what Jim said earlier, the auto inventories really are very low; when they finished this big sales program they were down to 24 to 26 days' [supply], which was the lowest inventory level in some 20 years So, for the rest of this quarter and going through January, one manufacturer at least is going to be running absolutely flat out including their maximum overtime schedule They will be running their plants at the absolute maximum at least through January Their outlook for '86 with regard to car sales is pretty good--a bit lower than ours but nonetheless the recent sales program hasn't had as big an impact on the '86 volume as one might have expected On balance, as we look at conditions in the District, the staff forecast would be rather consistent with the way that we see it  -11-    11/4-5/85 "
2881,1985-12-16," Sam, related to that, what kind of [mood do] the markets have regarding the fundamentals, excluding intervention? Before, we had worried very much about a precipitous decline in the value of the dollar In certain circumstances, is there still a pervasive feeling about that or do circumstances--  Well, excluding the policy changes or activities on our part, such as intervention--the issues Ed was talking about--is there any sentiment out there that we could see a stabilization and a rise in the value of the dollar?  Given the results of M1 this year, I certainly think abandoning the range would have some appeal But other than the legal aspect, it seems to me that there are public perception aspects that would be difficult By saying that we are not going to establish a range and that we have a lot of work going on to try and get a better understanding of what has been going on gives me the impression that we have a bunch of engineers in the back room busily cranking away and at some early point we'll come up with an ideal model that might work It might indeed work, but we would have to have a considerable period of time to feel comfortable with that Clearly, in my mind, we're going through a period of considerable uncertainty But given that, I would be inclined to use ranges as broad as possible, perhaps at least as broad as this year or maybe wider and certainly not narrower I'd just put in the testimony a lot of judgmental comments as to how we are going to end up in those ranges as the year evolves  In terms of the Midwest perspective, our feelings both currently and prospectively are very much unchanged from the previous meetings As we look ahead we think the expansion will continue, albeit modestly and certainly unevenly Therefore, our outlook is certainly consistent with the staff's forecast Indeed, perhaps there is an opportunity for somewhat improved results next year as opposed to what the staff is suggesting, as the risk of coming in weaker is diminishing, I think  -32-    12/16-17/85  I have a couple of specific comments I almost hate to mention it, but the agricultural situation does continue out there And I think the situation is, if anything, more serious The crop harvest is about completed, on normal schedule, but the production is going to be very significantly higher than last year That will continue to put pressure on commodity prices, and I think we're in a period in which production loans are going to have to be paid off It will be interesting to see how the production values come in relative to the loans There is also, of course, the issue of land values; the rate of decline certainly is diminishing but values are down very substantially whereas the debt has not come down So we have this very difficult gap between debt and land values, which has to be dealt with As a consequence of all this, I think the stress on the agricultural banks is continuing in a very significant way Their charge-offs this year are going to be substantially higher than was the case last year A very significant number of them are going to show losses this year as compared to last year So the agricultural problem continues to be very important  My second comment is on the tax bill I must say that the people I talk with say this continual uncertainty is extremely difficult from a planning perspective They just are having an awfully tough time figuring out what to do There are a lot of people who say cynically that a bad bill would be better than this continuing uncertainty that they are dealing with Also, as kind of an editorial comment Those in the manufacturing sector do feel that the bill as it has been proposed by the House is, at least from their point of view, a very bad bill  I think the most significant change that I've seen over the last few weeks is related to this exchange value of the dollar The attitudinal change that I sense out there is just very important No one will say they got this deal or that deal because the value of the dollar is down; but everybody says it just is a much better environment in which to at least negotiate They'd like more In terms of the yen, they would like 180 or 190 But most importantly, they are pleased with what has been accomplished and are very hopeful that the rate will not go back up The whole change of attitude based on this I find very, very positive  The bankers are getting very afraid out there Attitudes and emotions, particularly in Iowa, are getting very, very frayed There have been some bad incidents I don't think that is necessarily symptomatic of the economic circumstances, but I don't sense any improvement at all  Still, comparatively, it's awfully low as you go back the last few years  Well, I tend to support the position laid out by Messrs Boehne and Guffey I do think there have been some important changes over the last few weeks and, as a consequence, that we have something of an opportunity here that we ought to take advantage of The economic outlook, I think we agree, is positive I don't think I heard anybody talk about a recession near term But also I must say I don't have any sense that there's a significant risk of--  Well, as I heard the comments, at least near term, I didn't hear that risk But on the other side of that coin, I don't think I heard anybody suggest that we are significantly at risk of an overheated economy, at least near term With regard to inflation, notwithstanding the Chairman's comments, people I talk to in terms of labor contracts, for example, are still negotiating very, very favorable contracts with good work rule changes And in terms of pricing, the competition out there is just very, very rough As a consequence, I have a positive outlook on the inflationary side As for the exchange rates, it's always dangerous to talk about exchange rates because you have to be on the Desk to know what is really happening But I have some fear, as I said yesterday, that while earlier we were concerned about a precipitous decline, maybe we are getting into an area of at least stability The declines that we have had had such an important and positive effect here on those who were most affected, I'd like to try and provide an environment in which we could continue at least to stabilize and hopefully continue to get something of a decline But it is the interest rate side where I think there is the biggest change Yes, medium- and long-term rates have been going down for quite some while and short-term rates not so much But, frankly, I think the discount rate at this point is something of a barrier to a further decline in short-term rates As a consequence of all this, I think that the discount rate becomes terribly important in our considerations If I had my druthers, I'd opt for alternative B with a reduction in the discount rate and the borrowing level maintained at, say, $400 to $450 million But if timing were a complicated consideration and, therefore, if the discount rate were going to remain at its current level, I'd go for alternative A and reduce the borrowing level to the $200 to $250 million range  I agree with the approach I just wonder operationally if that's a wide enough band for you to operate with or whether you ought not to have a little more--  That was my point If, say, you pick a range of $250 to $450 million, you might accomplish that "
2907,1986-02-11," Ted, could you go over chart 17, the agricultural export chart, again? Apparently, you're forecasting an increase in export volume in the first half of 1986, then a decline, and then back up in 1987  Our forecast for the year is in substantial agreement with the Board staff's forecast We have a little less in terms of real GNP; that may reflect a Midwestern prospective We are a touch higher on the deflator, primarily because we have not forecast such a significant decrease in the price of oil Within that broad sense of agreement, though, we have some differences Our housing start numbers are a bit lower than the staff forecast, based primarily on the input of 2 or 3 of our directors who have had a pretty good track record on that in the past For commercial structures we are significantly higher; we think that the level of starts will taper off very considerably and significantly, but there are enough projects on the drawing boards that are committed to at this point that that ought to carry us through this year  Turning now to a couple of comments about the District Since the last meeting I think there has been a perceptible improvement in tone and attitudes, at least among the people I talk to I talked to a large retailer who just had an excellent January--16 percent over January of last year and the best month they had ever had They will have given a lot of it back in February, but they have a very ambitious objective for the year and they think they are going to make it On the auto side, people I talk to in Detroit are forecasting a slightly lower auto year than we are--103 to 104 million units But the production schedules for the first quarter are a bit heavier than was the case last year and the production schedules for the second quarter are about level, despite the fact that GM has this enormous inventory on its hands In heavy manufacturing there is some improvement, with backlogs up just a bit They are nowhere near the  -17-    2/11-12/86  peak levels reached before and they are never going to get back there; nonetheless, the attitude is somewhat better there  On the agricultural side, I can't suggest that we are going to see any improvement necessarily in 1986, but I think at least the rate of deterioration is moderating Land values have got to be getting down to some point of stability; and certainly, we do see a decrease in the rate of decline in land sales Farm [unintelligible] improved farm liquidity, and I think the work that has been done with the Farm Credit System at least clarifies an area of significant uncertainty A couple of negatively pervasive comments that I hear are Gramm-Rudman and tax reform Tax reform was described by one man, a [corporate] chairman, as the worst piece of legislation he had seen in twenty years On the positive side, [my contacts are] very pervasively positive on inflation I am talking to people who still are negotiating wage contracts three years long which tend to be in the 3 percent range commonly, or even 2 percent on the low side And I do think that there is something of a sea change out there on the part of organized labor; their attitudes as they go into the contractual process are entirely different now than in the past Pricing--  I am saying it's lower than it has been in the past Whereas people in the past have had--  Yes  Again, three-year contracts are being negotiated at a 2 percent annual cost on the low side and 3 percent as a common tendency but importantly with good work rule changes also; therefore, productivity prospects are improved I think pricing [unintelligible] continues to be very, very tight The margins are holding and there seems to be very little room for price increases, so that aspect of the inflationary equation ought to be pretty good As we look at the year, we think it will be a positive year, pretty much in line with the Board staff's forecast  Jerry, the number for the second quarter--sorry, I don't have the numbers here It was about 22 or 23 million, I think, for the first quarter, and that was about flat out Ford is running flat out; GM has pulled back a bit  Ford attempts to be pretty general throughout their line They are running very rapidly They are increasing the line speed and they are working Sundays  I think we agreed yesterday that the economic outlook is certainly positive, but I also heard an unusually long list of uncertainties that seem particularly serious So I would favor adopting a policy that gives us reasonable maneuvering room; I hope that would convey that [uncertainty] to the market We certainly want to avoid any unintended signals and just possibly changing the tentative ranges might do that I also think that continuing the ranges that we have had in place this last year could, in fact, convey a continuation of our policy So I would join those who suggest using last year's M1 range of 3 to 8 percent and continuing to view M1 as a guide in careful coordination with M2 and M3, as Steve has outlined It seems to me that the broader range deals with some of the uncertainties and gives us some maneuvering room and that under the circumstances that would be the appropriate choice  Given all the circumstances and the crosscurrents that we've talked about, it seems to me that at this particular moment maintaining the existing policy is appropriate We are at a time when there is a reasonably short interval until the next meeting and, therefore, we have an opportunity fairly quickly to review what we are doing Therefore, I would be in favor of alternative B and the borrowing range of $300 to $400 million, but with a careful eye on the federal funds rate I certainly wouldn't want it to go over the 8 percent level It seems to me that many of the problems we have talked about would be exacerbated by higher rates On the other hand, we certainly want to watch the inflationary tendencies very carefully Again, we have a fairly short period to deal with here and I think alternative B, the existing policy, is appropriate  Yes  -63-    2/11-12/86 "
2933,1986-04-01," In our part of the Midwest, the situation also seems to be improved for the three familiar reasons that Jim enumerated I think the fundamentals are better and I think they have been and will be enormously helpful As I talk to people, I have sensed a significant improvement in tone and attitudes over the last couple of months I hate to mention the agricultural situation one more time but I guess I feel compelled to I had hoped really that the situation in 1986 was going to be better than in 1985 but I am changing my view on that The rate of decline certainly has slowed this year; but I think the year as a whole is probably is going to be worse than 1985 I talked to a very senior guy yesterday who told me    4/1/86  about some land that had traded at $800 to $900 an acre, which is the lowest I have heard so far And even at those low levels, with the present level of commodity prices, this land will just barely [unintelligible] cash flow The exchange value of the dollar is helpful, of course, in the agricultural sector but the trade patterns are largely in place and are very, very tough to change--certainly so soon So that won't be quite as helpful as might have been expected The agricultural equipment business is going to be very tough this year Inventories at the dealer level are extremely high; they're just not moving, and pricing is wicked So the implement people are continuing to lay off [workers] and to curtail their production, and they are going to have a tough year The government programs certainly are helpful but they are also very confusing There is a new industry developing in the Midwest consultants who hold meetings and try to explain the various agricultural programs, which are very confusing, to the farmers Those programs are helpful, but when you break it down on a per farm basis, particularly in Iowa which is a corn area, the per farm assistance provided by government programs isn't as great as one might have expected  Just to add our comments about mortgage refinancings One of our directors last week characterized this year as the year of the mortgage refinancing He quantified the difference in monthly payments between a 14 percent loan and a 10 percent loan on a mortgage loan of some size And in terms of the monthly payments it really does amount to a significant amount of money, which certainly ought to be helpful for consumer spending In his view, any loan at a rate of 11-1/2 percent or over can be profitably refinanced But there are perhaps two negative aspects of this First, he suggested that the impact of this on the thrifts is going to be very very tough; that yield on the asset side of their balance sheets is going to go down significantly and the liability side may not be quite structured to deal with it Secondly--and I think we are beginning to see this-- because of the very heavy volume of refinancing going on, it is going to be tougher to get financing for new homes This potentially could have a bit of an adverse effect on new home sales But as we consider the overall situation, I think my comments will be similar to those of others that the outlook continues to be positive and that the second half of the year ought to show an improvement over the first half  I would be in favor of ""B,"" but I might also tend a little toward ""A"" despite the positive tone of the comments regarding the economy earlier Nevertheless, the current situation is a little on the weak side and though we all expect the longer run to be better, it's a little uncertain It does seem to me that the longer-run outlook will be validated if we are able to maintain these levels of interest rates I am just a little bothered by some of the comments with regard to rates that are incorporated in the text around alternative B So, I would choose ""B,"" but on the borrowing I would tend to want between $200 and $300 million as the alternative "
2958,1986-05-20," Conditions in our part of the Midwest also are very largely unchanged from the last meeting There is that general expectation that the third and fourth quarters will be significantly improved, but I must say the current level of activity is considerably under those expectations As always, the areas that have been strong continue to be strong I note particularly the real estate side, which is growing very, very rapidly pretty much across the board And that, of course, pervades all of the related activities such as materials manufacturers, suppliers, and the like Office building in the suburban Chicago area is beginning to slow down, but in the downtown Chicago area the projects are being completed and new projects are under way; I am quite surprised by the continuation of    5/20/86  the heavy building in the commercial office building area On the residential side in our District--and I guess this is typical of many parts of the country--over the last three months new permits for housing starts are up by some 40 percent over a similar period last year So housing starts are growing very, very rapidly  Alternatively, on the weak side, there is no really significant improvement in heavy manufacturing Almost surprisingly, the decline in the dollar has not yet worked its way through in terms of a substantial pickup in orders and production The environment is better, I am told, but in terms of actually getting deals it has not been much of a help An exception to this is the paper board/paper box industry which is growing very, very rapidly; their order books early this year--in February, really--on the export side began to take off So, they are exporting very heavily and that has been helpful  On the inflation side, I have two comments First, on pricing Everybody I have talked to says that the pricing in the marketplace pretty much across the board is very fierce They are just unable to get price increases to stick in any significant way The labor side is consistent with what Jim has suggested Contracts are continuing to be negotiated on very favorable terms three-year contracts, with good changes in the work rules and improvement on the benefits side, so that unit labor costs seem to be under pretty good control So, in an inflation sense, the outlook looks pretty good Net, our outlook is consistent with the staff forecast; but having said that we would be pleased to see the whites of the eyes of the third- and fourth-quarter numbers because they look a little remote right now  Well, I'd also favor alternative B, largely for the reasons Bob stated I came to the meeting wondering whether we might not fiddle with the words ""might"" and ""would;"" but based on the conversation I would not I would make it symmetrical on both sides I'd favor the second draft alternative That seems to me a responsible way of dealing with the aberrations that we've experienced I just have a slight fear that if we drop the numbers altogether, as called for in the third alternative draft, it might be a bit [unintelligible] for doing anything like that We might save that for the July meeting So, I'd be in favor of ""B"" with the wording proposed in the second alternative "
2983,1986-07-08," Jim, I hear all the adverse comments about the staggered effects of the introduction of tax reform I think you said there was a one percent effect next year  Well, that was the point I wanted to make I also wanted to ask a question It seems to me that we have done this before We have introduced tax legislation on a staggered basis and, if I remember correctly, the economic effects were a little more significant than what you are suggesting, weren't they?  Yes  Thank you  Well, I wouldn't change the range for 1986 or for 1987, nor would I rebase for 1986, because I think for all the statements that we could make, I would have very little confidence in any range or any base that we might choose But I wouldn't drop the aggregate either for 1986 or 1987 I would think of the two periods as a continuum; I would leave the target where it is for this year and reestablish the range at the same level for next year, but make it perfectly clear that we might expect the results to be at very considerable variance with the target, and that in the interim period we are placing our emphasis on M2 and M3 I think [Jerry] made an important point that at some point these relationships are likely to come back into line and that we are going to want to reuse Ml when we have the confidence that those relationships have been reestablished If we keep it in the menu, I think it would be easier to accomplish that than if we drop it at this point  Well, Mr Chairman, our outlook for this year and next year is consistent with the staff forecast; our numbers are close in a broad sense In the Midwest conditions of expansion continue but certainly at a slower pace than in some other parts of the country The consumer side out our way is pretty vigorous Retail sales have been improving and one chain we talked to had the [best] May they have had in years Auto sales seem to be pretty high, about equal to last year's level But the manufacturing sector, as always, is pretty mixed There are parts of it that have been doing well and continue to do well; building products are an example of that All of the people in the building products side are operating pretty much at the top of their capacity Those parts that have been weak show no particular sign of improvement A somewhat recent development is that two large crane manufacturers in the Midwest in effect have gone out of that business; they just decided to get out  Heavy crane manufacturers Farm equipment and railroad equipment are operating at about 25 percent of their levels of the late 1970s Every once in a while, maybe for myself, I take a look at the railroad numbers In May of this year, for example, there were all of 950 cars ordered For the five months through May 1986, ordering has been at about the 6,000 level That's up from 1985, but for the full year in railway equipment there is the anticipation that there will be about 10,000 cars ordered That compares with the peak level in 1979 of about 90,000 That certainly is one example of a troubled industry  There are two specific areas that I thought I would comment on One is construction activity, which in the District and in Chicago particularly, has been and continues to be extraordinarily strong On the residential side, housing starts in the District for the [first] five months of the year are up 24 percent as compared with those five months a year ago In Illinois they are up 57 percent and I think that's the largest increase of any state in the country In Chicago the number is even much larger than 57 percent So, we have a very significant housing boom going on  In the nonresidential sector, floor contracts are continuing at what seem like increasing levels For the five months of this year floor area contracts on nonresidential [structures] are up about 5 percent; that's a contrast from the national figures, which indicate a slump And in Chicago the office boom continues despite the strong activity that we have had over the last two or three years Many buildings are being announced; in one way or another some 14 million square feet have been committed to over and above what is already going on My conclusion on this is that in the construction side we have some trends going on that certainly seem pretty unsustainable  On the inflation side, the news continues to be pretty good Pricing is terribly tight Everybody I talk to says that both raw material and product prices are extremely tight, with very little    7/8-9/86  give, and increases certainly just aren't sticking That's true even for the industries that are going through pretty high levels of activity Paperboard is an example That's an industry that is doing well This April they had the biggest April that they had ever had in that industry and yet even now the pricing is only very modestly recovered from the amount that they lost during the recession I commented before on labor contracts that have been settled I think the news there continues to be pretty good By and large the contracts are coming out on a three-year basis at about 3 percent or a touch under--a higher settlement in the first year but declining in the second and third years But importantly--and this goes back to a chart that Mike Prell was showing yesterday--I am hearing that there are very, very substantial work rule changes in these contracts Although managements are going after the financial side, they are really going all out after the work rule side As a consequence of those substantial work rule changes, in terms of unit labor costs, I think the outlook is pretty good Two steel companies have settled their contract negotiations; hourly wages were reduced and in both cases the COLAs were eliminated Inland Steel's contract was up for a vote The ballots were counted yesterday and I don't know how it came out, but that would suggest a similar pattern Caterpillar settled over the weekend They have not announced the terms of the deal, but they did reach a negotiation and the expectation is, or it's entirely possible, that it will call for a wage freeze but that they did not get rid of the COLA They wanted to get rid of the COLA but they did not  Caterpillar I know you saw the and I think he was suggesting to you a higher number  than, in fact, worked out It sounds like they got a freeze but didn't get rid of the COLA They went into [the negotiations] thinking they'd have a higher number Deere is next on the list and they will have a very tough negotiation; they would like to get rid of the COLA and they would like to get a freeze as well I might mention that there is a little mini-exception to this 3-year, 3 percent pattern that I mentioned It relates to us The Chicago Building Trades have been [unintelligible]--those that had an impact on our building projects There was a settlement there over the weekend for a 2-year contract and a 5 percent annual increase But I think that's a very narrow, very specialized kind of situation Net, the labor cost situation seems to be pretty good and the outlook for the next year or so okay  I have a final comment on this tax legislation As I talk to people, I have a growing feeling of gloominess on the business side in that the shift of the burden from the consumer to the business side seems to be having a heavier toll, at least on outlooks And I think the introduction of the changes on a staggered basis is causing apprehension I hear what Jim says as to the impact but, at least as I hear the comments, it sounds like it might have a greater effect on 1987 than perhaps they have provided for [in the forecast] As we look at it now, we expect the expansion to continue, though certainly at a more modest pace than was our expectation earlier in the year But at this point, as we view it, we are very, very dependent upon the consumer; and I think as a consequence it will be important that we do anything we can do to deal with the consumer side of this  -26-    7/8-9/86 "
3009,1986-08-19," What are the major terms and conditions on the commercial bank credit? And is that going to take a push and a shove to get across?  I have a fairly specific comment, but one that relates to heavy manufacturing I had an opportunity a couple of weeks ago to visit with  I think that reasonably describes the company Their principal market, of course, is He observes that that's an industry that has a very, very significant worldwide overcapacity Gradually, the business of the manufacture of  has been coming under foreign control; as you know, within the last week there has been a further development on that As a consequence, they just haven't had any benefit at all from the change in the value of the dollar and they say that the pricing in the market is just absolutely fierce They finally, and maybe belatedly, have come to the conclusion that they just can't compete [unintelligible] And they're going to begin to    8/19/86  move a greater percentage of their production offshore as a way of trying to maintain their position They just concluded that they can't compete when they manufacture domestically and that they're going to make a change These [changes] tend to be fairly permanent But it's the only way they see that they can remain viable in a very tough market  If we moved unilaterally and the Germans did not, what kind of pressures would occur on the dollar? Or is it on a slightly different track than it may have been in the past?  While our economic outlook continues to be positive, I do think there are some growing risks that loom on the down side and I think we would have a better opportunity to maintain the growing economic expansion if we were to reduce the rate structure somewhat Real rates continue to be a little on the high side I think that we have an opportunity here to reduce the discount rate and I would be in favor of doing that Therefore, I would recommend that alo'ng with a borrowing level of $300 million Certainly, this whole issue is vastly complicated by the international situation, which is terribly tough to judge if you are not intimately involved in it But I think, as others have said, that there is a chance that if we were to do a discount rate cut, it would put some additional pressure on the other central banks to move and, therefore, I would be in favor of doing it "
3035,1986-09-23," Conditions in our part of the Midwest, I think, are very much unchanged The trends that have been in place most of the year continue at about the same level But I continue to be struck by this incredible dichotomy between the good sectors of the economy and those that are relatively weak There is nothing new about that but that dichotomy certainly continues I think the automotive sector, which Jim referred to, is rather phenomenal Here we have had the third year in a row of auto sales over 10 million, which I think is a pretty good record, yet even now these incentive programs just have a phenomenal effect because sales have literally taken off Construction activity in the Midwest continues at a pretty high level Residential construction throughout the District is really quite strong; that's particularly true in Illinois where the numbers are running well over the national average We are perhaps slightly different from what Jim said on the commercial side; we are stabilizing in our commercial construction but nonetheless stabilizing at what seems like a pretty high level  On the negative side, the heavy manufacturing news continues to be pretty somber There is no particular improvement More and more companies are continuing to shift their production offshore to take advantage of lower wage rates They admit that they are late in doing it but nonetheless see an opportunity to take advantage of that trend On the tax bill, those that I talk to on the heavy manufacturing side are pretty glum as to the near-term effects that the bill, assuming it gets passed, is likely to have Our agricultural directors report that we have had, really, a perfect growing season and we're bracing for record production; the stories one hears about the storage problems and what they're going to do with all this are really quite phenomenal  On the inflation side, I think the general outlook continues to be favorable but there are just those few worrisome signs there As I suggested, housing starts in the Midwest are pretty strong In some suburban Chicago areas we're having significant prices increases --15 to 20 percent in the first six months of this year It's a very, very, strong housing market and the prices are going up We anticipate that apartment rents will be up 5 to 10 percent in the Chicago area And, I think everybody expects that the prices of imports, particularly cars, are going to begin to go up Offsetting that, the labor news, as Jim suggests, continues to be good Three- year contracts are prevalent and annual costs are very moderate I talked to somebody last week who settled a three-year contract with costs over the three-year period of 1 to 1-1/2 percent And the companies are getting very, very significant work rule changes--that's the big push now, of course On the pricing side--perhaps not in services, but certainly in manufacturing--there are pressures  As to the [national] outlook, certainly our outlook is consistent with the staff forecast But I agree with Governor Wallich that it's a very, very hard time to call it Everybody anticipates that we're going to see export activity pick up and that at some point imports will be under some constraint; but these events are certainly  -18-    9/23/86  getting to be long overdue Therefore, I think it is a tough call to judge just how strong the underlying strength of the economy really is Perhaps this is one of those times that we just have to stand back and see how things come in  I would join those in favor of alternative B without a tilt one way or another It seems to me that there are conflicting trends regarding the strength of the economic outlook and conflicting trends with regard to the inflationary situation To a large extent we have done our thing over the last few months Clearly, the markets are beginning to resist these changes Perhaps the decision the next time is going to be harder than it is this time; but for now I would simply stand back and see how events develop "
3061,1986-11-05," In our District the fundamental conditions are very consistent with the pattern that we've had, really, all year long The unevenness that I've commented on before certainly continues Those who are doing okay are really doing quite well, and the weak parts of our District show no particular signs of improvement I hate to bring the agricultural subject back up, but there has been a renewed outbreak of gloom in that area for two very different and diametrically opposed reasons First, the flood damage in September was localized, particularly in the central Michigan area,    11/5/86  but in the areas that were hardest hit the crops were virtually wiped out That, of course, is an adverse condition that's completely unrelated to the basic adjustments going on in agriculture The opposite problem exists in the other parts of the District The harvest is now largely completed and I am told that the production has just been huge, phenomenal While the acreage for total production will be down, on a per acre basis the yields have been very, very high That means, I think, that the carryover stocks are going to be heavy The pressure on commodity prices will continue In the third quarter we do a survey of land values and, again, we saw somewhat of a decline in land values Whereas we thought we were somewhat in the zone of stability with regard to land values I am beginning to hear that we're going to see another slide off--nothing too sharp--but nonetheless that we have a way to go before we get down to the bottom level And that suggests some more pressure on the agricultural banks, so we've got more to do there On the manufacturing side the adjustment process goes on I might note just a couple of late developments, which I'm sure you've read about GM has this overhang in the market They're probably going to close as many as 12 plants and that, of course, will have a significant impact on the District in terms of employment  Gee, I can't tell you that But I think 12 would be a fairly big percentage  Of that number probably 7 are going to be in our District We think the employment [effect] could be as high as say, 23,000, which would be a very, very significant number Another structural adjustment in the manufacturing sector comes [unintelligible] engine I think I commented the last time that they were thinking about downsizing their domestic production They have now announced that and will be outsourcing to a heavier degree than they have done in the past On the inflation side, I think the trend is continuing to be favorable; what I hear anecdotally is very much consistent with what Mike has suggested On the price side, as I hear it, the conditions are very, very competitive and it's very tough to get price increases to stick And on the wage side, people are continuing to get three-year contracts and very good work rule changes; average costs are favorable so that the productivity aspects, I think, have been pretty good  As for the outlook, certainly, our forecast is consistent with the staff's forecast We have every expectation that the expansion will continue at, say, 2-1/2 to 3 percent And importantly, we see no current signs that we can fall back into a recession; but on the other side, we don't think that there's a significant risk that we would break out on the up side either So, we're broadly consistent with the staff forecast  It is a capacity shift as opposed to necessarily a capacity reduction The plants I mentioned clearly are older and outmoded; it is a way of trimming them as opposed to making a very fundamental, huge reduction [in capacity]  Well, I think they will reduce their production but not in the magnitude that the numbers would suggest As Roger says, they are adding a plant in Kansas City They are right; there are a number of plants where they can add a second and third shift to pick up the production "
3084,1986-12-15," I would be in favor of continuing to follow Ml and certainly reporting on it, but I would be a little reluctant to re-establish the range at this point because the results are going to vary, probably, from whatever we target And as we go through the year, if the relationships tend to re-emerge and/or if GNP growth or inflation growth were to begin to move away on the high side, then at  -27-    12/15-16/86  that point I would re-establish the range to use it effectively But I'd establish a range that seems appropriate at that time  It seems to me that last July we established the tentative ranges and reduced them by 1/2 of a percent, really, to deliver a message--namely, that we were going to continue to control inflation That must really be an important part of any kind of mechanistic result Changes at this point, if we don't have a substantial reason for doing them, would give a rather false message Therefore, I would be in favor of maintaining the tentative ranges that we set out last summer to continue that message  Conditions in our District remain very much unchanged and are certainly consistent with the trends that have been in place for so many months now The unevenness which has been a feature of this whole cycle in our area certainly continues The plant closings are a tangible sign of all of this The last time we talked a bit about the GM plant closings that we thought would take place That announcement, of course, has been made and it certainly has had an enormously negative impact on the District, particularly in Michigan where they are going to be fairly hard hit Since then there have been quite a number of plant closings announced, and I must say that I find it distressing at this stage of the cycle to keep having this phenomenon take place  As I look ahead to next year--to say the obvious, I suppose-- the two major questions are 1) inflation; and 2) the trade picture On the inflation side, I have this feeling that once we get the energy and food effects through the cycle we are going to be into a fundamentally higher underlying rate of inflation; but no one that I talked to confirms that My sense is that market pressures are very, very tight People are holding down on their raw material purchases very substantially and, in turn, aren't able to pass price increases on their products through to the market Of course, the operating ratios and the continuation of favorable labor contract settlements tend to confirm that Our outlook, therefore, for the inflation number next year is quite similar to the staff's The issue of the trade picture I find equally perplexing, given the large decline in the value of the dollar It just has to make sense that we are in a better position at this point than we were before; and I would say that the people I talked to are sensing better export opportunities than they had before and, certainly, an improvement in the trade picture is fundamental to our outlook for next year But one issue that I find a little troubling is the enormous disparity between our wage rates and those of some of the major foreign competitors To    12/15-16/86  give an example of this I was in last week and had a chance to talk to the general manager of with six or seven plants around the world; and they have a good one in Mexico Wage rates in are $2300 an hour; wage rates in Mexico are $100 an hour Not only is that surprising but the productivity in Mexico is better than it is in and even more surprising, the quality standards in Mexico are better than they are in  He says they are investing more in Mexico, given that it's a pretty easy decision The thing I find bothersome about that is that you can have an awful lot of currency value decline and you can't quite make up for that kind of disparity  Admittedly, that's a pretty narrow product line Putting it in a broader perspective, our anticipation is that there will be improvement here I would end my comments by saying that our outlook with regard to the growth picture as well as the other major economic indicators is very much in line with the staff's forecast We certainly expect a continuation of the expansion through the year  I'd be in favor of alternative B also, perhaps for slightly different reasons I would think that these minutes probably are going to be released just before your testimony, and that, therefore, these should be consistent with the last [directive] I would think that would be a slightly better environment--symmetrical language, without suggesting any change to the market--as you go into your testimony  I suggested it because, as Frank said, the market overread what we said the last time It seems to me there could be an overreading at this point [With no change] you would go into the testimony without that clouding the comments "
3108,1987-02-10," My question is somewhat related to an earlier question regarding Japanese investors in long-term Treasury obligations, and you probably have no chart or number for it You have given the interest differential Normally that's what we are [unintelligible] But given the tremendous decline in the dollar [unintelligible], broadly how are those long-term investments looking over any period of time? I guess the question is Is there a way that they have been protecting themselves against a [depreciating dollar]?  Our numbers are very consistent with the staff forecast We are a touch higher on real GNP, but perhaps from a lower fourth-quarter base, and our deflator number is a little higher With regard to risk--and I think we have covered it in some detail--it seems to me that so much is dependent on the trade side that the risks really have to be in that area I must say, nonetheless, that I think  -19-    2/10-11/87  we are probably going to come out about right on that From talking to people in the District, I do sense that probably one of the more significant changes that we have had in the last month or so is on the trade side, more as it relates to imports than to exports Certainly, the environment for exports is better and there are some industries-- chemicals and paper products, for example--that are doing better But on the import side, I think an awful lot of the domestic people who have been supplying the domestic markets that have been so very, very hard hit are sensing better opportunities now--particularly for people such as the integrated manufacturers who had typically gone to foreign markets for their out-sourcing I think they are beginning to look more at domestic markets for their sources and, therefore, that's an improvement also It's nothing dramatic, but I do think we are perhaps at a turning point on this Because of the importance of the trade sector to our outlook for the year, in my mind that has to be the big risk  On inflation, I think the risks are a little on the up side People I talked to say that wage costs are continuing under very good control Their contract settlements are excellent in terms of cost as well as work rule changes, etc And the market pricing is very tough; conditions continue to be very, very competitive so they are able to maintain pressure on that There is this bet that imported products will begin to go up in price I think we are going to see that show through and the CPI number is going to be a little higher than we might have expected And because of the sheer publicity--the visibility that the CPI gets--it seems to me that it is going to begin to get one's eyes focused on this problem, perhaps more than has been the case in the last couple of years So, I think inflation is the other risk area  I have just a couple of quick comments on the District I echo what Gary Stern was saying about the agricultural sector I have been out a couple of times over the last two weeks, and I sensed that we might, I hope, be at the bottom of that particular problem, or in the zone of stability, as I call it That's a bit of a positive On the negative side, we are continuing to see plant closings, something that I keep a count on Caterpillar has announced the closing of three additional plants in the Midwest in the last month or so GM has announced one more plant closing over and above that big string that they had a couple of months ago They are now beginning to shut down some of their [plants producing] parts used in assembly and, again, they are going to out-sourcing So that's one on the negative side Generally, conditions in the District seem to be pretty much unchanged from what has been the case over the last few months  I would definitely not favor alternative I The choice, in my view, is between ""II"" and ""III"" We have established a pattern over the last few years of reducing the range on a yearly basis and alternative I would certainly break that Between alternatives II and III, I see no particular reason not to choose alternative II, which we adopted [on a tentative basis] last summer Certainly, there seems to be an expectation that we can hit that and alternative III might suggest a change in policy that we don't really intend at this particular point So, I'd end up with alternative II  Would you go on in those circumstances to suggest that if certain events transpired that, at a later date, we would think about a range?  -34-    2/10-11/87  January through March  At the end of the sentence rather than using the word ""and"" I wonder if you used the word ""or"" if that would deal with the possible alternative situations  It gives you a little more flexibility  Rather than using ""continuing""--not to stir the soup here--how about ""strong economic expansion"" We could get continued economic expansion in a modest proportion "
3132,1987-03-31," While the conditions in our District are largely unchanged from previous periods, at least in the fundamental sense, I do have a feeling that there is a better tone out there It is entirely possible that this has been affected by the winter We really have had exceptionally mild weather this winter and, as a consequence, anything that would normally be adversely affected by the weather is doing very well Construction is the very obvious example Home building is strong Jim Kichline has commented on that, but in the Midwest in January and February home starts were up something like 40 percent over the previous year--obviously very heavily weather- affected Commercial office building continues to be, I think, astoundingly active There are a number of new buildings that are planned; despite a creeping up in the vacancy rate there are more buildings going up As a consequence of all this, all the building materials people--cement, masonry, and the like--are doing really exceptionally well There do continue to be plant closings, but I think they are slowing down a bit and there is some offsetting good news Last week, or maybe earlier this week, Youngstown and Nippon announced a very sizable joint venture--a $400 million coal power plant That is the first significant development in the steel industry like that for quite some while Employment in the District is also a bit on the positive side In January our employment increased by the national average; that is the first time we have had that in some while  Even the farm sector looks a little better or, at least, maybe not worse Farm earnings are probably going to increase this year; that does not really reflect a fundamental change but rather the huge government subsidies I will say, though, that the livestock business has been and continues to be pretty good There is some improvement or expectation of improvement with regard to corn exports, offset a bit by lower soybean exports We think land values are-- we've been saying this for a while but we have a growing confidence-- in a zone of stability that ought to be helpful to the banks If that does occur, we have a hope that the whole farm sector may be at a zone of stability, if you will, albeit at a very low level, as it has been for quite some while There is renewed concern out there about the Farm Credit System; but despite that concern there is, I think, the absolute expectation that at the end of the day the Government is going to be there and provide support for that But certainly, that has put an air of uncertainty into it all  On the trade picture, we would have somewhat of a disagreement with the staff forecast We have commented already on it, perhaps, but the people I talked to are not experiencing the improvements in exports that the Greenbook would suggest They are concerned about weak conditions in foreign markets and, therefore, the opportunity for their products But on the import side, there is very, very broad agreement that we've got some improvement The companies that are manufacturing products for the domestic markets are  -19-    3/31/87  finding a better receptivity there, a little less out-sourcing, and an increase in domestic production And that is certainly an improvement With regard to the exchange rates, just a specific comment told us that the increase in the deutschemark has basically priced German equipment that is used in the paper industry out of the market for the first time in quite some while, noted that in the machine tool industry, US labor rates are now lower than is the case in Japan That is also a very significant change for that industry  On inflation, I think the picture is a bit mixed The labor situation continues to be good The people I talked to about contracts are continuing to get what they think are very favorable deals--some as low as 1 or 1-1/3 percent Generally, most of them were under 3 percent with pretty good work rule changes resulting in productivity improvements Pricing on other commodities and materials, everybody says, is fiercely competitive--that they can't raise prices, etc, etc But I am hearing of more instances of the 3 to 4 percent increase and occasionally the 5 percent, so I think there is a bit of an upward movement on that In a specific industry, the paper industry,  a broad upward trend in [the prices of] the commodities that they use, and most specifically polystyrene resin I think there is a special reason for this, but they have had a price increase on that of about 30 percent in the last year  In some ways we certainly are in very close agreement with the staff forecast; we see no recession or a strong break-out on the up side either We are a little apprehensive that the export side may not be quite as strong as we expect On the inflation side we see nothing yet to be alarmed about but are beginning to sense some upward pressure out there It is not pervasive yet but I think it is the area that we want to watch  For the reasons stated it does seem to me that this is an appropriate time to maintain our current level of reserve restraint That suggests a borrowing level of, say, $300 million But depending on developments in the exchange market as they may evolve, if we were going to err I'd be in favor of erring a bit on the high side rather than the low side And I think the wording of the directive ought to be phrased to reflect at least that level of restraint Translating that to the federal funds rate, if the rate were to continue at the present level X--what's going on today, which I think is an aberration--or even trend a little higher I wouldn't necessarily fight that  6-1/4 percent was exactly what I had in mind  It seems to me that that level is one that we ought not to necessarily fight [From the discussion] around the table earlier, I think it's clear that our principal focus is on the international side, particularly the exchange markets Therefore, I do think that the directive ought to reflect that I think it's an honest statement that would not in any way be surprising to the markets The kind of wording that Don Kohn has in the Bluebook relating to that is an appropriate statement  Just a thought Does putting in a range now of, say, 3 to 7 percent, which is lower than the annual range of 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent, condition it with regard to time? Might that suggest to somebody that we're easing up on policy here? Would putting in a lower range than we have established for the year suggest that we are sneaking up on a policy change?  It's a different set of numbers than are generally out there and understood by the market  It may be true that in the past we have not always hit the trajectory exactly  Yes What is going on?  I would rather say 6 percent or less "
3149,1987-04-29," Peter, this is Si Keehn At that borrowing level would the federal funds rate tend to ride at about a [unintelligible] level or higher for some reason? "
3166,1987-05-19," Sam, given the magnitude of the intervention so far and the results, what is the appetite of the other central banks to continue with this kind of magnitude?  Our outlook for the economy is certainly consistent with the staff's forecast As we look at developments in our District the situation really does continue to improve, and I think the general outlook is certainly more positive Auto production is an exception; Jim Kichline has already commented on that But I would say that maybe we have a slight difference on the truck side of the automotive business From the people I've talked to in Detroit,  -13-    5/19/87  they would anticipate a slight increase in their production schedule for trucks, both in the second and third quarters The steel business has been surprisingly good, better than we would have expected Some of the sheet steel producers are operating pretty much at capacity, with a lot of that going into appliances Also, the demand for some categories of steel that in the past has been very slow is beginning to pick up I am somewhat surprised, for example, that steel going into gas pipelines is improving, and even steel for railroad equipment is higher than it has been Construction activity continues to be very strong I never cease to be amazed, but commercial buildings in Chicago are continuing to be started and to go under construction Residential construction has been very high in our District Home starts this year so far have been significantly higher than the national average As a consequence, the demand for building products has been strong For example, they've produced gypsum in the first quarter at an absolutely record level  On the agricultural side, I'd confirm what Bob Boykin has just said It seems to us that the land values really are beginning to stabilize Our first-quarter survey indicated some stability there for the first time in a long time, and though one quarter doesn't a trend make, nonetheless it is certainly an improvement Of course, the commodity prices--the increases for both corn and soybeans recently--have been a very significant help relating to land values This has not gone through to the tractor and implement manufacturers where the situation continues to be very, very tough Dealer inventories are low There's a lot of floor traffic, I'm told, but very few sales The farmers are reducing their debt; it certainly is a good thing that they're reducing their debt just as fast as they can And, therefore, they're not in a position to take on new obligations for equipment But it's possible that the agricultural situation is stabilizing, admittedly at a low level, and that it won't continue to decline  I must say that I find the inflation issue very, very perplexing Absolutely everybody is talking about it and worrying about it, and I think that in itself can be a little self-fulfilling [It's not in] the numbers we look at, as we have commented Outside of the food and the energy sectors, I can find very few people who are talking about price increases that seem to be out of line There are a wholesale series of price increases of the 2 or 3 percent category; those seem to be the norm I guess the difference is that this time last year, and really until very recently, we were talking about price decreases; now we're talking about price increases of 2 to 3 percent I think there's a very important shift in the psychology that goes along with that change of going from decreases to increases Certainly, long-term rates are telling us something They're either saying we're going to get very, very strong economic growth or the rate of inflation is going to pick up And, related to Bob Black's comment, I think that it is perhaps appropriate that we take some steps to try and reassure the markets with regard to our commitment to price stability  I share Governor Johnson's confusion on this I would be for alternative C, at least conceptually, because I think that represents a slight snugging and, for all the reasons we have said, I think that is appropriate at this point I also think it is perhaps appropriate to take a step that is a bit visible in terms of reinforcing our policy of price stability and, therefore, I would be in favor of recommending to you a change in the discount rate I don't know how to evaluate this Citibank issue as to what kind of effect that is going to have on the market Certainly, that has to be behind us before we take any move on that But I would be in favor of changing the discount rate And alternative C is a way of moving a little against this  Are you saying, Bob, variant II but move the inflationary pressure phrase up in the sentence?  I wouldn't feel strongly about it, but in light of the fact that we have tightened and we are suggesting wording that we are, would there be any sympathy for moving toward the federal funds range consistent with ""C,"" namely 5 to 9 percent? That would put the rate we are getting about in the middle of that range  I am suggesting that in light of changes that have occurred in the rate structure and the way this drafting is beginning to shape up, would there be a basis for changing the federal funds range to 5 to 9 percent?  Would you read the wording as we now have it? "
3189,1987-07-07," Sam, I suppose it's hard to forecast, but on the element of downside risk, has there been some improvement this time versus, say, the past several weeks? Is the downside risk about the same as it has been or has there been some fundamental improvement to relieve that?  Well, at the last few meetings we have been very concerned about the precipitous free fall, if you will, [of the dollar] There seems to be some improvement in tone, but I think you're questioning that And I wonder whether the downside risk now is as great as it has been  I also have a question about the consumption expenditures, which I think look on the low side, particularly for 1988 Cross-referencing a bit between [components of] the Greenbook forecast, specifically for autos, Mike, you are forecasting an increase in auto sales next year yet durable expenditures seem awfully soft Maybe I missed it but what is your number for autos?  If you have a level of doubt about any part of the forecast is this one area where your doubt level is a little higher than in others?  Thank you  Our outlook is quite similar to the forecast that Bob Forrestal gave just a moment ago; namely, we're really very much in sync with the staff with regard to 1987 but our 1988 number is 3 percent The difference, as I alluded to earlier, is in the consumption area; in each of the three categories of consumption we have a higher level of growth than the staff has in its forecast The  -27-    7/7/87  services number seems awfully low, certainly by comparative standards with what we've had over the last few years And we really wonder if that's realistic So that's an area of difference Our inflation numbers are somewhat higher but not much higher than the staff forecast, based principally on the export or the trade side We feel that higher import prices are going to work their way through to a greater extent than in the forecast that the staff gave  Well, for all the reasons stated, I am in favor of maintaining the current range The only thing I might say that is slightly different is that I think there is a message effect in all this I think the economic results have been and look to be pretty good A change in the range might imply some kind of policy change and I don't favor that On top of it all, it is an awkward time to be considering change  Could I ask What is our record of reducing the ranges over the last few years? Have we tended to move about 1/2 point?  I'd also favor alternative II I don't feel strongly between 4-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent and 5 to 8 percent but I would have a slight bias for the 5 to 8 percent In July, February always seems like a long time away But this year it seems like a particularly long time away I would be very tentative in the language for the reasons that Governor Angell has pointed out I would prefer to go to the 5 to 8 percent now, and if there is room to go to 4-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent when we get to February, I think that would be the appropriate direction, as opposed to the alternative direction  There is a high level of uncertainty Our results so far have been quite different than one might expect; that level of uncertainty continues and that's how the rest of the year might play out  Unless broadening the range to 4 percentage points has some meaning that would make it difficult, I think it is a good suggestion  I agree "
3215,1987-08-18," Our forecast is certainly quite consistent with the staff forecast as it relates to this year However, I will say that our outlook for 1988 is somewhat stronger And, I would join those who have commented that, as we go along, the revisions are likely to be up rather than down  Our District has lagged the rest of the country in the recovery, but since the end of last year that has not been the case As we look at our industries and our indicators, we are tending at least to equal the national numbers This year, for example, as we  have gone through the year, employment increases in our five states have been consistently equal to the national increases The increases have tended to be on the nonmanufacturing side, but even in the manufacturing category, we are significantly above the low level of manufacturing employment prevailing at the end of 1982 Unemployment continues to be a little higher than the national average, about a percentage point higher; nonetheless, that margin seems to be coming down And, I do think that some of the manufacturing sectors that have been going through a very difficult period are showing really surprising strength In steel, for example, which is a very tough industry, the steel plants that are producing sheet steel are about at capacity Those producing structural steel are lower than that, but nonetheless stronger than you might expect And, there are a number of other categories in the machinery side that are showing improvement A large manufacturer of diesel engines in our area is now really having a hard time keeping up with the demand; construction equipment is stronger; and even the railroad equipment business, which has been absolutely moribund, is beginning to show some signs of life All of this, of course, excludes autos, though the sale numbers for autos, as Mike is suggesting, continue to look like 10 million or more [unintelligible] this year or next year The production schedules in the third quarter will be down by about 13 percent; and for the fourth quarter, though the schedules are not final, it looks like they'll be down about 5 percent And the inventories do not seem to be out of line  On the agricultural side, I have just a quick comment I am almost hard pressed to say that, certainly, we have stabilized; and there are even some signs of improvement The land values, which in the first quarter were level, at least, did show improvement in the second quarter; those land values continue to move up a bit, albeit from very, very low levels Nevertheless, transactions that are taking place show some sign of strength in land values There was, as you know, a recent revision in farm income; and the outlook for this year is for a significant increase and, therefore, those farm income numbers look pretty good Surprisingly--or at least I find it surprising--the increase in farm income is not a result of higher subsidies, but rather of a decrease in production costs, which is an encouraging sign So that part of the agricultural sector looks pretty good Admittedly, we have a long way to go before the harvest, but at this point the growing conditions look good We would anticipate good crop yields per acre and, in some areas, there will be record production The overall production will be down by 12 percent; the acreage is down even more-- say, 14 percent; but, again, we have a net improvement in yield So, I do think the conditions in the District are much improved for the rest of this year and into next year  -13-    8/18/87  But, as I pointed out, there are a couple of key areas On this trade balance issue, I've had the feeling all year that we were seeing a correction; the people I talk to suggest that that is the case The June numbers were certainly disappointing I hope there's nothing fundamental there But if the major economies in the world do not turn around and begin to pick up and take our exports, this obviously will have a big impact On the inflation side, we are seeing some of the price increases that Mike mentioned They are in a couple of categories Specifically, in steel, one manufacturer increased prices 4 to 6 percent and this time they're sticking--again, at very low levels But if these price increases begin to become pervasive, and then go through to the labor side, I think the outlook for inflation will be quite different I don't yet sense that All the people I talk to who are negotiating labor contracts are continuing to get very good results reasonably modest increases on an annual basis, and importantly, very good work rule changes, so that productivity and unit labor costs seem to be better But, I do think these are, of course, the two key areas the trade balance and inflation Net, I think the economy, both nationally and in our District, continues to look good and seems to be improving As we go along here, there is the opportunity for increasing the growth forecast  Mr Chairman, I would be in agreement with the position that Jerry Corrigan laid out For reasons that have been well stated, it certainly seems to me that the economic opportunities at this point are on the upside and not on the downside On the inflationary pressures, though admittedly far from conclusive, we may be going through something of a bubble here Nonetheless, the signs are there and I do think it is appropriate that we begin to move against that I find the aggregates' performance this year to have been erratic They may emerge on a more predictable basis, but as yet I don't see the evidence of that Therefore, I find the alternatives, in terms of aggregate growth rates, to be a little awkward Accordingly, I would prefer to deal with the borrowing level and, given the circumstances, I think a borrowing level between ""A"" and ""B"", namely, $600 million, would be appropriate In terms of the wording of the directive, I would be in favor of ""would"" for [greater] restraint and ""might"" for lesser restraint And I do think that this sentence on the next page [of the Bluebook] does, at least preliminarily, convey the reverse meaning I think we might fiddle with the language on that to get a more appropriate wording "
3241,1987-09-22," Peter, you suggested that the increase in long- term rates is a combination of factors, with inflation being one But, in the combination of factors, how persistent is the inflation concern and is it just one of those issues?  But it is more that side as opposed to domestic pressures?  Thank you, Mr Chairman From a national perspective, our forecast is really very consistent with the staff forecast I would say that we have been a little higher throughout the year and, therefore, the last revision by the staff brings it pretty much in line with our perspective  With regard to the District, whereas we have been a laggard throughout this recovery, certainly, at this point we have turned around The conditions and the trends in the District I think are very favorable Employment, for example, is very consistent with the national numbers Our unemployment is still higher than the national average, but I do think the employment numbers are coming along quite well  I thought I would comment on just a couple of industries that are important to the District that I think are going through an interesting and positive adjustment First, the steel industry is a very dramatic example of a shift that is taking place in a very troubled industry We have had in the Midwest just a whole host of closings, bankruptcies, and near-bankruptcies, and, in addition, some shutdown of capacity; but those who have survived and those who have put some money into the plants, and have modernized them, certainly at this point are doing very well The decline in the dollar and the import restrictions have helped tremendously, but the demand for domestic steel is strong, and as a consequence, the plants are operating at a much better rate The demand for steel products seems to be quite broadly based, and now is as strong as any time since 1981 In getting to a point you raised earlier, many of these products are on allocation; the delivery times are clearly moving up from eight to nine weeks, so there is a slowdown in the delivery process The service centers, as I understand it, are trying to build inventories but are not able to do it; inventory is going out as fast as it comes in And, not surprisingly, there is something of a price increase going on in the industry and the price increases for the first time in this cycle may really seem to be sticking A tangible sign of an improvement in this industry in the last six or eight months is that we've had an announcement of two new steel plants in Indiana one a joint venture with a Japanese company, which is quite a significant installation; and the second a stand-alone facility  No, the Japanese one, I think, is fairly specialized; but they are brand new plants centrally located  No, not importing--they are taking slab out of a Chicago mill and cold-rolling it in Indiana So, I do think it's an industry that has gone through a tremendous transition The other industry that is important to the District is heavy duty trucks--Class 8 trucks Sales this year, I think, are going to be 13 or 14 percent higher than last year, and the outlook for next year is another increase of 3 to 4 percent These will go up to 125,000 to 130,000 units and this is just a lot higher than what we were experiencing three or four years ago There is still a lot of capacity in that manufacturing process but, nevertheless, this is a business that seems to have gotten better Pricing is still tough, however Nevertheless, from the District's perspective, it has been good  Let me say a quick word about agriculture by adding a little to what I've said in the past namely, conditions seem to have stabilized, albeit at low levels Land values are beginning to move; transactions are higher, and in a couple of instances, significantly higher But, the point I'd make on what I find to be a new development is that general business conditions, not just agricultural conditions, in the area of Iowa seem to be better  Turning to the price issue, I must say that I find this a very, very difficult read I keep hearing about price increases; I've commented on steel, but specialized chemicals, paper, paper products, brass, and copper all seem to be moving up in price They don't show up yet in the CPI numbers The competitive conditions for finished products are very tough and people are being squeezed on margins; but, at some point, you just have to think that this is going to poke through On the wage side, I'd add to the comments that we are hearing about shortages We were up in Michigan the other day doing a presentation and some of the people were commenting that they just can't get enough people to work in some of the operations there I would think that, at some point, we are going to see something of an increase on wage rates that's beyond what we've had over the last year or so  Turning then, Mr Chairman, to your question on long-term rates, which is a very, very key issue, like Jerry, I think it is awfully hard to analyze each part But, I think that the underlying rate of economic activity here is pretty good; it may be a little more rapid than we expected and, therefore, there may be some real pressure on rates Also--and I can't analyze what part equals what--on the inflation side, I think there is growing skepticism out there; there is concern about inflation, and something in the rate increase that we have experienced certainly has to relate to that Thank you  I agree with alternative B, and I have a preference, at least, for the asymmetrical language as it is currently Also, if there were going to be a bias, then I suppose the best nuance for the bias about borrowing would be up rather than down from the $600 million level But I do think changing the fed funds range from 5 to 9 percent perhaps would accomplish that bias  Right I would be for ""B"", $600 million, and a bias upward  Not really [unintelligible] instructions; it means he will just do it "
3271,1987-11-03," Well, like Mr Prell, I think I will divide my comments into pre-event and post-event Starting with the pre-event activity certainly, the District continued to operate on a reasonably favorable basis, much along the lines that I previously have been reporting, with the exception of the auto industry The manufacturing sector has been moving along pretty well and the employment statistics have been good, very much in line with the national numbers The steel business is operating again at very, very high levels; the demand for steel products is the best we have experienced in our area since 1981 The delivery times have stretched out very considerably and many products really are being sold on allocation Construction activity remains reasonably good The conditions in agriculture are continuing to improve; land prices are up and commodity prices have improved somewhat By and large, the harvest is in and it really has been a very good harvest in our area  Moving to the post-event comments, it is too early to assess the damage but, so far at least, I don't sense from any of the people that I talk to that any of these fundamental trends that I've just noted have been badly affected Certainly at the outset, consumer spending was affected; there was a decline in retail sales as we went through the market trauma, but that seems to have leveled out I am told from people who have October retail numbers in our area that, by and large, retail sales came in this October about level with last October Looking ahead to next year, the retailers are reducing their expectations but, so far, nobody has suggested a negative trend on retail sales On the auto side, it's awfully early to tell, but one of the major producers that I talked to yesterday said that they are reducing their sales [estimates] for 1988 cars and trucks together by about 800,000 units; but they do emphasize that it's very, very early yet to assess how the consumer will react On capital expenditures, so far I have been quite impressed that there are no early signs of a sharp curtailment Most of the companies that I've talked to--those that have significant programs in place--intend to continue, unless there is a very sharp downturn in the economy They have embarked on programs that they say they will, by and large, stay with And I do find that quite encouraging So net, I think it's still too early to assess the damage I keep being favorably surprised that our early assessment isn't a little more negative than it is I think our expectations for next year will certainly be down a bit, but it is far too early to quantify We are just going to have to go through a period of some uncertainty Nonetheless, so far things seem to have come through better than I might have expected  Jerry, what's wrong with the next phrase?  Mr Chairman, I'm certainly in favor of maintaining the current policy, which I interpret to be alternative ""B"" And I must say I like the Corrigan wording of Variant I; I prefer Variant I to Variant II because I think it is a more honest statement of what we are doing, particularly with the language that he is proposing to amend it I'd have a slight bias in the wording toward easing, and using ""would"" [for easing] and ""might"" [for tightening] I'd be in favor of maintaining a broad range for the fed funds rate And I don't feel strongly about it, but I think in the interest of consistency and stability I'd stay with the 5 to 9 percent  In the interest of consistency and stability, I'd stay with 5 to 9 percent, but I don't feel very strongly about it  Earlier, somebody suggested that in line 5 we change that ""outlook may call for"" to ""may continue to call for"" That's appropriate "
3294,1987-12-15," Mr Chairman, I'm here with Karl Scheld and I hope you can hear us  Mr Chairman, I think I hear a consensus for moving away from what we are currently doing and in the direction of alternative (3), and I certainly would favor that; but in my mind, it's really a question of timing I'm a little uncertain as to how the rest of the year is going to play out and what kind of pressures will be emerging Rather than using the year-end as a blind, if you will, to accomplish a change, I'd favor going through that period, and then as soon thereafter as possible, begin to implement the change  I'd be in favor of that--in other words, alternative (1) Or more precisely, I guess, I favor alternative (1) for now, but moving to (3) as rapidly as we can after the turn of the year  No I very much agree with Governor Angell that it has all the characteristics of adjustment borrowing, and that being the case, it's appropriate to include it But this certainly would be an inappropriate time to be making a change  At this point, I have nothing to add to the discussion that hasn't already been said a couple of times at least But, hearing the conversations and reading the paper, I don't find any compelling reason to shift to M1A or to add it as a target I would not be in favor of targeting a narrow aggregate Jerry Corrigan made the point earlier that I think is very appropriate whatever we are doing, we are doing pretty well I think the economic results have been good Utilizing, say, M2 and M3 in the way that we have has been an appropriate way to do it; the results have been good, and we ought to continue with that  Well, while this conversation has been going on, we were told that it is snowing again and both airports are again closed But, we're a bit hopeful that we can get out  I'm counting on you, Bob!  We'll work with it It's either going to work for us both or not And if it doesn't, if we could again participate on the phone tomorrow, I'd appreciate that I'm not going to know for another hour or so whether or not we can make it out I'll let Norm Bernard know  Sam, lacking intervention, what's the comment in the market with regard to the lowest level that the market would expect against the mark and the yen? How much more [decline] can we get here?  That's the main piece of it because the market discipline would have been much stronger on the US to get the adjustment process moving forward more rapidly without this foreign official financing  Mr Chairman, looking ahead to 1988, I too definitely think the October events [unintelligible] I agree with Bob on that While obviously those events were hardly positive, they have not had a fundamental effect on the economy as I had thought they might, at least as yet Therefore, our outlook is not at all inconsistent with the staff forecast We may be a touch on the more positive side I have just a couple of specific comments On retail sales, I certainly agree with Bob Black I talked to somebody Monday who has important operations in the Midwest and, for the Christmas selling season so far through Sunday, their sales have been 5 percent over last year; and he thinks that for the balance of this Christmas season their sales will improve over that The outlook for retail sales appears really quite positive at this point Capital spending programs have not been cut and I've talked to an awful lot of people about that over the last two or three weeks Most companies have contingency plans in place and they are taking a very careful look They have a cautious attitude but, so far, nobody is reducing their plans and they are really carrying on with them in a pretty good way  There are two dichotomies here that I have a hard time understanding first, on inflation, I keep hearing these anecdotal reports about very significant price increases for a variety of raw materials, steel in particular I have heard some huge numbers on steel from some people--30 percent increases on an annual basis; and I have heard of paper products and chemical products also moving up pretty rapidly But these are offset by comments of other people I have met with major companies, and one very, very large manufacturing company that I talk with pulled out their material prices for me For 1987, excluding steel, their material prices have only gone up 7 percent; and for next year they are forecasting an increase of 5 percent For steel for this year, they in fact had a price decrease of 18 percent; for next year they are expecting an increase of only 04 percent So, there is this tremendous difference between large companies that have big power and the smaller companies that really don't Certainly, the increases are not showing up in the inflation numbers On the labor side, the news continues to be very good Three-year contracts, at least in our District, are very standard In some cases, annual increases in all costs are under 2 percent and certainly, 2 to 3 percent is quite standard The productivity work  -58-    12/15-16/87  rule changes have been very important Therefore, the productivity increases for some companies have been very impressive, so that unit labor costs indeed are coming down So, with regard to the inflation problem, at least as I talk to people, certainly the pressures at this point are not nearly as great as I would have expected last summer In fact, at least some of the heat has come out of this problem  The other dichotomy, which we have talked about a little, is this trade balance issue A lot of people I have talked to are really getting much better results on their exports; they are operating at high levels in some specialized industries but, at the current level of the dollar, they can easily compete in Europe and the Far East But again, this is not universal There are other people who are not having a similar kind of experience I am reminded by people that when the dollar was so very high, dealer and distribution networks really came down very significantly; and those who were dependent on such networks are having a bit of a problem re-establishing them But for the long run, I do agree with Ted Truman and Mike Prell that the fundamentals have to be very, very good and that, at some point, we're going to begin to see these improvements on the export side On net, given the reduction of the dollar, and if the foreign markets hold up and indeed begin to improve, I think that we are going to see this increase in exports If the consumption numbers hold up--and certainly I have this early look that they are moving along better than I might have expected--I think the staff outlook is a little soft on the consumption side I do think the outlook for 1988 continues to be positive and not inconsistent with the results that we've had this year  Yes, that's right  Mr Chairman, I'd also be in favor of alternative ""B"" With regard to the other four alternatives, I kind of like all of them in proper order other than alternative (2) which I do not like Certainly between now and the end of the year, I think it would be appropriate to keep current procedures in place until we are satisfied that we've come out of that particular adjustment period; then I would shift to alternative (3) but lean toward alternative (4)  -75-    12/15-16/87  Specifically, a fed funds between now and the end of the year at 6-3/4 to 6-7/8 percent would be appropriate, with a borrowing level not unlike what we have now But I think as we come out of that year-end period, we would want to get back toward alternative (3) and then move from alternative (3) to alternative (4) with a borrowing level of about $400 million I wouldn't necessarily want to judge a federal funds rate that would be appropriate for that borrowing level; I'd rather let the market determine what would be appropriate In terms of the language, I would be in favor of symmetric language But I'd also pick up on the same directive language that Bob Black mentioned with regard to sensitive market conditions I think that phrase ought to be dropped and I would use symmetric language "
3331,1988-02-09," [I want to address] the capital expenditure issues that Frank Morris and Bob Black raised in a different way Looking at the utilization rates on chart 7, some of these rates are getting pretty high And I guess the question is What does history tell us? When do industries, particularly textiles, chemicals, paper, and steel, which are operating at very high levels--and those are averages for each industry, which suggests that some are operating at    2/9-10/88  higher levels--begin to move? At some point they're going to begin to lose market share And my experience is that market share is a very sensitive issue; when they hit that point they begin to spend some money Does history tell us anything about that?  Let me just start by saying that our forecast is really very close to the staff forecast; our contour is terribly parallel There really are no differences that are worth talking about Importantly, I certainly view both our forecast and theirs, at least in the growth perspective, as being a very positive outlook-- certainly not negative I think we are making a shift from a consumer-driven economy to greater strength on the manufacturing side And certainly, the improving trade balance is a part of that Also, from the Midwestern perspective, no one I talk to senses any emergence  -14-    2/9-10/88 -15-  of a recession, as I keep reading about in the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times  With regard to the District, our growth characteristics are now very much in parallel with the national numbers Having lagged so long, we are very much on track right now Just to hit a couple of individual sectors first, the agricultural part of our District is clearly showing signs of improvement Land values rose last year, and in the fourth quarter these values stabilized at higher levels; and we've seen a lot of land transactions--enough purchases taking place to give confidence in the numbers Commodity prices are higher, so the exports are helping that Farm debt levels are down and, I think, at a much more manageable level Even the beleaguered equipment manufacturers--and this has really been a very tough industry--are showing signs of light I'm hearing the first good news out of that group that I've heard for a good many years  We talked about machine tools a little earlier, but one of our directors operates a very large machine tool company and they are operating at an 80 percent rate; they are enjoying the best quarter that they have had since 1982 The import penetration of machine tools, at least from their perspective, is down significantly and they think the Japanese are on a conscious program to try to curtail their exports to the United States In the steel industry, I think there has been almost a spectacular turnaround, with the industries-- certainly in our area--operating at very, very high levels Delivery schedules are being lengthened out, and we are hearing increasing comments about price increases, and this time they're sticking The paper industry--I mentioned that a moment ago as well--is operating at rates over 90 percent, and I am hearing more noise that they're getting into capital expenditures On the housing side, we have several directors involved in that and they all say that the December numbers were distorted, probably by weather, and certainly are not reflective of a fundamental change in conditions The auto industry, which has had high inventories, is going to have lower production this quarter, but I think to some extent that's a corporate problem GM and Chrysler are digging out of very high inventories Ford is not; in fact, their production schedules in the first quarter are going to be up, not down So then, as far as growth is concerned, everybody I talked to--though there is a high level of apprehension and concern-- certainly does not anticipate, from their own business perspective, anything like a recession  Let me just conclude by picking up on some of Ed Boehne's comments, because I think they were very appropriate With regard to inflation, all of the indexes indicate that we are going to continue to experience moderate inflation But I think some of the stories don't match the indicators; I keep hearing more news and more noise about price increases that are beginning to stick In the raw materials area, nonferrous metal prices are moving up pretty rapidly Aluminum and copper--we have talked about those in the past--are much, much higher Many chemical products that are in short supply [unintelligible] Also, people that we talked to who buy copper are paying much more There are definitely higher prices in their production process  SPEAKERS(?) [Unintelligible--Several speaking at once]    2/9-10/88  I mentioned steel a moment ago--one person I talked to said they had an increase in steel prices of 10 percent in January and another 10 percent in February And some of these prices are beginning to move through into finished products, as market conditions permit Wage rates are certainly not affected I think wage rates are continuing to perform very, very well While the economic outlook seems solid, I must say in regard to the inflationary outlook that I think the risks are on the upside rather than on the downside  Without going back over yesterday's conversation, it does seem to me that it's important to remember that the economic record over the past few years, and that certainly includes the last year, has been pretty good And I think the outlook for this year is also positive In terms of the risks, they're about equal on the upside and the downside And I think we have a very good shot at coming in about on the forecast The risks, as I see them and as I suggested yesterday, really are more on the inflationary front; I do sense some buildup of the inflationary pressure In addressing the aggregates question, I think it's important to bear that in mind  Now, despite Don's very articulate and, I think, clear explanation of the opportunities this year with regard to the aggregates, I think we are continuing in a period of reasonable uncertainty and it's terribly difficult to forecast just how this is going to come out Therefore, I think we ought to try and establish ranges that deal with those very tough uncertainties If I were to choose one of these specific alternatives, I would choose alternative III, largely for the reasons that have already been said But I must say, given the uncertainty, I'd have a preference for the 4 to 8 percent range that Bob Forrestal suggested I think it does provide for the uncertainties and also deals with the consistency of our message of trying to achieve price stability So, I'd have a preference for 4 to 8 percent but certainly could be persuaded to accept alternative III I would not establish a monitoring range for Ml; I think the uncertainty there is still too high to do that And I would not be in favor of rebasing either I think if we begin to move the base around to suit our requirements, that's a rather awkward message; I'd not be in favor of rebasing  Mr Chairman, I share the questions that are arising as to just where we are, but for the short term I am in favor of maintaining the existing degree of pressure, and I think that's alternative B I also would share Tom's view that we ought to be moving back to a borrowings level, on a basis that's consistent with what Peter can produce; and, therefore, I'm leaning toward a borrowing level of $250 million Of the three alternatives for the longer term, I'd be in favor of using the ranges stated in alternative III; but I would have a preference, as I said earlier, for a broader range of 4 to 8 percent And I think that that broader range would be appropriate both for M2 and M3 "
3355,1988-03-29," At this point I'm not sure I can handle it! I was intrigued with a line at the end of Ann-Marie Meulendyke's memorandum which says that what apparently started out as a temporary procedure has persisted, with modifications, for over five years It seems to me that there hasn't been such a significant change of circumstances at this particular time that we ought to make a change [in our procedure] I'm not persuaded by either the memo or the discussion that we really have a hard basis for making a change And if we do, I think it ought to be very well grounded Having said  -35-    3/29/88  that, I would have a reluctance to shift to any kind of fed funds rate targeting We are discussing this at a fairly benign period; the economy is moving along pretty well, inflation is higher than we like but still not out of control, and the interest rate structure is pretty good But that won't always be the case As we've said a couple of times, there are going to be some circumstances in which we'll need to tighten And I think the political pressure would come to bear if we were using the fed funds rate as our focal point--then change would be very tough I'm reminded of that line ""Don't shoot the piano player, he's all we've got"" It seems to me the present procedure has been serving us pretty well; I don't see a reason for making a change  I certainly agree with the direction of the staff forecast, and I think that from a national perspective the economy really is improving with the passage of time That is consistent with the conditions in the District which are also improving and I think the improvement is quite broad-based I commented before on the steel business it is continuing to operate at a very high level; indeed, those in the Midwest are operating pretty much at capacity And I am beginning to hear a phrase that I haven't heard in a great many years, namely, ""double ordering"" People are very much in the business of double ordering for steel; and if they get both, they are pleased to take both because they basically need the steel  But there are other parts of the manufacturing sector that are showing good improvement We have been hearing for some months now about the improvement in the machine tools business from various people in the District Earlier this week we saw some articles on the improvement that is taking place in that industry Orders for mining equipment and railroad cars are better than they were--showing improvement, albeit from low levels There are no capacity problems there, but nonetheless the trend is up, not down And, almost unbelievably, the heavy construction equipment industry has turned  -42-    3/29/88  around again, quite significantly, and they are operating at a high level In farm equipment, last year's big inventories of agricultural implements have largely been worked down, as retail inventories are at a much lower level; and production in that industry is picking up Mike Prell mentioned that the auto production schedules for the second quarter are higher--some 4 percent higher for the second quarter this year as compared to last year--given higher sales in the first quarter So I think, as I look across the District, that the fundamental conditions are showing signs of improvement  The mystery in all of this, at least from my point of view, is the inflation situation I keep hearing about these big increases in prices--in steel, aluminum, other metals such as nickel, and in paper products and raw materials going into that industry  who is in the paper industry commented on the very significant price increases that they have experienced on their raw materials So far it has been at the intermediate level; it hasn't gone through into finished products But I think there are some margin squeezes out there, and I'm hearing about some anticipated price increases for example, commented that they have price increases announced for April 1; they're not sure whether the increases are going to stick because their circumstances are pretty competitive Nonetheless, some price increases in finished products are beginning to move forward Certainly, that has not shown through in the price indices; and there would be no reason to make a change in policy now based on the indices While the economic outlook continues to be favorable, and I think we can clearly be pleased with the outlook, there are these upward pressures And I think the worry has to be on the inflationary side That is the part of this that we have to be particularly alert to  Don, back on seasonal borrowings--a question related to what I asked Peter at the outset this morning Doesn't a $200 million borrowing level, now that seasonal borrowing is going up, really represent, in a slight sense at least, an easing of policy? "
3378,1988-05-17," Mr Chairman, I feel a little ambivalent, certainly not regarding the direction, but regarding the question of timing We have talked about that a lot Ed Boehne phrased it much the way I would I would not move on the borrowing today, because I think it would be pretty quick after the last move and might perhaps signal a little more to the markets than we would intend And we want to do this in an orderly way So, I would bring the level up by $100 million as soon as we think the markets can accommodate that; I don't know whether that's a week or two weeks, something like that Certainly, I'd be in favor of asymmetric language with an upward bias    5/17/88  in the policy directive And I think it's not only possible, but very likely, that we will move on the second $100 million before the next meeting of the Committee Whether we do that at a conference call or leave that entirely to you, I'm indifferent "
3401,1988-06-29," Mr Chairman, with regard to the District economy--except for agriculture, and I'll comment a little later on that--I think, broadly, conditions in our area are pretty much unchanged from previous meetings I've commented before on the steel industry and industrial equipment Those types of activities are continuing to be very, very strong And I think the improved export market has really had a very positive effect on the manufacturing part of our District There are some industries that have been selling almost exclusively on the domestic side that are now beginning to export products, and this is a very positive thing And I think the value of the dollar will continue to provide good export opportunities and also improve production on the domestic side In machine tools, for example, where imports as recently as a couple of years ago had about a 60 percent participation in the machine tool business domestically, that number is now down to about 37 percent So, there's been a very significant positive shift in the machine tool industry And from all of my contacts on the manufacturing side, the tone out there is very positive; everybody has a good expectation that the expansion will continue  On the drought picture, I can add little to what was said last night or to what Bob Forrestal said I think we are continuing in a period here where we have a bit of a window I keep hearing about the 10-day window; it keeps moving out But I think we are at a point where if we do get some rain the [unintelligible] can be pulled out of the bag here If we get rain--and there was some rain earlier this week--I think the corn crop probably will be down by some 10 to 25 percent For soybeans, there's still enough time that if we get some rain that could be a normal crop But having said that, if we don't get as much rain as we'd like, even under the worst of circumstances, the component of commodity prices in the final retail value of food is such that we would not expect that this drought will have that dramatic an effect on food prices I think the number that Mike suggested yesterday is very much within the range that we would forecast  I've been worried about the effects of this on the banks as much as anything We did a quick survey of some of the ag banks earlier this week and I, frankly, was very reassured I would have expected that some of these problem loans would begin to reemerge The banks that we talked to said ""no,"" that's not the case--that the weak borrowers were really shaken out over the past few years The strong borrowers are now those who remain and they have the strength to sustain a bad year such as this That's not the case, as I understand it, with the nonbank lenders--the FMA, FHA, and the FMHA There are apparently [unintelligible] some problems in loans to developers The banks at this point feel adequately collateralized; they're not taking that much collateral They seem to have plenty of reserves built up for this and they think they can handle the problem without an onslaught of additional problems  I also checked with the exchanges I was concerned that we've gone through a period here where the margin calls were pretty  -17-    6/29-30/88  heavy And the exchanges say that there have been no particular strains The volume of margin calls has been high, but so far they have been met The banks that deal with us are not experiencing any shutoff in terms of the credit that they're granting So the exchanges, I gather, are coming through  Finally, with regard to inflation, our forecast of the deflator is a little lower than the staff forecast for both '88 and '89, but I think we may revise that somewhat Nonetheless, it's clearly the case that we are on an accelerating trend line here and I think all the signs do point toward an increase on the inflation side Capacity utilization for many of the industries in our District continues to be at very high levels and I am sensing some upward movement with regard to [unintelligible] prices Markets have been pretty sticky in the past, but I think there's a little more give in this  A little more positively, I do think there is something of a changed attitude with regard to some prices over the last two or three weeks, in nonferrous metals and chemicals particularly They have had a very significant roll up I have talked to a number of people who have the expectation that such prices will stay about level for a while--not go down, but not continue the kind of increases that we've experienced over the last six months or a year On the wage side, I think there is a hardening attitude developing in the wage contracts Admittedly, the results are coming in very favorably--the numbers look positive--but I just sense that in the bargaining process labor has a harder attitude than they have had in the past So far the unit labor costs have remained in check because the [unintelligible] changes have been good; productivity increases have been pretty good But I think, intuitively, the risks on the inflation side just have to be on the upside And certainly, the agricultural picture only adds a little pressure--yet to be determined how much--but a little pressure on the upside So, I'd agree with Vice Chairman Corrigan that the risks here on inflation are very much on the upside, not on the downside  That's the problem; there is no evidence  I am talking to people--chief executive officers of companies--who are continually going through the wage bargaining process Job security has been the number one issue and continues to be very high priority And labor has been very reluctant to go on strike I don't think there's necessarily going to be a change in  -18-    6/29-30/88  that But they are just getting a harder attitude, because they are concerned that the increases they're getting are not keeping pace; and they feel they have a stronger position than they have had It hasn't shown up in the numbers and I think that's the mystery in all this That we've gone through the process--  I'd maintain the '88 ranges and I'd be in favor of alternative III for '89 If I were fine tuning at all, I would widen the ranges when we are going through a period of some uncertainty, but the latter is beginning to clarify This might be an opportunity to narrow the range again and perhaps go to 3-1/2 to 7 I don't feel strongly about that; I can live with III  Mr Chairman, I agree with the direction you're suggesting, but I might get there a slightly different way I wonder if there hasn't been enough movement in the rates that a change in the discount rate would be appropriate I think I understand the tremendous sensitivity about that, but I wonder if it couldn't be explained as rather a technical move, perhaps a following move, at this point And if the Board members were to do that, then the borrowing level would be adjusted accordingly If you were not comfortable with that, then I would agree with the increase in the borrowing level to $600 million with asymmetric language "
3422,1988-07-19," I agree with what Jerry just said I think the strength in the economy is continuing to move along; and in a purely domestic context, I'd be in favor of continuing to move up the borrowing level now The exchange value of the dollar surely complicates it, and I don't think we want to do anything that would exacerbate a trend that doesn't seem to be permanent Therefore, I'm in favor of what you're suggesting--namely, that we simply hold for an additional fairly brief period and watch it carefully If the dollar begins to move down, though, I think we ought to make another move on the borrowing level "
3442,1988-08-16," Mr Chairman, economic activity in our District continues to show I think very, very considerable strength That's particularly true in the manufacturing sector, and more specifically in those activities that are either related to exports or capital goods where those operating levels continue to be very, very high The steel industry, for example, is continuing to run at quite close to capacity The third quarter is normally a period in which the steel industry shuts down a bit to deal with maintenance, but this year the maintenance is being deferred to deal with continuing demand Chemicals and paper are continuing to run at high levels Auto production schedules for the third quarter are considerably higher than in the third quarter of last year So, I do think on the capital expenditures side, Mike has certainly covered it very well I think we are going to see higher increases in capital expenditures than we may have forecast And I'm sensing from a lot of companies that they really are thinking about adding significantly to their expenditure level  I have just a couple of comments on the agricultural situation, other than crop estimates, which you've seen First, implements Interestingly, as we got started on this drought thing, it did not show up in implement sales Through June they were holding pretty well; but the July numbers are now in and, on a comparative basis, July sales of tractors and combines, for example, are considerably under last year That's not surprising, but certainly this is a negative feature Agricultural banks, a second element of agriculture comments We surveyed the agricultural banks in our District again last week, and the story I think continues to be more positive than one had expected it to be The weak producers were weeded out in the previous adjustment Those credits now on the books are farmers who are strong enough that they can deal with this drought without a renewal of significant problems among the banks  To me, the most surprising shift that I've sensed over the last month or two is this employment thing There has been, I think, quite a modification in attitudes out there There is now, I think, quite persistently a shortage of [unintelligible] The manufacturers I have talked to are running at very high levels, and their constraint really is the availability of labor to deal with it And that's also the case I think in the service sector I was talking to somebody the other day that has opened two major retail stores in Chicago They put out applications, or requests for applications, and they were flooded with people But they have high standards for their employment, and the applicants came in short on that Therefore, they have opened one of their stores very significantly undermanned As I  -14-    8/16/88  talk to people, it seems that the shortage of labor really is beginning to be felt There are a couple of key contracts for which negotiations have just started And I think people have been following that very closely My sense of all this is that the wage side and the inflation picture are going to continue to accelerate We are going to continue to see increases in wage costs  Mr Chairman, I agree with the policy pre- scription as you outlined it Going back over the past several months, I think the record's been good; we have been moving in the right way And I think it is appropriate to see if at some point this doesn't begin to have an effect But I do think it's clear from comments that we've got more to go, and the question is more of timing as opposed to the direction that we are going So, I would be in favor of the asymmetric language and a borrowing level of $600 million And I'd allow the fed funds rate to seek its own market level But also I think if there are any other indicators, I'd move again on this, and I do think the phone call procedure has worked out very well as a way of dealing with these interim changes Certainly, I would encourage continuation of that With regard to the language, I do feel that the pressure now is on the inflationary side and we ought to maintain that focus So I would leave the language in the paragraph just as it is "
3466,1988-09-20," With regard to the national economy--with some modest adjustments for the fourth quarter of this year and the first  -12-    9/20/88  quarter of next year due mainly to agriculture--our outlook is quite consistent with the staff forecast in the Greenbook With regard to the District, there's really very little that's new to report With the obvious exception of agriculture, I think the economy continues to be really very strong But there are just a few signs of moderation-- nothing pronounced I think there are somewhat slower growth rates in a couple of parts of our economy Retail sales, for example, were much weaker in the summer months than earlier in the spring And construction activity is down a bit Another example is paperboard, which of course has been so very strong; after a string of almost two years of record monthly shipments, last month's shipments were down just a bit there  It's too early to tell if these early signs are indicative of a trend and if they're going to be sustained It's entirely possible, I think, that the trends--particularly in some of the areas that I've mentioned--are the result of the exceptionally hot weather that we've had Since the turn of the weather, I'm told by retailers that the flow of traffic in their stores is back up to more normal levels So some of these things may have been very weather related  Perhaps the lack of any significant changes could be a good thing Anecdotally, at least, I don't sense a continuation of the upward pressures on prices that were so very evident earlier this year I still think that the risks are very much on the side of greater inflation But I am beginning to hear some comments about the leveling of prices for a variety of materials--or certainly that more moderate increases are taking place as opposed to the big numbers that we had earlier this year And at least one major manufacturer that I talked to the other day is forecasting that raw material purchases next year will be level with 1988--really no increase at all  Surprisingly, consistent with what Bob Forrestal has just said, I don't sense any deterioration on the wage front Wage rates do not at this point seem to be accelerating Also, there doesn't seem to be a hardening of attitudes on the part of labor I'm told that the attitude of organized labor continues to be very constructive, given the continued progress on work-rule changes So I think the news there continues to be pretty good Companies are not losing ground on unit labor costs but, as a caveat on that, there are two major contracts out there that are currently reaching the final stages of negotiations We'll just have to wait to see how those work out Again, I think it's too early to tell whether these early signs of moderation will be sustained But certainly they are favorable, and for now it just could be the case that things are falling into line pretty well  Mr Chairman, I also agree with your recommendation I would add only one thing to it in terms of the operations of the Desk If what we're doing would suggest a federal funds rate of, say 8-1/8, I'd certainly be more comfortable with a slightly higher rate than I would with a lower rate "
3489,1988-10-17," Mr Chairman, this is Si Keehn Going beyond the bridge loan, is there any additional private sector participation contemplated or required to deal with this? "
3508,1988-11-01," I think Ed and Bob make a very good point, but nonetheless I come down in favor of the change I wasn't aware of the background of the March 1st vote until I read the memorandum I always thought it was a very awkward date coming in the middle of the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony I just feel there's a little bit of confusion there for the reasons that we've said namely, that by setting the ranges we have some accountability for them I think for the rotation to be on that basis, it will be a cleaner way to do it, and I'd be in favor of the change  Sam, given the dollar-yen pressure we're experiencing and [unintelligible], are there any changes in the attitudes of the Japanese [investors] over the dollar as an overall issue?  -16-    11/1/88  Well, our outlook is broadly, in the national context, very consistent with the Board's forecast; certainly in a numerical sense that would be true, but it is perhaps a little bit different in tone From many indicators certainly, it would appear that we are experiencing some moderation in the growth rate, albeit from very high levels I think really the major question is whether or not this moderation is and will continue to flow through to prices And on this front there are just a couple of what I would view as signs, and therefore the second part of the question would be do we need to take additional steps at this point to accelerate the process We'll talk about that later  With regard to the District and consistent with the overall economy, manufacturing activity in our District as we measure it does seem to be moderating On the price front, contacts within the  -32-    11/1/88  District and certainly our directors suggest that there is a discernible leveling in price trends with regard to certain raw materials and commodities The paper industry for example where there have been very significant increases in pulp prices, weight paper, and [unintelligible] prices seem to be hitting a peak Indeed,  expects to see something of a decline in those prices over the next five or six months Aluminum prices are down; even steel is showing some signs of leveling And there are many products that have been in very short supply where the backlogs have been filling up with these distinct signs of easing  A comment about housing We would expect 1989 to be not unlike 1988 with regard to housing starts, say 14 or 145 million But in the past, production and housing starts have been attributable to interest rates who are very close to this industry, are suggesting that in fact we may be getting into an environment of some market saturation and that if new home sales don't continue at a fairly high level, we could see a buildup of inventory of unsold homes If this is true, if we're getting into some market saturation with regard to housing, I've always had a question on the auto side of how far we can continue with these very big auto years And then we could also get some market saturation in that sector  Finally, a comment on the agricultural sector I hate to mention it, but I'm going to say just one thing about aflatoxin, which is an issue that has been very badly we think blown out of proportion; it's really not as big an issue as you might expect from reading the press But the FDA's standards of aflatoxin were really very, very tight It's one of these issues where you have to eat a ton of corn flakes forever before you get into trouble Those standards have been reduced a bit, but when this first hit the exchanges corn prices took a big dive; and beans, in sympathy, also went down They've come back and I think the markets are looking through this as kind of a non- issue From a [statistically] measurable perspective, we would expect that the aflatoxin effect would have stopped, but admittedly [the price of corn] is down because the drought would only have an effect of, say, 5 to 10 percent Given this year's drought, the early anticipation is that the next year's planting will be very heavy And of course we're a million miles away from that event But the expectation is that the acreage will be up by about 35 million acres, some 12 to 14 percent And if we get some reasonable growing season [weather], production could be pretty heavy Meanwhile, land values are continuing to increase--3 percent in this most recent quarter and 4 percent over the year So, I must say net at least in our District, the agricultural sector has come through much better than one might have expected given the kind of circumstances that we were dealing with  I think from a national perspective as well as from the District's, things are in pretty good balance And I would agree that no doubt some of the moderation that we are experiencing is a reflection of the monetary policy actions that we've taken so far  Mr Chairman, I also would be in agreement with what you recommend I might have come prepared to argue for shifting language to symmetric, but I don't feel strongly about it But I do have a question about the borrowing level The $600 million--, we have been through a period where the borrowing level has been at $600 million with a significant seasonal component I meant to ask Peter about this earlier I have a feeling that at this time each year as the level of seasonal borrowing comes down, the level of adjustment borrowing builds up But there's a possibility that this shift in composition of borrowing may have caused the federal funds rate, for this and other reasons, to be a little bit higher than our anticipation And if this is the case then maybe we need to think about a precise borrowing number  But on the anticipation that $600 million is consistent with 1/8th or 1/4th, that's what I would favor "
3546,1988-12-13," Peter, you commented on the 30-year [unintelligible] Is there an expectation that we will do more, or [what] is the market reaction to what we've done so far?  Well, while I completely agree with the procedure as you describe it, the only question I would have is how do we explain to the markets what we are doing I have in mind your February Humphrey-Hawkins testimony Are we doing something different that you're going to have to explain in your testimony?  Well, I would think in your testimony the aggregate discussion tends to be on the heavy side in terms of ranges and performance relative to the ranges, etc  -16-    12/13-14/88  I think what we are talking about is a quite different procedure with which I agree I think we may have a responsibility to explain both to the Congress as well as to the markets that we are doing something a little bit different here  Not everybody  Mr Chairman, we see the outlook just slightly differently from some of the comments so far; and again I would say in the national context, our outlook for next year is a little more modest than the staff forecast  In terms of the District, there are really very few changes to report from the last meeting Certainly, the District economy has moved along at a good pace I think everything is very solid and there are no significant soft spots out there But while the current situation does seem very solid, I must say I find the price inflation outlook to be particularly difficult to assess, and I find this an unusually difficult period The Greenbook and Mike's presentation yesterday clearly make a case that the economy is moving along very rapidly I think we've got some big price pressures out there, and I do find some of the data to be compelling Maybe we do have a somewhat overheated economy on our hands Alternatively, no one that I've talked to certainly is pessimistic; the attitudes with regard to next year I find very positive On the other hand, from our director reports and our other contacts, I don't sense a particularly big upsurge as folks look into the next year There are some constructive signs out there Capital expenditures, particularly for equipment and machinery, are moving ahead at a very good clip, and many of these expenditures are being directed to industries that are operating at pretty high capacity rates chemicals, petrochemicals, paper and the like That ought to relieve some of the capacity constraints in those industries Also, I'm hearing that some products that have been sold with long lead times or allocations are beginning to ease somewhat Indeed, orders for communications equipment and electronic components clearly are showing signs of peaking In autos, inventories as Mike reported yesterday are at higher levels Therefore, I think it's entirely possible that the production schedules will be reduced for the first quarter of next year And it's just possible that some of these prices that we have been hearing about are showing signs of some stabilization An example I would give is a company I talked to that keeps a very good track of its expenditures for materials; this year their expectation is that their material costs will have gone up about 23 percent Next year, they anticipate an increase of about 04 percent They are very careful about [their estimates] and they keep good records These numbers may not be typical of industry at large, but I think it's entirely possible that the trend is  -40-    12/13-14/88  In my mind the big question is on the labor side As I go around the District, everybody I've talked to reports a shortage of skilled labor Labor costs are rising, but this is frequently on the non-wage side as opposed to the wage side I think firms are continuing to get pretty good work rule changes, and therefore unit labor costs are under reasonable check In a pricing perspective, the question obviously, which we'll talk about later, is whether we have done enough or should do more Instinctively, I have the feeling that we've got a very strong economy on our hands The price pressures are building up We may see some increases, particularly in the near term But also as I said I think there are some signs of stabilization I continue to think that the risks are on the price side and that an upward policy bias will certainly be appropriate The point I'm making is that I'm not sure just how draconian we need to be at this point to deal with these pressures  Mr Chairman, while the risks clearly are on the side of inflation as we've said, not economic growth, it does seem to me as we've gone through the year and particularly starting in the late spring we've been responsive to that concern And I just don't have quite the feeling that others may have that we've fallen behind the curve on this one Certainly, at this time I think further tightening is appropriate And the scenario that you outlined is just right I would not raise the discount rate now I would simply raise the borrowing level and initially the fed funds rate to 8-3/4 percent and maybe moving up to 9 percent as we get into the new year would be appropriate But I'd hold the discount rate for something a little bit more overt than we see now to make that move more appropriate from the point of view of the market "
3571,1989-02-07," Mike, a question on chart 5 on the consumer durables Is the decline in the red line solely attributable to a decline in car sales from, say, 106 to 102 million units, or in fact does the slump of that line also imply some pickup in [unintelligible] of consumer durables?  What comprises the end of 1989 number?  I guess the question is With home starts down, does that fit in it?  Mr Chairman, with regard to the District, things are very much unchanged since my report at the previous meeting and that in itself may be significant The outlook certainly continues to be positive No one that we talk to in any way thinks that we're likely to have a recession this year There are some early comments about the possibility of a recession in 1990 but those are the same kinds of comments that we heard last year about 1989 Alternatively, the general attitude is that we will not experience any particularly rapid acceleration in growth either I think the inflationary picture continues to be very difficult to assess The common wisdom is that we are going to see some escalation, particularly on the wage side; yet the reports I get from companies are not necessarily consistent with that common wisdom The labor market continues to tighten We are continuing to hear comments about shortages of skilled labor But despite that, I'm surprised by how favorable the contract settlements continue to be--[increases in] wages and fringe benefits of 3 to 4 percent on an annual basis And though labor attitudes certainly are hardening, they have at least not yet begun to evidence themselves in significantly higher settlements The price side of the picture, I suppose as always, is quite uneven Steel prices have now begun to moderate At this point many companies report that steel prices are only now back to the prices that they were paying in 1980 and 1981 So, though we've had a big escalation over the last two years, we're now getting back to those levels that we experienced earlier in the 1980s But nonferrous prices are now beginning to accelerate again, particularly copper, nickel, and to a somewhat lesser extent,  -12-    2/7-8/89  aluminum Chemical prices are moderating following the big increases that we had over the last year or two, but pulp prices are beginning to escalate pretty rapidly I don't sense any consistent pattern in these materials prices At one company that I talked to--it isn't a very large company but it tracks these things very carefully--their material price increases for 1988 came in about 2 percent higher than 1987 For 1989 they had been forecasting an increase of 4 percent They very recently increased that from 4 to 13 percent, and that increase is entirely in the nonferrous area But despite the increase, it is still lower than what they had in 1988 Virtually everybody continues to report very competitive conditions in the marketplace For finished products there are competitive pressures that really make it difficult to pass price increases along, so there seems to be some continuing pressure there  With regard to the national outlook, our forecast is a bit more modest than the Board staff's but pretty consistent with the central tendency I think our difference with the Board staff's forecast is partially timing, but a bit of it is also in this nonauto durables area that I asked Mike about I continue to think that the risks at this point are on the inflation side--continued upward pressure on prices and, I do expect at some point, on wages As a consequence, as we get into the policy deliberation we're going to continue to need to exert more pressure to deal with that But having said that, I also have the feeling that, given what we have done so far, we are not necessarily behind the curve in dealing with the inflation problem  Mr Chairman, for the reasons that I think have been well covered I'd favor the preliminary ranges under alternative ""I"" Having reduced the preliminary ranges as much as we did last July, it seems to me that to reduce them further at this point has a signal effect that may contain more than we intend And if, as seems likely, we end up in the lower part of the M2 range for the year it seems to me that's an issue you can very well cover in your testimony  Mr Chairman, you very well described what I think is a very complicated and difficult current and prospective situation; and in a broad context I'm in agreement with you But having said that, at the margin I think I'd have a modest difference I'm not saying that we are targeting fed funds Nonetheless, if we have an objective currently of, say, 9 or 9-1/8 percent, I think I'm hearing from Peter and others that there is a market tendency to move higher--I would think 1/4 or 3/8 percentage points in that direction If there is that kind of tendency in the market I think we ought to support it and move up as those pressures continue to move up There is general agreement, certainly, that the risks here are on the side  -53-    2/7-8/89  of inflation The magnitude of the risks is something we can argue about, but I think Jerry stated it very well the risks are on the up side The underlying rate of the economic expansion is strong, I think, and sustainable; therefore, I wouldn't necessarily do anything that would hurt here but I sure would move up to the extent that we can, consistent with what I think is an underlying tendency Therefore, I'd probably come down someplace between ""B"" and ""C"" and would be inclined to move a little on the borrowing level now if that would basically support this upward tendency in the fed funds rate "
3597,1989-03-28," Sam, separate and apart from the central bank attitudes, what's the attitude of the participants in the markets? [Do they see] long-term trends there or is everybody kind of moving day-by-day? What are the basic attitudes?  Day-by-day?  Mr Chairman, I do find this a particularly difficult period in which to assess the outlook In his presentation I think Mike made the case, which we would agree with, that there are at least some tentative signs of moderation out there In a national context we reviewed a number of things in the Greenbook We think  -24-    3/28/89  consumer spending, particularly for durables, will be showing some sign of leveling Growth of exports is certainly short of our expectations, and that would be particularly true for industrial supplies, materials, and capital equipment The housing numbers are showing some signs of softness; interest rates have had an impact on that The railroads no longer carry the GNP but nonetheless the year- to-date numbers for rail shipments are certainly lower, particularly for February, than was the case for last year How much of this is weather-related I think is very tough to tell January was extraordinarily warm, of course, and February was at least normally cold and the seasonal adjustments may have had an impact on some of these national numbers  In a District context, we're really not seeing very much of this moderation The employment numbers throughout the District continue to be strong; we don't see any weaknesses emerging there The manufacturing outlook continues at a pretty high level The steel business, for example, is strong And the steel plants in the Midwest are exporting--admittedly from a low base--but nonetheless that's a new market for them Machine tool orders are up Railway equipment-- an industry that has been absolutely moribund over the last four or five years--is showing some signs of increased orders So, in a manufacturing context, it's our expectation that activity in the Midwest this year probably will be running ahead of the national numbers And certainly the other aspects of the Midwestern economy continue to be pretty favorable On the inflation side I have thought for quite some while that of course the risks really were, on balance, for higher levels of inflation I think that continues to be the case; but it may just be possible that we're at one of those times when the balance is shifting a little and that as we go into the upcoming period some of the moderating signs will become a bit more specific The real question--which we'll be talking about a little later--is how much more we need to do in a monetary policy sense, if in fact we need to do more  Don, maybe you answered this, but in the cool light of hindsight has the Hoey survey had a reasonable degree of accuracy?  Well, on the shorter?  Mr Chairman, I would be in favor of your recommendation, namely, alternative B But at this point I certainly would continue to favor asymmetric language Not to go further into the operational aspects of it but, if the market's perception is that the fed funds rate target is, say, 9-3/4 or 9-7/8 percent, it does seem to me that we are in a period in which there may be natural upward pressure on that rate I wouldn't resist it if the rate were moving up to 9-7/8 or 10 percent, whereas I would resist it if, in fact, the rate began to trend downward So, I'd have a clear bias toward allowing the rate to go up "
3623,1989-05-16," Mr Chairman, I think there is increasing evidence that the economy is moderating Mike has gone over all the indicators that I would have suggested would substantiate that At the outset a couple of months ago we may have been seeing these trends because we wanted to, but at this point I do think they are becoming much more tangible The question is Will these moderating trends be sustained? My hunch is that they will and that they can be sustained without further tightening  From a District perspective, though, the moderation that we're seeing nationally is not quite as apparent Many of the industries in our District are doing pretty well--indeed, very well The auto industry is a mini exception to that but it's not a dramatic change They are reducing their forecast for the year; commonly, the sales forecast for cars is 10 million and for trucks 51 million Inventories at the dealers are very high and for the first time in years the dealers are beginning to resist the delivery of new units Therefore, production is probably going to come down The second- quarter number looks to be a reduction of about 3 percent The production risk in autos is clearly on the down side, not on the up side But as they reduce production it's going to come out of overtime; therefore, the reduction in production will not result in layoffs But the sales level of, say, that 10 million on cars and 51 million on trucks can only be maintained with the incentives that they're running As I hear it, the incentives are the richest that they have ever offered since they initiated these programs As a result of this, the steel business, at least in our District, is expected to be down--not anything significant but down certainly from last year, which was very, very heavy Other parts of the District are doing very well The demand for industrial machinery is high; chemical products demand continues to be high; construction activity, despite higher rates, also continues to be at much higher levels than the national numbers would suggest; and our employment numbers are continuing to come in quite strong  In the agricultural sector, though, we have a little different outlook than Roger's At this time of the year it's always uncertain but this year is particularly uncertain Parts of the District--specifically western Illinois, southern Iowa and southern Wisconsin--are really very dry As a consequence, the planting this year is slower and is running behind the normal schedule Also, in Michigan we've had a very cold spring and we've had some frost damage to the fruit crops There is plenty of time to recover from this before any permanent damage is done, but the next month or so is going to be pretty critical  -20-    5/16/89  On the price side, I don't see any particular changes At least as I see it there is no further deterioration Some prices-- aluminum and steel, for example--are continuing to go up but prices of other products are coming down For example, there's some weakness on some chemical products On the labor front, despite very tight labor conditions as I've reported in the past, I continue to be impressed by how well some of the contracts come out I did talk to a chief executive officer last week of a company that just concluded a very major three-year contract which calls for increases of 3-1/2 percent over the three-year period So, certainly, those numbers are coming in better than I might have expected While I see no further price deterioration, on the other hand, there's no improvement either I think the overall situation is a bit better than at the time of the last meeting It's too early to be conclusive but the outlook, at least as I see it, is more constructive  I don't have a question but an observation I find the charts to be very helpful I wouldn't advise necessarily having you send them out in advance, but I do find having these kinds of charts as you go through your presentation to be a very useful part of the presentation  Mr Chairman, I'd agree with your analysis of the situation very, very closely I would support your recommendation without change It seems to me that it would be appropriate to maintain [the current] policy under alternative B and that this is a time that we could shift toward the symmetric language "
3665,1989-07-05," For those of us who were on planes today, has something been going on in the market today that is significant?  Mr Chairman, with regard to the current situation, at least in a national context, I do think there is a buildup of indicators that suggest fairly specifically that the growth rate is moderating That's particularly true in the interest- sensitive parts of the economy, notably cars and residential construction But across a broader spectrum of the current leading indicators I think we do see some tendency for moderation and a trending downward With regard to the forecast, ours is really very similar to the Board staff's We have somewhat stronger growth in 1989 and more so in 1990 I doubt it's worth going down sector-by- sector because I think in the main it's a difference in the policy assumption that we use in putting our forecast together We would expect a more rapid decline in interest rates, particularly short-term rates, than is true of the staff forecast, which accounts for our higher outlook on GNP growth  With regard to the District, what seems to be true in the national level is certainly less true within the District There are a couple of parts of the District that certainly have peaked and are heading down Automotive is clearly a part of that, and merchandise sales have been trending down for the last couple of months But other parts of the District continue to show strength For example, through May commercial construction contracts were up 1 percent versus a decline for the United States as a whole That same kind of dichotomy is true for residential construction We've had a bit of an increase whereas other parts of the country have been down As a result of that, within the District the demand for building products, specifically gypsum and cement, has been pretty strong And the demand for business equipment and other categories of industrial equipment continues to be surprisingly vigorous The steel business has been good though they expect something of a decline in the second half Nonetheless, the first half has been good enough that for the year as a whole steel in the District will come in pretty well Employment in the District has shown good gains We are equal with the national numbers and at this point our unemployment rate for the  -18-    7/5-6/89  District as a whole is under the national average; that's the first time that has happened in a while  On the price and inflation side the situation is a bit more mixed but I think, on balance, it's positive The reports we're getting from our directors as well as other market contacts would suggest some stabilization in raw material prices Indeed, a couple are coming down; aluminum and copper have been mentioned as prices that are coming down And with some minor exceptions there are no stand-outs in the raw material category that are showing great big increases For finished product prices I understand that market pressures continue very intense For example, in the paper industry they're operating at higher rates who runs a company in one part of that industry says they are operating at 93 percent And though they have had price increases over the last 12 months, looking ahead they think they are not going to get any increases at all And that's quite unusual to be operating at those higher rates and not getting price increases On the labor side, despite very tight conditions I'm surprised and impressed by how good at least the organized contracts are coming in People are still getting 3-year contracts and some are quite low I heard one comment of an increase in costs of 1-1/2 percent per year but that's unusual The 3 percent continues to be quite common On the agricultural side, and here I think the situation is very uncertain, the eastern part of the dDstrict has had far too much rain and the western part has not had enough; unfortunately, you can't average that out We're simply going to have to wait and see how the growing season takes place to determine whether or not we're going to have good yields But despite that, the demand for agricultural equipment continues to be surprisingly strong Both tractors and combines are being sold at a higher rate this year than last year One of the major manufacturers in our District has cancelled a two-week summer shutdown so they can keep up with demand I think the District doesn't quite reflect the trends we're seeing in terms of the national numbers But having said that, we lagged the recovery on the way up; and I think it's probably true that we're going to lag this turn on the way down Pretty shortly some of the moderation trends that we're seeing nationally will show up in the District as well  Inland has been in negotiations but I don't [think] they are a major supplier of the auto companies  Mr Chairman, given our experience with the aggregates this year, I think it's very difficult to forecast the outcome for the balance of the year, much less for 1990 I think the memo that Don sent out analyzing what has happened so far really was an excellent way of looking at what has happened But that certainly is after the fact, and it doesn't give me, at least, any real assurance as to how these aggregates are going to perform in the future But in the interim, it does seem to me that the signal effect of the ranges that we select really is very, very significant There is an interesting quote in the Bluebook on page 17 which says ""But only alternative III involves a further reduction in all the current money ranges and might seem most in accord with reinforcing the Committee's longer-term commitment to price stability"" I think that is a very significant statement To say anything else, really, in terms of the choice of the range would be a mistake Therefore, I would be very strongly in favor of alternative III for 1990 If in fact things work out this year along the lines that Don is suggesting, we do have--as apparently has been the case in the past--the opportunity to change the ranges in February Clearly, if a change were appropriate at that time, then we would do it But I think in the interim it would be important to signal our continual commitment to price stability And I think alternative III accomplishes that  Questions or--  Mr Chairman, given the current situation and the accumulation of evidence in the economy, along with the current conditions in the markets, I think the policy prescription that was outlined is just right and I concur with it "
3691,1989-08-22," What are the disadvantages to having it show on the record?  Well, the fact that it would only be activated if those things happened, it seems to me, is consistent with what you want Also, these minutes won't come out for six weeks  Long after your--  Mr Chairman, it seems to me in a national context that the economy, as Gary has just said, is moving along just about on the track that we might have expected I think the moderating growth trends are there; there are many industries that are certainly operating at lower levels than was the case earlier Some of the interim data may be coming in a little stronger than we might have expected, or certainly than we expected the last time we met That may be particularly true on the personal consumption side But I think, basically, the situation is largely unchanged  In a District context the news is a bit mixed but on balance showing signs of moderation The steel business, for example, has been weaker but there were some seasonal issues there Last year the  -26-    8/22/89  steel industry and most of the major customers operated throughout the summer without taking the normal seasonal shutdowns This year, though, they have been operating with somewhat normal shutdowns and I think this is having an effect on the numbers Looking ahead a bit, the auto industry, as Bob [Forrestal] has suggested, [is planning] a very significant production cutback in the fourth quarter That certainly is going to have a big impact on their numbers as well as those of their suppliers The heavy truck business is much softer now and some of their main manufacturing suppliers were also scheduling layoffs The Chicago purchasing managers' report for July reflected a pattern very similar to that in the national report Alternatively though, I find that the construction business has been surprisingly strong, particularly for commercial and public works There is a lot of activity going on there Our numbers in that category are stronger than the national numbers, and I think to a lesser extent the same is true for residential construction In the agricultural sector, the news is certainly much better now than it was earlier in the summer We've had reasonably good rainfalls pretty much throughout the District Production is going to be good Farm land values are continuing to go up a little more modestly this year than they were going up last year And in the improved environment, the agricultural picture is much better Products are moving off the dealers' lots at a pretty good rate I think the price picture is also good Prices of some basic materials, which over the last couple of years had shown big increases, are now down There are some chemical products--zinc and lead--that I think are examples of that; and others are showing smaller increases The competitive factors remain pretty intense, so finished prices are remaining in pretty good check  So at this point, I think the economy is developing very much in line with our expectations, at least But I will say our forecast has been a little [unintelligible] than the Board staff's forecast has been Some of the data are coming in on the positive side but I think the underlying risks are about the same as they have been On monetary policy some things are working out just about as we'd like to have them  Mr Chairman, I agree with your recommendation and your statement I have a mini preference for asymmetric language because, as we see it, the moderating trends are likely to continue But I don't feel particularly strongly about it "
3717,1989-10-03," I have a question not with regard to Peter's report on the operations but on the seasonal borrowing program We basically hear about the borrowing within [unintelligible] rather high And I'm not sure that fundamental underlying conditions are that different It's easy to believe that people are perhaps using it, hopefully, advantageously I just raise the question Are we going to take a look at the use of the seasonal program before we get into next year?  At this point, Don, or--  Well, I think you're right It seems to me it complicated the operation of the Desk on the way up and it's likely to complicate it on the way down If people are using it for different reasons [other than] seasonal borrowings, I think it makes sense to take a look at it  Mr Chairman, the overall situation, particularly as it relates to the Midwest, is largely consistent with a pattern that has been developing over the past several months--namely, moderation in many sectors It is not in any way a sense of deterioration, but a tendency [for activity] to come down toward a level more consistent with our forecast This moderation is particularly true in the heavy manufacturing part of our economy For example orders for the large trucks, Class A trucks, have slowed very considerably; orders for heavy construction equipment are down substantially; and some categories of machine tools are also off Offsetting this, construction activity in the District continues to be pretty strong, stronger than the national numbers Certainly, the automotive sector is difficult to read I agree with Mike's categorization; I think the strong sales level in August that was carried over in September is largely for the 1989 [models] and is in anticipation of the substantial price increases for 1990 cars Also, there are very heavy incentives on the 1989 models As a consequence, dealers are selling out of their inventories and the order level from the dealers to the manufacturers I'm told recently has all but collapsed As a consequence, the auto production schedules have been reduced substantially in the fourth quarter and the reductions planned for the first quarter of next year are even more substantial than that So, anybody who is dealing with the auto sector is beginning to  -28-    10/3/89  take on a fairly bearish tone In the agricultural area, the news is good The harvest has started and we are anticipating good production on both corn and soybeans--not record crops, but substantially higher than last year And our expectation is that, within the District, the USDA estimates of production are probably a little on the low side On the price front, it's hard to get a good sense of where prices are going, at least from the reports I get The Chicago purchasing managers' index came out earlier this week and the price component of that was at 50 I think that's reflective of the comments that I hear some prices are up and some prices are down, but there's no decided trend one way or the other On the wage front also there is no change The settlements, in my view at least, continue to be quite constructive and not indicative of the wage pressures that you might expect On net, I think the economy is moving along on a constructive but moderating trend Not unlike the Greenbook, I think the outlook for the balance of this year and, indeed, the early part of next year is assured, but I'm beginning to get concerned as to what a continuation of our current policy may mean as we get further out into next year  I'd be in favor of alternative B and asymmetric language It seems to me that what we're basically saying is no change in policy A word change is awfully minimal; nonetheless, I'd prefer remaining with asymmetric language at this point "
3735,1989-10-16," Mr Chairman, the two main markets out here this morning are viewed as being reasonably comfortable, under the circumstances The margin calls following Friday's activity have been met At the Merc the [unintelligible] was about 808; foreign trading was a little over $300 million and those are both up As I say, at the opening of the Fedwire this morning [unintelligible] viewed both of these changes as being especially helpful Other than that, banks seem comfortable in providing funds to meet these margin calls As you know, one dealer failed; he's not a major dealer, but there was a [buyer] over the weekend The purpose was to get that behind them so they wouldn't have that failure staring at them at the opening of business [Unintelligible] packages being put together, and that has been doubled I think everyone out here views the key as being what's going to happen on the New York stock exchange this morning Everyone's waiting; that's what's taking place here Apparently, things seem to be reasonably comfortable  Let me just add that the Bank went through the dealer list over the weekend here in Chicago to see how much [the banks] had advanced to each dealer Apparently, they had no problems As I said earlier, the margin call was met with no problem But if we had another that would be different But as of now they were quite comfortable with what they had to do to meet this margin call "
3742,1989-10-17," Not particularly, Mr Chairman Both the Merc and the Board of Trade had busy days yesterday--not record volumes, but still high volumes And margin calls this morning were fairly heavy but they were described as being easily met, I think, by the banks in supporting the margin requirements by the dealers The night trading on the Board of Trade last night was light--supposedly very steady as compared to a very heavy night Sunday night And both exchanges seem entirely comfortable this morning "
3751,1989-10-18," Not really, Mr Chairman Activity in the Chicago markets yesterday was much smaller than on Monday and Tuesday Operations here yesterday were seen as fairly routine and at this point there are no particular glitches in the system that I'm aware of But having said that, there certainly is a sense of wariness that continues "
3766,1989-11-14," Conditions in the District seem quite consistent with the national trend of moderation, but the moderation is perhaps a bit more apparent in the District because of our very significant commitment to manufacturing and also the importance of the auto companies and export-related activity And because of that, I think manufacturing may be showing something more of a downturn in our area than is true in the rest of the country Just to add a word or two to the automotive comments that we've already heard clearly, sales are down from the higher levels that were recorded this summer My contacts in Detroit suggest that November and December levels will continue to be under--and I think quite considerably under--the average for the year as a whole Even though the fourth-quarter production schedules for the domestics are down, nonetheless they anticipate that they are going to go through the end of the year with pretty high inventories at the dealer level As a consequence, at least one manufacturer has a preliminary forecast of these variables and what strikes me is the size of the decline in production for the first quarter down 18 percent compared to last year Other automotive-related businesses obviously are showing signs of weakness Heavy trucks are down significantly and diesel engine orders for one manufacturer are down 40 percent in September Given all of this, the unemployment levels in the District are showing signs of increase In Illinois, for example, unemployment went from 62 percent in September to 68 percent in October; in Michigan it went from 81 to 82 percent If you look at the District as a whole, unemployment numbers are clearly over the national average  But offsetting that trend there is, I think, some good news in the District First, the steel business--and it surprises me--has been quite good The industry has been working off some pretty high inventory positions in a variety of products They seem to be about through that So there is an expectation that for some products production is going to pick up For 1989 shipments are forecast at about 83 million tons; for 1990 the number is lower--from 80 to 81 million tons--but still hardly a [unintelligible] Farm equipment has been particularly good, given that the production of crops has been completed Farm income, of course, is good and expected to remain good Large tractor sales in the third quarter were 15 percent over last year; combine sales were 86 percent over last year's Clearly, that's a part of the industry that is doing much better Production is higher but they are going to be very careful not to build up too high an inventory position Construction activity in the District, particularly on the commercial side, remains surprisingly strong For [unintelligible], for example, we have about 13 million square feet available for lease and another 9 million under construction So, we're heading toward a vacancy rate that's going to be in the 15  -12-    11/14/89  percent area, which for us is pretty high Despite that, new building seems to be coming on  On the inflation side, by and large the current developments are consistent with some moderation built in over a long period of time Marketplace conditions for farm products seem to be very tight, with not as much latitude there as people would like In fact, some prices are coming down In the steel business, for example, the steel plate--[load] bearing or structural--prices really are coming down And in agriculture, despite this significant improvement in business, they expect price increases next year of about 3 percent--not as much as they would like and certainly very low levels On the wage front, wage rates are going up but I don't sense any particular big breakout on the up side And in the manufacturing sector, at least among those that I talk to, people have overcome the [wage] increases with productivity improvements so that costs are remaining in line So, things are working out about as we expected I think the fourth- quarter numbers, as more of them begin to emerge, are going to evidence considerably more weakness than we saw in the third quarter  Mr Chairman, I agree with your assessment It seems to me that in a broad sense we are accomplishing what we set out to do and that it's coming out about as we would have expected I do think the discussion around the table indicates that the economy is far different this time than was the case the last time Having said that, I think we've done quite a bit over the last month or two and this is an appropriate time to simply stand back and see how things work out I'd be in favor of alternative B I don't feel strongly about the language, but would have a slight preference for asymmetric  Don't we have a fairly long paper coming up? "
3793,1989-12-18," As always, I think history is an interesting way to look at things; and I find this chart on the bottom of Exhibit 2 to be fascinating with regard to where we have been My hunch is that if we go back, most of the periods with bad inflationary results may indeed have been the result of some exogenous events or shocks over which we had [no control], I suppose, with some exceptions It's not monetary policy that has been the cause of that And it seems to me that that may be [the case] over a long period of time; this suggests that what we can do is just put continued pressure on this If that's the way in which we can achieve the best results, I'd be reluctant to be so committed to an objective of zero inflation that it became [unintelligible] And I think John LaWare brings up a good point that if we become that committed to something and then we miss it because of events over which we have no control then the cost of that gets to be very, very high indeed And I'd be reluctant to be so constrained  It seems to me that the Federal Open Market Committee is a policymaking body and that we really can't make monetary policy decisions in a vacuum It's awfully awkward to be slavish to any mechanistic goal regardless of the events or the environment around us because the environment is constantly changing And I think decisions have to take that into account By definition, certainly less inflation is best But there are these measurement issues, which Governor LaWare has brought up, and I think there are others as well Indeed, if we were to aim at absolute zero inflation that, in effect, might very well be destabilizing for parts of the economy So it seems to me that a more realistic goal is a steady but low level of inflation Really, if the level of inflation is moving down and we are continuing to make progress, that's okay But if it's moving up that's not all right, and I would expect us as a Committee to react to that With regard to the timing question, for the same reasons it seems to me that it would be very awkward to be precise Again, if we are making progress that would be the desirable objective But because there are so many events out there over which we have absolutely no control but that could have an impact on inflation, if we were to be precise about a time I think we'd be put into a corner and have an economy that we really were not able to control  Well, I agree with most of the comments, particularly Ed Boehne's comment that we probably don't have a broad constituency out there that supports an absolutely slavish drive toward zero inflation at this specific time And in a practical  -48-    12/18-19/89  sense, it seems to me that politically it would be very, very difficult to build that When you talk to people about these kinds of objectives there's a running agreement in an academic sense But as you begin to think through some of the consequences related to attitudes in the changing political environment it would be difficult to adjust that That really was why I said earlier that I'd be opposed to a very specific public commitment to zero inflation in a very precise period of time; because if we really meant that, then as people began to work their way through what all that would mean, I think the political thrust to us would be very awkward As long as we are continuing to make progress and continuing to bring the rate of inflation down--and our policy deliberations and decisions take that pattern--it seems to me that that's the ultimate objective and that we're doing what we should do And the cost of becoming very mechanistic on this could be very difficult  A meeting or two ago I raised a question about the seasonal borrowing program and it just came up a moment ago It seems to me that we've been through a year in which the seasonal borrowings have been very, very heavy--maybe for some reasons that don't absolutely relate to seasonal requirements And at this point, it seems to me it's getting a bit in the way of the operation of the Desk I wonder if that doesn't raise a question as to whether or not we ought to look at the seasonal program to see if there's some way we could price it or handle it differently so it doesn't impact on the operations of the Desk  But we will be getting to it at a time of the year when the [Reserve] Banks will be back out offering the program again So time is running [out]  Mr Chairman, conditions in the District seem to be mixed, but I think clearly [our economy] is moderating Manufacturing, in particular the auto and auto-related parts of the manufacturing sector, is showing signs of weakness But there are other parts, particularly construction for example, that seem to be doing at least a little better than the national numbers There is little I can add to what we've already heard on the auto side, but given the importance of that industry to our District, I certainly feel constrained to say at least a word or two Contacts with that industry [indicate that the situation] is really pretty grim Sales levels have been down As a consequence, the expectation is that by the end of the year the inventory levels are going to be at least at a 100 days' supply, or maybe more, which is awfully high Consequently, as we said, the production schedules of the first quarter are going to be down very significantly--in the case of one manufacturer down by 23 percent as compared to the first quarter of last year At this point they caution that the production risk is clearly on the down side, not on the up side And the reason for that relates to this incentive business I hear what everybody is saying about the opportunity for more incentive programs, but they already have been fairly heavy and have had a terribly important and very negative effect on earnings I'm told, therefore, that there isn't quite as much room on the incentive side as people might believe and that the response to bigger incentives will be further cuts in production At the dealer level the attitudes are pretty sour Many of the dealers are claiming to be facing very serious financial problems and there is some risk that the automakers may lose some dealers Having said that, I do think it's important to keep all of this in perspective what we're talking about is a sales volume for 1989, including cars and light trucks, of 147 or 148 million, and that would be even with a very bad fourth quarter That is down from previous years but still not a disaster For 1990 the expectation is that the first quarter will be low, say, 141 million in sales, but that there will be a pickup in the second half Therefore, for the year as a whole we could be looking at a  -74-    12/18-19/89  sales level of, say, 14-1/2 million, which though down would be not an unreasonable year The effect of all of this, though, is pretty pervasive in the District because there are so many people who relate to autos one way or another  Other parts of the manufacturing side are doing surprisingly well, I think Agricultural equipment obviously is doing well, given the improvement in the farm sector As for the [steel] business, 1989 shipments are expected to be about 83 million tons, which is less than in 1988 but not significantly so And the outlook for 1990 suggests about 81 million tons--again down, but still not a disaster On the retail side, I think it's too early to see how Christmas is going to work out My understanding is that buying patterns have shifted and people are increasingly buying later in the Christmas season But the retailers I talk to are reasonably optimistic as to how it's going to go On the inflation front, I think the outlook has become somewhat better We see a lot of capacity coming on in some of the major industries--autos speak for themselves--but in steel we've had some additions to capacity over the last couple of years and the same is true of paper and chemicals And I'm hearing from people that there are a whole host of prices that seem to be moving down, not up Therefore, from that perspective, the inflation outlook has improved On the labor side, costs are up; most of it continues to be on the benefits side as opposed to basic wages and, therefore, the outlook doesn't seem negative Net, it seems to me that the outlook for next year continues to be positive but certainly moderate But I do think at this point that the risks are very much on the down side; at the same time, I believe the outlook for inflation perhaps has improved a bit  Mr Chairman, I completely agree with your recommendation to make the move now It seems to me that we have been moving in a pattern for the last several months and that it has been an appropriate way of dealing with the economy as it has been changing Therefore, to make another move now would be important and I think that we should do so It seems to me that the risks are clearly on the down side I'm not quite sure what kind of an immediate impact we will get, but certainly at the margin it has to be a plus rather than a minus I would move the rate down and then would return the directive to symmetric language "
3820,1990-02-06," Comparing our forecast versus the Board staff's, I must say ours is somewhat stronger We are looking for an increase in GNP, fourth quarter over fourth quarter, of about 2 to 2-1/4 percent Our differences are not all that large in any particular category But going down the whole list there does seem to be a bit stronger growth in most of the categories Personal consumption, for example, in our forecast is higher and I think durable goods are a part of that; I'm sure autos have some relationship there Business fixed investment also is stronger in our forecast; our housing number is somewhat higher There are no major differences but, as I say, we have a higher number in most of the categories But with regard to this interest rate increase we have had, if that were to continue at its current level for any length of time and become more pervasive, it might raise some questions about the strength of our forecast  Moving to the District economy, our District continues to have two economies, really the auto and auto-related activities, and then everything else On the auto side, despite the improvement in the sales level in January, the attitudes are awfully grim Plants were basically shut down in the early part of January; some have reopened since but the schedules for the remainder of the first quarter are really very low And the comments about the second- quarter production schedules are very cautionary Everybody is saying that they certainly are going to be higher than the first quarter but lower than the second quarter of last year But people are unwilling to be much more precise than that January's sales level has reduced auto inventories to about 70 to 80 days' supply, down from about 100 days' supply at the end of the year Despite that, and this is really a very difficult issue, the dealers just are not ordering more cars About half of the dealers, as I understand it, are still losing money They really do have a grim attitude and are just simply at the point of not buying more cars Therefore, we see the risk on the production side as down and not up Also, on the outlook for sales of heavy duty and medium size trucks, they had a bad year last year and the outlook for this year is pretty grim Despite that, no one I talk to suggests a forecast in terms of cars and light trucks lower than, say, 14 to    2/6-7/90  14-1/2 million units As I've commented before, yes, that's down from other years, but comparatively it's still not all that bad  Other parts of the District, I think, are moving along at a reasonably good pace The steel business is surprisingly good despite this slowdown in auto orders; demand for steel for appliances and structural items for other sectors of the economy is doing pretty well The level of incoming orders after the turn of the year generally looks good for this year And I'm told that in the steel industry the actual facts are better than the perceived facts Construction activity in the District is reasonably strong; both commercial and residential numbers are higher, I think, than the national numbers And we have a surprising number of new office projects, particularly in the Chicago area Vacancy rates are moving up a little but are not yet out of line In agricultural equipment, business looks good; the expectation is for an increase in unit sales of 4 to 5 percent this year over last year And in agriculture itself, the outlook is positive Crop prices are down and farm income probably is going to be down a bit, but if we have a reasonable break on moisture and some rains this spring and summer, the outlook there is pretty good As for retail sales in the District, the results in December were good and so far in January they have held up So, net, excluding autos, we think that the attitudes are reasonably positive There is no growing concern yet about accelerating risks on the recession side But having said that, the big caveat is the auto industry I think the auto sales will pick up, particularly in the second half; if that's not true, of course, the outlook will be different  Finally, on the inflation outlook, our numbers are a little more positive than the Board staff's We're expecting moderation in inflation this year to 4 percent or perhaps even a little lower by the end of the year The people I talk to say that raw materials prices in many cases seem to be down Steel, aluminum, and copper prices, for example, are down And I don't sense any strong upward pressure on the wage side Therefore, our outlook for the inflation situation is a little better That's not to say it's acceptable to have inflation of, say, 4 to 4-1/2 percent on a continued basis and, obviously, that has some monetary policy implications But presumably we'll talk about that later  Mr Chairman, I would also be in favor of alternative II, which seems to me to be consistent with the baseline strategy, ie reasonable growth or at least not unreasonable growth with some progress on the inflation front at least over a longer period of time My hunch is that if the growth rate, particularly in the early years, comes in as low as the strategy would suggest then it's low enough or far enough under the growth potential that in fact the inflation results may be better than suggested In terms of M3 and debt, I don't have a particularly strong feeling, but I would be in favor of 3 to 7 percent and 6 to 10 percent as outlined in alternative II Those seem to be reasonably technical adjustments for us if we were to go forward even more Alternative III, I think, would perhaps be more of a message than we'd want to deliver  Mr Chairman, I came to the meeting with the view in terms of policy moves that we've really done quite a bit in the last 6 to 8 months, that it will take a while for all this to work through and that, therefore, this would be a very appropriate opportunity to simply stay where we are Therefore, I'd also be in favor of alternative B and symmetric language My hunch is, given the length of time between this meeting and the next meeting, that there will be an appropriate opportunity to have a phone call  By doing it at lunch, is it clear that it's not a part of the Committee meeting?  It is part of the Committee meeting but at lunch "
3844,1990-03-27," Sam, related to that Did they ask us to share, and what did we say by way of opposition?  Mr Chairman, [unintelligible] the advent of spring weather, but within a District context I sense that the level of economic activity has improved at least modestly both in tone and in fact January and February were really very weak, of course, mainly because of the auto business, and that has persisted I think there has been some improvement For example, the steel business is much better Orders are coming in from a fairly broad spectrum of industries, backlogs are up, and in some cases shipments are being deferred Those I talk to are continuing to forecast shipments this year of, say, 81 to 82 million tons, and if there are any revisions, they are more likely to be up rather than down Construction activity in the District continues to be strong, indeed above the national numbers There continue to be just an awful lot of commercial projects coming along in Chicago Vacancy rates are still in line but I hope we're not beginning to replicate the New England experience Downtown Indianapolis, the different part of the District, apparently is going through a very substantial commercial real estate growth phase Home sales are ahead of last year and permits continue to be high, which is indicative of a continuing good level of housing Machinery business is quite good, with agricultural equipment for example at very high levels The outlook is good for that industry; production schedules would suggest an 8 percent increase over last year  The big uncertainty continues to be the automobile sector Certainly, the incentives of January are lame The first 20-day sales of March were very much on the weak side Unsold inventory is up a bit but not out of line for this time of year Second-quarter production schedules look to be about 25 percent higher than the first quarter but still would be lower than the second quarter of last year And in the case of one manufacturer, it's a substantial reduction from last year The industry continues to forecast [sales of] cars and light trucks together of [14-1/2 million] That number happens to be  -23-    3/27/90  a little higher than our number but they are anticipating a pretty good second half to come up to that higher number  In the agricultural sector, there has been a very significant improvement over the last few weeks At the last meeting I reported that the moisture issue was a significant concern We've had very good rains over the last three or four weeks and at the meeting of our agricultural advisory council last week we heard that the planting conditions are the best they've seen in quite a number of years For livestock, the outlook continues to be very good Land values are continuing to move up fairly slowly, which I think is constructive  On the credit side, I've talked to a number of banks within the last few weeks and, despite the numbers to the contrary, I think there's a difference in opinion on commercial real estate I sense some shutdown on that Also, I will say that I've heard of one project in Chicago in which a Japanese bank was going to participate and within the last few days it has backed out Our small business advisory council last week reported that they do sense some tightening of credit conditions and attitudes on the part of lenders More paperwork is required, more detail, more this and that; therefore, it's making it harder for the smaller companies to get credit  On the inflation side, our outlook is perhaps a bit better than the staff forecast Competitive conditions continue to be pretty intense Price increases just aren't sticking, at least in the full sense There has been enough new capacity in some industries--and I think paper is a good example of that--that the [competitive] price pressures will continue Wage settlements seem favorable and are not in any way getting out of line Offsetting that, though, just as a couple of negative items, I keep hearing about huge percentage increases in health care costs that are going through Also, as a different item, we're starting to hear from some companies about the increase in transportation costs that they're beginning to experience  We have had a somewhat more positive view on the economy than the staff and, therefore, we think the upward revision that Mike has gone through is appropriate We continue to think that the outlook for inflation is perhaps a bit better than the staff forecast, but I'd have to admit that our worry level on the inflation side is certainly higher at this meeting than was the case at the last meeting  Mr Chairman, I think you summed the situation up very well; I happen to agree with your conclusions As I said earlier, I think the risks on the inflation side may have shifted upward a bit, but I'm really still hopeful that as we get further into the year the numbers will show some improvement without our necessarily having tightened policy Therefore, at this point I'd be in favor of maintaining our policy and would have a preference for symmetric language I would only add that I don't in any way view symmetric language as limiting action on our part during the interim period if something should develop that would call for that "
3878,1990-05-15," Mr Chairman, overall conditions in the District are pretty much unchanged from the last meeting We seem to have stabilized at a level reasonably consistent with our outlook for the balance of the year, namely sustained growth at, say, a 2-1/4 percent rate I have a couple of specific comments First, on the auto sector, which Mike has covered At this point it looks as if some of the uncertainties in the industry early in the year have been clarified, with the very large unsold inventories having been worked down now to I think reasonable levels, particularly for this time of the year Production levels in the second quarter will be lower than last year by about 12 percent on average but significantly higher, of course, than in the first quarter And the early outlook for the third quarter is that production levels will be higher than was the case last year, but last year's third quarter was comparatively a quite weak quarter I think there's a slight change in sentiment among the auto dealers They have gone from being very, very negative to at least being cautious But my understanding is that on a national basis some 50 percent of them are still losing money And clearly, it takes very big incentives to move cars at this point The sales outlook for the year--adding cars and light trucks together--I'm told by the industry is about 14-1/2 million units They think that's very disappointing But having said that, they think their trend line is about 15 million units; so it seems to me that on a broader prospective 14-1/2 million in sales is a pretty reasonable year A major uncertainty, of course, is the labor negotiation coming up in the fall It is just far too early to tell how that's going to work out It certainly does have the potential to have a big impact on production  The steel business seems to be reasonably good; production levels are in the 85 to 86 percent area Sales of some steel products are coming in at about 100 percent of capacity and backlogs have now moved up to 82 to 83 days As a consequence, we are seeing some price  -13-    5/15/90  increases in the steel business and, given these kinds of pressures, those increases are sticking The expectation is that prices will go up about 5 percent on average next year In construction, surprisingly, both commercial and residential numbers in the District continue to move ahead of the national numbers But I think we're going to see a big change and that there will be some reduction Clearly, there is a curtailment of credit for commercial projects But everybody I talk to says it's simply a result of having had far too much money going into too many projects and it's going to take a while for the absorption rate to dig into the vacancy rates While the construction numbers probably will be a little lower than was our early expectation, offsetting that is our expectation that the opportunity for exports for the year will be a little better than we might have guessed The level of the dollar has not been impeding sales and any reduction in the dollar along the lines that Sam suggested simply will add to a more positive outlook there  In the agricultural sector, I was really pleased to hear that planting conditions have been excellent In fact, in Iowa a number of people describe conditions as the best they've seen in a good many years The corn crop is largely in; the soybean crop will go in within the next two weeks These better conditions will be reflected in a good increase in the demand for agricultural equipment Industry sales of large tractors and combines are running significantly ahead of last year  On the inflation side, the outlook is certainly less clear; it's difficult to tell how the first-quarter aberrations are going to work out as we go along here But we are still, I think, a bit more optimistic than Mike in that we see some improving trends in inflation as we get out toward the end of the year Market pricing for manufactured products continues to be very, very competitive There's a lot of pressure [to hold down] price increases, given capacity additions as well as foreign competition, [but] I think we're going to continue to see some price pressures In the services sector, though, there are some increases that are more disturbing; that would be most particularly true in regard to health care But on the wage side, basically increases seem to be continuing okay One very unusual example I talked to somebody who negotiated a six-year contract with the machinists union the other day, which provides for an annual cost increase of 2 percent and some unusual features I think that's an indication that wage pressures continue to be pretty tight  On a national basis, we think that the outlook for growth continues to be positive But certainly we're going to need to see some improvement in the inflation rate We continue to be optimistic, as I say, but pretty soon we're going to have to see that evidenced by better numbers on the inflation side  Mr Chairman, for the reasons you stated, I'd also be in favor of alternative B and would have a preference for symmetrical language The only other thing I would add is a question of timing Now, [unintelligible] I would not expect a lot to come out of the budget negotiations But it does seem to me that this could be an awkward time to be adjusting policy if in fact there is at least a possibility that something could come out of the budget discussions "
3901,1990-07-02," Mr Chairman, on balance the economy in the District is largely unchanged from the last meeting mixed to just stable, at least at a moderate level Clearly, there are some sectors that are weaker Retail sales are down and I must say anecdotally I am hearing that June sales really have been very soft as compared to last June Construction activity is down, both residential and nonresidential; yet our numbers I think are still running ahead of the national numbers The Chicago purchasing managers report came out the other day; for June it was down a bit from May Production, new orders, and order backlogs were lower The manufacturing sector is generally unchanged, but there are some areas that are better In the steel business, for example, as the year is moving along, the shipments level is being increased They started the year off thinking it would be an 80 million ton year Now, the numbers are up to as high as 84 million tons--a little lower than last year, but still a comparatively good year Operating levels, at least at the company I talked to, are at about 89 percent The electronic communications business is strong; the order rate is moving up and is now back up into the double-digit area The paper industry is flat but at a high level, operating at about 98 percent But having said that, an awful lot of capacity has come on in the paper business and, therefore, pricing is very, very intense Liner board, for example, has gone down from $410 a ton to $370 a ton In the manufacturing sector, not surprisingly, agricultural equipment is very strong; production levels are about 5 percent higher this year than last year Sales of agricultural equipment at retailers are moving at a very good pace Construction machinery, though, is weak; and in response to the decrease in construction activity, that category is down  The auto sector continues to be very, very uncertain; the sales level in May and early June certainly was weak and as a consequence the forecast for the year is beginning to be pulled down a bit One company's forecast is down to a little under 14-1/2 million units for the year and that's depending on 14-1/2 million for the second half Even those levels, of course, are dependent on tremendous incentives The incentives continue to be over $1,000 per  -14-    7/2-3/90  car in order to maintain these even weaker numbers of sales Auto inventories at retail continue to be at reasonable levels; dealers just aren't buying and, as a consequence, many of them are losing money GM is quoted as saying that 35 to 40 percent of its dealers are currently losing money The auto production levels in the third quarter will be significantly higher than last year but there is a comparative issue involved because the third quarter of last year was pretty weak  In the agricultural sector, what started off a couple of months ago as being a near perfect growing season looks not quite as positive as a consequence of the heavy amount of rain we've had in the Midwest We are having, to quote a new term, ""ponding"" in some areas and severe erosion And as a consequence, the corn planting has been delayed and some of it has been shifted into soybeans, which can be planted a bit later Depending on how things work from this point forward, I think we're still going to have a good production year, but it just isn't going to be quite as strong as it might otherwise have been  On the pricing side, our outlook is more positive than the staff forecast I am continuing to hear awfully good reports The raw materials prices are stable to down One large manufacturer I talked to says that his firm's raw materials costs for all of this year will be 1/2 percent lower than last year In other respects I hear very good news on the raw materials side Finally, with regard to the credit crunch, the banks that I talk to are saying that they certainly are being more careful in their approach to credit lending They are lending very, very carefully, but everybody says that there is more than enough credit for good credits And, of course, they would emphasize the word ""good""  Just briefly, in a national context--and I think our view is reflective of our District outlook--we have been a little more positive than has the Board staff in the past and we continue to be so Our outlook for this year particularly is stronger than the staff's and for next year we are a bit stronger The difference really is in personal consumption, to some extent in nondurables but to a greater extent in the durables category and [more specifically] in household durables Our outlook for home starts is a little higher than 13 million, whereas the Board staff's is a little under 13 million, and that works its way through in the household durables category With regard to inflation, our outlook is a bit different from the Board staff's also We think as we get into next year that the numbers will begin to show some improvement And our outlook for inflation by the end of next year is certainly lower than the Board staff's Thank you  Mr Chairman, for reasons that I think are clear from the discussion, we are going through a period where the uncertainties are particularly high with regard to the aggregates While it's clear we will be low in the range for M2 and below the range for M3, I think changing at this point implies a [degree of certainty] that we just don't have Therefore, I'd be inclined to maintain the 1990 ranges as they are In your testimony you can explain it It does seem to me that the exchange that you had with    7/2-3/90  Mike and Don a moment ago begins to provide a good basis for reducing the ranges First, Don's model and our models are not perfect; they certainly give as good an educated guess as we can come up with as to how things are going to work out So, I do think there's a basis for lowering [the ranges] Secondly, Don used the word ""symbolism"" in his text and I think that is important In effect, it's why we should continue the program of lowering the ranges So, I would lower the 1991 ranges Specifically, for M2 I'd be a bit more comfortable with 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent I don't feel strongly about it, but I have a minor preference there I think we definitely should continue targeting M3 In a period of uncertainty, the more alternatives we have the better off we are; therefore, I'd continue M3 Somehow reducing it to 0 to 4 percent seems like a big drop; I have a minor preference for 1 to 5 percent I don't feel very strongly about debt, but it does seem to me that the economy may begin to pick up next year as the forecast suggests that it might; therefore, I'd prefer to keep the debt range at 5 to 9 percent for next year  Mr Chairman, I'd be in favor of alternative ""B"" with the current asymmetric language, and I'm entirely comfortable with the explanation that you gave Bob Forrestal on what would trip using the asymmetric language Perhaps I have a slightly more positive outlook on the economy than some, and perhaps more so than you, but I think it's awfully important that we provide an environment in which we can continue to have these kinds of results It does seem to me that the move that you suggest will give us that  -50-    7/2-3/90 "
3924,1990-08-21," The budget deficit numbers that Peter mentioned, particularly the $300 billion, are a little higher than I had heard That is a combination of lower revenues and higher expenditures, I presume On the expenditure side, is it mainly the RTC-related expenses or are there other categories that are also going up? If you take that higher number, is there any way that we can finance that without having big upward pressure on rates?  Mr Chairman, reporting first on the conditions in the District prior to the Middle East events, I must say I certainly was surprised, positively, by the resilience of the Midwest and the ability of the District economy to rise above the national trend, at least so far Certainly, the GNP revisions reduced our baseline forecast at least somewhat, but pre-Middle East events we continued to have a positive expectation for the economy We forecast continued improvement this year and into next year  I have a couple of specific comments The steel business continues to be good A company I talked with is currently operating at a level of 85 percent of capacity; their order books are full for the third quarter; the fourth-quarter orders are coming in well; and they have not experienced the normal summer slowdown that they generally do each year They continue to look for shipments this year of 83 to 84 million tons, which is about equal with last year And even prior to the Middle East events, there was something of a boomlet going on in steel used in energy-related activities Demand for sheet and bar continues to be good The only significant change in their order book is that they do see a downturn in the demand for heavy structural items that would go into commercial construction Recent price increases in the steel industry have been sticking, but on average they are still at this time some 6 percent under last year In the construction area, on a year-to-date basis both nonresidential and residential construction in the District have been comparatively strong We've had plus numbers in both categories versus negative numbers on a national basis And just one item, the backlog for cement shipments, currently is running some 40 percent higher this year than last year, at least for one shipper But having said that, I do sense in a more current perspective that there are not only postponements of some major commercial projects but some outright cancellations I think within the last couple of weeks even in the Midwest there has been a change of attitudes there One supplier to the commercial construction business tells me that their attitudes are rather worse now than they have experienced since 1981 or 1982  The auto business continues to be a sector of enormous uncertainty But I did talk to one company as late as last Friday and they continue to hold to a sales forecast for cars and light trucks together of 144 million for this year And they're looking at 143 million for next year While those numbers, at least in my eyesight, look pretty good, their baseline number is 154 million So, when they're under that baseline number by that amount, they think conditions are pretty negative Third-quarter production schedules this year are up 17 percent over last year; fourth-quarter schedules  -15-    8/21/90  are up 10 percent over last year But, clearly, the production risks at this point are on the down side And even this late into the third quarter the projected pickup of 17 percent is likely to be erroneous Meanwhile, auto dealer attitudes are very negative One would expect some pickup in orders because of the possibility of a strike; despite that, dealers just aren't ordering cars But again, for the company that I talked to, 27 percent of their dealers are operating at a loss, which accounts for the negativism The heavy truck business is bad One manufacturer we talked to is looking for shipments of class E trucks, the heavy trucks, this year of 125,000 units; that's lower than others that are at 133,000 to 135,000 Again, that's against the baseline number of about 160,000 So, clearly, they're having a very bad year  In the agricultural sector, growing conditions continue to be very good, but because of late plantings and the reasonably cool summer that we've had so far, crops are a bit slower [coming in] than normal The yield is going to be determined largely by the timing of the first frost If we have a reasonable break on that first frost, production could be excellent and, indeed, farm income will be high There's a shot at least at having a record farm income  With regard to credit and lending conditions, I continue to think that this is really a phenomenon caused by the banks themselves going through a self-correcting process I think they've raised their lending standards But even with the increases in C&I lending by the District weekly reporting banks lower this year than last, the numbers are nonetheless positive And C&I lending by small banks in the District is higher this year than was the case last year So, maybe we're seeing a bottoming in this trend--at least in genuine C&I lending, taking out merger-related activity and the like I am reassured by the bankers that for good credits--they do emphasize the word ""good""--there is plenty of money available But they do all say that they have raised their credit standards  Shifting to a post-Middle-East-events comment and a look at the national economy, I think it's just too early to assess the damage that we're likely to experience Having said that, I haven't talked to anybody so far who specifically has changed their business pattern or what they are doing in the way of operations Some companies are going through their capital budgets, but there are some contradictory [comments] on that Some companies are planning to pull back on their capital spending programs, but I did talk to one company that's doing quite the opposite They are now in the process of accelerating their capital spending because they sense that the level of inflation will be higher and, therefore, they want to get their expenditures in before that occurs  Now, I continue to have a feeling, at least in an intuitive sense, that the economy is operating at a very moderate level and that the Middle East events certainly are a negative in all this But it's awfully hard to judge the outlook at this particular point And, therefore, certainly in the monetary policy sense, it's a very awkward period  Mr Chairman, I absolutely agree with the solution that you describe in what is at best a very difficult situation Therefore, I would support alternative ""B"" with asymmetric language toward ease I have one minor operative difference, and it relates to the question that Lee Hoskins raised Looking ahead, I do think the chances are that we will be easing policy sooner than we will be tightening it And it seems to me that these kinds of situations happen very, very quickly and that there are brief windows in which we would have an opportunity to make a change Therefore, I would not be uncomfortable--if you were to become aware of something and you felt we did not necessarily have time to bring the Committee together--if you were to go ahead and make a change without a phone call  Yes, that's how I interpreted it  That's my point  SPEAKER(?) That's the point "
3946,1990-09-07," Mr Chairman, this is Si Keehn I would agree largely with Bob Forrestal In our District there are no significant changes that I would report since the last meeting I agree with your assessment, particularly on the car sales Having said that, if you look at the June, July, and August numbers for total sales of cars-- imports and domestic--there is something of a decline, though not a precipitous decline It seems to me that to some considerable extent the market has discounted a change, particularly on the short-term side, and that if we don't move the fed funds rate, it may back up "
3966,1990-09-17," Mr Chairman, this is Si Keehn I can't report anything in the way of a change over the last couple of weeks, since our last phone call But I do think that the attitudes are becoming increasingly cautious out there--really even pessimistic My hunch is that the numbers on growth in the Midwest are still a bit stronger than the national numbers Clearly, we are at what I think is a very moderate [pace] and [the risks] are very much on the down side It's getting awfully close here While I was disappointed by what the 30-year rates did, I think there's enough anticipation in the market that we will ease that I'd be in Ed Boehne's camp--that we're moving close enough [to recession] that we ought to use a near-term outlook for policy "
3990,1990-10-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman In a District context, there really is very little recent specific data that will give a meaningful indication as to where the economy is going Everybody is in a state of suspended animation--waiting to see how some of these major uncertainties will work out But I agree with Mike that there's a considerable dichotomy between the sentiment out there and the underlying facts On balance, though, I think the District economy is continuing to show further moderation We're still doing a bit better than other parts of the country, but I think the growth rate is coming down  Despite that, I'm quite surprised, really, that some of the basic businesses are better than I might have expected The steel business, for example, continues to be strong; and as the year has gone forward it really has shown improvement They started this year expecting shipments of about 80 to 81 million tons; that number has come up and we're close enough to the end of the year that 84 million tons looks like a very safe [bet by the] fourth quarter Order books are basically full; there are some orders being delayed but no outright cancellations that I'm aware of Meanwhile, though, those in the steel business are trying to raise prices where they can and when they can, and to some extent the increases are sticking The construction business in the Midwest has finally hit the air pocket that others have experienced The August numbers, both residential and nonresidential, showed declines--not perhaps as significant as in other parts of the country--but they were down, and that's the first time we've experienced that General attitudes of those in the construction business are, understandably, quite pessimistic  In the auto sector, sales expectations certainly are being reduced The third-quarter number for cars and light trucks together came in at 146 million The fourth-quarter number is now down to 142 million and that brings 1990 down to 143 million; there has been a steady erosion as we've gone through the year For 1991, at least at the company I talk to, they are expecting 14 million at this point; but they have brought that down from 143 million the last time I talked to them and from 149 million the time before that So, it clearly has been coming down In the September numbers that Mike referred to, fleet sales apparently had an impact both on the first, but maybe most particularly, the second 10-day period of September; those sales were moved forward a little earlier than is normally the case to deal with production schedules The fourth-quarter production schedules for the auto companies are higher than last year, but last  -21-    10/2/90  year was a comparatively low period Clearly, the production risks are on the down side which, of course, is exactly what happened in the third quarter They had a very big production increase scheduled for the third quarter and they reduced that right through that period As an aside, the heavy duty truck business has been and continues to be very, very soft The news out of that area is bad  The agricultural sector continues to be strong Another week or so of this good weather and crop production is just going to be excellent Farm income, despite low commodity prices, is going to be ""pretty good,"" which means really very good There is some uncertainty and the budget resolution adds to that uncertainty As a consequence, the agricultural equipment business seems to have plateaued And as the major manufacturers look forward to next year, they think it's possible that equipment sales have plateaued and that 1991 will not be as good as 1990, and that's the first time in 2-1/2 years that we've had that comparison  On the price side, I must say as I talk to a lot of people around the District, that they are using opportunities to raise prices where they can Many of them felt they got burned the last time around on this energy issue and this time rather than waiting and putting through more major increases on an annual basis they are trying to add a little here and a little there whenever they have an opportunity Whether the competitive conditions are going to permit that remains to be seen  What to me is the most worrisome is this attitudinal issue While the current level of activity seems to be pretty good and there is certainly no evidence of accelerating deterioration, most businesses are worried about a recession And many of the CEOs that I talk to are running their businesses as if we are going to get into a recession They are looking at their plans for 1991 very carefully They are trying to curtail capital spending where they can The risk, of course, is that this could become a self-fulfilling prophecy and we could experience something of a downturn as a result Therefore, Mike's forecast looks entirely reasonable from our perspective Because of that and given the budget resolution and the other caveats, with respect to policy I think we need to be alert to the opportunity to respond to potential weakness  What might the timing of that be, assuming you go through with it?  Fairly near term?  Could I ask an operational question to be sure I have this clear? You're suggesting that we ease early next week, say, Tuesday Is the purpose of that easing to respond to the tightening that has taken place in the market?  That was the question Are you then suggesting we would ease 25 basis points near term before that?  That would be after the 13 individual appropriations have been done and the situation clarifies?  I would absolutely agree with your proposal as to both timing and methodology, which I would gather is alternative B as Don verbally described it, with asymmetric language now and an assumption that we may move next week with a continuation of asymmetric language "
4015,1990-11-13," In the Bluebook there is a comment about the Japanese banks borrowing overnight and about the fact that [such borrowing] apparently doesn't have an impact on the domestic rate I'm not quite clear how that works  A premium  Because the sentence really is no longer operative, as we discussed, I would very, very strongly favor eliminating it altogether There is another option if we feel we can't do that Sort of coupling the third and fourth alternatives with the word ""and"" may cover all the circumstances--and indeed are the circumstances under which we would want a consultation But I prefer dropping it altogether  Mr Chairman, in the District context, I think our part of the Midwest is still operating at a better level than is true of the national indicators Nonetheless, clear signs of weakening are beginning to emerge In the steel business the plants are operating at a comparatively high level, at about 84 percent of capacity; and at this point of the year, the year being really all but done, they are rather sure that they will see shipments this year of about 84 million tons So comparatively, it's quite a good year But    11/13/90  for the first time in quite some while, they're seeing a deferment of orders Two markets that in particular have this phenomenon are autos and appliances; appliances really have been very, very weak  The price increases that have gone into effect in the steel business certainly are not sticking; competitive pressures, I'm told, have been very tough and, therefore, the price increases really are not sticking The automotive sector we talked a little about this afternoon An explanation I would offer for the strength in sales relates to this fleet sale phenomenon The company that I talked with has had a very significant increase in the fleet component of their sales Going back to 1987, for example, fleet sales were about 27 percent of their total volume; this year they are going to be about 35 percent That selling is largely behind [them] at this point of the year Therefore, they are reducing their production schedules, which we talked about, and they have reduced their sales outlook for the industry next year--cars and light trucks--to about 14 million units  In the agricultural sector, though obviously we have had a good crop year, the production and sales of agricultural equipment are down There is a lot of uncertainty out there in the market because of the impact the tax bill is going to have on subsidies That uncertainty has caused farmers to defer major purchases And in order to keep inventories in line, some of the major producers are planning significant layoffs between now and the end of January so they can keep inventories low Heavy construction equipment is declining, reflecting [weaker] conditions in real estate, mining, and forest products And real estate construction, which in our area had been holding up I think surprisingly well, is now showing signs of softness in both residential and commercial sectors Interestingly, I've had a chance to talk to a number of different architectural firms recently and their business has just absolutely stopped There are no new projects coming on line; they're finishing off some of them, but new projects have just dried up Retail sales, particularly in those areas that are affected by the auto sector, are weak and home appliances are pointed out as being something particularly soft  In the financial sector, I think there's still a question but we are seeing a tightening of credit conditions The banks have raised their credit standards and also certainly are raising their prices for credit extensions There is a growing apprehension that there's going to be a very significant tightness in the markets as we get close to the end of the year A lot of banks are beginning to play with [unintelligible] measures to be sure that they get past the year-end [unintelligible] Therefore, I think it's the time when capital ratios could be impacted by year-end transactions that [unintelligible] some measures to control that With regard to inflation, excluding energy, I sense [price trends] are showing signs of, if not improving, certainly not getting any worse And given the weakening economic circumstances the [competitive] pressures, I think, are very high Labor costs particularly are showing similar and reasonable restraint  Now, I don't think anybody is forecasting anything like a collapse; nonetheless, I do think we are seeing signs of weakening and it's perhaps very likely that we're in for a rough quarter or two Certainly our outlook in a national context for the fourth quarter of  -27-    11/13/90  this year and the first quarter of next year would be consistent at least in direction with the forecast that the staff has given  I concur with your recommendation "
4035,1990-12-07," Mr Chairman, this is Si Keehn in Chicago I would echo what Dick is saying, though not in magnitude I've talked to several retailers and they said that the Christmas season is starting off far weaker than even they expected They do point out,    12/7/90  though, that this is unusually long in their [unintelligible], and they are hopeful that as they get along toward Christmas it will pick up The initial returns are quite bad  This is Si Keehn I agree with Bob I think the structure of rates and the circumstances are such that it would be appropriate to change the discount rate We have not changed it for some 22 months, which is an extraordinarily long period, despite all the changes that have taken place And I think we should do that if for no other reason--and this is in itself [unintelligible]--than at least that the directors feel left out of the problem "
4053,1990-12-18," Peter, I think maybe you have answered the question, but let me just go back over it again On this year-end issue, I keep hearing that because of capital level constraints this year the year-end pressures are going to be particularly tough Are you saying that was the case but [unintelligible] a bit?  Thank you, Mr Chairman While in a comparative sense economic activity in the District has been stronger than the national economy, as I have commented at past meetings, I think there has been a clear downward shift both in sentiment as well as in the underlying level of activity itself Probably the greatest impact-- and Mike can certainly comment on this--has been in the auto sector We've finally reached the point where these fleet sales have moved through the system And that had kept both production and sales at a higher level than we would have expected over the last several months Given that, I think sales levels probably will be down and will be more reflective of underlying consumer demand As a result, sales forecasts have been reduced One manufacturer that I talked to has reduced its sales expectations for next year by about 1 million units --down to 13-1/2 million units And even that is dependent on a pretty good improvement in the second half of the year At this point the auto inventories are at pretty reasonable levels with days supply around the mid-80s, and that's certainly better than was the case last year Nonetheless, production schedules for the first quarter of next year are down substantially And the manufacturers say the risk is clearly on the down side--that they probably will be reduced even further as we get into the quarter All of this is backing up into the suppliers to the auto industry; they've seen very significant cutbacks in their orders So, the backup is beginning to be pretty pervasive both in Michigan and Indiana, which are heavy suppliers to the industry  Another swing factor has been the level of construction activity We also have finally been hit by this Commercial contract awards have all but stopped At this point we have quite a number of projects that are still [some distance from their] completion dates So, we're going to have a lot of floor space coming on and, therefore, vacancy rates which already are beginning to climb certainly are going to be climbing even further We're going to have some cash flow problems developing in some of the developer areas For home starts, our numbers are perhaps not off as much as the national numbers, but currently we're seeing a downturn there as well The volume of home sales this year is significantly lower than last year  In the good news category, in the agricultural sector the production levels clearly were high, although the prices weren't quite as good as farmers would have liked Farm incomes at the end of the year are really in very good shape and I think the farm sector is in pretty good balance Many of the uncertainties that were bothering them before are behind us Farm equipment sales next year are expected to be about level with this year There are going to be some layoffs in that sector to bring inventories into line, but the farm outlook seems to be pretty good  It is hard to get a fix on retail sales, particularly this early in the season My hunch is that the Christmas season will come in better than a lot [unintelligible] would suggest Clearly, the  -13-    12/18/90  pricing is bad When I say that sales will be okay, I really mean that in a volume sense I think pricing is going to be very tough and, therefore, the profit levels will be down On the inflation front, excluding energy, I think the news is just okay Competitive pressures out there are terribly heavy and, therefore, the pricing continues to be tough The steel industry is a good example They're going to ship 84 or 85 million tons this year, which comparably is a pretty good year, but the pricing is really rough As a consequence, companies are shipping a lot of metal but are not making as much money doing that And certainly on the labor front there are no current excessive upward pressures  In a national context, our forecast is very consistent with the staff forecast, at least in broad contour, We have some interim quarterly differences, but I don't think that's particularly significant In my mind, the major uncertainty here is the financial system I can't remember a time when there has been a bigger buildup of pressures throughout the financial system It's awfully difficult to measure the impact if something were to get loose on us here in a kind of [destabilizing] way And when we get into the policy discussion, that would be a very important determinant, at least to my mind, of how we should conduct policy  Mr Chairman, I would enthusiastically support your recommendation, which I think is absolutely the right thing to do given the current circumstances Specifically, in terms of our decision here today, I would reduce the fed funds rate by 25 basis points, have asymmetric language, and hope that the discount rate would be reduced concurrently or shortly "
4095,1991-02-05," Would it be appropriate to ask what the nature of the objections was?  I don't have a solution to that problem, but just to express my view I thought a greater degree of specificity was appropriate, and given the problems that we've experienced, I understand that it could be contentious  Sam, what is your sense of the outlook for the dollar? You say that, given the interest rate differential and other things that are putting pressure on the dollar, [downward pressure] is there But is a precipitous fall likely here or just this continued downward pressure?  Peter, I agree with Bob's answer but as another operational alternative What if you were in the market more frequently than once a day--frequently enough that you could deal with some of the volatility?  -12-    2/5-6/91  Mr Chairman, starting with a comment about the national economy Our forecast is considerably more modest than Mike's rosy scenario But I am pleased that our forecast is comfortably included within the central tendency We have a couple of particular differences First, and this really relates to the Greenbook, we expect a pretty significant reduction in consumer durables in the second quarter rather than a very large pickup That  -21-    2/5-6/91  difference probably relates to the automotive sector, which seems to us to be very much on the optimistic side in the staff forecast I'll make a comment or two about the automotive sector in just a moment The second significant area of difference is on the export side Our expectation for import growth is a bit more modest than the Board staff's, but the difference is more particularly on the export side; we just don't think that exports are likely to grow to quite the level that the Board staff shows in their forecast And that really accounts for the differences in their forecast and ours  Turning now to the District As I have been reporting, the District really is doing quite well compared to other parts of the country but we are now catching up Clearly, a shift is taking place; certainly, more and more within the recent couple of weeks, our region is taking on the aspects of a fairly classic manufacturing recession So far it's mainly auto-related The Middle East events have resulted in an almost total shift in attitudes with regard to the outlook in that sector At this point it's very hard for automakers to keep any semblance of a normal production schedule Normally, they set their production schedules pretty far in advance But now they are meeting frequently--about weekly--and the tendency is to reduce production week-in and week-out As a result of significantly reduced retail sales, dealer inventory is building up in terms of the number of days stock on hand And, therefore, the dealers' attitudes are just terrible and dealer orders have been cut back substantially [Their sales] are running at about 50 percent of last fall's levels, and last fall was pretty weak to start with, particularly if you take out the fleet aspect of that So, the dealer orders from the manufacturers are very, very low Employment levels and production schedules have been reduced substantially and at least one company that I talked to would expect that production this quarter will be down 11 percent from last year, which was not in itself a strong period They would further expect that the risks are on the down side with respect to incoming orders, and it's entirely possible that their production in the first quarter will come in 24 percent below last year As they add their production and the production for the other manufacturers together they would expect that this would have a negative impact on the first quarter GNP by about 1 percentage point It's far too early to tell what is going to happen to auto production in the second quarter, but certainly it's going to be down compared to last year And as you would expect, [the impact of] autos is now moving into the supplier community and the suppliers are seeing very, very sharp curtailments of purchases  That's the bad news There is some better news The steel business--and I found this surprising--is quite good The orders are continuing to come in at reasonably good levels and firms are operating currently at a level of about 83 percent of capacity The current estimate for shipments this year is 81 million tons That's down from 85 million tons last year but is still a pretty good year, at least as they see it now And I think, encouragingly, they are exporting steel at pretty good levels even to Japan I do think the steel industry is one where the competitive aspects have improved very substantially just in going through the last three or four years Machine tool orders are surprisingly strong; some of that goes into the auto sector There will be substantial retooling in the auto sector as they come up with some new models over the next year or two, so that has been strong Agricultural equipment certainly is going to  -22-    2/5-6/91  be down; they have cut production substantially in this quarter but not nearly as much as the auto sector The production plans for the remainder of the year are expected to be down about 12 percent  I end up with a comment--an anecdote really--on retail sales not unlike Bob Parry's I talked with a guy who runs a specialty chain store that has operations all over the country They had a good year last year and a good Christmas season But as of January 15th there was just a complete shutdown of retail sales, unlike anything he had experienced in his life, He mentioned one story about a conversation with one of their salesmen he had seen when he was in New England The salesman had just completed the sale of a large couch to somebody As they were completing the paperwork, the buyer was just filled with apologies that she was buying the couch She made the point that she thought it was a bad time; she was embarrassed to be making a purchase at this particular time but the family desperately needed a couch to sit on and that's why they were doing it He suggested this is symptomatic of the attitudes that people have; they are quite worked up about this [war in the Gulf] And as a consequence, his retail stores are really quite void of people He doesn't think this will be a continuing effect, but for now it has had a very significant impact on their sales  Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation It seems to me that we've done quite a bit and we ought to sit back and pause here Having said that, I think the chances are that we are more likely to ease than to tighten before the next meeting and, therefore, I think the asymmetric language would be appropriate  I agree with Mike's thought; but having said that, changing the order at this point I think would imply more than we want to So, I'd be inclined to leave it as it is "
4122,1991-03-26," Peter, with regard to the discount rate I must say I find it a little awkward to have the discount rate and the fed funds rate at the same level, given our interest in trying to encourage at least the visibility of [the discount window] If we were to reduce the discount rate and make an argument that it was absolutely just a technical change to reestablish the [alignment with] market [rates], would the market buy it or not?  Mr Chairman, I sense something of a dichotomy in the District with the end of hostilities and the arrival of spring, which in Chicago is always a welcome event, or the combination of the two I think attitudes in the District are quite significantly better than they were at the time of the last meeting Retailers, for example, are reporting a significant increase in floor traffic and, in turn, improvement in sales of small ticket items It hasn't yet flowed through to big ticket items, but small ticket items are up  Auto dealers certainly have a significantly improved attitude As they went through December, January, and February--a very grim period--dealers were ordering cars from manufacturers at rates lower than the retail sales level That has now reversed; they are ordering cars at a higher level than their retail sales And while that's typical for this time of the year, nonetheless, I think it is a decided shift in attitudes But while the attitudes seem better, some of the specific numbers really don't line up with these improved attitudes The District labor markets, for example, are weak And while our numbers had compared favorably with the national numbers, we're seeing some deterioration there Claims for unemployment insurance are rising in the District, and my hunch is that our numbers are going to begin to take on an adverse comparison  -27-    3/26/91  with the national average We're continuing to experience what I think of as an unending series of layoffs from one plant to another-- 100 people here, 200 there, etc Specifically, in the auto industry, though the outlook may be improving, it's at pretty grim levels The manufacturers that we talk with have reduced their sales forecast for the full year again, down to 13 million units; of course, that's cars and light trucks And even that number is dependent on comparatively good third and fourth quarters The production levels in the auto industry in the second quarter will be higher than the first quarter but still some 10 to 15 percent lower than last year And as I hear it, the production risk in the auto industry is still very much on the down side at this point  This weaker auto situation is reflecting itself in the steel industry That industry is reducing its forecast for shipments for this year down to 77 million tons, which is down from 80 million tons at the time of the last meeting and down from 85 million tons for last year One manufacturer, at least when I talked to him, was producing at 70 percent of capacity The order rate is a little higher, so they won't do poorly in inventory Prices in the steel industry are at best stable but at a very low level The competitive conditions there are really very, very tough and as a consequence some have gone through some difficult profitability issues The pricing in general in the District, as far as steel and other things, is reflective of that Competitive conditions are awfully tough and for most items I don't sense much upward pressure In heavy trucks, ie Class E trucks, a category I haven't talked much about, conditions are really very weak Sales and production this year are off some 25 percent from last year; last year itself really was not a good year And one major engine manufacturer, a supplier to that heavy truck industry, is currently running at 30 percent of capacity, so they are really all but shut down and they don't expect any near-term improvement In fact, normally they sell about 180,000 units in a reasonably good year and the sales forecast for this year is between 110,000 and 130,000 units; therefore, it's a pretty depressed situation Adding to that problem for that industry, some of the major haulers are having a tough time getting credit to finance the purchase of equipment, so that just exacerbates the problem  The machine tool industry is a bit brighter than some of the other industries in the District Sales and backlogs are a little higher The auto industry will have to go through some significant model changeovers in the next couple of years, and that shows up in improved orders for machine tools Net, in the District context, I hope that we are going through something of a transitional phase and that we will see some improvement in the numbers following this improvement of attitudes that I certainly feel  In a national context, we have no basic disagreement with the staff forecast, at least in pattern We think we are moving past the low point here But our expectation is that the recovery will be a bit more modest than the staff forecast would suggest, at least for the next couple of quarters The personal consumption numbers look a little high, particularly for durables; that in turn will be dependent a great deal on the auto industry, and we'll just have to see how that works out So, as we look at it, we think we are moving through this transitional period, but at least for the moment the risk continues to be a bit on the down side  -28-    3/26/91  I would be in favor of alternative B I would have had a slight preference for asymmetric language in favor of easing but I think your comments with regard to consultation in the event of accelerating deterioration deal with that and, therefore, I support your position "
4144,1991-04-12," Mr Chairman, this is Si Keehn in Chicago I agree completely with the proposal that you've made My sense of it is that attitudes were somewhat better after the ceasing of hostilities but that some of that euphoria is now beginning to dissipate And certainly the underlying economic data coming out of the industrial sector have not yet begun to show the improvement that we would expect Specifically, I might comment on the steel industry We had a meeting of our local economists yesterday and the representatives of the steel industry reported significant and new weakness in their industry They are now operating at rates of about 70 percent and that's down quite considerably from levels a little earlier in the year Their expectation is that shipments in the first quarter will come in about 9 percent lower than last year So, clearly, in that area there is continuing weakness And I sense from talking to other people that that's a fairly pervasive comment "
4158,1991-04-30, When will this be announced and when will it be effective? 
4177,1991-05-14," Peter, the 30-year Treasury rate, which seems to be going in the wrong direction, is hard to judge What is the market's view on this? Is this a supply issue--just a very heavy volume of financing coming to market for [unintelligible]--or is this inflationary expectations?  Mr Chairman, conditions in the District remain unchanged from the last meeting You will remember that having come through the early phases somewhat better than other areas of the country, the data have now caught up with us, and the current level of activity in the Midwest, I think, is very much reflective of national conditions or already perhaps even a little weaker There may be some tentative signs of improvement, but nothing specific to suggest that we have reached a turning point  I think you can tell from Mike's comments, and it's certainly true in the District, that the critical area of focus is the auto industry Our District will not show a real-side improvement until we see a sustained pickup in the level of retail auto sales With the first and second quarters essentially complete now, the 1991 model year really has been a big disappointment The forecast of total sales for the full year was being pulled down to 12-1/2 to 13 million units and even that reduced level is quite dependent upon having a good improvement in sales in the third and fourth quarters And though car inventories at the retail level are really quite low at    5/14/91  this point, the dealers are still reducing their orders substantially At the time of the last meeting I reported that orders by retail dealers were in excess of or within the sales level That has turned around The dealers have turned quite negative and are ordering cars at about 80 percent of the current sales level, and that's, of course, very unusual for this time of the year In part, the dealer attitudes are based on the fact that many of them are losing money; at this point something like 50 percent of the dealers are in loss positions Despite this, given the seasonal factors of course, production in the second quarter is going to be up quite a bit from the very depressed levels in the first quarter Still, that higher level of production will be substantially under the production levels of the second quarter of last year But because of this shift between the first and second quarters, in a production sense the industry is going to be less of a drag on GNP than it was in the first quarter; indeed, it might have something of a positive effect As a final comment on the auto industry, I certainly would say that the enormous first-quarter losses that the Big Three experienced have cast a big pall on the Detroit area  Many of the other sectors of the District are impacted by the auto situation In the steel business, for example, one of the CEOs was telling me that his business was, in his term, ""rotten"" They currently are operating at about 70 percent of capacity The forecast of shipments for the year has been reduced from 85 million tons last year to 76-77 million tons this year And of that reduced level, about 20 percent is going into the export markets; of course, those sales have very little margin, so there's not very much profit there Other suppliers of the auto industry are equally hard pressed Some of the other parts of the District also are having a fairly weak time of it Construction activity, for example, continues to fade Construction contract awards are off very substantially from last year; through March the awards level is something like 26 percent under last year's level And people in the concrete business say that they are experiencing something of a free fall  More positively [for prices], though, the news in the agricultural sector is really quite good, mainly because of a reduced level of exports Corn and wheat prices are under [downward] pressure; that's going to hold down farm income Nonetheless, I think in an inflationary sense that ought to be good Due to heavy rains-- we have had a lot of rain in the Midwest--planting is about 10 days late But this is really a good problem, not a bad problem People I talk to say that the planting conditions really are excellent And while it's certainly far too early to judge the outlook for crop production, at least at this point it looks pretty good  Also positively on the inflation front, based on my talking to people, I think the price outlook is continuing to improve Competitive conditions in the marketplace are awfully tough Price increases are just very, very difficult to sustain And people who keep track of their raw material purchases say that they are experiencing very little price increases on raw material purchases The CEOs, looking ahead, still don't have any expectations that they're going to experience a very big price escalation  Net, while in a national context we may well be reaching a turning point, certainly we don't yet see it in the District From    5/14/91  our perspective within the District an improvement is going to be very dependent on the auto sector--an improved level of sales following the end of the model year production--and also an increase in exports Certainly at this point both of these objectives seem agonizingly elusive  I agree exactly with what Bob Forrestal has said I have a slight preference for asymmetric language, but I don't feel strongly about it And I do absolutely agree with both the current situation and with [policy] as you see it It's a fairly long time  -24-    5/14/91  between now and the next meeting, and a question comes up in my mind Presumably, we have now established that you have the right to move policy, and by that I mean the fed funds rate, by some amount I don't want to get into that but what would cause you to make a change as you look at the data that may be coming up in the next few weeks?  The down side  Well, I haven't looked at the calendar of the data that will be coming out over the next three or four weeks, but I'm simply saying that if there were some indication of basic weakness, I would hope there would be an opportunity to move  Thank you! "
4195,1991-06-10," This is Si Keehn in Chicago I agree with the thrust of Ed's comments The tentative signs out here are that economic activity in the Midwest is stabilizing, but I doubt that it has turned around Still, it seems much better than it was at the time of the last FOMC meeting The residential real estate activity is better; there are increases on a year-over-year basis in sales of houses Retail sales--at least from what we hear in the Midwest--are higher than the national averages The auto sector, I think, is still something of a quandary Dealers are continuing to report very weak sales without any particular signs of improvement But given the [unintelligible], production levels are a little higher than we saw in the earlier part of the year And manufacturers look toward 1991 closeouts The steel business has improved, particularly in the foreign sales of at least one producer, and there are several others as part of the auto industry who report at least some increase in orders But I think it's too early to conclude that the regional economy has moved into recovery    6/10/91 -4- "
4214,1991-07-02," Joan, what is likely to come out of a refunding study, and will they [implement any change from] the third quarter out?  Thank you, Mr Chairman First, with regard to the national economy, our forecast is very similar to the staff's forecast The differences are really very much at the margin Maybe my memory is faulty, but it's interesting that the range of the members' forecasts this time, particularly for real GNP, seems a bit narrower than I ever remember in the past Our outlook is a little more modest than the staff forecast for both this year and next I think, like Roger Guffey, that the main difference is in the inventory area Although the staff forecast would suggest a somewhat smaller inventory swing this time than in the past, nonetheless, our numbers are even a bit more modest than that I think the other differences really are very modest and our numbers line up reasonably well  With regard to the District, there are increasing signs that we have reached stabilization and I think the prospect for renewed growth has improved quite a good deal since the last meeting District employment was essentially unchanged in May after declining significantly in April and, as we [survey] the hiring plans for the third quarter, the employment situation looks to be getting better As always, the auto sector is absolutely key to the District and, of course, we are in the model changeover period and there is an awful lot of uncertainty out there But I think on balance--maybe it's because people are looking to a new model--that the attitudes are a little more positive And we would anticipate that production schedules in the third quarter would add a full percentage point to the GNP Even though auto inventories at retail are in good balance, nonetheless, I think the production risks continue to be on the weak side Given the results of the 1991 model year, any way you look at it there is an awful lot of nervousness about the 1992 models, and we aren't going to know the market reaction to all this until later this  -17-    7/2-3/91  month and really into August But the dealer attitudes are better; fewer are operating in loss positions now than was the case before and in general, as I say, the auto industry attitude is a little more positive This is working down into the supplier sector The steel business is a bit better than was the case at the time of the last meeting The forecast of shipments for the year has been moved up a bit to 77-78 million tons And the initial outlook for next year--at this point it has to be very [preliminary]--is that shipments will come in at about 80 million tons But still, it's important to remember that these numbers are significantly lower than the 85 million tons that were shipped in 1990 In the capital goods area, an awful lot of weakness continues Construction orders still are well below last year; the machine tool business is soft Heavy truck sales this year are about 15 percent lower than was the case last year, which was not a very good year  In the agricultural sector, we have a couple of interesting dichotomies First, starting with the weather Parts of Iowa are very wet--much too wet in fact to get into the fields; but some parts of Indiana haven't had enough rain Nonetheless, on balance, with any reasonable luck on growing conditions it should be a good production year The planting is about completed in the District For some, though, I would say it was the latest planting that they've experienced in a great many years And the latest Agriculture Department survey on planting would suggest that District corn and soybean acreage is up just a bit this year, which brings the other dichotomy forward namely, food prices Because of the increased acreage and significantly lower export opportunities, the carryover stocks this year are likely to be heavy, and prices are under significant [downward] pressure Corn and soybean prices particularly are under a lot of pressure Therefore, farm income is going to be down, and I am beginning to hear some bad news out of some parts of the agricultural sector that are a little more highly leveraged than others We could have some more problems there  On the inflation front, the news continues to be good and the outlook is even better Materials prices are under a lot of [downward] pressure and competitive conditions continue to be very heavy For some of the large manufacturers whom I talk to, the increases in their purchase prices this year are lower than last year One very large manufacturer that I talk to from time to time says that in fact they have a lot of leverage; they have been able to achieve a decrease in the overall cost of their raw materials and other purchased products this year So, they've accomplished a good deal Labor contracts continue to be favorable, with fairly long contracts and good terms But I would caution that there are at least two major contracts in the District coming up this fall that could make a difference But, net, District conditions seem to have stabilized, albeit at a fairly low level, and people's outlooks seem to be much more positive than at the time of the last meeting  Did you say that the difference is that they're rating down versus your ratings?  That's what I'm hearing  Mr Chairman, it seems to me you phrased it very, very well, and I absolutely agree with both the strategy and the scenario as you outlined it It seems to me at this point that the message effect of what we decide today is awfully important, perhaps a bit more important than the practical operating effect As I think about it, I'm not sure I'd like the message effect of changing the ranges either way at this point To reduce the ranges has some unfortunate consequences, which you talked about; it's the wrong time to send that particular message And, obviously, raising the range would be inappropriate I think the baseline alternative strategy as Don has outlined it is reasonably consistent with the economic forecast that we talked about yesterday And I must say that as I think about that forecast for this year and next year, it's a pretty constructive outlook and, therefore, it seems to me that we ought to continue to leave the ranges as we have them I very strongly favor the ranges of alternative II  For the interim period it seems to me that the current policy is appropriate There is a fairly short interval between now and the next meeting and, therefore, I'd be very supportive of alternative ""B"" with symmetric language "
4235,1991-08-05," Mr Chairman, this is Si Keehn I don't have anything to add to the analysis that Don Kohn has given us on M2 But I think conditions in the Midwest in general are a bit more favorable than we see in some of the national numbers But I very much agree with Ed Boehne's analysis Our [regional] economy, at least in tone, quite closely parallels his At our June board meeting the economists were really quite positive; at the July board meeting there was a decided shift in tone; it was much more modest, particularly as it related to some of the middle market companies here in the Midwest Also of concern is the agricultural situation, which started out as being a marvelous growing season in March, April, and May It has turned around on us; we now have quite a serious problem on our hands, given the very dry conditions we had in June and in July as well That is really having a negative impact on the farm industry    8/5/91  Having said all that, we expected the recovery to be much more modest than other previous recoveries, and we seem to be getting that But I do think at this point that the risks are on the down side We ought to be following developments very carefully and it may be appropriate to make another move  No, in fact, Iowa is not as bad Indiana is very serious and Illinois is serious, though not quite as bad as Indiana I don't know, frankly; it's a bit mixed; some parts are dry and other parts had pretty good rain But to give you a number For June and July we had less rainfall in those two months than in any year since 1936 So, it's quite a low level "
4255,1991-08-20," Mr Chairman, we have been forecasting a modest recovery and it seems to me that at best that's what it seems we have been getting Our forecast has been a little weaker than the staff forecast and with the passage of time I'm afraid the difference seems to have narrowed  -18-    8/20/91  With regard to the District, I think overall conditions are continuing to show improvement, but certainly this unevenness continues The auto sector remains the key uncertainty, with the change in models Recent sales trends have been encouraging at least but still far from strong, and the numbers are really confused by fleet sales It's very difficult to get at those numbers and really determine just what the underlying retail demand for cars is The '92 models have been introduced and the introduction hasn't gone quite as well as had been generally hoped Indeed, attitudes in our District are a little more negative than just a month ago In fact, one manufacturer is concerned enough about the way the '92 sales are going that they are going to put out a nationwide sales pitch of an unprecedented level in September Having said that, the retail dealer inventory is very low; no correction there is necessary But despite that, the production risks, looking at the third and fourth quarters, are still viewed as being on the down side Of course, the three main domestic manufacturers are reporting big losses And heavy truck numbers continue to be very weak; sales forecasts for '91 are estimated at about 90,000 units for the Class A trucks and that's down some 25 percent from 1990, which itself was a weak year The recreation vehicle business, which is very important--particularly to Indiana--also is pretty weak That business continues in a three-year slump now; [it's down] as much as 25 percent for some individual manufacturers The steel business, though, is doing a bit better Those manufacturers supplying the auto industry are operating at a slightly better level; 80 percent of capacity is the overall industry average And the current level of orders is responding to the slight pickup in car production; the current level of orders of those supplying the auto industry is at about 150 percent of capacity, but they do caution that those steel orders are subject to cancellation Nonetheless, they are forecasting for this year shipments of about 76 million tons and the initial forecast for '92 is 82 million tons  In the agricultural sector, the drought, as I commented the last time, is beginning to have some negative effect on the outlook for crop production So far it's not nearly as severe as the 1988 drought, and we do not expect this to move into the banking sector and cause the kind of problems that we had before Nonetheless, in terms of our District--and I think we are perhaps a bit more impacted by the drought than some other parts of the country--corn production will be down about 15 percent from last year and soybean production will be down about 4 percent But because the drought conditions are recent, prices haven't risen as much as one might expect and, therefore, farm income will be adversely affected That is beginning to show up in the weakness of sales of agricultural equipment, and the main manufacturers of ag equipment are beginning to pull back their production schedules for the remainder of this year  On the inflation front, I must say I continue to be impressed --really almost surprised--by the very, very heavy and continuing pressure on prices Competitive conditions out there are very intense and price increases at least from a [unintelligible] just aren't sticking Manufacturers are able to get a [price] reduction on their purchases of raw materials and other parts and products Some of the reductions really are quite impressive, so they've got a very good control on their costs Offsetting this, and Mike alluded to it, there has been some recent shift in labor contracts; some of the more recent contracts are not coming in quite as favorably as they were  -19-    8/20/91 -20-  earlier in the year I would point out that Deere and Caterpillar are just starting their negotiations These are very important contracts And certainly, the caps in their discussions particularly are starting off badly They can't even agree on the sites where they're going to hold the negotiations  With regard to the credit crunch--and I must say here I'm certainly speaking from a Midwestern perspective--the problem, at least in our part of the country, doesn't seem to be as bad as in other regions I think there is a slight shift taking place Though banks have raised and continue to have pretty high credit standards, for those companies and borrowers that do meet these standards there's plenty of credit available A CEO of one large regional bank told me the other day that for any good credit that goes on the table, five banks are coming after it pretty quickly In the consumer credit area--and we do have a director who follows consumer activities pretty closely--I must say the level of personal bankruptcies is getting a little worrisome The numbers are up very significantly this year over last year And this seems to be showing up in increased delinquencies in [banks'] consumer portfolios  The recovery still seems to be on track but it's certainly modest and uneven and very, very susceptible to shocks such as what we experienced over the weekend From a policy perspective, continuing ease is the best policy to facilitate the continued recovery and seems to me an appropriate course of action Thank you  Mr Chairman, given the risks as I see them--I think I heard some comments of the same nature around the table--I would prefer to do a bit more now But having said that, I find your recommendation entirely acceptable namely, alternative ""B"" with version II language [Nevertheless], I hope it would not take the accumulation of an awful lot of negative data before we make a move  Version II "
4274,1991-09-13," This is Si Keehn I would certainly concur with your recommendation, Mr Chairman "
4289,1991-10-01," Mr Chairman, in the Chicago District at least we seem to be in something of a steady state Really not much has changed in total context since the last meeting In a comparative sense our numbers seem a little better than the national averages On employment, for example, our numbers have shown a little less erosion than the national numbers; excluding Michigan, which of course has its own very obvious problems, some of the employment numbers are looking at least flat to up a bit Manufacturing activity is showing some sign of modest improvement The steel business, for example, is operating at a higher rate, and at least one manufacturer would anticipate that their operating rate would go up pretty close to 100 percent by the end of October  As has been the case all year, so much is very, very dependent on the auto industry And I must say at this point that I find it awfully hard to get a grasp on what the underlying retail demand for cars is The early September sales numbers are a little on the disappointing side, but it is expected that fleet sales during the last 10 days will boost sales for the month as whole The industry obviously is hoping for a better fourth quarter and the forecasts for sales of cars and light trucks seem to be coming in at about 136 million at an annual rate But they do admit that that could be a little on the optimistic side Based on that sales expectation, their production schedules for the fourth quarter have been set at levels quite a bit higher than the fourth quarter of last year and higher than the third quarter of this year But, again, the caveat or the production risk is on the down side Looking back at the third quarter, of course, they had production schedules that were forecast  -13-    10/1/91  at quite a bit higher level than actually took place If the sales fail to live up to expectations and production is cut back, that of course would work back onto the suppliers A lot of the order increases that steel manufacturers have are based on auto production, but these are orders that are cancelable We're just going to have to wait and see how all this works out in coming weeks  In the agricultural sector, despite the drought in parts of the District--it's particularly tough in central Indiana--and now the early frost, production is going to come in at a reasonable level Corn is down just a bit from last year; soybean production is probably down a little more The impact in the District in terms of farm income is nothing like what we experienced in '85 or '86 when we went through a big correction, barring even the drought of '88 And the ag banks do not anticipate a significant deterioration in the permanent aspects of agricultural loans  On the price inflation side, I must say the situation continues to look positive Competitive conditions are just too tight and too tough to provide much latitude for price increases The steel industry, for example, has announced a price increase for sheet steel They think it will stick, but major users of steel say it will not stick and that they will be able to beat it back down On the wage side, there is not much change other than, I would point out, that Caterpillar is really in a very tough negotiating stance--really a non-negotiating stance They anticipate a strike and final settlement coming out of that at a very low rate--at about the settlements of some of the other UAW contracts  In a national context, our numbers, certainly for the third and fourth quarters of this year, are quite similar to the Board staff's But I will say that our forecast for next year is a little lower than the staff forecast The main area of difference is in personal consumption for durable items and in turn for disposable income; our numbers are lower there as well So, I would argue that the staff forecast is a little on the positive side as we get into next year And, net, while the recovery seems to be developing along the lines that we've been anticipating, the main question is the one that Ed Boehne raised whether this recovery is going to be strong enough to get enough of the boats off of the bottom to sustain it for a continued period  ""B"" asymmetric "
4311,1991-10-30," Mr Chairman, this is Si Keehn in Chicago I agree largely with what both Ed and Bob have just said I don't think the situation has deteriorated that much since the last FOMC, but there has been a perceptible change in attitudes among the people that I've talked to They just are feeling much more concerned than they were before The sentiment has turned to the very negative side I spent some time talking this morning to representatives of the auto industry in preparation for the FOMC meeting next week I probably    10/30/91  have little to add that you don't already know Clearly, they are reducing their production schedules and their estimates with regard to sales both this year and next year are coming down According to the data they gave to me, the order levels coming in from their dealers look pretty terrible; there is a definite trend downward And the production that is now scheduled for the fourth quarter compared to orders appears to be substantially higher than [has been the case] in quite some number of years So, unless there is a rather substantial turnaround going into the early part of next year, they don't see any particular improvement  In terms of the policy decision, I think there are arguments for doing something that is a bit more dramatic I would very much favor a reduction in the discount rate as a way of indicating what we're doing, but also I would do it because I think we have a logjam on the prime rate If we choose to reduce the fed funds rate by 25 basis points, it may not be enough to move the banking industry down a notch, whereas if we reduce the discount rate and also the fed funds rate by 50 basis points, that would be enough to reduce the prime rate, I would think There is quite a bit of apathy and [such rate reductions] could have a very positive effect and, therefore, I would do it It doesn't seem to me that we need to wait for the FOMC meeting I'd be inclined to do it Friday morning "
4330,1991-11-05," Mr Chairman, in the District some signs of weakness have developed since the last meeting Attitudes have certainly deteriorated Anecdotal reports are coming in very much on the negative side As always, the auto sector is the major swing element in the District and in that area the news seems to be coming in more negatively The company that I've talked to has reduced its fourth-quarter production schedule by 8 percent from the time of our last meeting, and the production risks are still on the down side In part, the fourth-quarter production rate is based on a dealer order rate of about 66,000 units a week The order rate is in fact coming in substantially under that; it has averaged 52,000 units over the last five weeks and most recently it was only 43,000 In the retail auto sector, inventories are turning out okay and maybe a little on the low side If this gap between orders and production [widens] as we get into the quarter, we're probably going to get some further production cuts In turn, that will result in cuts in orders from the suppliers While earlier we expected that the auto sector might have a positive effect on fourth-quarter GNP, perhaps by as much as 1-1/2 percentage points, it now seems much more likely that the sector will be flat at best and perhaps a bit negative The production of medium size and heavy-duty trucks in September of this year was down 22    11/5/91  percent from last year And in terms of a comparative year, sales were pretty weak last year  District employment has moved sideways since April; it's up a bit in manufacturing, offset by a decline in nonmanufacturing Retail sales came in very much on the weak side, particularly in Detroit And one Chicago retailer told me that sales of autos in Chicago since Labor Day have begun to trail off and currently are running about 7 to 10 percent under the same [period] last year, particularly [unintelligible] Sales of new and existing homes in the District have declined quite substantially and housing starts have dropped as well Plant closings in the District--and I'm not talking about just temporary shutdowns but permanent closings--are continuing at what seems to me to be disturbingly high levels, with announcements day-in and day-out  Offsetting what may seem like gloom, here and there are some bright spots The steel business, for example, is something of a mystery The industry is now running at about an 80 percent rate [of capacity utilization] and the estimated shipments for the year have been increased a little--from 77 million tons at the time of the last meeting to 79 million tons now--and the outlook for 1992 is even a bit better Though the steel companies do expect some more cancellations coming out of the auto industry, steel inventories of manufacturers and also in the steel centers really are very, very low It should mean that even if there are some cutbacks in orders from the auto companies, the steel production levels ought not to be hit too hard  On the price front, the outlook continues to improve I think the better conditions are centered perhaps in the manufacturing sector; the major manufacturers are able to hold down the cost of their purchases Indeed, in some cases they really have achieved some good reductions I have no sense that direct labor costs are increasing more than productivity gains Deere, for example, very recently settled their contract; financially it is a little more expensive than they wanted Nonetheless, they got very good work rule changes and they feel that they can overcome the financial aspects through productivity And a word of caution Caterpillar is in their negotiations and those have broken down It looks as if they might have quite a tough strike and the settlement of that could set something of a pattern for the UAW at least [unintelligible]  Turning to the national economy, the Greenbook revisions plus the staff forecast for this year are much more in line with where we have been But the staff forecast still seems to us to be a bit on the high side as we get into 1992 The main difference, first of all, is in consumption, particularly for durables While the increases in the staff forecast are in reasonable alignment with the historical record, nonetheless in a current context they still seem to be a little on the high side Net, I think we have something of a [unintelligible] on our hands, which I think we will need to address as we get into the policy deliberations  Mr Chairman, it seems to me that the small reductions we have been doing really aren't producing the desired results, with M2 in this process having continued to deteriorate We haven't reduced the discount rate since September and that seems to me an awfully long time to have left such a visible rate in place, not having made a change I do think we are at a point where we need to do something a little more visible This confidence factor is important Also, it's important to do something that will bring the prime rate down I'm not [certain] that a lower prime rate is necessary to encourage more lending, at least at the outset; however, ultimately, I think it does work its way through to higher lending But it certainly does reduce the costs [of doing business] My preference would be to reduce the discount rate by 50 basis points and the fed funds rate by 25 basis points As to whether it's Wednesday or Friday, I have a slight preference for Friday, but I don't care I must say, having heard the conversation earlier, that I don't know quite how much confidence I have that a change in the discount rate [will be adopted] at this point Lacking that, then I'd be in favor of alternative A with a 50 basis point cut in the fed funds rate But I could live with 25 basis points now on the fed funds rate if there were asymmetric language If [the consensus] were for 25 basis points now and symmetric language, I'd find that a very difficult option at the moment "
4352,1991-12-02," Mr Chairman, this is Si Keehn In a District context, the economy continues to slow; it is still on a negative trend but [unintelligible] the last meeting I think are continuing in moderation Other than that, I would say that conditions in the District are a little worse than they were at the time of the meeting As always, the auto industry is the key to activity in the District I talked to one manufacturer this morning; they're still finishing up the numbers but their guess is that November probably came in at about 12-1/2 million units and that is a little lower than their estimates of two weeks ago The order rates from dealers to manufacturers are still lower than production levels One manufacturer had order rates that were coming in at about two-thirds of their production level and they're continuing to do that The risk is that manufacturers' inventories [will rise] in addition to dealers' inventories, and that has some implications for the first quarter of next year So far they have not backed up as much as expected Indeed, one steel supplier told me this morning that they've had some deferrals of shipments in the first quarter but not as much as they would have guessed They do anticipate both for the end of the year Otherwise, the Chicago purchasing managers report 627 [compared with] 562 in October On the down side, new orders with backlogs are down You'll soon get [the Beigebook report] on retailers here but we did have a chance to talk to a number of our retailers, and they felt they had a good weekend Their sales level was about 10 percent higher this year than in the same weekend last year However, they do point out forgotten [unintelligible] because of the length of [the selling season]  I must say I find this a very difficult environment, and the outlook is especially murky But I certainly have no reason to disagree with the forecast Mike has given While I recognize that this is an [unintelligible] to me, nevertheless, it does seem to me that the risks at this point continue to be on the down side And in light of that, I'd continue to ease "
4372,1991-12-17," Mr Chairman, while I might have a preference for adjusting the wording slightly or the order of the objectives, I think    12/17/91  I hear the way things are going and I support Governor Kelley's recommendation  Mr Chairman, I'll admit to feeling a bit on the gloomy side In a District context, the moderating pattern that has  -10-    12/17/91  been in evidence for quite some while is continuing I don't think it's necessarily accelerating, but it certainly is continuing  As I have so frequently commented, the automotive business of course has a very major impact on the District's activities and it is continuing to exert something of a negative influence The order rate for dealers has been consistently underneath the manufacturing production level with the result that the production schedules are continually reduced In the fourth quarter, production is going to come in substantially under what just a month or two ago was revised to the very lowest level possible There was something of an increase in the order rate in the first week in December, but I am told that about half of that increase was the result of fleet sales, not higher retail demand The first-quarter production rates are very uncertain at this point Initially, they have been set at a level a little lower than the fourth-quarter level, but there is every expectation that as we get into the quarter they will be reduced further But because the first quarter of 1991 was so very weak, in a comparative sense at least the production levels may exert a positive influence The forecast sales levels for 1992 are about one million units higher than 1991, but much of the increase is in the second half And, frankly, it seems more of a hope than a forecast of the reality  All of this is backing up into the supplier group Steel companies are experiencing cuts resulting from the auto manufacturers The orders have been reduced by about 10 percent for January and February and, as a result, the operating rates in the steel industry have declined and are currently down to about 77 percent Therefore, the first-quarter expectations for steel will be weaker than they were before Still, they are expecting for the full year that shipments will come in at about 82 million tons That would be up from about 78-1/2 million tons this year The other suppliers to the auto sector are experiencing similar curtailments It looks to us as if in a direct and indirect sense the automotive industry may have a negative impact of as much as 1 percent on fourth-quarter GDP; and it may also have a continuing negative effect in the first quarter  The heavy truck business continues to be terribly weak The class A truck shipments this year will come in at about 100,000 units For next year the expectation is that the shipments will go up to 109,000 units, so it's quite an increase Nevertheless, we have to compare that number with what shipments could be in a good year, and shipments could come in--have come in--at as much as 175,000 units  District employment increased in October; that's the latest month that we have available But the unemployment claims rose in November, and a survey of hiring plans for the first quarter indicates a decline in the Midwest from the fourth quarter The Chicago Purchasing Managers survey indicated a pretty substantial decline in November; there was even a steeper decline in Detroit And the Chicago December report, which will be coming out later this month, shows a further decline  With regard to retail sales, it's a little hard to get a picture; but I think the outlook is a little better, particularly for those in the discounting business For those people the early Christmas sales seem to be running a little over last year But alternatively, those who are not in the discounting business are    12/17/91  having a very tough time One specialty retailer I talked to said that currently he's having the worst experience he has had in 29 years He gave me a report on sales in the various regions that they cover and I was surprised that in Chicago in the first week of December they had an 8-1/2 percent decline in sales from the first week of December last year  On the inflation side, given the competitive conditions, pricing is really very, very tough One major manufacturer said that they have gotten decreases in the prices of their outside purchases of 14 percent this year and they are forecasting a further 06 percent decrease next year Despite some attempts to raise steel prices, I am told that steel prices more broadly are still at about the 1980 levels, so there is no improvement there The wage patterns continue to be favorable, but I will say there's a growing level of anxiety about the Caterpillar strike, which at this point looks very, very difficult  In a national context, the reduced staff forecast certainly seems plausible In fact, our current look at the first quarter would be just a bit better than the staff forecast, but we have the remaining quarters of 1992 weaker than in the staff's outlook I think there's a lot of hope in this expectation that we'll get a turnaround To me the risk is that the growth rate, if we get it, won't be strong enough to sustain itself and that we could, therefore, get back into a deteriorating environment And it seems to me that our policy actions have to deal with that risk  Mr Chairman, given my concerns about the outlook and the overall situation, I'd be very much in favor of doing more and doing it now I'd be in the Syron/Boehne camp, supporting alternative A Having said that, as I hear your recommendation, the evidence of economic growth would have to be very, very compelling in order not to ease If I'm right about my interpretation of that and if the move might be in the near term, then I support the recommendation But if I'm not right, I don't know how you can be more precise about exactly what you mean in terms of the indicators that would cause you to do something If I'm not right in my interpretation, then I'd be in favor of alternative A  Norm, at the risk of interrupting, which I'm doing, could I ask the Chairman for just a bit more interpretation as to what you really mean in terms of the indicators that would cause you to do one thing or another? What would really make a difference in terms of monetary policy?  Continuation of the current trends Do you have a time perspective in mind?  -37-    12/17/91  Two to three weeks or something like that?  Thank you "
4407,1992-02-04," Mike, a curiosity question on productivity as depicted in Chart 14 Am I right that overall productivity includes manufacturing and services?  The question relates to my impression that on the manufacturing side productivity seems to have been pretty good over the [past] few years and, therefore, in an inflationary sense it has been a constructive thing Am I right about that?  Mr Chairman, our forecast is quite close to the staff forecast for 1992 Indeed, we probably are closer now than we have been in a while Our outlook for both inflation and unemployment is just a little lower, but the differences aren't really worth talking about  With regard to the District, in the period since the last meeting of the Committee, I think the District economy really has weakened This seemed particularly true as we approached and then went through the year-end period In some respects, I think the District just caught up with the conditions that were prevalent around the country The employment situation is perhaps the most evident indicator of that Total payroll employment in the District declined in December, and the District unemployment rate went up to 7-1/2 percent; that's the highest level we've had since May of 1986 Illinois really did stand out in that; its unemployment rate went up to 93 percent and that got a lot of attention There are some special factors behind that; nonetheless, it was a very, very significant increase in the level of unemployment in Illinois And that puts us, I believe, at the top of the industrial states Announcements of employment reductions, closings, early retirement programs, and the like, are continuing at what seems to me to be a very disturbing rate Since the year-end, I've been trying to look around pretty hard for better news and I have to admit it is a bit scarce I will say that there are some categories in which there are signs, if not of improvement, at least of stabilization The steel business is perhaps in that category One large manufacturer in our area is clearly operating at a 72 to 73 percent rate, but its current order rate is a little higher, coming in at about 75 percent So, that should mean their total production will go up a bit And the forecast for shipments this year is a little higher than was the case last year In the steel industry, though, the pricing is stable, which from their point of view means that it is just terrible Their prices currently are generally at about the level that they were in 1980-81 on a nominal basis On an inflation-adjusted basis that means they're about 30 percent under that level The outlook for heavy trucks also is just a bit better; sales are expected to be some 5 to 6  -11-    2/4-5/92  percent higher this year compared to last year But I will say that that improvement is very much a forecast for the second half of the year; there's an awful lot of focus in the District on the second half versus the first half Machine tool orders increased in December; that was particularly true for metal cutting tools, which should mean that those industries will be producing at higher levels  Also, I think there's something of a brighter note on the retail front One specialty retailer I talked to said that in the early part of January their sales around the country were up some 14 to 18 percent Another very major retailer in the area said they had a good January; their sales for the full month were 17 percent over last year On a cautionary note, though, last January sales were very badly affected, of course, by the so-called CNN factor And all the retailers say that discounting continues to be just very, very tough In the automotive business, though, as Mike has said, the last 10 days were a little better Still, for January as a whole those sales came in a bit lower than the earlier forecast I think that means that the first-quarter production schedules are at further risk But one manufacturer that I talked to said that they had seen some improvement in the order rate from dealers, which is something I've been looking at pretty carefully And, indeed, last week they had a very significant increase in the order rate from their dealers They're not quite sure why If that is maintained, then their production schedules in the first quarter might be okay  In the agricultural sector, the equipment business has hit a rough spot One major manufacturer has had a decline in sales of major implements of some 24 percent over the last couple of months There's a comparison issue there, but they still are down very significantly; the reason is supposedly that the farmers are looking at the ITC and are going to hold off until that gets clarified I do think that for many of the businesses in our District, this ITC uncertainty is going to be something of wild card  In an overall context, while I can't find people whose attitudes are particularly positive, nonetheless some of the very heavy depression that was rather pervasive when we last met has passed, and I do think our policy change in December had an important effect on that  On the pricing front, the outlook continues to be positive The competitive conditions speak for themselves Price increases just don't stick; and wage increases, particularly in manufacturing, are modest and can be dealt with through productivity improvements Therefore, I think the staff forecast on inflation is very realistic Also, I think the restraint on credit extensions by banks is beginning to stabilize As nonperforming loan problems begin to unwind here and capital ratios continue to improve, lending attitudes are getting just a bit more expansive It hasn't shown up in the numbers yet, but my sense is that the lending officers are being encouraged to go out and find good loans, and I certainly would want to emphasize the ""good"" in that comment Net, I think the risks continue to be on the down side in terms of overall economic activity, but I do think, though it's hard to give you statistical evidence of it, that there has been at least a mini-improvement on balance from the last meeting  It has not; it has gotten worse Caterpillar, of course, built up very large inventories going into the strike And because of the low sales level they are still very much working off those inventories And the union has an enormous strike fund This is getting to be tougher; they are not talking, and it's difficult to see a constructive way out of this one  It's not so much wages as it is the issue of [the industry] pattern The UAW settled with Deere and is insisting on the same settlement out of Caterpillar Caterpillar is saying they ship to different industries and face different competitive factors, and they cannot settle on the [basis of the] Deere package Again, it's the pattern that is the ultimate issue here  Well, Deere had a bad [strike] the last time and went into this one deciding they were going to find a way of settling  Mr Chairman, I would be in favor of alternative I For the reasons we've articulated today and in any number of other meetings it seems to me that the [historical] relationships have broken down As a consequence, to make a change would imply a greater degree of confidence in the aggregates than we currently have, at least in an operative sense Moreover, if we were to make a change, either up or down, it would convey a policy message that I think at this particular point would be very inappropriate So, I would be in favor of alternative I  As to where we might end up in the range, it's awfully early in the year to try to determine that It does seem to me that in an operative sense we are really driving policy off a different measurement anyway And I'd like to see how the economy seems to be developing as we get further into the year before trying to determine just where in the range M2 might properly be  Mr Chairman, to state the obvious, this is a very difficult period to try to assess both the current as well as the  -57-    2/4-5/92  prospective environment There may have been at least a mini- improvement in the balance from the last meeting but, as I said yesterday, I still think the risks are very much on the down side at this point And the policy directive should reflect that risk I think it's perhaps too soon to ease again; moreover, we don't have a credible basis on which we could make that kind of change But if the incoming data begin to show further deterioration, I'd move and I'd move quickly Therefore, I'd be in favor of your recommendation for alternative B with asymmetric language toward ease "
4431,1992-03-11," Mr Chairman, this is Si Keehn in Chicago It would be difficult to enumerate a long list of indicators that would suggest a pickup in activity on a sustained basis, but there are some decidedly encouraging signs out there I have not seen proof but I think there is a developing expectation that things are going to get better [For auto assemblies] the most recent trend is a little disappointing but still, as Mike has commented, production levels in the first quarter are some 6 to 7 percent higher than in the first quarter of last year which admittedly was hardly a [unintelligible] The early schedules for the second quarter also show an increase of 7 to 8 percent in production levels, so that's on the plus side Retail sales certainly have improved And, while the increases on a current basis are rather slim, nonetheless clearly there is a better retail attitude out there [than there was] in January and February Many retailers claim that they really are surprised by the strength that they are seeing More significantly, home sales have improved, especially in the Midwest And I think the very significant [unintelligible] that we've seen is very remarkable [However,] there's a lot of noise in the numbers We've had an extraordinarily mild winter, which has helped; also the current inventory is pretty low One local residential retail dealer said he had a very, very good February--in fact the best February he's ever had Therefore, I think it's clear that lower rates are working their way through to the residential market to show a definite improvement I must say that while the situation is far from [certain], I do think that on balance conditions in the Midwest are better Attitudes are improved and the signs are that the US economy has bottomed out  Well, the change there is basically for the worse Caterpillar has called back some workers and [unintelligible] UAW then struck those plants The standoff continues I think it's worse The [unintelligible] situation is deteriorating; the UAW attitudes [unintelligible] It clearly has gotten worse and there are no signs that there is going to be a break because both sides have dug in very hard It's the pattern issue that I commented on before that is the breaking point "
4457,1992-03-31," Thank you, Mr Chairman With regard to the national economy, our forecast is very similar to the staff forecast at least in contour We also show an improving quarterly trend but our growth rates, particularly in the first and second quarters, are a bit lower Our outlook for personal consumption, particularly durables, is just a little lower than the staff forecast Correspondingly, our outlook for inflation this year is a bit more positive We would think the CPI, for example, by the end of the year could be at 3 percent or a bit lower But these overall differences are really just differences at the margin  In the District, the modest improvement that I commented on at the time of the last meeting and also on the telephone call continues Certainly, residential housing in the Midwest has been a strong point Homebuilding has increased significantly and home sales have also been very active But I do think weather has been a decided factor We've had the warmest winter in 97 years and I have a hunch that the seasonal adjustment factors have had an effect on the numbers At the distant horizon--and I would emphasize distant--I am hearing a little better tone in the commercial real estate sector Some investors are beginning to express at least a possible interest in commercial real estate That's the first time I've heard that in quite a while Not in any way should this suggest that there's any interest in new projects; that's a long way out In fact, in Chicago we have a number of fairly sizable projects that are still being finished As a consequence the rental overhang is pretty high and the rental terms are very, very tough Nonetheless, this possible interest on the part of investors to come back may be indicative that we could be reaching toward stabilization in this very tough sector  The automobile business is a bit better, at least for the one manufacturer that I talked to Their first-quarter production, for example, was 32 percent over last year; last year, of course, was very low as a comparative period The second-quarter production will be up about 8 percent Encouraging also is the dealer order rate, which has shown a significant improvement on a week-by-week basis as we've gone through this year Sales have been a little under forecast but there is a better tone out there There is a better mix Fleet sales are down; retail sales are up Also, retail pricing for autos has been a little firmer In the truck industry, medium truck demand is flat to down a bit, reflecting very tight control on capital expenditures by businesses But the demand for big trucks, the class A rigs, is up a bit, and one manufacturer is forecasting a 10 percent increase in  -14-    3/31/92  sales this year for the class A group Still, in a comparative sense, that is a very modest number  The steel business continues to be pretty reasonable First- quarter sales will come in at an 82 million ton annual rate The industry is now operating at about 85 percent capacity but the pricing in the steel business is very, very tough On the retail side, sales continue to show an improvement It looks to us as if retail sales in the Midwest are running about 5 percent ahead of last year on a comparable store basis but the pricing continues to be [very competitive]; we see no inflation on the retail side In the agricultural sector, the outlook for the crop year looks favorable, at least at this point, despite a fairly warm and a dry winter Ground moisture is regarded as being excellent in most of our ag areas Planting is going to start in two to three weeks and the outlook is pretty positive There is some concern out there about the [weather] effect; nonetheless, we are forecasting normal crop production this year  With regard to inflation, I do think the outlook continues to improve Pricing conditions in the marketplace are awfully tough The big increases just don't stick and in some industries--paper, for example--prices are continuing to come down And energy prices just don't represent anything by way of an inflation issue On the labor side, the contracts are being settled on very favorable bases In the paper [industry], for example, one of our directors reported that a company has recently gotten a six-year contract, with annual increases of 3 percent a year plus a one-time premium shift buyout of 3 percent Two other paper companies got five-year contracts at very, very modest wage increases So, certainly, those contracts have gone well But one labor negotiation that has not gone well, and I've commented on it before, is the Caterpillar contract; the strike is now almost five months old They held the first talk in quite some while last week, but nothing came out of that In fact, the union rejected what the company said was absolutely its final offer So, the discussions broke off and both sides left The pattern issue is what is holding them up Both sides have said that absolutely under no circumstances will they give on that particular issue In the interim Caterpillar's inventories are running down to pretty low levels; and current production, of course, is very spotty I talked to somebody yesterday  That for the union would be a very tough situation The expectation is that this could get to be pretty vicious before we're all done  Net, while the anecdotal reports and certainly the data continue to be positive in a modest sense, I continue to think the risks are very much on the down side They are perhaps not as great as they were a few months ago but, still, I think that's where the risk is Therefore, in terms of policy response, I think we should be geared to deal with any signs of weakening should they appear Thank you  Mr Chairman, while we are moving through this transition pretty well and the tone and numbers are a little better this time than they were the last time, nonetheless, as I said earlier, I think the risks continue to be on the down side I also think the inflationary outlook is better than [unintelligible] To me it would be very premature to make a shift from asymmetric to symmetric language and, therefore, I'd be in favor of alternative B asymmetric toward ease "
4482,1992-05-19," Thank you, Mr Chairman In terms of the national economy, our forecast for growth this year is very consistent with the staff forecast We get there in slightly different ways Our consumption numbers are a bit lower I think the differences in durables probably relate to the fact that our housing numbers are a little lower than those in the staff forecast but, offsetting that, our export numbers are a bit stronger There is a difference, though, in the outlook for inflation Our numbers are more constructive than the staff forecast We expect in terms of the CPI that we would be getting down to the 3 percent area by the end of this year and then perhaps see continued improvement next year  With regard to the District, there seems to be slow but steady improvement in the major segments of our economy But I must say the magnitude of the improvement between this meeting and the last  -17-    5/19/92  meeting is not quite as great as was the case at the time of the last meeting In that prior period there had been pretty good improvement In fact, in some cases there are signs of moderation appearing As an example of this, our housing activity is down a bit but from very high levels Seasonal factors had a big effect on January and February housing activity Also, that was a period in which mortgage rates had come down quite substantially and that gave housing in the Midwest a push; but we're now seeing some softness in housing Retail activity also has slowed a bit; it is still positive compared to last year but the momentum has slowed, again from a very rapid pace in both January and February  On the other hand, the manufacturing sector continues to show slow but steady improvement Second-quarter production in the auto industry is continuing to run well ahead of last year, but of course the second quarter last year was comparatively weak Third-quarter schedules have been set a little higher than the third quarter of last year, but the magnitude is not as great as the pace of the second quarter Current dealer attitudes are good, I'm told Their order rate from manufacturers is very much in line with the production schedules But I will say the dealer order rate is a bit ahead of the retail sales level Still, the inventories out there don't seem to be out of line, particularly for this time of the year I must say that in this overall category I have heard from just everybody that the demand for light trucks is very, very strong The industry sales forecasts are a little stronger than ours They are expecting a very good third quarter and an even better fourth quarter So, there is more to come on that The heavy truck business continues to be better than last year The current order rate is running about 10 percent ahead of last year, but of course that's an increase from a very low level And heavy truck manufacturers are operating at about 70 percent of capacity They are forecasting an improved sales level this year of only about 119,000 units and that's versus a good year of, say, 165,000 to 175,000 units The steel business also is doing a little better; orders, particularly for sheet, are coming in at good levels That I think is reflective of the auto production schedules and also a bit of strength on the appliance side The steel industry is operating at about 83 percent of capacity They're going to ship 40 million tons in the first half and are forecasting 42 million tons for the second half, so it ought to be a good year in terms of the [tonnage] being shipped But the pricing is just terrible I find this somewhat of a contradiction They're shipping a lot of metal but they're just not making any money  With regard to the real estate question that you asked about, the firm I talked with feels that we may be getting to the point of stability but we still aren't there yet They are seeing some increased interest on the part of funds to buy real estate There's a greater level of interest but not a significant volume [of sales] is taking place They think we're going to have a continuation of price declines this year, perhaps as much as 10 percent for the year as a whole That's lower than in previous years, which again is indicative that we're getting to a point of stability The vacancy rates in Chicago are going to go up We have two or three big projects that are still finishing up, so our already fairly high vacancy rates are going to go up This firm does not anticipate a return to normal vacancy levels until 1995 or 1996  -18-    5/19/92  In the agricultural sector, we've had a very unusual planting season It has been cold and wet in most of our area But in one week, the week of May 10th, some 50 percent of the corn acreage was planted, which was pretty phenomenal However, given the carryover stocks, which were fairly low, and the significant uncertainty with regard to weather, our expectation is that it's going to be a year in which prices are going to be very, very weather-related, but at least we're off to a pretty good start I might say that the ag equipment business is sour Contrary to earlier expectations, retail sales of major agricultural implements have slowed significantly It's down about 13 percent currently from last year As a consequence the production schedules, which had been set at a pretty conservative level, now are being reduced  With regard to inflation, I do think that the outlook is increasingly constructive Price increases are just not sticking In the manufacturing sector, I continue to be impressed by the major manufacturers who are continuing to get decreases in their prices for purchased products or, if there are increases, they are pretty modest The same also is true in the retail sector People who supply the major retail stores know that they just can't get price increases through The consumers in turn are very tough So, I must say general attitudes in the District are that rising prices are just not a major danger Labor contracts continue to be negotiated under favorable terms Three-year contracts are the norm The occasional six-year contract in the paper industry and the wage increases under these contracts are easily managed through productivity improvements After months of bitterness that I have commented on from time-to-time here, the Caterpillar strike just went ""poof"" When the company threatened and then began to bring in replacement workers, the union attitude just collapsed They have not, of course, settled the contract yet, but they're back at work This won't necessarily set a pattern for the UAW negotiations with the auto companies this fall, but certainly it's going to have an effect on the tone as they go into those discussions  Net, while I think the economy is continuing to show signs of slow but steady improvement, without more strength in some of the major segments the question [of sustainability] has to be a significant one Therefore, as we see it, the risks in terms of growth continue to be on the down side And with the improved outlook with regard to inflation, it seems to us that our policy response should be geared to dealing with signs of deterioration in growth should they begin to emerge Thank you  Don, in your comments about the structure of interest rates and the yield curve, I don't think I heard you say anything about the supply factor and the impact that has on rates Is that in your mind not an issue?  Mr Chairman, I was right with you absolutely all the way as you went through your analysis right up until the end I must say that although the general tone of the comments seems more positive now than it was the last time, I do think there are some unusual factors here And I continue to think that the risks on economic growth are on the down side You said, and I certainly agree, that in the near term we are more likely to ease than we are to tighten Therefore, it seems to me that the directive ought to  -43-    5/19/92  reflect those possibilities As a consequence, I'd be in favor of ""B,"" but I'd continue with asymmetric language "
4507,1992-06-30," Thank you, Mr Chairman Starting first with a comment on the staff forecast Our forecast is very similar to the staff's in terms of the numbers; the pattern, though, is somewhat different Our GDP forecast for '93 is lower than the staff's and in fact is lower than our forecast for this year The differences seem to be in the auto and housing sectors Our forecast for sales of cars and light trucks in the second half of next year is lower than the staff forecast by about 500,000 units at an annual rate Our outlook for long-term interest rates also is not quite as optimistic as the staff's and, as a result of that, our housing starts for next year  -12-    6/30-7/1/92  also are lower than theirs These two differences, of course, lead to secondary differences at least in terms of growth Our inflation forecast is very similar to the staff's; we're a little lower this year and about the same for next year While the differences between the forecasts aren't that great, assuming that this year and next year work out about in line with either of these forecasts, in my view the bigger question is whether there is enough momentum in the underlying economy to be sustainable After three years of comparatively weak growth, the likelihood of a fourth year of weak growth this year and perhaps a repeat next year for a fifth year of the same, [the question is] Is this the best we can do and will this growth be strong enough to improve significantly the employment problem as well as the utilization of our industrial capacity? I have growing feelings that it will not--that this is not a satisfactory forecast--and that in our policy discussion we will need to take steps to try to develop some stronger growth  In terms of the region, while many of the major sectors of the District's economy have shown some improvement, here again the durability as well as the strength are open to question The major area of improvement has been in the auto manufacturing sector The second-quarter production schedules were somewhat over those of last year Third-quarter schedules have been set preliminarily at levels about 17 percent higher than last year But those schedules are based on the expectation that retail sales will increase from current levels; and if they don't, then we would expect the production schedules to be reduced In turn, the suppliers to the auto industry have seen some pickup in orders In the steel business, for example, they expect to ship some 21 million tons in the third quarter, up from 20 million tons in the second quarter For the full year they are forecasting shipments of 82 million tons; that's not a bad year And the improvement in the steel business is not just on the auto side; for example, shipments to appliance manufacturers are also a bit higher  Other parts of the District have been a bit mixed Housing activity was higher in May than in April, though April was quite weak, and transaction volume has been pretty good However, retail sales, which increased in May, seem to be down in June; at least the reports are that sales were a little on the soft side Weather may have been a factor; it has been exceptionally cold in our part of the Midwest and people just are not buying the things that they normally do at this time of the year  In the agricultural sector, we may be in for a difficult summer We had an exceptionally wet spring, which resulted in a difficult planting season That was followed by an exceptionally dry spell and has affected much of the corn and soybean crops of the District And most recently we had frost conditions in Michigan and Wisconsin, which have had an effect on the fruit crop Despite that, it's still early enough that if we get a reasonable break on the weather from this point on we should get pretty good crop yields But given this uncertainty in the farm area, sales of agricultural equipment have been very weak--surprisingly weak--and indeed were described as terrible by one CEO As an example, combine sales in May were some 80 percent under the volume sold last May Therefore, production schedules, which had already been reduced, are now in the process of being cut further  -13-    6/30-7/1/92  On the employment front, District employment has increased by about 100,000 since the low point in August of 1991, but despite that increase we still have recovered only about 25 percent of the losses that we sustained during the recession Many manufacturers are continuing to implement staff reduction plans, and I just don't sense any fundamental improvement in the underlying employment conditions Inflation continues to look constructive Intensive competitive conditions seem to be an absolute lid on significant price increases The people I talk to say the pricing environment for all products is really very tough One major manufacturer, admittedly [with] an enormous amount of clout, is achieving a reduction of almost 1 percent in the cost of outside purchases this year And I must say that in talking to people I just don't have any sense that inflation is a part of their current thinking Net, while I think the District has shown improvement since the last meeting, the strength of the underlying momentum and the vulnerability of this level of activity are the major questions Thank you  Mr Chairman, I completely agree with your proposal and support it for the reasons that you stated The only thing I would add is that by lowering the ranges it's just possible that we might send some signal to the people who are viewing our outlook and expectations for the economy in terms of the [monetary] growth rate I just don't think that's the signal we want to send  Mr Chairman, given my comments yesterday, I'd favor alternative A and an easing move now, but I could accept alternative B with asymmetric language Without necessarily meaning to put you on the spot, what kind of timing [are you contemplating] and what kinds of things might prompt the calling of a telephone conference?  You mean autos, employment, a series of things like that?  Just the same, my view is that we have reached a point where some additional easing would be called for now; therefore, I would have a preference for ""A"" But the way that you phrased ""B"" with asymmetric language [toward ease] would be acceptable "
4532,1992-07-02, This is Si Keehn in Chicago I think you could tell from my comments yesterday as well as the action of our directors last week that we completely endorse the action you've taken 
4542,1992-08-18," Mr Chairman, in terms of economic activity in the District, really there has been very little change since the last meeting Some sectors are doing a little better but others not quite so well  Much of the District's focus continues to be on the auto sector which has declined just a bit since the last meeting The third-quarter production schedules, which earlier seemed pretty strong, have been reduced quite substantially, principally due to GM's cutback Whereas originally the third-quarter schedules were set at about 18 percent over the third-quarter 1991 levels, they now have been reduced to about 11 percent [over the year-earlier level] We would expect the effect of the auto sector, which earlier might have had an effect on third-quarter GDP of about 1 percent, to be reduced to about 1/2 percent The fourth-quarter production schedules haven't been announced for all the manufacturers, but one I talked to has reduced its sales forecast for the fourth quarter from 14 million at an annual rate to 13-1/2 million They feel in their case that the production risk is definitely on the down side  -17-    8/18/92  Retail sales in the area continue to be very tough; merchandise will move but only at discounted prices And the pricing techniques have become very, very aggressive At least one retailer that I talked to had a pretty good early part of July; at the end of the month things turned sour and the lower sales levels have continued into August Offsetting this, though, the steel business continues to be pretty good The industry is operating at a rate of about 82 percent One large Midwestern manufacturer is higher than that, at about 85 percent, and they now expect shipments for the year to come in at about 82 million tons, which in a comparative sense is not that bad a year Part of the strength is based on lower imports The industry, as you know, is involved in an effort to deal with tariffs, and that is having an effect; but also the export business has been pretty good The heavy truck business also is showing some favorable signs The order flow for Class A units has improved and customers for these units are feeling pretty good about their business The industry expects to ship about 120,000 to 125,000 Class A units this year; that's up from 100,000 last year Indeed, the current order rate is a little higher than that, and they expect the order rate to come out at the end of the year at about 140,000 units  The residential housing business is also quite strong New single-family home sales in the Midwest have been stronger than the national average Housing starts on a seasonally adjusted basis, though down in the second quarter from an unusually strong first quarter, are still above levels for 1991 And given the reduction in mortgage rates, I think the attitudes about residential housing are pretty good  In the agricultural sector, we've had a very significant change from the last meeting We had plenty of rain in July and early August and at this point the crop outlook is really excellent Crop prices reflect that; they're down quite significantly And that negative effect on farm income is showing up in the sales of agricultural equipment That industry is really having a very tough year For example, year-to-date sales of 4-wheel drive tractors are down 37 percent; sales of large tractors are down 32 percent; and sales of combines are down about 36 percent So, production schedules, which had already been reduced, are being reduced further One large manufacturer expects that their fourth-quarter production schedules will be about 20 percent lower than last year  On the inflation side, the news continues to improve Upward price pressures just aren't part of anyone's thinking Large manufacturers are putting tremendous pressure on their suppliers In many cases, they are holding [down] price increases on their purchases to very low levels and in a couple of cases they actually are getting reductions The pattern of prices on purchases over the last two or three years really has been very, very favorable  While in an economic sense, in terms of the indicators, the news in the Midwest and indeed nationally is a bit mixed, I must say that I think there has been a deterioration in mental attitudes Many of the people I talk to seem awfully grim The uncertainty and the negative outlook are beginning to creep into business thinking and, therefore, I think the risks here are a bit on the down side Using the analogy of the slow takeoff--and I think we've been experiencing this slow takeoff for an awfully long time--my worry is that we're  -18-    8/18/92  reaching the end of the runway And in a policy sense, I think we better push forward on the throttle until we're sure we are clear off the ground  Mr Chairman, I agree with Bob Forrestal I would prefer to ease now in the direction of ""A"" but certainly find ""B"" with asymmetric language acceptable "
4568,1992-10-06," Mr Chairman, conditions in the District have not changed that much since the last meeting While the trends are somewhat mixed, I think on balance the overall rate of economic activity has moderated; and certainly attitudes have deteriorated further The auto industry and all auto-related activities are  -22-    10/6/92  weaker Third-quarter sales were lower than the industry's earlier expectations and the sales forecasts for the fourth quarter have already been reduced and, I think, still may be on the high side As a result, fourth-quarter production plans are steadily being reduced At one point, the fourth-quarter schedules were significantly higher than last year--though last year was a weak comparative period--but by now they have been scaled back and are only about 4 percent over last year's level Again, I think the production risk is on the down side  Farm equipment sales and manufacturing continue to deteriorate The sales of major [farm equipment] units for the year through August are off 18 percent from last year and off 24 percent from two years ago One major manufacturer has reduced its fourth- quarter production schedule again and is now planning fourth-quarter production that is 21 percent below last year Other parts of the manufacturing sector in the District, however, continue to expand but, again, the growth rate has moderated Orders for Class 8 trucks, the big trucks, are running some 25 percent over 1991 But in the last 30 days there has been a perceptible change in the attitude of major truck customers, and the manufacturers are now concerned that this [orders trend] might turn around quite quickly Therefore, their confidence regarding the rest of this year, but more importantly for 1993, is not very strong Medium truck sales, Class 6 and Class 7, are about level with 1991 and no improvement is expected Offsetting this, though, housing activity in the District continues to show strength New single-family home sales in the Midwest rose 15 percent in July and continued to climb in August Home starts also were strong and that strength is carrying through to the manufacturers of building materials In the retail area, sales continue to run about 6 to 8 percent ahead of last year Customers, however, as I've commented before, are very, very price conscious And retailers who import a good deal of their merchandise are continuing to have to raise prices to reflect the plunge in the dollar Finally, in the agricultural sector, I think crop production is going to bring very good news We're clearly going to have good crops--indeed, perhaps bumper crops--in both corn and soybeans Prices are way down, but we're going to have very good production  In the inflation area--price pressures--the news continues to improve Intense competitive conditions are continuing to restrain price increases and many manufacturers are holding the increased cost of their purchases to very, very minimum levels In the case of a couple of large manufacturers, they have actually been able to accomplish reductions in their purchase prices on a year-over-year basis But at this point inflation is just not an issue, certainly among the people I talk with, and they are growingly disturbed that they just can't get price increases to stick in the marketplace In turn, they have worked [to hold down] their purchase prices, as I suggested In the labor area, contracts continue to be settled on what I think are very favorable terms  In a national context, I find the overall economic outlook increasingly worrisome [The economy has remained] a long time in this very steady state--I think perhaps too long--and there is a real risk at this point that [the expansion] will lose momentum We continue to reduce our growth forecast and are now down to a point that the sustainability of even the current very moderate rate has to be open to question In this environment, despite the policy easing  -23-    10/6/92  moves that we have made, the risk of the economy taking off at such a rapid rate as to cause strong inflationary pressures seems pretty close to zero But I think the risk that the economy could fall back into negative growth is very real and is increasing with the passage of time Therefore, in a monetary policy context, I think we ought to move again as early as we have the opportunity to do so  Mr Chairman, my view on today's decision really is completely separate from either exchange market or other market expectations or political issues It does seem to me that these are matters that we can reasonably deal with, given any decision that we come to today Rather, my decision would be based on the economic situation, which I think clearly has weakened and quite considerably so At this point the risk that the economy could fall back into a negative situation is not insignificant; I think the balance here is very delicate It seems to me that we already have the data that we need to make a decision It's very much there on the record Therefore, as I indicated in my comments earlier, I could live with ""B"" asymmetric, but I frankly would have a far stronger preference to move now and to use this meeting as a reason for making that decision "
4595,1992-11-17," Mr Chairman, on balance conditions in the District have a somewhat better tone than was the case at the time of the last meeting It is a little hard to back that up with statistical data In fact, some of the data have gone the other way; for example, the Chicago purchasing managers survey for October went below 50 percent Still, the steel business continues to be pretty good The industry is currently operating at about an 80 percent rate, and that's a rate that will maintain inventories at a fairly stable level Shipments this year are probably going to come in at about 82 million tons, which is a pretty good year, though I must say that pricing continues to be very tough For 1993 the industry expects an increase in shipments to about 85 million tons There is a wild card with regard to next year and that relates to the outcome of trade suits that have been filed The early outlook on these suits is favorable and, if they prevail, that should be helpful both to volume and also to prices  Aided by strong light truck and van sales, the motor vehicle sales levels have improved Sales this year will probably come in at about 13 million units and the industry is expecting an increase to about 13-1/2 million units next year Based on these higher expectations, one manufacturer has set first-quarter production schedules 15 percent over the first quarter of last year I was talking to representatives of one major automotive manufacturer last week and was trying to convince them that at 13 million units this has been a pretty good year; they didn't buy it a bit They reminded me that the industry's base year, in their view at least, is 15-1/2 million units; and with operating results running very firmly in the red it's very difficult for them to view this as a good year The heavy truck business also is better Sales of the Class 8 units this year are about 25 percent over last year and the industry expects continued improvement next year--perhaps another 20 percent increase But I must say that even at these higher levels sales are well under the very much higher levels that existed in the mid-1980s  Retail sales in the District are showing some improvement I think consumer confidence is back a bit and the early outlook for Christmas is a little more positive than previously expected But the consumer continues to be very price conscious and it does take price discounts to produce sales In line with that comment, the price and inflation news in the District continues to be very positive Price pressures really just aren't there  Offsetting the good news, the agricultural equipment business is just terrible, with no signs of improvement One major manufacturer just finished its fiscal year and large tractor sales in that fiscal year were down by some 40 percent from the year before They are continuing to reduce production schedules and to lay off    11/17/92  employees Also disturbing is the continuing drumbeat of layoff notices in the District Just in the last few weeks we've had another 8 or 10 companies announce layoffs Some of them are small--180 to 200 employees--but others are much larger And this constant announcement of layoffs does cast something of a pall over the employment outlook  We had something of a milestone in Chicago last week There was a large reception commemorating the completion of the last major office building in downtown Chicago No one has projects underway and we now have a vacancy rate in the downtown area of about 23 percent At current absorption levels, it is going to take about 10 years to work through that inventory and there is a gloomy prediction out there that we won't see another big project until the next century  In a national context, while the outlook may be showing at least some signs of improvement, the improvement seems to be very modest I continue to think that we have a very fragile situation on our hands and that the risks continue to be on the down side If the staff forecast is right--and ours is quite close to it so I don't think it's worth spending time discussing the differences--the issue really is whether this is an outlook that will be acceptable and whether it will produce the kinds of employment gains necessary to sustain the recovery over a reasonable period of time That to me is the issue that in a monetary policy context would be the important question Thank you  Jerry, on the first question, there are frankly questions of viability about GM; that has been true not just recently but going back a few months I talked to  just felt that the troubles were much bigger than were fully understood by the market, and this goes back three or four months So, everything that has come out tends to confirm what he was saying The most recent numbers [coming out] in the last few days are really very much on the serious side So, that is certainly an open question In terms of your second question, if in fact this does evolve in a way that suggests there are questions as to GM's viability, it's only a matter of time until the market will pick that up and make the rollover of paper a very difficult issue So, this is a very significant concern in more than just a District context  I don't know if it is that large; it is huge  Mr Chairman, with regard to the long-term ranges I would prefer not to take any action at this time My impression was that our discussion basically related to your commitment to Congress to study this and report back, and it does seem to me that the paper and the discussion deal with that commitment The paper does add a lot of knowledge to this question It seems to me that there is enough uncertainty remaining that to make a change implies some degree of precision that I just don't have the confidence is really there Therefore, I wouldn't to make a change, particularly at this time when there is a signal effect that I find a bit awkward As a technical point, I assume if we were to make a change in the ranges as provisionally set, that we are not talking about making final changes to the ranges for next year  So, if we make a change now, it is a provisional range and we will leave it as a subject for next February and we would so state that?  Separately and apart from that, I'd prefer not to make a change With regard to the short-term policy, I must say that at the time of the last meeting I would have favored a change I was disappointed that it did not evolve Therefore, I came to this meeting in favor of either alternative A or alternative B with hard asymmetric language I must say I'm very surprised by the change in the tone of the reports It's the most significant shift between two meetings that I can remember While the data are a bit more positive, I have a feeling that the [anecdotal] reports are a little ahead of that It may be that good news is slow to reach our part of the Midwest Nevertheless, at this point I'd be in favor of alternative B with at least some bias or asymmetry toward ease  Bob Forrestal already made the point that I was going to make I certainly agree with those who have said that any further specific detail or attribution of individual comments would be very destructive of the [deliberative] process But this is a question, frankly, that I don't think Mr Gonzalez wrote; some curious staffer way down the line wrote it And for us to respond by making a change at this point would be a very big mistake I think we ought to go back and say that we thought about it carefully and that the process we're currently using seems appropriate to us We're always open to thinking about it further, but we don't see any reason to make a change at this time I think they're just fishing and if we give them something now, that's just going to encourage them to try to get more "
4630,1992-12-22," Mr Chairman, in terms of the District, the level of economic activity continues to increase Coming into the last meeting, conditions were starting to show signs of improvement and, if anything, the rate of improvement has accelerated a bit as we came into this meeting And I do think this improvement is fairly broad- based Auto sales have been a little better The first-quarter production schedules have been set about 15 percent over last year, so that's a good increase The auto manufacturers are anticipating an improvement in the sales level next year that is still below what they describe as the baseline but it is higher than this year The heavy truck business has been particularly strong Sales of Class 8 units are up 15 percent this year and are forecast to be up another 16 percent next year The backlog now is some 12 to 16 weeks for these units; it's pretty broad-based and is viewed as quite strong Steel production continues at a good level, operating at about 80 percent [of capacity] Steel producers also are reasonably optimistic about next year And certainly the international trade cases that are currently going on ought to be beneficial to the industry Between the subsidy constraints and the dumping constraints--and I think the latter will be announced later in January--they are expecting that imports next year will be reduced by 4 to 5 million tons That should also have the effect of improving the operating levels of the industry by some 5 percent, and they would expect that to occur by the end of the first quarter This ought to provide a better environment for pricing, which continues to be very, very rugged  Retail sales in the District continue at a good pace, but I must say some of the strength that we saw early in the Christmas season has eased a bit in the last few days This is a very tough period to judge because the selling season is longer, but I must say    12/22/92  many of the people that I've talked to who earlier were expecting, say, an 8 percent increase this Christmas season now are talking more in the area of 4 to 5 percent We have particularly strong [sales] in communications equipment Orders for communications equipment bottomed out in mid-1991 and have been increasing rapidly at annual rates of 20 to 25 percent The expectation for next year is that growth will be a little lower but still some 15 to 16 percent ahead of 1992 Even in the agricultural equipment business, there is a little better tone, or at least it's not worse One major manufacturer is expecting a 5 percent increase in unit sales next year, but that is after a 12 percent decline in '92 and a 9 percent decline in '91 So, it's an improvement from a pretty low level I will say, though, that inherent to the better outlook for '93 is the expectation that an ITC tax will be enacted, which will be beneficial to agricultural equipment  The inflation news continues to be very good To hold down their cost of purchases, large companies are exerting tremendous pressure on their suppliers with very good results More than a few, in fact, have achieved reductions in the average cost of their purchases this year and they are expecting equally good results next year Competitive conditions in the marketplace make it awfully tough to increase prices Labor contracts continue to be negotiated on favorable terms, and certainly this continuing drumbeat of layoffs and plant closings has an effect on labor expectations The fact that of GM's 28 planned plant closings 12 so far have been in Michigan certainly is unsettling to employment conditions in that state  Turning to the national economy, while I do think the outlook has improved--certainly we have no reason to question the staff's forecast--I must say that I continue to have at least lingering questions as to the underlying strength and sustainability of the recovery The employment numbers that will be coming out over the next few months I think will give us pretty good indications as to how things will work out next year  Mr Chairman, I'd be in favor of ""B"" symmetric It does seem to me that there has been a shift both in fundamentals and attitudes But I have a lingering question about the sustainability of that shift, so I think ""B"" symmetric is appropriate at this point "
4653,1993-01-06," Mr Chairman, this is Si Keehn The transmission is a bit rugged so I may have missed something There are those of us who are just opposed to taking verbatim minutes; if so, I assume that ought to be our position  This is Si Keehn The telephone hookup is bad, and I missed part of what you said earlier But if there are some who are just opposed to taking verbatim minutes and prefer to say so, I assume that's a reasonable position to take "
4672,1993-02-02," I can comment on that, Wayne The people I talk with say that the dumping suits ought to result in about a 4 million ton change in shipments this year The production level in the steel industry currently is about 80 percent of capacity Based on this one change it could go up to, say, 85 percent And shipments this year as a result could go up to 88 to 89 million tons In terms of price, there is a proposed price increase for cold roll, hot roll, and coated products [scheduled] for early April, and they expect that increase to stick This affects about 50 percent of overall steel production and, therefore, the anticipated overall increase in the price of steel is 2 percent for this year  Yes, as a consequence of this change and the change that took place late last year, imports will be down by 4 million [unintelligible] 5 to 6 million tons  With regard to the national outlook, our forecast has somewhat lower growth than the Greenbook We don't have any major differences, but our numbers are a little lower across the spectrum of components For example, our number for personal consumption, is lower We also have lower business fixed investment, exports, and housing starts There are more differences in consumer nondurables and services than in durables  In terms of the District, I think there has been a decided improvement in attitudes about the underlying rate of expansion since the last meeting The positive retail outlook coming out of what was a strong Christmas held up surprisingly well in January The Christmas season seemed very strong, particularly in places like Michigan where the Retailers Association reported that over 70 percent of their members experienced sales increases and that attitudes were ""generally euphoric"" An appliance manufacturer located in Michigan reported a fantastic fourth quarter, the best since 1978 They expect a good sales increase this year--not as strong as last year, but still a good increase In the auto industry, while the most recent sales data have been a little on the soft side, first-quarter production schedules have been set about 20 percent over last year And with inventories currently at what seem like quite reasonable levels, the first-quarter production risk doesn't seem that high I will say, though, that the industry is forecasting--or at least those we talk to--a somewhat higher sales number for the year than we are The heavy truck business continues to be strong The industry's incoming order rate is running at an annual level of 165,000 to 175,000 units That's higher than current production rates, so the order backlog is beginning to lengthen to a delivery [schedule] that the industry is not comfortable with And if this order rate is sustained, they are likely to add to their production levels  Attitudes in the steel business understandably have improved considerably since the dumping suits were announced I've already commented on the price impact that that is likely to have, but they do think that the announced price increases on the products that I mentioned are likely to stick this time I would point out, however, that the price increases that will result from that are from very, very low levels Their pricing has been awfully soft for an extended  -12-    2/2-3/93  period With regard to inflation, the pricing environment continues to be favorable Very heavy market pressures are holding down price increases But I will say that this time at least one or two companies did comment about some modest increases in their expectations regarding the cost of their raw materials purchases The steel price increase is certainly a part of this, but there are some other parts as well These are not significant shifts in terms of the amount; nonetheless, it's the first time I've heard this in quite a while Offsetting what I think are pretty good economic reports, almost every company executive that I talk to expects to continue to reduce their employment Everybody says that they are simply going to produce more this year with fewer people; this has come to be the macho thing to do And, therefore, while the immediate outlook has improved, the question of sustainability continues to be the key issue Either employment and disposable income are going to increase to support this higher level of consumption or we're going to see consumption come down a bit So, while the outlook seems much more balanced than it has been, I do think the risks, given this disposable income issue, continue to be a little on the down side Thank you  Mr Chairman, as you went through your opening comments I completely agreed with what you said and how you said it but, honestly, I thought you were coming to a different conclusion I thought you made a very good case for leaving the ranges where they were and not making a change In a perfect world, frankly, that's what I'd prefer But I do understand that we aren't in a perfect    2/2-3/93  world and that there are some political perceptions out there that we need to deal with But there seem to have been enough changes since the correspondence we received indicating that we might reduce our ranges--and certainly the incoming data for this year suggest that the numbers are moving even further away from our expectations--that one could make a case that developments have taken place that make a change not seem appropriate The uncertainties are very, very significant and, therefore, I would leave the ranges where they are I'd prefer to keep them where we tentatively set them last July, but I certainly don't feel strongly enough about it to dissent Therefore, I would support the case that you made because you seem to feel more comfortable in a political context with what you've said, and I'd support that  ""B"" symmetric  Could I just ask relative to the testimony the presidents will be giving on the 10th of March If we are asked specifically how we voted on the long-term ranges, given the visibility this issue has gotten, how do you want us to respond? I guess an issue is whether you are going to cover in your testimony anyway how we decided on that  Yes  I know, but are you going to say how the vote went? What if I'm asked in the testimony ""How did you vote on the ranges?""  At that point the minutes will not have been released  If you cover that, I think that will be a useful way of setting the stage for defense  No  Well, if you don't say it, it's likely to come up when we're asked and--  If that's all right, I think that's fine I just want to be sure that's okay  That's my view "
4693,1993-02-18," Alan, this is Si Keehn First of all, I think the statement is very well drawn I must say, listening to it, it sounds like a very good [statement] on these issues But let me come back to a point that Ed Boehne raised--this is a question I'm sure you're going to be asked--on this balance between expenditures and revenues I do understand the arithmetic that you tried to point out, but I  -10-    2/18/93  wonder if you can try to emphasize the expenditure side just a little more, particularly the timing, so that we don't get out so far that we lose this Losing on the expenditure side would raise the dangers that the credibility of the package will dissipate and that will have an adverse market reaction  Yes, that's a good suggestion  That really is the point I was trying to make--to emphasize the danger of losing ground on the expenditure side "
4713,1993-03-23," I think this is a constructive move I can't see any down side The up side does not seem to be considerable because I don't think it will diffuse the critics I'd prefer to do it without the executive summary I understand what Susan and Mike are saying, but I can't think of a time--again to use the private sector context-- when I've seen private sector minutes with an executive summary And I think the more we make it consistent with such minutes, the better off we are So, I'd do it without the summary  Mr Chairman, in the District the level of economic activity has shown clear signs of improvement since the last meeting At the February meeting we talked a bit about the impact of trade restraints on the steel business And in terms of pricing and production levels, I think that along with the basic increase in domestic demand is having an effect, as Mike has suggested Bookings during the last two months have been running at an annual rate of 110 million tons; that's clearly an unsustainably high level Delivery lead times are lengthening to the third quarter for at least one manufacturer, and one large steel purchaser has been put on allocation by two of its main suppliers The mills are currently operating at a stated rate of capacity of 83 to 85 percent, but there is a view in the industry that the [stated] capacity is too high, and at least in our District we think the mills are really operating at a level of about 90 percent of capacity Steel prices were raised, as you know, by $20 a ton in January; another $20 a ton increase will go in effect in April, and they have announced another $20 a ton increase to be effective in early July If all of these stick, it would raise the price about 10 percent from the low point in this most recent cycle But in a longer-term perspective the industry will only have regained  -14-    3/23/93  about one-half of the decline from the last peak in prices, which occurred in '88 and '89 And that 1988-89 level was still well under the levels that prevailed in '78 and '79 in nominal terms but, of course, further under in real terms  In other District activities, the second-quarter domestic production schedules in the auto industry have been set at about 12 percent over the second quarter of last year That production level is somewhat higher than the current dealer order rate Therefore, if the retail sales don't pick up fairly soon, there is some downward risk in the second-quarter production schedules The manufacturers I talk with have reduced their '93 sales outlook Their forecasts are down just a little to 14 million units But even that level implies very strong third and fourth quarters The truck business is also improving I've commented in the past on the heavy truck business, the class 8 units, and at this point both the order and production levels for those trucks are expected to be about 17 percent over last year But this time there's also what I think is a fairly significant change in the medium truck category, the class 6 and 7 units The current forecast suggests that these medium truck sales, which are regarded as being quite sensitive to economic changes, will be about 13 percent higher this year Agricultural equipment is doing better Sales there are improving at the retail level, and production schedules have been increased by 5 percent for one manufacturer There is a somewhat larger increase in terms of production for industrial equipment  The only sour note I heard, and it really wasn't all that sour, related to retail sales The District's sales held up quite well coming into the new year, but we hit something of an air pocket in February It's unclear whether that reflects uncertainty following the President's State of the Union message or is attributable to bad weather I must say that I think it's probably more the latter than the former  With regard to employment, we have some mixed developments Most of the people I talk with, particularly those in heavy industry, continue to say that despite the higher levels of production they are simply going to produce more with fewer people and that the staff reduction programs that they have in place will continue Yet we do think that the underlying employment data may suggest a somewhat brighter picture We've been doing considerable work on some of the statistics related to our District employment levels and we think they may be re-benchmarked and that the net effect a re-benchmarking of the state data will raise the employment level as of the end of last year by some 128,000 jobs And if that develops, it could well be that we've had a greater growth of employment in the District than we had thought If this is false, though, it may be that this higher level of employment will be consistent with the improvement that we're seeing in terms of economic activity  With regard to the national economy, when we did our forecast for the February meeting we were somewhat under the central tendency of the FOMC members Given developments since then, if we were redoing our forecast, I think we'd raise it a bit and we'd be very much in line now with the staff forecast And despite the recent PPI and CPI reports, which we don't think represent a fundamental change in the inflationary picture, our outlook for inflation has not  -15-    3/23/93  changed; we'd leave our fourth-quarter forecast at 28 percent Thank you  Mr Chairman, I would strongly support alternative B with symmetric language and the current language indicating specific growth expectations with regard to M2 and M3 We have been in an easing mode for quite some while now and a change in policy is going to be a very, very major change Somehow the asymmetric language does imply a somewhat automatic shift Well, perhaps not, but there is an implication of a somewhat automatic  -41-    3/23/93  shift If we do make a change, and it's entirely possible that we might, I would far prefer to do that from a consensus in the group, perhaps in a telephone call between now and the next meeting But for now I think maintaining our current stance is absolutely appropriate "
4737,1993-05-18," Mr Chairman, economic conditions in the Chicago District have been somewhat uneven since the last meeting, but on balance I think there has been an increase in the level of activity In a modest context the outlook is reasonably positive Starting with the automotive sector Based on a pretty good April, the industry's confidence in their forecast for sales in the second quarter and the full year is somewhat stronger than it has been Despite press reports to the contrary, the inventory levels in their view are currently just about right and, therefore, second-quarter production schedules have been set about 10 percent over last year And they are pretty confident about those production schedules I must say the mood in Detroit is much more positive than it has been and that is radiating pretty much throughout the dealer organization The truck business also continues to improve Orders for the Class 8 units, the large units, were strong in the first quarter and that has continued into the second quarter For the full year the industry is forecasting an increase in sales of the big trucks of from 17 to 18 percent Also, and something of a change, there has been a recent increase in the medium truck category, the Class 5 to 7 units, and for the full year they are now forecasting an increase in sales of some 13 percent for those Medium truck sales are viewed as something of a lagging indicator and, therefore, this turn, which generally occurs about 6 months after the change in the heavy truck category, is viewed as a good sign But despite the strength in the underlying auto sales rate, I must say that truck prices really have not been increased  The steel business continues to do well and is benefiting particularly from the improved level [of activity] in the auto industry The current order rate for one major company, which they expect [to continue] for the full second quarter, is coming in at about 110 percent of capacity This is down from the first quarter but still pretty strong Some of the order rate they [feel] is due to the current labor negotiations; nonetheless, the underlying demand is pretty good And based on this they are now forecasting shipments this year of some 87 million tons, which comparatively is an awfully good year We've talked about the steel price increases at previous meetings and again earlier today There is, as you know, another increase scheduled for July They would expect that to stick But I do think it's important to remember that these increases do not apply to the major purchasers who are buying the steel on contract Those prices are still very, very tight, and it's particularly true of the auto industry But for others who are not buying on contract, when we're all done here this increase is going to amount to about 12 percent  In the agricultural equipment business, sales of tractors and combines have been higher most recently and production schedules, therefore, have been increased The large manufacturer that I talked to expects their production for the full year to be about 9 percent higher than last year Also, there has been a recent increase in construction equipment; it has been slow to get off the mark but some  -19-    5/18/93  of those orders are beginning to pick up One very major manufacturer is now selling a number of its product lines on back order  Retail sales are uneven and this, I think, is heavily driven by the terrible weather that we had in March and April As for car [sales], retailers tell me that their sales this year are up about 5 to 6 percent from last year In the ag sector, as you know, we had a very wet spring and planting, therefore, has been terribly slow But conditions looked pretty good last week and they got a lot done; that is true I will say with the exception of Iowa, which is still very wet But they're still well behind and for the major states planting is at about 40 percent of the normal level Nonetheless, there's enough time left and most people expect that there is a good opportunity to get a good crop Perhaps one of the most significant changes, at least to me, has been a decided change in the attitude about lending by banks People tell me, both borrowers and banks alike, that banks have become more aggressive They are now actively seeking loans and are pretty much out looking for business; they have begun to shave rates, but I am assured that they have not begun to ease their credit standards  In a national context, while the improved level of activity may relieve some of the concerns I've had about the sustainability of this expansion, I still think the big imponderable is on the employment side Major companies--and I must say everyone I have talked to in the manufacturing sector--say they will continue to reduce their employment and will produce more products with fewer people At some point it does seem to me that the lines between overtime and an increase in demand will cross, but so far they just are not yielding And almost surprisingly, some of the unions don't want the companies to hire more people either But despite this improved tone both in the District as well as in the national economy, it does seem to me that at best we are talking about a pretty modest recovery If you look at the staff forecast, which is largely in line with ours, the outlook continues to be positive but in a very, very modest context  On the price front, in talking to people I just don't sense the upward pressures that the recent numbers might suggest Yes, there are some exceptions, such as steel, and for the reasons that we talked about; but there are some offsets Raw aluminum prices, for example, are at the lowest real level in history Labor contracts continue to be settled on favorable terms that are, I think, very much noninflationary For example, the steel contract is a long way from settlement, but so far the thrust of the discussions has been entirely in the work rule area and productivity Companies want to improve work rules to achieve more productivity and they are willing to give a little in terms of employment security On the economic side the discussions really are focused on pensions, not on wages Therefore, the steel industry hopes that they will come out of this [negotiation] without an inflationary settlement So, although the recent numbers are a little unnerving, I do think it's far too soon to conclude that we are experiencing a basic shift in the outlook for prices Thank you  Just to add to Ed's point If we think the inflation issue is expectations as opposed to real, it seems to me that an asymmetric directive, which no one will be aware of for another six to eight weeks, isn't going to do anything for us An asymmetric directive that won't be known for eight weeks isn't going to do anything with regard to the expectations issue If in fact the inflation increases are sustained, then it seems to me we ought to move in a way that will deal with those issues, and that ought to follow a phone call Therefore, I think the asymmetry confuses the issue and doesn't deal with it My thought is to leave the directive as is but be very specific that we will have a phone call  -43-    5/18/93  May I just ask a technical question in reference to Jerry's point? I haven't had the feeling that the difference between symmetry and asymmetry necessarily constrains your ability to make a move It seems to me that as the Chairman you ought to have the ability to make a move under [changing] circumstances as you see fit Asymmetry means to me that we would go into the intermeeting period [ahead] with a very strong bias toward making a change to tighten, and I don't think the lack of asymmetry necessarily ought to  -46-    5/18/93  inhibit your ability to tighten if in fact the numbers [develop] in a way that makes that seem the appropriate thing to do  Mr Chairman, my earlier comments were really observations and questions Just to be clear as to where I come out on policy at this point It seems to me, as we went around the table and talked about the economy, that the general thrust was that the economy is okay but there was a theme that some moderation has taken place in terms of growth since the last meeting I didn't hear anybody talk about a growth rate that to me would be high enough to sustain this inflationary trend that we're worried about It does seem to me that Ed Boehne makes a very compelling point on this In light of all that, I'd be for alternative B with symmetric language But I would be prompt to take an action by telephone if something in the future would warrant that  I think I hear that any change would be preceded by a phone call "
4760,1993-07-06," Mike, a question on capacity utilization, the lower chart on the lower panel on Chart 14 In the past it seems to me that when we got the capacity utilization to a sustained 85 percent we had price increases But with so many industries now becoming global, the question is whether this is really a meaningful indicator at this point Isn't it entirely possible that we will see domestic capacity moving up to the higher levels but at the same time we'll continue to see prices coming down?  Thank you  Mr Chairman, with regard to the national economy, our forecast really is quite close to the staff's forecast But it is interesting that when we first made a forecast for 1993 this time last year, we started off lower than the staff forecast We were at the time somewhat pessimistic but as we've gone through the year [unintelligible] and at this point the differences aren't that large Our outlook for inventory levels and residential construction is somewhat stronger than the staff numbers This is perhaps reflective of conditions in the District  In the District, the level of economic activity continues to expand but the pace of the increase is beginning to show signs of moderating The auto industry continues to be our bright light Retail sales are continuing at good levels and inventories are in good balance The third-quarter production schedules, which have been set about 18 percent over last year, seem reasonably firm at this point The heavy truck business continues to be solid; retail sales of heavy trucks are forecast at about 129,000 units this year; that's a good year for them But some of the strength is being driven by pending changes in regulations rather than normal market forces, and there are some preliminary indications that the heavy truck order rate is falling; indeed, there are a few signs of order cancellations  In the steel business, while the order and production rates continue at good levels, the significant development has been the preliminary settlement of the contract the USW has been negotiating with the first company It seems to be coming out on a non- inflationary basis The contract preliminarily agreed to calls for a $500 signing bonus, a $500 lump sum payment in the second year and a $50 per hour wage increase in the third year; there are no wage increases in the first and second years There's also a $1,000 lump sum payment in 1996 if the company earns over a specified level in 1995 Given the substantial changes in work rules and the substantial give-back on health care, the company feels that it can easily cover the higher cost through productivity increases That deal is far better than what they had hoped for at the outset of the negotiations  Retail sales in the District have been reasonable thus far, running about 3 to 4 percent over last year There is some strength in appliances and home improvement items In the agricultural sector, we have something [akin to the reverse] of what Jerry Jordan referred to His good news, of course, is our bad news I will say, though, that the ag equipment business has been very good up until now Therefore, based on these higher sales levels, at least one manufacturer has increased its production schedules for the second half of the year by some 13 percent But the miserable weather that we've been having and continue to have is a real downer The corn  -27-    7/6-7/93  crop planting is in one sense complete, but as of late last week it looked as if in Iowa alone some 6 percent of the corn crop would have to be replanted The soybean crop has been badly delayed and I think it's not going to get completed It's clear that we're going to have an acreage shortage in soybeans once things get straightened out It's going to take quite a while to assess just how much damage is going to result from all of this rain but, clearly, that has not been a plus for the District  On the inflation front, despite the discouraging numbers that we've talked about for the early part of the year, I really don't sense any significant upward pressures on prices on a broad basis Competitive conditions remain very, very intense in the market Certainly, this is true in the retail sector where it takes significant sales and discounts to move products One manufacturing company that I talked with follows the cost of their purchase materials very closely; it's a large manufacturer They had been forecasting a decrease of 1/2 percent in the cost of their purchase materials this year They re-forecasted just last week and they now expect the cost of their purchase materials to decline by 09 percent; they really have a very constructive look on the price of their purchases As for wage costs, with the steel contract seemingly settled on a non-inflationary basis, the bargaining focus will shift to the auto negotiations which just started It's far too early to tell just how that's going to work out, but that certainly will be a key item on the wage front Net, while the economy continues to expand, it just doesn't seem to have that much strength, and I think we could be facing a pretty mediocre outlook Thank you  There's no question about it People are very uncertain; the level of uncertainty caused by the discussions [in Washington] has led people to hold back  I don't think I could be specific about major projects on hold, but I know that capital purchases are clearly being affected by this  That's right Jerry Jordan is saying they've gone up in his District; they have not gone up to that extent in our District  -42-    7/6-7/93  It's highly liquid!  Would you be uncomfortable going into the testimony simply saying that we continue to move through this period of extreme uncertainty We will obviously continue to follow the aggregates very, very closely, but in an interim period to make a  -50-    7/6-7/93  change to reduce the ranges implies some level of certainty that we just simply don't have And then leave it as it is now I guess my questions are (a) Would you be uncomfortable in taking that kind of position; and (b) What are the risks?  Like others, I think, I certainly don't feel strongly about this either If I hear you correctly, you would be reasonably comfortable either way on this; you don't feel very strongly about it I must say I have a preference not to change the range either for this year or next year If we did reduce the range this year and made a technical adjustment, in the cool light of hindsight, frankly, it seems to me that will be viewed as a mistake I think we simply ought to leave the range where it is, make the case in the testimony that there's an awful lot of uncertainty, we're doing a lot of work, and we will report back to the Congress as we develop more information to shed some light on this issue  You get the political reaction by not making a change We'll be worse off than--  Thank you  While I might have had a slight preference for symmetry, I very much support your recommendation primarily for the reason Al Broaddus mentioned If there were another leak reflecting a change from asymmetry to symmetry this time, it would be very awkward in the marketplace And, therefore, I think what you recommend is appropriate  I think that's exactly right, but I just question whether we have the time to make it happen  Why would the statements be voluntary?  Well, I think you ought to find a way of getting [rid of] anybody not willing to give a statement  I think if the Chairman of the Board puts the freeze on anybody at this table, he's gone  If the Chairman puts the freeze on somebody, they are in effect gone  I understand that  Not to split a hair on that, but I thought at one point we had an opinion that this was confidential information and to release it was in fact breaking the law  And that's not a law?  -84-    7/6-7/93  Okay But if you violate a law, it seems to me that's a different set of circumstances "
4788,1993-08-17," Let me start off, Mr Chairman Other than the flood, which certainly has been a serious event for those who are directly involved, I would not have to comment on any significant changes in the District economy since the last meeting Broadly, things seem very much the same The auto business continues to be strong As we get closer to the end of 1993, the industry is raising its sales forecasts for the year Third-quarter production schedules are running about 20 percent over last year and the expectation is that the fourth-quarter schedules will be higher than last year but that the margin will be much smaller I will say, though, that there is something of a growing concern in Detroit that the auto business has run ahead of the national economy And unless the employment and disposable income gains catch up, the sales levels could be at some jeopardy Order flows for heavy trucks have slowed a bit but the industry doesn't, at least so far, view this as significant They are coming off a very strong period and I think the current softness may well be a reflection of the summer doldrums  In the steel business, the outcome of the trade cases, while certainly disappointing from their perspective, is anticipated to reduce annual domestic shipments by about 2 million tons Also, this is going to have a limiting effect on price increases They had announced an increase of 2-1/2 percent for October that is clearly not going to stick And they now think that the next increase will not be earlier than next January Despite this, though, the underlying business continues to be good and they are forecasting shipments this year at about 86 to 87 million tons Contrary to the national numbers, retail sales in the District in July were comparatively good  -6-    8/17/93  Some of the larger chains that had been having a difficult time experienced some pretty strong gains  In the ag sector it is still, of course, premature to judge the full economic impact of the flood But in a broader perspective, I don't think the effect will be nearly as large as one might guess by watching the television coverage on it Growing conditions in many areas that are not directly affected have really been very good And with higher crop prices, farm income this year is expected to be pretty good But I will say that because the growing cycle is behind by several weeks this year--we got a late start you may remember and all the wetness has delayed the growing cycle--an early frost this year would be a much more significant problem than would normally be the case In the ag equipment business, the level of activity continues to be pretty high Retail sales from one manufacturer that I talked to are running some 20 percent ahead of last year and because their inventories are reasonably low their production in the current quarter is running some 25 percent over last year One manufacturer of construction equipment notes that business is up because equipment is being used in the cleanup after the flood  With regard to inflation, I continue to be impressed by how restrained the price pressures seem to be Many manufacturers say the cost of their outside purchases this year will increase by only 1 percent or even a little less One large manufacturer that I talked 'to says that in fact they are going to have a reduction in their outside purchase prices and costs this year of about 1 percent Virtually everybody we talk to--it's true for retailers and manufacturers--says that marketplace pressures are very, very tough and that there just aren't any signs of widespread price increases On a somewhat continuing somber note, I think the line on this restraint on hiring that we keep hearing about is getting harder and harder with the passage of time [Firms] just will not take on additional full-time employees, and they are continuing to rely on overtime and out-sourcing to deal with their increased production requirements While out-sourcing does increase employment, at least in an indirect sense, it's not the same kind of employment increase that we've had in past cycles And I must say this employment restraint has become something of an absolute mindset among a growing number of CEOs  Turning to the national economy, the outlook is almost surprisingly unchanged, very much in line with the forecast that we developed at the time of the last meeting of the FOMC I think that at this point the risks are about evenly balanced But I must say it does seem like a pretty unexciting outlook Thank you  It's certainly true in Iowa, Wisconsin, and Michigan, not quite so much in Indiana Indiana is going to have a good year, much better than they've had in the past  Yes Production in Indiana looks good and they are delighted with the high prices    8/17/93  Not as good as Indiana It's between Iowa and [Laughter]--it should be obvious it's between Iowa and Indiana!  Mr Chairman, I completely agree with the position you've developed The opening line of the operational paragraph does say ""In the implementation of policy for the immediate future"" and it does seem to me that in the immediate future the chances that we would we change our policy at all are very remote Therefore, I think symmetric language is appropriate "
4813,1993-09-21," Mr Chairman, turning to the District, the level of economic activity seems very much unchanged since the last meeting Still, the underlying tone of the reports seems a bit stronger, at least in terms of volumes The automotive business continues at a surprisingly good pace The fourth-quarter production schedules have been set some 11 percent over last year In a comparative sense, the fourth quarter of last year was really quite a strong one so this year's fourth quarter bodes to be a pretty good one And with retail inventories still at good levels, as long as the sales hold up the industry thinks the downside risk on production is reasonably limited The automotive industry, therefore, expects that their activity will be a plus in terms of fourth-quarter GDP The steel business continues at a strong pace given the good first half that they had; it was the best first half since 1981 As [for] the current level of operations, they're at running about 87 percent of capacity They  -13-    9/23/93  expect shipments this year to come in at 87 to 88 million tons So, in terms of production it's a good year They just aren't making any money The October price increase that was announced earlier is not going to stick; but despite that they're really pumping out a lot of metal  Despite the floods and other adversities in the agricultural sector--and as an aside I would say that the weather over the next few weeks is certainly going to be critical to that sector--the farm equipment business continues to be very strong The company I talked to has a scheduled fourth-quarter production level some 30 percent over last year, but last year was really a very, very poor comparative quarter In the truck business, the 1994 outlook for medium trucks is good They're expecting a 10 percent increase next year Heavy trucks will be down a bit, 5 to 6 percent, but this is a result of a regulatory issue; there's a change taking place at the beginning of next year and, therefore, there was some advance buying this year to get the trucks in before that change I continue to be impressed, really even surprised, by the intensive competitive conditions of the marketplace and the very restraining effect that is having on pricing Many companies are achieving outright reductions in the cost of their outside purchases And for those companies experiencing increases, the increases tend to be pretty small and in the production process they are able to overcome those through productivity improvements So, it really is a very, very intense pricing environment But I do find the employment aspects of the environment increasingly worrying Companies are continuing to contract their work forces, and CEOs are taking a very, very hard line on this and are exerting an awful lot of employment discipline on their organizations As an example, in one company in Chicago, which 15 years ago had sales of about $1 billion and 53,000 employees, their sales level currently is up to $4 billion and their employment level is down to 25,000 And despite the increased production levels, which in some cases really are quite significant, I think it's a fair statement to say that no one I have talked to plans to add permanent employees to their payroll  One change in the outlook that I find a little interesting and almost surprising is in the commercial real estate business I talk to a company from time to time that is in the upper end of the commercial business, and over the last three years they have had nothing to report other than just absolutely dismal conditions This time, though, there was a slight change in the tone They think conditions are beginning to improve As yields on alternative investments have come down, people are looking at real estate as a possible investment for a higher yield This is probably an improvement for the wrong reason; nonetheless, it appears to be beginning to result in something of a stronger tone in rental conditions, terms, and other things like that They expect, if this continues and there is an improvement, that as we get into the second half of the 1990s the underlying fundamentals can begin to show some improvement  With regard to the national economy, I think the 2-1/2 percent or so growth rate that we've been talking about continues to be very realistic, very achievable, and that at this point the risks are about evenly balanced Thank you  When you say ""a stacked deck,"" do you mean in terms of the people who will be testifying in front of them or is there something else?  The non-Fed witnesses?  Who other than the voting members [of the FOMC] is likely to appear there?  ""B"" symmetric, I completely agree "
4833,1993-10-05," This is Si Keehn With regard to this business of going back and reconstructing Memoranda of Discussion for previous meetings from the information we have, I presume in the process that the people who participated would have an opportunity to review them and make changes and corrections as we do now on what we produce And I must say I think it would be awfully hard to go back that length of time and try to produce anything that would be reasonable I would resist very strongly the suggestion that we could go back and reconstruct these from such a long time ago  Okay  Absolutely  May I ask a procedural question? When we testified before Riegle, they were fairly specific about how long they wanted our verbal testimony to be Do we have any feel for how they're going to go about this and what Gonzalez is looking for by way of an opening statement? "
4850,1993-10-15," Alan, this is Si Keehn Could Virgil list the alternatives on that question?  I was just going to raise that point You may remember that in Gonzalez's letter to the Presidents, the number two question is to answer the question of whether we keep notes or are aware of notes being kept by others Until 10 minutes ago I had no awareness that we did have these detailed transcripts In fact, in my [draft] testimony I very specifically say that I do not keep notes and I have no direct knowledge of notes that others may take I guess I'd ask Virgil Do I now have direct knowledge of other notes?  -7-    10/15/93  [Unintelligible] Tuesday, I wonder how we ought to handle that question to try to deal with it  Alan this is Si Keehn I certainly want to support Tom Melzer on this It does seem to me that--  I was simply going to support Tom in that view It does seem to me that in your letter of December 24th to Mr Gonzalez and also in the concluding part of your testimony last week you very well made the case against a more detailed record than we now have And it seems to me that we ought to try to support that, as Tom suggested, as a way of separating the existence of those transcripts from what we're going to do on a forward basis  If we need to do that, can't we get there later rather than doing it so soon? Can't we initially try to take the view that Tom is putting forward? And as we get down the trail a bit, if it's not working, then we can rethink the position But if we get there right away, we've lost right off the bat  In fact, aren't we better off not making up our minds today or Tuesday? "
4866,1993-10-22," This is Si Keehn I really wondered why we wouldn't specifically say that in that section  Dick was talking about ""D"" on page 2, and I had the same question We say ""confidential and financial information, including central bank and foreign government information"" Why wouldn't we also be specific and say that we would exclude confidential corporate information and data relating to financial institutions?  Another I suppose procedural issue Now that I see Mr Gonzalez's most recent letter, I guess the horse is out of the barn But would we necessarily go to the Justice Department and begin to negotiate before it is clear that we have a problem that we're going to have to deal with? "
4882,1993-11-09," This is Si Keehn Is it clear that the addition would be shared equally between the Treasury and the Fed?  This is Si Keehn Given the circumstances, I certainly support the operation and would be comfortable with a higher limit The only possible question, and it's a detail that I'd raise, is this Given the political nature of the NAFTA issue, might we not be better off if we let the Treasury take the lead on the announcement so that we are riding clearly behind them? "
4913,1993-11-16," In talking about a delay of, say, three to five years, somehow we seem to have gotten to a very short fuse right off the bat Is there an argument, if we're going to do this, to use a longer time period before release at least at the outset? I think three to five years gets to be very, very short right at the beginning  Why not ten as a start?  Secondly, if I could, looking ahead What's our sense of the real interest within the Banking Committee in terms of making a fundamental change here? I must say that out in the Districts this is an absolute non-issue I haven't heard--  Yes  Does that say, therefore, that if we change our operating procedures a bit in [the way] we develop the current minutes, it's entirely possible that we might not have to make a fundamental change in the way we record our proceedings?  To wit If we don't have a recording, if we don't have transcripts going forward, we need not necessarily change what we do and the way we do it  -16-    11/16/93  Mr Chairman, I'm certainly more concerned about what we do going forward than what we do about the records of previous meetings, and I certainly hope that nothing we do with regard to the existing transcripts is going to affect our [deliberative] process adversely I must say, as kind of an aside, that I have a group of people--some ten people or so--that I talk to before I come down to the FOMC meetings I sent each of them a copy of my [October 19] testimony after I got back just so they'd be aware of what was going on And in my calls this time, getting ready for this meeting, I must say that one of the conversations turned out to be very different It was with a man who runs a very large manufacturing company in our District Normally we have a 15 to 20 minute conversation; this time it was about 5 to 6 minutes And as I went through that process I just had a feeling that maybe he had talked to a lawyer and came forward with quite a different message So, I think there is a risk in this that the information we get and the way we use it is going to have an impact on the way that we develop policy  With regard to the existing transcripts, I would favor the lightly edited transcripts Clearly I would state here, and it doesn't have to be repeated, that all the confidential information should certainly be deleted from them I'd prefer to have the staff do it as opposed to going to the principals; I think it's just easier to have the staff go through them and clean them up I raised the question about timing earlier If we start off with a short time, it's not going to get longer; they're always going to chop it down I'd prefer starting at longer than five years, but if we got to five years on the existing transcripts I think that would be okay  Going forward, I would far prefer the current procedure I must say that I think the current minutes are a very detailed, excellent record of what has taken place, what has been said, and what information we are looking at They are certainly more detailed than the minutes of most other meetings that all of us are familiar with And it seems to me that if we move away from that, it's going to have an effect on the way that we develop policy So I would prefer Don's alternative number one I would cease the recording and I would cease the transcripts I would rely on greater secretarial support to produce the minutes It's probably going to mean that we're all going to have to work a little harder in cleaning them up, but that's the way it is A couple of people have mentioned that the timing of a decision to cease our recording and transcripts now would be awkward; I don't think it would be at all After all, we are having a meeting in which we are discussing the process In the years I have been here we have never had this kind of full discussion It seems to me only reasonable that as a result of it, it's very likely that we would make a change And this is the change that I think would be appropriate  I'm staying with the existing minutes, no recording, no transcript  My first choice would be lightly edited transcripts without annotation; my second choice is raw transcripts with annotation  Could I ask what you mean by annotation?  Ten, first choice; five, second choice  Current minutes first choice; enhanced minutes second choice  Yes, I would too  SPEAKER(?) It's still got four votes; there are four enhances  -51-    11/16/93  Mr Chairman, in the interest of time let me simply say that in the District there really hasn't been a great deal of change since the last meeting But I do think, to a modest [extent] at least, that the underlying level of activity has increased The steel business is going to finish the year on a pretty strong note and [our contacts in that industry] are preliminarily looking for an increase in shipments of 3 to 4 percent next year, so they're feeling pretty good The auto industry currently is having perhaps the best quarter in a sales sense that they've had since the first quarter of 1990 The production schedules for the first quarter of next year have been preliminarily set some 7 percent ahead of [those for the first quarter of] this year, and this is invariably a pretty good quarter So, they're looking currently and ahead at a continuation of good business I must say that the retail side has been a very pleasant surprise I talked to one retailer--they have nationwide activity--who said their sales in October had been simply fantastic Total sales were up 20 percent and on a [same] store basis they were up 12 percent, so he has an underlying feeling that the level of confidence of retailers and consumers is building I mentioned the last time that in terms of commercial real estate some tentative signs of stability are emerging I think that trend is continuing I'm told that there really is an awful lot of capital that is moving into that [area]--again for the wrong reason The fundamentals aren't better but the investment alternatives are such that real estate in a yield sense is looking better And it's now beginning to have an effect on rent conditions, which are slowly beginning to improve at least on the margin We're a long, long way from new construction, but we have to go through this phase before we get to new construction The only negative that I'd report certainly is in the ag sector, for reasons that are well known to the Committee Particularly in our District, we have been very hard hit by growing conditions this summer The [harvest] is about completed on soybeans and seventy-five percent complete on corn, and we really have had a significant reduction in the production of both corn and soybeans While that's bad enough this year, it really does mean that the pressure on next year is going to be very, very heavy If we had two bad years in a row, it would be certainly very tough  -71-    11/16/93  Turning to the nation, I think our [District] outlook is consistent with what we see in the national economy, namely a modestly building growth consistent with the staff forecast It may be even a touch stronger than that But I must say the marketplace pressures are continuing to restrain price increases so that our outlook for inflation is very consistent with the staff forecast  ""B"" symmetric "
4941,1993-12-21," Mr Chairman, in our District also the underlying level of economic activity has clearly gained some momentum since the last meeting Virtually all the important sectors of our area have shown further improvement, driven largely but certainly not exclusively by the auto sector The auto production schedules, of course, have been strong this quarter; and for the first quarter of next year they have been set some 13 percent over the first quarter of this year The first quarter of this year was a pretty good comparative period And the industry estimates that their contribution to first-quarter GDP will be just a little stronger than the number that's in the Greenbook Given this, it's not surprising that the steel industry continues to operate at high levels Shipments this year will come in at about 88 million tons The forecast for next year is that they will ship over 90 million tons, a 3 to 4 percent increase One company that I talked with said that the outlook for the steel industry in the next two or three years is the best that they have seen in some fifteen years  Other parts of our economy also are doing well The farm equipment business has been strong The heavy truck business is expecting an even higher level of sales next year than this year So the improved level that we have experienced this year, as it turns out, has not just been due to the environmental standards that will become effective January 1st Machine tool orders, as an example, though down in the third quarter, for the year through October are up by almost 30 percent And retail sales--and I do think this is a fairly strong and recent development--really have increased quite substantially over the past month or so It's uneven; it's much stronger on the durable goods side than apparel Nonetheless, overall retail conditions are described as the best that have prevailed in some three to four years And I think I'd give high odds that the Christmas season is going to come in a little better than some of the forecasts that we're hearing about The employment situation also has strengthened Consistent with what Al has just said, for the first time that I can remember a heavy manufacturer has indicated that they will add employees at one of their facilities So far they have been able to meet the increased demand by increasing the line speed They now plan to add another shift, which will require additional employees They are completely out of capacity and the major constraint is a shortage of qualified drivers; there just aren't enough people available to drive the trucks And  who has been very cautious--really rather bearish for some time --describes employment conditions as the best he has seen in quite some while  With regard to the national economy, clearly the fourth quarter will come in on the strong side I think the question, as Mike has outlined, is whether or not we will experience the same kind of drop in the first quarter of next year as we did this year or whether [the quarter] will be more in line with the staff forecast And I must say at this point I think there is enough underlying momentum in place in the economy that the decline is quite likely to be very much in line with the staff forecast But there are some uncertainties out there, which are now well familiar Certainly, at this point at least, [the forecast] is not free from doubt With regard to pricing we are experiencing this interesting dichotomy very strong growth in economic activity yet pricing conditions that  -10-    12/21/93  continue to be very, very competitive Despite the higher demand for their products, manufacturers just don't have the latitude to raise prices with confidence that [the increases] will stick They are continuing to put tremendous pressure on their suppliers to maintain or even reduce their prices, and many of them are achieving some considerable success Whether this very fundamental change will last or whether we're setting the stage for somewhat higher prices on a broader basis remains to be seen I have a hunch that this will be the basis of our discussion when we get into the policy deliberations  Right  Mr Chairman, I also would be in favor of alternative B with symmetric language It does seem to me that the environment is one in which the policy stance ought to be heading to asymmetry toward tightening But I do think it's a question of timing The key here will be how the first-quarter data begin to come in rather than the fourth-quarter data I just don't think we're going to have that much available for a while that will tell us how the first quarter is really coming in And until we have that, I'd prefer to stay just where we are  Mr Chairman, I agree with your proposal; I certainly support it The only question I would raise, really, relates to access by other people If there was no monetary policy discussion, would I gather therefore that this is something that could be discovered through the Freedom of Information Act?  Well, I'm really raising the issue Is the October 15th tape and transcript one that if somebody comes in and asks for it under the Freedom of Information Act we're going to have to deliver It is, right?  We would not have to do it  Well, then I agree I just wondered, if in fact we would end up having to disclose it, whether tactically there might be some advantage to releasing it publicly at the same time we give it to the Committee But if that's not a risk, then I would not "
4971,1994-02-03," With respect to the issue Don Kohn just raised Is it a given that in the February Humphrey-Hawkins report we give the forecast for the next year and are we required to do that?  I move that we do this year only unless we have to do 1995  Mr Chairman, with regard to the national economy, in terms of growth at least for this year our forecast is really very close to the staff forecast, especially for the main sectors involved, and any difference is really not worth talking about Our overall CPI forecast is a little lower than the Board staff's; part of that I think is due to seasonal adjustment factors Offsetting this, our core rate of inflation is just a little higher than the staff forecast, so there is a little difference in our expectations with regard to energy prices  With regard to the District, the level of activity and I think the general tone of things and the underlying strengths are better now than they were at the time of the last meeting And despite the really miserable weather that we've been having in the Midwest, so far I don't sense any dropoff in the level of underlying activity this year of the magnitude that we had last year Admittedly, it's early to be coming to this conclusion, but certainly in the Midwest we've not had the same kind of dropoff  The auto business, of course, continues to lead the way Production schedules for the first quarter--it's hard to believe these numbers--have been set some 15 percent higher than the levels of last year or little more than that, and of course last year was a strong comparative period So the first-quarter production is going to be very, very heavy And in fact for some models, manufacturers are now experiencing some capacity constraints  The outlook for the heavy truck business has been improving Producers are raising their forecasts some 5 to 10 percent above last year's sales and production levels, and again last year was a pretty good year And related to this, the truck-trailer business is reported by one company to be absolutely on fire The shortage of truck shipping capacity is now a decided problem Shippers have become concerned and are pushing the large companies to add to their equipment and also to hire more drivers  Despite the adverse growing conditions last year in the ag sector, farm incomes were good Certainly farm attitudes coming into the new year are positive, and this is reflected in continued strength in the production and sales of ag equipment The production schedules for one large manufacturer have been raised some 16 percent above their earlier expectations for this year  Retail sales are surprisingly strong Christmas, of course, was just terrific Sales limitations, at least for some stores, resulted from the inability of suppliers to deliver and not from resistance from customers Again, despite the miserable weather, we really have not seen as adverse an effect on retail sales as we might have expected And to state the obvious, sales of snow shovels and batteries have been phenomenal!  -15-    2/3-4/94  In talks with representatives of various companies, I thought I'd mention three differences from what I noted the last time First, despite higher sales levels--and I think Mike Prell had a chart that demonstrates this--inventories remain under very, very tight control One large manufacturer reported that this is the first time in the history of their company that they've had a significant increase in production and sales and yet have not had an increase in inventories They are obviously managing their inventories very carefully But they are managing them on an absolute basis and not on a relative basis Second, while the now almost macho ""I'm not hiring any more employees"" statements continue to prevail, this time there were two heavy manufacturers who said they are adding employees and this is a sharp shift from their earlier ""not ever"" statements Third, I'm sensing some price pressures out there, and I think it's more now than just steel Several contacts reported that the prices for their purchased products are edging up just a little Also, in terms of their prices, though marketplace pressures remain competitive, they said they have been able to raise some prices and those increases are sticking That is by no means prevalent nor are the increases large, but at the margin a subtle change seems to be occurring So, I think the outlook here is a little different than it has been  I'm not quite clear on the precedential side of this Are you saying this would be an announcement that we have tightened without a discount rate change or with a discount rate change?  Okay  That's right  I agree with that  Committees could do mortal damage to press releases, but I really wonder if we want to use the term ""small increase"" rather than just ""increase""  I was going to take a word out!  Mr Chairman, I certainly favor moving and, like others, I have debated in my own mind the difference between a move of 25 and 50 basis points I was impressed with the tone of the comments yesterday It does seem to me that there has been a very significant shift toward strength in the reports that we heard yesterday as contrasted with December But despite all that, I must say that some uncertainties still remain Things are looking awfully good but there are some questions that we've all talked about that still need to be answered So, I come down favoring 25 basis points It does seem to me that 25 basis points with this announcement--which may turn out to be precedential but at least this morning would be unprecedented--will have a very strong signal effect Therefore, I think in effect we will get more than 25 basis points out of the action that we contemplate With regard to symmetry versus asymmetry--and this is a different thought--I've come to the conclusion that we ought to get rid of the asymmetric language forever It seems to me to cause far more complications than it's worth If we are going to move,  -54-    2/3-4/94  particularly over the foreseeable future, I think we ought to do it as a result of a conference call where we are all participating as opposed to getting all wrapped up in asymmetric language So, I would strongly favor symmetry now on a continuous basis  Mr Chairman, I would not change the provisional ranges and, like Governor LaWare, I feel very strongly about not releasing the 1995 forecasts "
5010,1994-03-22," Mr Chairman, in terms of the District, there is no question that the underlying level of economic activity has been and remains strong And despite the miserable weather that we have had in the Midwest most sectors, with the obvious exception of housing construction, have come through very, very well  There is little that I can add to what you already know about the automotive sector The second-quarter production schedules have been set preliminarily at 9 percent over last year This increase would be even greater except that some of the manufacturers are dealing with capacity constraints with some of their better selling models Still, the production increase in the second quarter will be less than in the first quarter, as Mike has pointed out Therefore, the automotive industry's contribution to the second-quarter GDP will be lower than was the case in the first quarter The capacity issue in the automotive industry, though, is an interesting shift from an industry that for years has been experiencing plant shutdowns and layoffs Now in some cases, they are struggling to keep up with consumer demand, which of course is particularly the case for light trucks To address their problem Chrysler, for example, has announced a $18 billion capital investment program And we are told that it's very likely that this program will be larger as they get further into it Given what Chrysler has been through over the last 10 or 15 years, it seems almost incredible that they are now the industry's star profit performer I must say that for the auto industry, all the way through from the manufacturers to the suppliers to the dealers, attitudes at this point are really very positive The heavy truck business has only gotten better, and Class 8 sales estimates for 1994 have been increased to 185,000 units The current order flow is the highest that they've had in 15 years and it's potentially a record year for some of the major manufacturers  -21-    3/22/94  The steel industry is running essentially flat out even though the current capacity utilization number is 93 percent That number is somewhat misleading; several companies are really producing at what they feel is their capacity limit Some of the major customers of the steel industry, and the auto companies are a specific example, have become concerned about the ability of the industry to meet their demand Ironically, steel imports this year will increase and likely significantly, but a large part of the increase will come from the domestic companies that will be purchasing foreign semi- finished products to meet domestic demand There is another increase in steel prices coming this summer Some while ago, US Steel announced a 2 percent increase that was scheduled for midyear It kind of hung out there for a while and others didn't join it; but now it looks as if the others will support that price increase  Retail sales have remained on the strong side To the amazement of one retailer I've talked to, their comparable store sales in February were 17 percent higher than last year, with good demand for higher-priced items They also worry about the ability of their suppliers to deliver, and in several instances the suppliers for this particular company are adding to their capacity  Despite this very strong level of economic activity I just don't sense that the price pressures are quite as heavy as I might have expected Major companies, particularly those that buy under contract, are continuing to push their suppliers very hard and they are continuing to get results from this Labor contracts continue to be very restrained, and wage increases are easily dealt with by productivity improvements, which continue to be very impressive Having said that, there clearly are signs that in many cases prices have at least stabilized and that some are showing slight upticks That's particularly true, of course, for steel-related products But while prices in the manufacturing sector may be firming, these increases have been offset by moderations in the service sector So I think, net, our outlook for inflation continues to be a constructive one  With regard to the national economy, our forecast is very much in line with the staff forecast And I think at this point the risks, if any, are as Ed Boehne has just suggested--namely that perhaps the numbers will come in higher than our current expectation  Well, it is a tough call I can't remember a time that the call has been tougher than it is right now I can come up with good arguments, at least in my own mind, for and against either 25 or 50 basis points But on reflecting, I do come down agreeing that at this time the 25 basis point move is the appropriate thing to do I would not be in favor of asymmetric language I would be in favor of symmetric language, not because I disagree with the direction of policy--I think we will be moving again--but because I'd rather not make it such a regular thing that the moves are going to be dependent on the timing of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee I would be opposed to establishing that kind of pattern Moreover, I'm just in general opposed to asymmetric language We had a very bad experience with asymmetric language last spring and, therefore, I'd prefer to leave the language symmetric I do think that the economy is going through a very dynamic phase and that we should keep in pretty current contact as we go through this period Therefore, I'd be in favor of 25 basis points now with symmetric language but an understanding that probably we would have a phone call before the next meeting and might make a change at that point  I'm very much in favor of announcing it Whether it's an announcement from the Chairman or the Committee I think is immaterial If we do it today, which I think we should, we will have established a precedent and we will have to continue But I think it's a constructive change "
5031,1994-03-24," This is Si Keehn I certainly support the action I think Ed Boehne has phrased it very, very well This is    3/24/94  exactly the way we ought to use this kind of facility under these particular circumstances "
5045,1994-04-18," This is Si Keehn I completely agree with the statements that Ed Boehne has just made I am very sensitive to the risks that Bill McDonough pointed out, but it seems to me that as we move for the third time and do not bring the discount rate along, it does open up the question as to when that will occur And while I quite understand that it's a sense of what the markets might do, I just have the intuitive feeling that the markets are probably ready for this kind of a change; and not to make the change, given this particular set of circumstances, would be a mistake "
5063,1994-05-17," In terms of the District, the underlying level of activity, which of course has been strong, just continues to gain momentum The auto industry, for example, which directly and indirectly so dominates our area, continues to exceed our earlier expectations Second-quarter production schedules were set at 12 percent over last year, and since retail inventories are at relatively low levels, even if there is a fall-off in sales this ought not to affect the production schedules The third quarter at this point seems a long way off; nonetheless, the early expectations are that the production levels will be up very substantially over last year And,  -13-    5/17/94  of course, the third quarter is normally a very slow quarter While the April auto sales were down a bit from the first-quarter level, some of that reduction results from the shortage of the better selling models Production capacity constraints really are getting to be an increasing problem In this environment, the steel business continues to be excellent; the raw production side of the industry is operating essentially flat out And it's more than just autos The appliance business is also very strong, as is the demand for other housing- related steel products There is, though, a little capacity available in the finishing end of the steel business, and the majors will be increasing their purchases of semi-finished steel products from foreign sources to fill out that available capacity An activity that I haven't mentioned in years because it's been so absolutely moribund is the rail car manufacturing business There also has been a decided pickup in demand as the fleet has gotten a lot older While people in the industry do not expect that deliveries will be quite as high as some of the published reports that you've seen, nonetheless, we are told that shipments of 35,000 to 40,000 cars annually over the next few years seem reasonable Not surprisingly, prices of rail cars are being increased this year, and there is a more substantial price increase scheduled for next year  The heavy-duty truck business has been even stronger since the last meeting The Class 8 sales forecast has been raised again, this time to 195,000 units, and the sales level will be constrained by capacity limitations as will the sales of medium-size trucks GM, for example, would like to add a third shift to one of their medium truck production facilities, but they just can't get the qualified workers Offsetting this somewhat, retail sales so far in May are reported to be a little slower than earlier in the year, but I think this is a comparative issue, not one of weakness in market conditions Sales of some items, such as home appliances, continue at a very fast pace A very large retailer told me the other day that their sales of appliances, for example, in April were 25 percent over the sales level of last year  In the ag sector, so far the planting has been going well Corn and soybean acreage is expected to be up this year, and both the corn and soybean plantings, as of last week at least, were well ahead of the normal schedules It is, of course, a long, long way to harvest Nonetheless, we are off to a good start with what are regarded as generally good moisture conditions Sales of ag equipment are well ahead of last year, with sales of large tractors some 18 percent higher than last year; and last year was, in a comparative sense, quite strong  All of this strength certainly gives a very positive tone to the District, but I do think there are some worrisome signs on the pricing front In the steel business, I've mentioned at a past meeting or two that there is a $10 a ton price increase scheduled for July 1, and at this point virtually everybody expects that to stick In addition, the majors are adjusting discounts and pricing for extras, which will have the effect of raising steel prices by about another 2 percent Aluminum manufacturers are reducing their production to firm up the prices Admittedly the latter are at low levels, but the reduced production levels nonetheless have resulted in higher prices, and I am told that the Russians are cooperating with this effort One very large user of aluminum told me the other day  -14-    5/17/94  that they are forecasting about a 17 percent increase in the price they will pay for aluminum next year Many other manufacturers report an upward shift in the cost of their raw material and component purchases By no means is this a dramatic shift, but it indicates just a different attitude and a different tone out there than has been the case in the past Some, of course, are finding ways to pass these increases through in the form of higher prices for their products For example, although their heavy truck prices won't be increased this year, one very large manufacturer is planning a pretty significant price increase next year Of course, retail auto prices are being increased as we go along here Despite all this, so far there does not seem to be any upward pressure on the wage front Though everybody we talk to says there is a shortage of qualified labor, so far at least it has not resulted in higher wage rates; but I just wonder how long that can continue to hold  With regard to the national economy, our numbers are essentially in line with those of the Board staff I do think that at this point the risks, both in terms of growth and inflation, are on the up side  Well, Mr Chairman, I certainly support the proposal The only question I have is a technical one Is this a single announcement today and is it going to be announced by you or announced by the Committee or--  Okay "
5087,1994-07-05," Thank you, Mr Chairman Our 1994 forecast is so close to that of the staff that it's hardly worth mentioning the difference here In some respects, we get there in a different way Nonetheless, the 1994 results are the same For 1995, though, there is a greater discrepancy Our outlook is somewhat stronger for GDP and just a bit lower for inflation Therefore, we have not built into our forecast the policy tightening that we have just been talking about I think fundamentally these differences perhaps reflect our view that potential growth is a little higher than the Board staff's  With regard to the District, overall conditions are largely unchanged from the past meeting or two The Midwest economy is continuing to operate at what I think is a comparatively strong pace The auto business continues to be good, and I think the recent reductions in sales in April and May had more to do with capacity constraints than any significant change in consumer attitudes The auto industry sales expectations for the third quarter are comparatively strong, with domestic production schedules set at some 18 percent over last year Since retail inventories are very low, I think at this point the downside risk in this production schedule is very limited Of course, all the industries that are serving the auto sector such as steel continue to experience very strong operations What's true for the auto sector, I think, is true for manufacturing in general; there are not many soft spots in our District in that sector The forecasts of sales for heavy trucks have not increased since the last meeting At this point, the manufacturers are dealing with capacity constraints, and lead times for delivery of the large, heavy trucks have been stretched out The delivery times for heavy trucks in general have stretched out even more out--to July 1995 In the home appliance business in April shipments were at record levels; and sales of agricultural equipment, another part of our economy that's important, are likewise at high levels  Despite the strong results in the manufacturing sector, I think there are some signs of moderation and slower growth in other parts of the District economy who runs the  trucking company reports that there has been a downward shift in the rate of increase in shipments But this downward shift is from the very, very high levels the trucking industry has been experiencing He says it is particularly apparent in shipments to retailers in general and for paper products Also, the retailers I talked to are seeing signs of moderation In looking back over the last few months, there seems to have been some kind of a shift People I talk to are not sure whether it is because of the  -21-    7/5-6/94  higher interest rates or the result of high income tax payments Nonetheless, I think there clearly has been some moderation in the retail sector from the high levels earlier in the year  On the price front, I do sense some pressures, though nothing dramatic But after a protracted period when manufacturers were able to push their suppliers to reduce prices, they are, as one company put it, approaching payback time, and we hear of more price increases There are also some upward pressures on wages The trucker that I just mentioned has reported an extreme shortage of truck drivers To deal with that, has granted an 8 percent increase in wages Another manufacturer I talked to who has a multiplicity of contracts they are renewing says the terms are a little higher, at least, than in the past With tight labor conditions, we have to worry that at some point these are going to be translate into higher labor costs So our outlook for inflation, while still positive--indeed it is a little lower than the staff forecast--suggests that there are some worrisome signs out there that we need to keep our eye on  Finally, in the ag sector, growing conditions for the grain crops continue to be favorable Planted acreage in the District this year is 3 percent higher than last year As of the end of June, the corn crop was described as excellent That obviously is a very significant improvement over what we were experiencing last year There is, of course, a long, long time from now to harvest, and we're at a critical point in the growing cycle But with a reasonable break in the weather the crop production should be pretty good And grain prices, which certainly have been terribly weak over the last several weeks, are likely to be restrained and ought not to be a significant cause of inflation  Mr Chairman, I agree with your comments with regard to M2 and M3 The point on the debt aggregate that Bill raised made the comment that I was going to make, but I really wonder what the correlation has been over a period of time between the debt aggregate and output, prices, and the like Has there been a reasonable correlation?  Hearing that, it seems to me that Bill's comment is particularly appropriate By focusing any attention on this, we are creating something that could be very awkward in the long run  In my earlier comments, I didn't remark on the forecast for 1996 I would be opposed to going forward that far unless we really have to It seems to be awfully far out on the forecasting horizon, and I far prefer to state our expectations in terms of our long-run objectives  Mr Chairman, I came to the meeting in favor of alternative B with a bias toward tightening I think you made a very strong case for that choice, and I certainly support that Even so, I would slightly favor symmetric language, not because I think an asymmetric policy is an inappropriate stance--I think our next move is likely to be toward tightening--but because I just am not sure what asymmetric language really buys for us On the other side of that coin, we have had some bad experiences, it seems to me, with asymmetric language May of last year comes to mind in that context So, as long as we have a good sense as to what we want to do with policy, I think that is all we really need to operate Therefore, I prefer symmetric language, but I don't feel that strongly about it In terms of the announcement, it is a bit of a dilemma, but the choice that Ed Boehne suggests seems to be a good way of dealing with that particular problem "
