7013,2003-03-25,  Dino has something from New York  
7106,2003-06-24,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The New York regional economy has   shown some signs of improving in the second quarter  Employment has recovered moderately in   the past two months, housing markets appear to have retained good momentum, and there are   signs of a revival in both New York City’s office market and in the region’s manufacturing   sector, though the latter is still characterized as weak  New York City, which was hit by some of   the steepest job losses in the District, has shown recent signs of a pickup, driven in large part by   the financial sector  Though large corporations on Wall Street are still not hiring, smaller   June 24-25, 2003 85 of 211    financial firms as well as legal and business service companies are reported to be adding staff    While New York City jobs data show only a slight recovery from the recent lows, the suburbs—  where job losses were milder—have seen more of a rebound in jobs this year  Office vacancy   rates have declined in the past two months, most notably in lower Manhattan  The midtown   office market appears to have steadied but lower Manhattan’s market has firmed markedly, with   vacancy rates dropping from 15 percent to 12 percent in just two months  Wall Street firms are   reported to be seeing good growth in profits and revenues  Debt issuance has been strong, while   equity and merger-related business remains at quite low levels despite a recent pickup in that   high margin activity    New York City’s and New York State’s fiscal problems have been addressed largely   through a combination of tax hikes and budget cuts  Widely publicized hikes in mass transit   fares, tolls, sales tax rates, and regulated rents should have only a modest effect on the overall   cost of living in the New York City area  In upstate New York, there are fewer signs of a   pickup  Albany, usually one of the state’s star performers, recently saw a sizable downturn in   employment  Rochester’s hard-hit manufacturing economy, dominated by firms facing intense   foreign competition, remains weak  While Buffalo has sustained fairly mild job losses recently,   the troubled finances of the city of Buffalo are being taken over by a state board     Our early June Empire State manufacturing survey indicated an improvement in business   conditions, but commentary from respondents still characterized the sector as weak  The home   purchase market has shown remarkable resilience, with inventories remaining tight across most   of the District  In contrast, Manhattan’s rental market remains slack, with nonstabilized rents off   about 20 percent from their 2001 peaks  Multifamily construction is remarkably brisk—mainly   in New York City, which no doubt reflects the very long lead time for project approval     June 24-25, 2003 86 of 211    On the national scene we have seen substantial improvements in financial markets, in   surveys of consumer attitudes, and in a number of business indexes  Given current levels of   interest rates, the tax cut, increases in federal spending, and the drop in the dollar, a forecast of   improved growth is certainly reasonable  However, we have yet to see any strong evidence of an   actual pickup in spending, employment, or production  There has been a rebound in a few   sectors—particularly in travel and recreation, which were heavily affected by the war—but as yet   the forecast of overall improved growth remains just a forecast    Our business contacts have become less gloomy recently, but the tenor of their remarks is   not yet optimistic  Firms seem to be quite hesitant to make capital spending commitments or to   increase employment  In many instances they have substantial margins of excess capacity, some   of it related to the technology and stock market boom of the 1990s  There is great concern about   foreign competition and the lack of pricing power  Our middle market company contacts express   growing anxiety about competition from China due to the latter’s significant pricing advantage   and constantly improving quality  Many of these contacts expect capacity expansion to occur   outside the United States for that reason  Businesses have become very disciplined about   continually looking for ways to increase output with fewer workers, and they expect to continue   that practice even as sales pick up later this year  For that reason we expect employment to   significantly lag economic recovery—even more than was the case in the early 1990s     Our large company contacts tell us that management and boards are spending much of   their time on governance and accounting issues, which is the cause of a more conservative risk   attitude  It does seem quite likely that household spending will remain on track and could gain   momentum with the tax cut  Certainly federal spending will be strong  Housing will continue to   be quite robust as consumers take advantage of once-in-a-lifetime low mortgage rates  While   June 24-25, 2003 87 of 211    state and local governments are raising taxes and trimming spending, this negative effect will be   small compared with the fiscal stimulus from the federal government    The expected strength in household and government spending notwithstanding, some   skepticism about a very positive outlook seems warranted  For example, the Greenbook forecast   calls for 4½ million jobs to be created over 2004  We believe that the traditional relationship   between economic recovery and employment is now much weaker because of new management   practices and structural shifts in manufacturing that will continue despite the recovery  On   balance, a forecast of improvement in growth looks logical  But we should be cautious about   accepting it as a basis for decisionmaking until we see business activity pick up decisively     Housing and deficit spending are not a strong enough foundation for a sustained recovery  We   still need clear signs that capital spending and employment are improving  Thank you    Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  I agree that there is no   clear sign of a recovery, and it seems to me that we need to back up our antideflation reputation    I would not go to a ½ point cut in the funds rate objective because it seems appropriate—to recall   some of my nautical training of years ago—to go slowly in uncharted waters  At these levels of   rates we don’t know what the impact on the financial industry will be, and I like the idea of   giving the banks, money market funds, and consumers time to adjust to these low rates  "
7133,2003-08-12,"  We do know that the European Central Bank has been studying our   ECI (extended custodial inventory) system because they want to make the euro more available   globally  So that’s a strategy that they have announced, but we haven’t seen the numbers yet, as   Dino said    The economy in the Second District has shown increasing signs of   strength in a variety of sectors  Employment has expanded in the past three months  Retailers   have reported strong sales results, and one major firm suggested that the tax cut is showing up at   retail cash registers  Reports indicate that the finances of the State of New York and of New   York City have improved substantially recently, reflecting both tax increases and some   surprising strength in revenue, probably from Wall Street   August 12, 2003 27 of 110    In terms of jobs, the best improvement this year has been in New Jersey, but we see signs   of a pickup in a number of areas of New York City’s economy  In particular, Wall Street firms   are reported to be enjoying strong growth in profits and revenues, and financial firms have done   some scattered hiring, unfortunately including one of our senior bank supervision officers     Tourism seems to be strong, with hotels reporting a noticeable pickup in occupancy in the   late spring  Upstate New York has generally lagged—though in the Hudson Valley, employment   is growing, and housing markets have been strong  Despite long-term problems in the upstate   industrial areas, manufacturing seems to be strengthening in the District  Our August survey of   New York manufacturers, to be released on Friday, will report improvement in general   conditions for a third straight month, reflecting strength in new orders and shipments  There is   also sustained high optimism about the future  For the first time in a while, respondents report   plans to add to inventories over the next six months  In the near term though, inventory and   employment plans remain rather subdued, and firms report that they are unable to boost prices   Turning to the nation at large, I think of the forecast expansion in the economy as   progressing in stages  The initial impetus has been provided by the expansionary fiscal and   monetary policies  The first sectors to advance should be households and defense spending, and   the indicators suggest that both are growing strongly  Growth should then be transmitted to   inventories and then to capital spending  Will growth spread from consumer spending to   inventories?  We still see continued liquidation of inventories, and businesses remain quite leery   about making any near-term plans to add to stocks, whether from domestic or foreign suppliers    Our New York survey suggests that plans to add to inventories apply to the longer term   Capital spending does look better, with good growth in the second quarter and some   strength in recent orders  But there isn’t any widespread commitment in the business community   August 12, 2003 28 of 110    for a full-bodied capital expansion  Despite improved business optimism, firms may be reluctant   to increase hiring for quite some time or to add to inventories  Firms seem increasingly   committed to a new business model in which improvements in sales and production will be met   as far as possible through efficiencies gained from the existing workforce  Executives will be   slow to accumulate inventories in anticipation of future sales because companies have developed   new techniques to manage their stock of goods more efficiently, as shown by the long-term trend   in inventories  As a result, we may continue to see strong growth in productivity and improved   profitability with stagnant employment  Unlike traditional recoveries, business optimism about   sales and profits will be very slow to show up in hiring and inventory accumulation   Another sector that we expect to gain momentum over time is US exports, which may   be shaped by similar forces  I’ve been dismayed by the extent to which our counterparts   overseas are counting on a US recovery to jumpstart their own economies  Nonetheless, like   the Greenbook, we see some early signs of a pickup in the major foreign economies, including   improved business sentiment  However, my view is that underlying business caution about   expanding employment and investment is even greater in Europe and Japan than it is in this   country  Thus, we may see a less robust recovery overseas than in past cycles and consequently   less push from US export growth than we would normally expect  Clearly, the risk in this   scenario is the need to finance a very large US trade deficit     In sum, we seem to be off to a decent start in a number of areas, but I am less certain that   we will be seeing growth spread to all sectors as we have in past expansions  Moreover, even   given the strong staff outlook, a substantial gap between actual and potential output will remain,   raising the likelihood of further disinflation—perhaps more than is indicated in the Greenbook   projection  Thank you   August 12, 2003 29 of 110     I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  I also promise not to   get too pessimistic, but I feel that business decisionmaking is different than it used to be  I think   that’s partly because of the global competition that President Pianalto talked about but also   because of pressure from investors for a low-risk, high-return strategy  This is something that’s   familiar in the market, as I know it   August 12, 2003 79 of 110   "
7154,2003-09-15,"  Mr Chairman, my approach to this question was to ask a number of   top economists for Wall Street firms over the summer whether in their view, in light of the   events of May and June, we have a fundamental problem with our communication policy  The   answer has been “no”  Their sense is that the system works and that it’s the best relationship   between the markets and the central bank in the world  There’s a sense that we continue to have   extremely high credibility  There were views on both sides on whether we should have inflation   targeting  Some argued “yes,” and some argued “no,” but there was no clear consensus one way   or the other  I think the only clear message was that they would like to see the minutes published   earlier than they are now rather than have to wait so long  But I wouldn’t say that there was an   extremely strong feeling on that among those that Chris Cumming and I talked to     The other interesting point that came out of these discussions was the difference between   talking to this professional audience of economists, many of whom have worked at the Fed in   one capacity or another over the years, and talking with traders  The economists listened to us   September 15, 2003 49 of 78    very carefully and understood what we are doing and the issues that we’re dealing with  Talking   with traders was a very different matter  That group is not a sophisticated audience in this arena    The economists in the top firms would say that they, too, have problems getting the traders to   understand their point of view  In effect, they threw up their hands and advised us not even to   try to use sophisticated economic arguments in dealing with that segment of the marketplace   So I would end up agreeing with President Minehan in terms of feeling that the existing   system is working well  The people in the markets that I think are the most important   decisionmakers say we have credibility; they know exactly what we’re going through; and they   would not ask for a change of any significant nature  "
7178,2003-09-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Second District seems to be doing at   least as well as the nation  Payroll employment has risen modestly in New York and noticeably   in New Jersey  Office vacancy rates across the New York metropolitan area have generally   leveled off and even declined in some areas, most notably lower Manhattan  Our September   Empire State manufacturing survey suggests that conditions in the manufacturing industry   improved for the fifth month in a row  As a reflection of this broad-based improvement, state tax   revenues have picked up noticeably, leading to a greatly improved fiscal situation in both New   York and New Jersey  Like the nation, employment is at best sluggish, with New York City just   September 16, 2003 44 of 106    now seeing some improvement and with considerable weakness in employment in some of the   major manufacturing areas of the District     For the nation as a whole, certainly there is a great deal of forward momentum evident in   spending and production  The major issues now are the sluggishness in employment and the   sustainable aspects of rapid growth  We have emphasized that a good deal of the job losses over   the last few years have been structural in nature, occurring in the process of strategic   reorientation of firms and industries  These jobs are not coming back; on that we agree with   President Guynn  If we look at the manufacturing sector, the best we can hope for is that   employment will level out  Manufacturing employment didn’t grow significantly in the 1990s,   and there is no reason at all to expect it to grow now  The big disappointment is that we do not   see any dynamism in employment in the services sector  Industries like retailing, where we   would normally expect to see fairly vigorous growth at this point in a recovery, continue to   stagnate  The process of structural change may be spreading widely outside of manufacturing     We have reason to expect recoveries to be considerably more sluggish now than they   were in the past, just as we expect recessions to be less severe  The rapid recoveries of the past   were inventory-driven, but closer inventory control means that firms today are not likely to   engage in a massive inventory buildup in the way that they used to  At this stage of a recovery in   the past, we were seeing output growth at least twice as high as we are seeing currently, and   much of that reflected an inventory buildup  While we might have to adjust our expectations for   growth in the early periods of recoveries, the absence of these large inventory-driven swings in   production seems to be a good thing for the economy  Changes in management practices, aided   by technology, contribute to firms’ ability to produce more in a period of modest demand growth   without boosting employment significantly  In manufacturing, we see this in changes in   September 16, 2003 45 of 106    assembly line setups and machine tool technology  In wholesale and retail sales, we see this in a   movement toward massive centralized distribution centers, satellite tracking of orders, real time   electronic data-sharing between suppliers and retailers, and greater use of temporary and contract   workers  There has also been a rapidly growing and widespread tendency toward outsourcing   and vertical specialization  Tasks ranging from human resources in hospitals to consumer   support in banking to R&D in Silicon Valley are now being outsourced     Nonetheless, if the recent pickup in spending is sustained, we should see some modest   job growth and a pickup in inventories  However, it may be that we will continue to be surprised   by the strength of productivity growth and stagnant employment  While all of us would be   disturbed by continued sluggishness in employment, consumer spending and the expansion in   output should remain intact as long as aggregate income holds up  There clearly is a large   margin of excess productive capacity in the United States and other industrial nations, and   capacity continues to grow briskly in developing nations  As the staff outlook suggests, it is   likely that the economy can expand at a fairly rapid pace for quite some time before we see   inflationary pressures develop  Thank you    Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  In my view the   recovery still is fragile in terms of employment and the business psychology  I think it’s too   early to start an exit strategy from our statement about our accommodative policy being   maintained for a considerable period of time  I have no regrets about having made that   statement, and I think it’s still relevant to repeat it    "
7202,2003-10-28,"  By most measures the Second District economy appears to be on the   rebound in absolute terms and particularly relative to the nation as whole  Private-sector   employment has trended up in New Jersey but has held near its cyclical low in New York  Our   Empire State manufacturing survey, which had been signaling steady growth in the second and   third quarters, kicked into a higher gear in October, suggesting accelerating activity and even   some pickup in employment  This is consistent with a recent upturn in jobs in hard-hit   manufacturing areas of upstate New York such as Rochester  Housing markets in and around   New York City sustained strong forward momentum in the third quarter, with brisk sales   October 28, 2003 35 of 126    activity, a diminishing inventory of homes for sale, and continued price appreciation  New   construction has also remained robust  Reflecting a combination of general economic   improvement and recent increases in tax rates, New York State, New York City, and New Jersey   all reported a continued pickup in tax revenues in the third quarter     On the national side, the upsurge in recent activity is clearly welcome  Production   appears to be ramping up to catch up to household spending, and there are signs that capital   spending is coming back to life  Business confidence is firming, with the pickup in growth and   the pronounced turnaround in profits  The labor market looks a bit better  I don’t think much   should be made of the small increase in jobs last month  The figure for September was a little   above zero after a string of numbers slightly below zero  Still, it was good to see, and there are   indications of some follow-through  Unemployment claims have fallen a bit, business surveys   are showing stronger hiring plans, and we are hearing about firms actively seeking workers     Looking ahead, I believe that the recovery will be subdued and that inflation will remain   under control for a considerable period  Businesses will continue to meet increased demand with   an improved management model, which will limit the need for significantly more plant,   inventory, or employees  Capacity will continue to grow rapidly in China and India, which will   limit pricing power for US producers  Business people are concerned about the long-term   implications of our large fiscal deficit and the current account deficit  There’s a general belief   that we are living beyond our means in this country and that the price will be paid after the   current stimulative boom runs its course  One facet of this concern is our global   competitiveness  We have been able to move into higher-value activities in the past when   manufacturing jobs moved offshore  But today we see that some developing countries have   October 28, 2003 36 of 126    large pools of well-educated and inexpensive workers that are beginning to challenge our   position in areas such as technology     My assumption is that the relationship between economic recovery and business   decisionmaking is quite different now than it was historically  We first saw the change in the   1992 recovery, when employment gains were very late and moderate  I believe that in this   recovery we will see businesses doing very well in terms of sales, profits, and cash flow but that   it will not translate into the same level of hiring and plant expansion that we expected in the past    Instead it will show up in larger dividends and continued pressure for more productivity from   existing people and equipment  Any new capacity expansion will be done offshore when   possible  Given this outlook, I believe that monetary policy will be stable for quite some time,   and in my view our statement should continue to communicate that message  Thank you    I concur  "
