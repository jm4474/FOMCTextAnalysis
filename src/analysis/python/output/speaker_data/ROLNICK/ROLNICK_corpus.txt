 Mr Chairman, I realize that typically when I give talks like this I’m   required to give a disclaimer  These are not the views of the Federal Reserve Bank of   Minneapolis, its board of directors, or the Board of Governors   2  In this case, I’m hoping they may become the views of those  organizations  The title of my talk is “Are Phillips Curves Useful for Forecasting  Inflation? 40 Years of Debate” It is based on work that our Reserve Bank published  last year in our quarterly review  Before turning to the package of materials that was  distributed, which I hope you all have, I would like to make a few introductory  remarks  Then we will go through the handout   At the heart of monetary policy discussions is a view that there is a stable  relationship between unemployment and inflation  Such a relationship is embedded  in the Board staff’s model and implies that low unemployment today will mean future  inflation tomorrow This view of unemployment and inflation is based on what has  become known as the Phillips curve  Indeed, some of the leading economic  textbooks today tout the Phillips curve as one of the key principles in economics   Nevertheless, the conventional view of the reliability of the Phillips curve has been  debated in academia for over forty years  Recent work by UCLA professors Andrew  Atkeson and Lee Ohanian, former staff economists at the Minneapolis Fed, concludes  that the debate is over On both theoretical and empirical grounds, the Phillips curve  fails The unemployment-inflation correlation is not stable, and unemployment is not  a useful indicator for forecasting inflation   What I’d like to do now is to take you through the handout  Page 2 highlights the  three points that I want to make  (1) the Phillips curve hasn’t been stable; (2) the  unemployment rate is not useful for predicting inflation; and (3) what we can say is  that, in the long run, money growth is a reliable predictor of inflation  Page 3 is titled  “The Phillips Curve The US Experience 1960–2000,” and page 4 shows the Phillips  curve from 1959 to 1969 that many of us grew up with  I remember graduate school  under Walter Heller when he would present these data and make the argument that  this was not just a correlation but obviously a very strong correlation that looked  rather convincing Furthermore, he and others—Paul Samuelson, for example—  argued that there was an exploitable tradeoff between inflation and unemployment  and that indeed it was up to policymakers to pick the right point on that curve  We  spent a lot of time arguing about where we should be on that curve, about the cost of  inflation versus the cost of unemployment    But if you recall, and some of you may, there was a fairly heated debate joined by  Milton Friedman, who argued that there wasn’t an exploitable tradeoff between  inflation and unemployment  He believed that if policymakers tried to exploit that   2 Materials used by Mr Rolnick are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)                     June 25-26, 2002 8 of 179  relationship, it would shift and indeed might disappear  If you turn to page 5, you  will see that, in fact, that is what happened as policy changed and we confronted the  inflation of the 1970s and onward One would have a hard time finding what I’ll call  the old Phillips curve relationship between inflation and unemployment in that period   If anything, in the 1970s the relationship went the other way, and some people were  saying that it looked as though we got high inflation but also high levels of  unemployment     Nevertheless, a number of economists weren’t going to give up on the Phillips  curve, and indeed—if you’ll turn to page 6—a new Phillips curve emerged between  1970 and 1984 The new Phillips curve was now a relationship between  unemployment and changes in inflation This led to the concept of the non- accelerating inflation rate of unemployment, which we all call the NAIRU  The idea  behind that concept is that, if unemployment falls below the NAIRU, the economy  will be heating up and that will cause inflation to accelerate  Alternatively, if  unemployment rises and the economy gets weak, then inflation will decelerate  If  you look at the data from 1970 to 1984 you can see a relationship like that  It  convinced many that there was something to the NAIRU concept and that once again  unemployment would be useful in understanding inflation    Again the debate continued Professor Robert Lucas argued that with this  conceptual framework there was a problem with policy  His argument was that it  might be true that, if policy is highly variable and inflation is hard to predict, we can  get real effects and a new type of Phillips curve  That is, because unexpected changes  in inflation are difficult to decipher and we don’t know whether those changes  involve a relative price change or a rate of change in inflation, there can be real  effects But in his models he shows that if policy were to stabilize and if inflation  were to come down and stabilize, then this relationship should also disappear  And  that’s what we find As you can see on page 7, the so-called new Phillips curve  becomes less visible in the years between 1984 and 2000 as we were bringing  inflation down As inflation becomes more predictable and as policy becomes more  predictable, it no longer appears that there is a NAIRU that tells us much about where  inflation is going   So, as I’ve noted on page 8, my first point is that the Phillips curve has not been  stable You might quarrel with this  I’ve taken some very simple views of the  Phillips curve; you might take some more sophisticated views  You might not use  unemployment; you might want to use a broader measure of economic activity  But  I’m going to assert that whatever the measure used, we’re going to find the same  problem over this period  When we have tried to look at more-sophisticated Phillips  curves, we found that they are not stable over this period   Let me turn now to the question that the authors, Atkeson and Ohanian, pose more  directly Some economists still insist that the Phillips curve may be stable enough  and that unemployment, therefore, can still be useful for predicting inflation  So the  authors suggest a test, and their test raises this question  Can the NAIRU-based                        June 25-26, 2002 9 of 179  models forecast better than a naïve model?  What do they mean by a naïve model?   As shown on page 10, their definition is simply that a naïve model is one in which  inflation over the next period is predicted to be equal to inflation over the previous  period—not a very high hurdle and obviously a very unsophisticated model     On the question of whether NAIRU-based models can do better, page 11 provides  a picture view of their answer, which is “no”  They compare a naïve model to the  NAIRU-based Board staff model—and also to the Philadelphia Fed’s Survey of  Professional Forecasters, which we think is NAIRU-based—and one can see that the  predictions are roughly the same  They went on to evaluate a host of other NAIRU- based models, including many based on work done by Mark Watson and James Stock  who have done a tremendous amount of writing and work on NAIRU-based models   So the authors looked at a large assortment of those models—132 of them—to  evaluate them in terms of whether they predict inflation better than a naïve model     Page 12 conveys the basic idea underlying their method of evaluation  A better  forecasting model has smaller average forecasting errors, right?  The authors’  measure of success for a model, then, is the ratio of the average error of a NAIRU- based model versus the average error of a naïve model  The NAIRU model wins if  the measure is less than 1  It loses if it’s greater than 1  So it’s a very direct test, and  I would argue that it’s not a very high hurdle  The authors take a look at the Stock  and Watson generalized versions of 132 different NAIRU-based models and compute  these ratios   You’ll see on page 13—and this chart needs some explanation—how the NAIRU  models did What we’ve done here is to show the range of that ratio  Again, if the  ratio is over 1, the NAIRU model is losing Take the record with respect to the  models’ predictions of core CPI, for example, one of the inflation variables the  models are trying to predict The question asked is, Based on that ratio, how many of  the NAIRU models have lower average forecast errors?  The answer was none For  all of them the ratio was above 1  The authors looked at the forecasts of CPI and  found that one or two of the NAIRU-based models actually tied the performance of  the naïve model They looked at the PCE deflator and could find one NAIRU-based  model at most that did as well predicting that variable as the naïve model  So,  looking at the performance of a variety of NAIRU-based models in forecasting three  different major indicators of inflation, the NAIRU models could not beat the naïve  model That’s the summary of that page, and it makes the second point I want to  convey Not only has the Phillips curve been unstable, it is not useful for predicting  inflation when measured against a naïve model   So the conclusion that I draw from much of the work of Atkeson and Ohanian is  that there are problems with predicting high-frequency inflation—or what is known  as short-run variations in inflation—if we use unemployment  We’ve learned that  that is also the case if we try using the money supply—even different measures of the  money supply We’ve had trouble using a money supply measure to predict inflation                       June 25-26, 2002 10 of 179  for a long time, and that is one of the reasons this Committee has moved away from  placing heavy emphasis on money growth in its policy decisions   Nevertheless, we do know, based on various types of evidence, that over a long  period of time money growth causes inflation  There are a number of different  statistics I could have used to make this point The one I’m going to show you on  pages 15 and 16 happens to be my favorite  It is based on the experience of ninety- four countries from 1960 to 1990 averaged over twenty-five-year periods  It is work  that was done by Warren Weber of our staff and George McCandless, one of our  visiting economists  And it is work that was cited by Robert Lucas in his Nobel  address regarding one of the clearest facts we have in economics, which is this long- run relationship between money and inflation  Again, we recognize that it is difficult  to say anything accurate about short-run movements in inflation  But we can be fairly  confident that, over the long run, countries or their central banks that print too much  money are going to cause high inflation That is my third point, as stated on page  17—that, in the long run, money growth is a reliable predictor of inflation    Let me sum up with a few concluding remarks  The work that we have published  on the Phillips curve is consistent with a number of articles and research papers by  others in the System  The New York Fed, the Cleveland Fed, the Chicago Fed, and  the Board have all published papers that are consistent with the findings of Atkeson  and Ohanian  I think the bottom line is that the research calls into question the use of  unemployment to predict inflation in the short run  Finally, let me say that, ex post,  one can always find explanations for movements in inflation That may be a very  useful exercise for a number of reasons But it does not change the results that I’ve  presented here Mr Chairman, those are my comments and I’d be happy to answer  questions    Well, we have a theory, the quantity theory—as well as a number of   other general equilibrium theories—that says money causes inflation    Right, a theory    The correlation I show is a correlation  I don’t think we ever prove a   theory The best we can do is to say that we have a theory and these data are consistent with the   theory In this case, quantity theory and a number of general equilibrium models say that an   increase in the money supply will cause inflation, and we have this correlation in the data that is   consistent with that theory  Are you saying that we could have theories in which we predict that   inflation will cause an increase in the money supply?  I guess we could invent some   Right, absolutely     Did they cave?    We’d have to get Chris Sims here to discuss whether those techniques   are good enough to determine causality I think that’s hard to do Even with the best statistical   techniques we have, it is difficult to get causality    I’m very familiar with that study, and I think it was an excellent study   in a number of ways  Let me point out that the authors of that work found, too, that the Phillips   curve was very unreliable and was not stable They had their reasons for claiming it wasn’t   stable ex post; ex ante there was no such suggestion in the literature that the Phillips curve was   going to shift the way it did other than by those who argued that Phillips curves are inherently   unstable in the first place So nothing that was shown in that study suggests that the Phillips   curves are stable   Secondly, they used a turning-point analysis—a different metric, as you noted—to try to   determine turning points rather than the measure of inflation changes  They don’t show that that   gives a stable relationship either  In fact, that is also a relationship that changes over time  The   basic message of the Minneapolis study was that these relationships are not stable, and that is the   case whether one is looking at measurement or turning points  It is true that for certain intervals   one can forecast very well with the Phillips curve  How do we know what kind of interval we’re   in?  How do we know when the interval changes?  What theory tells us when it changes?   Potentially, policymakers can make large mistakes if we’re in a period where the ability of the   model to predict accurately is changing and they don’t know that  So I think the argument                  June 25-26, 2002 14 of 179  coming out of the Minneapolis Fed study is that to be confident—whether you want to use a   measure of detecting turning points or not—you need a stable relationship  And until you find   that stable relationship, you’re facing quite a bit of uncertainty  As you pointed out, the success   rate in predicting turning points was 70 percent  I don’t know if that’s high enough  Are we   going to tell the Congress next year that we’re 70 percent sure that inflation is going to decline?   Is that good enough?  I would think we’d want a success rate closer to 90 or 95 percent and we’d   want a relationship that was stable  So I’m not sure, given the evidence we have, that we would   be very confident in either type of metric—that is, the measure of inflation or its turning point    There is still a lot of work to be done to be able to argue that we could confidently predict a   turning point in the rate of inflation    Thank you!    No, I think there is a question of whether it is statistically better than   50 percent In this case there were not enough observations to do a very good job of testing   whether that result was any better statistically than a flip of a coin  So while I think there may be   something there, you don’t have enough observations to say much confidently on that method of   turning points              June 25-26, 2002 15 of 179   I thought you were going to ask me an easy question!  [Laughter]    All I’m suggesting is that our current knowledge is that, for high-  frequency observations or short term, it’s very difficult to predict inflation  For the long term I   think we can do a pretty good job    Using quantity theory But if we’re interested in short-run movements   in the economy, I think the quantity theory has not done very well  After all, that’s the reason we   don’t use monetary aggregates for short-run predictions of inflation  So as long as we’re   concerned about short-run movements in inflation—and I’m talking a year to two years—all I’m   saying is that I think you have to continue to forecast but you might as well use a naïve model for   forecasting inflation now until you find something statistically better  If you think   unemployment is going to do it, I believe this evidence suggests that you should be worried   about using that construct In fact, when the unemployment rate fell well below the so-called   NAIRU for the last three or four years, it was fortunate that this Committee did not respond to   that—and I think for good reason The message from this evidence is that looking at the        June 25-26, 2002 16 of 179  unemployment rate relative to a NAIRU is not a very effective way of predicting inflation  If the   Committee had believed it was, I think it would have made some serious mistakes    Yes, there is one comment I’d like to make  A number of people have   made the point that Robert Lucas made a number of years ago, which is that in an environment   with high and variable inflation we’re going to see this correlation between unemployment and   inflation And indeed, unemployment then helps us predict inflation  But when we stabilize   inflation and move to a stable environment, as we’ve done, that relationship disappears  I think   we all believe we’re in such an environment  So going forward, assuming we’re going to   maintain that environment, the question is this  Are we still going to rely on a Phillips curve to                                                           June 25-26, 2002 52 of 179  help us predict unemployment, or are we going to acknowledge that there is another model and   that it is a simple naïve model?  At the minimum I would argue that we should be putting less   weight on the Phillips curve’s ability to tell us anything about the future course of inflation  It   shouldn’t have the weight that it has had in the past  I’m not arguing against structural models    I’m not arguing that there is nothing we can learn by trying to understand underlying behavior in   this economy But it is important to notice, and I think many of you did, that the relationship   between unemployment and inflation is dependent on policy  We are now in a very stable   inflation environment, so we should be putting less weight on that relationship  Thank you, Mr   Chairman
