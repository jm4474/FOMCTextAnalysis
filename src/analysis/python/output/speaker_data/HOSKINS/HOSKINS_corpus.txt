 I have one question--and this is back on the dollar again--and it has to do with your sense of any large short positions currently in the market In other words, is there a perception that the only risk is on the downside and not on the up? If that is the case--  Let me ask Peter a question I might be too sensitive to the markets, having just left those wharves But in this environment if, for technical reasons, the funds rate were to trade above 7 percent, what in your judgment would the perception be with respect to either Federal Reserve policy in general or the linkage to the dollar?  I would speak only with some trepidation, since my first FOMC meeting by telephone resulted in a 508 point drop in the stock market I will make another observation, however I have been a Reserve Bank President about three weeks now and I've probably participated in more FOMC meetings in that time than any other three-week President In terms of the Fourth District, it is probably very typical--similar to what Si Keehn has indicated We polled [District contacts] prior and after the problem in the market and, basically, heard of no major pullbacks in either capital goods or on the retail side The only comment I would like to make is that I do have some concerns about the dollar and any attempts to keep it at a level that is other than what the market wants, particularly, if we signal that as policy makers through interest rates  I think if the Desk comes in on either side of the market around 6-3/4 percent, it is going to be pretty clear to the  -40-    11/3/87  market very quickly where we are; and they are not going to pay much attention to the borrowings  I don't have anything to add to what has been said with respect to alternative "B" I think I like the Corrigan language; I'd prefer the funds rate about where it has been--I don't have any problem with that I would not want to err too much on the high side in terms of a federal funds rate over 7 percent because I think that might sent the wrong signal to the market I think the point that Manley Johnson raised is an important one that it may be difficult when do we shift from a mode of providing liquidity back to some kind of monetary aggregate And I think I would be remiss if at my first opportunity with all of you I do not mention the monetary aggregates In that regard, they have been growing slowly relative to trend for six months or more The staff projection for M2 is 4-1/2 percent, fourth quarter over fourth quarter and that's down from a trend rate for two years of roughly 9 percent That usually is considered a significant change with some real impacts; however, that's not for this meeting   In your opinion, if we were to make a change, is the tenor in the market a lot different now than it was, say, right after October 19th?  It seems to me that we are struggling with the issue of trying to tell the markets where we are Perhaps one way to do it--and I think Jerry has already referred to it--is simply to indicate that we are returning to an operating procedure that is more normal There are a couple of reasons for doing that We are trying not to give a miscue with respect to two things, it seems to me first, whether or not we have tightened or eased policy; and secondly, whether or not we have moved to a different kind of interest rate policy Because we don't want misconceptions out there about those two issues, it seems to me we're better off providing more information rather than less Now, Peter did that before by protesting--by coming in early--and the market caught on very quickly I'm not sure he can do that in reverse So, I guess to some extent I would support Jerry I'm not sure I caught the gist of his comments correctly, but [unintelligible]  I guess this has been a nice trip back through Federal Reserve policy in the last 10 years I think the only term I haven't heard was RPDs Some of you may remember that one Do you remember that? That [unintelligible] when I left the Federal Reserve System the last time So, it was a fascinating trip, and the debate about the base certainly brings back the old fervor for everybody But I don't think Tom's suggestion was that we ought to install the base as a target and use it right now I think the suggestion was that we ought to take a look at it and maybe get the Board staff to take a look at it, too, since some new work has been done We just had a paper presented at the Cleveland Bank by Ben McCallum that you might want to take a look at From my point of view, policy has been wise for five years, but the inflation rate has not been down for five years Not that the base is going to cure that, but if we're looking for a long-term message or consensus on inflation, then we may want to take a look at something like the base to help us get there, not as the end-all  You used the number of $100 billion spent for six months of this year by G-10 countries  I'm just curious Has anybody speculated as to what we bought with that $100 billion and where we would be had we not spent it? And, secondly, you described a situation that seems to me to be indicating some strains amongst the G-10 countries regarding the notion of further intervention Does that imply that we are going to alter fundamentally some monetary and fiscal policies? In other words, are we not going to sterilize?  Well, if intervention doesn't work, to me it's obvious, then, that you can draw any conclusion you want to  I'm sure it has To my mind, it certainly has an effect It has an effect as one country sees another country shifting away Every time we get into periods like this, certainly there is a tendency for Latin American countries--those that have any reserves--to switch a little; some of the Asian countries have a great desire to make the best of their reserve holdings and do some switching I don't want to exaggerate what we have seen to date but there are some important [unintelligible] as the dollar has continued to weaken It's not surprising that you see these kinds of pressures  Given your reference to divine intervention earlier, would you figure that this is an appropriate time to think about starting option (3)? Would you be comfortable with that?  The question was that we have a fluctuation in the funds rate on the down side, and therefore, we could perhaps begin to move toward [accepting] more volatility in the funds rate right now since it moved in the right direction for us first off  I have a clarification on the National Association of Business Economists survey Mike correctly reported that nearly half of them expected to see a recession in 1988 However, that's a general question asked to them about recession But the data with respect to questions on their own firms are inconsistent with their forecasts of recession In other words, most of them commented that the order books in their own firms were fairly strong  The manufacturing side of the Fourth District is strong and it is strong based on the dollar From what we can tell, it is strong in steel, chemicals, and capital goods The emphasis on the customer side has been more on delivery times as opposed to price, which implies some increase in price of very [unintelligible] commercial side It is very consistent with respect to not bringing on [line] a lot of old plant; they want to wait a while longer to see if the demand lasts On the retail side, it's very much the same as everyone else has reported Higbee's, May's, and Federated all have reported strong sales gains since Thanksgiving None of the weakness that we've all been anticipating has shown up, to date In terms of the longer-term forecast, we have no really major differences with the Greenbook forecast In terms of the adjustment  -63-    12/15-16/87  process we were talking about, I suspect surprises in the future rather than disappointments will be on the side of a quicker adjustment rather than a slower adjustment than we have seen lately And the reason for that has to do with what is going on, at least in some companies, with respect to their profit margins The profit margins of foreign companies are being squeezed; they are holding market share, as everybody has discussed But they are doing the same thing that the Americans did six or seven years ago they are putting plants in place in domestic markets or buying plants in domestic markets to retain their market share So, they are going to suffer a profit squeeze for a while, and then they will be up and running with domestic plant production which would then imply less imports from abroad So, I have some view that the adjustment process, at least as forced by the marketplace, is going to go a little faster than perhaps we are expecting at the moment It doesn't mean that we shouldn't worry about the things that Jerry Corrigan and everyone else are worrying about But my emphasis would be that, obviously, we don't have a lot of control over all of those variables One we do at least have some influence on is price stability And I would find a consensus around the table for moving more towards zero over the next four or five years more comforting than 4-1/2 percent  I guess I'd go with alternative "B", with some reluctance, over the concern about the aggregates and the continual downward revisions That causes me some concern about going forward Obviously, the optimism we see right now is related to some events that have already happened, if we believe in lags So, I'm concerned about going forward If we're going to look at an aggregate, I would try to pay a lot of attention to M2 and whether we're going to get the growth there or not If we get continued shortfalls in that, then I'd be concerned more than I would be otherwise I'd want to go with option (4) if we're going to use the announcement I don't see any reason not to announce to the markets that we're making a change We're sitting here looking for year-end cover and all that kind of thing; it seems to me we can get where we want to be very quickly with less misinformation or miscues by making an announcement If we're  -74-    12/15-16/87  not going to do that, then I'd worry a little more about markets and go with option (3)  Symmetrical, and $400 million borrowing  That's as good a guess as I can come up with  7 percent   This is Lee Hoskins I think I agree with moving back to this language I guess I question doing it in this reserve period, when there is massive intervention going on and there's a possibility the funds rate will stay substantially above 7 percent, giving the impression to the market that we are, in fact, evolving policy in order to support the dollar   Mike, I don't know whether this is an appropriate question for you, or maybe for later discussion, but our first monetary policy objective states, essentially, that we want maximum output without a significant acceleration in inflation One could reverse that and say we want to achieve a deceleration in inflation without significantly damaging employment and output Did you choose that assumption or are we to discuss that assumption?  Just very briefly, the Fourth District is very similar to what the reports were with respect to Philadelphia and Chicago We are strong in terms of steel and chemicals and capital goods And, despite a certain amount of probing around for difficulties there, we're having a lot of trouble finding any To answer Ed's question about why people are so nervous, even though  -21-    2/9-10/88  things are so good it's probably because we're always calling them up asking them what's wrong There's a problem every week, and they think I know something  SPEAKER(?) You can talk to [unintelligible]  SPEAKER(?) You can create a recession  Yes, all by myself! The only exception, really, is in the state of Ohio, where we had a full percentage point rise in the unemployment rate in the last couple of months And, from what we can tell, that's entirely associated with autos and the buildup there As for the financial forecast, I wouldn't quibble with the staff's projection  I think the long-term targeting process is really your chance, and our chance, to make a more clear statement about what we think we can control over time I think over time we can control nominal variables and not real variables And I think what we want to signal to the markets and the public is this commitment to bring on price stability I think you do that by continuing to march the aggregate ranges down In that context, I think we should have some fairly firm statements about our consensus on inflation, and I'd prefer to see some time horizon attached to that price stability goal  -38-    2/9-10/88  In terms of the specific targets this time, I would want to choose alternative III, if not even slightly lower than that I think, as the staff correctly points out, the forecast will fit any of these ranges And I think, as Ed indicated, this will send the right message to our public  In terms of the rebasing issue, it's an old one that has come up many times before in terms of base drift At least eight years ago we chose, at that time, not to adjust our misses Ed was indicating that it seemed to be somewhat random; in those days, it seemed to be biased in one direction I think if we are going to want to adjust for base drift, then we ought to do it in a consistent fashion That would mean something like picking the midpoint of the target range every year and starting the base over again--starting the cone from that midpoint regardless of where we came out I'm not recommending that I guess I'd just as soon go with the randomness in our misses and start from scratch each time But I would not move the base around My last point is that I would concur with Jerry that we ought to put M1 into a monitoring range; but--and this may be premature to our later discussion--I'd also toss the monetary base in there as a monitoring range  I'd like to know what the procedure is for formally changing the borrowings target  I guess we could get to work toward our luncheon discussion if we wanted to consider a penalty discount rate;  -65-    2/9-10/88  that ought to reduce the concern over borrowings I think Frank Morris raised a good point We haven't been willing to address the rate of growth in reserves, because while we may be able to control that, we haven't liked the outcomes That may be because we have been uncomfortable with the relationship between money and the economy That's a longwinded way of saying that it's still a pretty confusing scenario in my own mind I would tend to favor alternative B in the short run, ensuring that the growth in the monetary aggregates continues; I would err on the side of making sure that growth is continued In terms of the longer term, I would stick with alternative III   It's not really for Sam It's just an observation It may be for Ted Truman or Don Kohn On the question Ed Boehne raised--and you and Jerry also commented on--in respect to using currency market intervention with large open economies, I think that the empirical evidence is that if you sterilize you don't get any effects through intervention over time I'd be interested in hearing comments on the empirical research because I think the question--  SPEAKER(?) Now, that is a technical kind of question in the sense that if you really do want to alter your monetary policy and use currency markets as a way to do it--that is, to allow money supply to grow or to shrink to match what you are doing--I think that is a different question  But if you had had borrowed reserves, there would have been the same question about what the appropriate level of borrowed reserves was  I didn't attend the meetings, but I spent a good portion of my time as director of research [at the Philadelphia Reserve Bank] on the 1979 issue, trying to widen the funds rate bands We went through a lot of the things that some of us alluded to here when the base argument came up two months or three months ago; we went through things like zone of indifference and zone of tolerance And during that period--Peter is right--it is part of the process If you use interest rates, you're going to be procyclical You may think that you are going to be able to jump out in front, but the experience  -15-    3/29/88  was that you just won't move interest rates sufficiently to get on top of an expanding economy  I'd do it a bit differently I think that the borrowing target is more closely related to what I think drives the economy And it may be that money matters--whether it's the base, M1, M2, or M3--  I see no need at this point to change the current procedures Harking back to Ed Boehne's analogy of 1 to 10, I thought there were some of us here who would prefer to go back to something like a total reserves target or a nonborrowed reserve target procedure at some point in time Keeping the framework that's currently in place allows us to keep that hope alive to some extent, whereas if we go straight to explicit funds rate targeting I think we would be doing ourselves a disservice It's very hard to reverse that process; my experience in the 1970s leads me to believe that I would stay where we are, in terms of how we're doing this In terms of the Chairman's discretion, I really don't have too much to say about that; I think he's got to have the ability to make some decisions And I don't see an easy way to limit that in order to fulfill our responsibilities I think it's a matter of trust, and I'm comfortable with that  Let me say, it has always been different  The Fourth District is pretty much as I reported last time Manufacturing activity is very strong We have several firms, primarily in primary metals, that have reported that they are at capacity levels; they simply can't produce anything else One of those firms is considering some kind of expansion at this  -46-    3/29/88  point, because they believe the demand is going to last a lot longer than they had anticipated before That is primarily because of the client involved We see a reaching of capacity limits now across a broad spectrum of manufacturing activities, from glass through chemicals, at least with the firms within our District Not everybody, though, is planning to move ahead to build plants or expand capacity; there are still a lot of people who are not quite ready to take that step  In terms of price increases, you heard me say last time that, at least at a couple of firms, primary metals--steel principally--have risen 15 percent or so I have not heard of any new price increases since then, but that is coming out of the gate at the start of the year with a pretty hefty price increase We are getting the same thing in chemical products now 10 to 15 percent price increases But they have not shown up in the national indices  In terms of the overall outlook for the country, we are very similar to the staff in terms of real growth The composition is somewhat different we actually have stronger PCE--as we've had for the last six months, probably--and weaker net exports I have some concerns if you're right on exports and we're wrong But if we're right on PCE and you are wrong, we have a problem Given the potential for that problem, I see a resource-constraint type of problem; trying to make room to ship goods abroad with our resources requires a slowdown in the expansion of consumption If we don't get that, then I think we are going to get the inflation forecast that my own staff is turning out, which is very similar to yours And frankly, I find the CPI [projection] of 5 percent in the second half of the year a very distressing number to have to face, when I think that our objective, as I stated before, ought to be price stability-- and by that I mean zero   I'd like to start by sort of recapping what I see in worldwide inflation rates I think we are looking at a situation where, for one reason or another, the inflation rates of two of the major economies out there are moving up toward ours, instead of ours moving down toward theirs And that seems to me to be a real loss in ground There are reasons for that; they have exceeded their monetary growth rate targets, partly in defense of the dollar Those monetary growth rates seem to be giving the kind of impetus to spending in those economies that we would expect And I don't see that going away any time very soon So, worldwide, we have a potential trend that is discouraging In terms of our own inflation rate--just to reiterate what I said earlier--we have been stalled at a rate that I think is too high for most of us, at least as stated in terms of our objective, which is price stability Even if the staff forecast is in error, in the sense that it's too strong on the economy, it seems to me we're still faced with the prospect of inflation staying at current levels or rising And if our objective is price stability, then we ought to begin to pursue that objective aggressively  With respect to movements, and the size of movements in policy actions, I think there are several issues that surround this discussion One is the credibility of policy Policy credibility means that markets believe you're going to do what you say you'll do I find it difficult to believe that markets believe our rhetoric about price stability when the long bond rate is over 9 percent I don't know what happened to it this morning, but I suspect that if I were advising people in the market, as I did a year or so ago, I'd say that the economy looks stronger than I thought, and that we would see a    5/17/88  rise in inflation and, therefore, a rise in interest rates And I would expect the bond market to be selling off Back on the credibility issue if we move now, and convincingly, it seems to me that we will have a peak in interest rates that is lower than if we wait and go forward in incremental steps A second point about credibility is the issue of confusion in the public and, perhaps, in our own minds If we react with small moves to noisy data that come out monthly, then I think the public doesn't understand fully what we're trying to do More importantly, I think it convinces us that we have more ability to control economic activity than we really do I think monetary policy is a long-run policy, not a short-run policy So, I think the markets are not as unsure about us We have gained some credibility; and I think we ought to retain that credibility And last, I guess I ought to say, given the strength of my statement, that I prefer alternative D I think I'll end there  What about the 5 to 9 percent or 4 to 8 percent? Do you want to do that at the same time or not?  I just wanted to bring it up and make sure we didn't--  Can we poll for a $100 million over the next two weeks and then--  Of the voting members?  Well, I think the proposal deserves serious consideration I'm not wedded to the base itself Given the objections that some of the Board's staff have raised, I think the nonborrowed base would do the same thing that we're trying to accomplish I think what we're trying to accomplish with this kind of a proposal is to tie our hands, to some extent; and in doing so, I think we would give some assurance to the markets that, in fact, we will react in a certain way over time Another thing we need to address is that we would also have to make it public--if it's to work appropriately--to get the markets to do our work for us, as the market did when we had a nonborrowed reserve targeting procedure If we used the quarterly average approach, and it looked like the month or two coming in were going to push the quarter above that constraint, the market would perceive that and begin to push interest rates up itself So, [this approach] would allow us to curb the base growth I think we'd have an override of the FOMC, if conditions warranted We'd have to take an explicit vote and that has an advantage too If you wanted to make that tougher, you could require a two-thirds majority, or something of that nature, so that it would be a real constraint on us, a more difficult constraint  I would suggest, if we have some agreement on it, that we at least look at doing a monitoring of it, if not a range I know Tom didn't want to put a cone out there, but the market will very quickly draw parallel lines and also draw a cone You have parallel lines, which is basically what you're projecting as a range, and people will start in the middle of those parallel lines and begin to figure when the base is going to bump against either the ceiling or the bottom end So, I don't think it is going to be a real issue, whether we put a range in there or not I think the markets are going to interpret it correctly as a governor, if we announce it as such and  -20-    5/17/88  if we react that way So, I think there is some reason for us to consider this, and maybe even set up the monitoring approach as early as the next Humphrey-Hawkins [meeting]  But don't you think that if you had a constraint you'd get a different shape in the yield curve? Do you think the yield curve would look the same as it does now if the markets were operating with this constraint in mind? I think that's the point  And that's clear information The market is going to behave differently if it knows that constraint is there in terms of long--  If they believed that the base was a real constraint  I think Martha raises a good point It would give us a chance to take a peek at it when--  You're right  You would be losing half the power The power is the market's response to this rule, or this constraint, or governor, or band, or whatever you want to call it That's the power of it  But he did a lot better than when he first brought it up!   Is the perception by central banks that this is a technical problem, rather than a change in trade balances that is a surprise or a change in monetary policy?  Just a comment I guess I'd feel remiss, since I complained on the downside of the dollar that I didn't see the gains from intervention, if I didn't make the same complaint with respect to the upside on the dollar That's no criticism of the operation of your Desk, it's more a question about what we're trying to do with policy in terms of currency intervention My concern is as to uncertainty in the market rather than smooth outlooks and also that we might convince ourselves, perhaps, that we can do more than we really can do  Peter, have you heard much discussion on the street about a discount rate change?  What would you think the impact on the funds rate would be if the discount rate were to be changed?    6/29-30/88  Oh, the whole change would--  Let me start with the labor issue We don't have any specific information, at least that I've generated, on it But in the Fourth District, particularly in Cleveland and Pittsburgh, we have very large manufacturing firms where over a period of years  -28-    6/29-30/88  I've heard a number of them say directly that "We've learned our lesson with respect to wages and inflation and we won't repeat that mistake" I think that might explain partially why you see lags the way you see them People--labor and management--are still working in Cleveland to insure that they gain market share and retain jobs However, I don't think that can go on forever and we're liable to see a snapback rather quickly when we get to that limit But I don't have any information from these people that we're at that limit today I haven't asked specifically, but the fact that they haven't brought this up in conversations, I think, is indicative that they're not overly concerned at this particular point in time  Overall, the District continues to be very strong in capital goods and also very strong in exports The stainless steel strip indicator, which is something that I casually follow, was up around 35 percent in terms of new orders against a 5-year average in the last 3 months Lead times haven't lengthened, however The price increase in the last 18 months in that particular product has been 80 percent And exports in stainless, at least from this company, are up 65 percent So a lot of things are working now correctly in the District  Some aren't working out so well As in other Districts, retail sales seem a little softer and construction is softer I guess I'm a little uncomfortable in analyzing, or going through what seems to be kind of a Phillip's curve framework here, when we talk about resource constraints versus inflation I think Governor Johnson put it back on the track Our concerns, or at least mine, focus around the fact that we have had a couple of years of 4 percent inflation We don't seem to be making much progress toward [reducing] it And I think that's the real focus, at least in my view, for monetary policy As we look ahead, even the Board staff's forecast, with a substantial tightening in it, produces another 4 percent next year at the very minimum The Board staff's forecast on CPI ex energy and ex food is 5 percent So that leaves me with the position that says I think we have to be very concerned about inflation I don't know how much we may have to move again; I'm not sure how much we really have moved in the past 6 months I know where interest rates are, but I don't know how much the market did to put them there versus policy moves So, I think what it boils down to is that expectations are important for us right now And what we signal to the markets, I think, is important I'm not sure of the magnitudes that we ought to be signaling, but I certainly would err on the side of moving earlier rather than later So, I see strengths across the board but not a boom; and I do continue to worry about the errors on the international side being somewhat higher in terms of real growth than we think at this point in time  When I match up the Greenbook with alternative III, the implication under alternative III is that we're shooting for 5 percent M2 growth So the question is What is the Greenbook projection under that alternative?  Yes, I'm trying to match the two up  You have a midpoint of 5 percent and I'm asking what the Greenbook forecast would look like under a 5 percent M2  Because that's how the markets would translate  -36-    6/29-30/88  Well, alternative III doesn't achieve the objective that I'm looking for over time, which is to ratchet down the rate of inflation It leaves us with a midpoint that would be more inflationary than the Greenbook forecast, which is still at 4 percent So, if I were to pick a number, I would certainly look at something like 2 to 6 percent, to focus it around what is consistent with the Greenbook; and 1 to 5 percent might even be preferable If we are going to use something like III, then I think we ought to make it  -40-    6/29-30/88  explicit in your public statement that we are going to shoot for the lower end of that target range Otherwise, the implication is that it's 5 percent An alternative to that would be to narrow the range-- leave the bottom end at 3 percent and pull the top end down to 6 percent I can live with 1988 the way it is, but I think it's important to signal the markets that we're serious out in 1989 I think we'll get some benefits out of that without having to pay a price in terms of short-term interest rates  Are we voting now?  I'd come out for III if we could make either one of those two adjustments  Those reservations are on both the high and low sides  MR ANGELL [Laughing] Well, you mean just one!  Just for clarification Is that [telephone] meeting a conference or is it a vote?  Why not have a following discount rate move? If we believe the discount rate should be roughly in line with other rates, then we could probably get by with having it move up My concern is that if we move ahead on the funds rate and we leave the discount rate behind, it's going to get more difficult to raise that rate the further forward we go And I have some concerns that we're just dropping that rate as any kind of a useful tool at all  Yes, I'm ready I guess since a $200 [million increase in the borrowing target] made the markets happy, maybe we ought to consider that again! But I don't think there's much support for that To try to reduce inflation at all in 1989, I think we would have to move at least 50 basis points before the end of the third quarter That would imply a "C" path to me A trade-off obviously for the "C" path, given what Peter Sternlight said yesterday with respect to a discount rate move causing the funds rate to rise, would be living with a "B" path with a discount rate increase  I have some reservations similar to President Forrestal in respect to reacting, or appearing to react, to incoming information on an every two-week basis I think the market has been doing that and I think we should try to set a tone of a little more stability than that I also am concerned that this tit-for-tat kind of following market rates up may not get us out in front of inflation It's like trying to nibble it to death, it seems to me And it's not clear to me from our moves to date that we've tightened significantly If you look at the monetary aggregates, which is the point Bob Black made, you could make a case that we haven't changed much at all If you look at bank credit, we had two months of pretty strong growth relative to the last 6 months So, the concern would be that if the markets are moving rates, while we're allowing them to go up, in fact, we're providing more reserves than--  Yes It's just very difficult for me to untangle I think you understand what I'm concerned about--that it's not obvious to me that we're ahead of the game all the time So I guess my preference would be for "C" But I think if we were to move with the $50 million now and seriously consider $100 million if the data that you're concerned about come out to support that kind of move, then I could live with your suggestion  Yes  I would like to make just one comment We are always discussing this in terms of the risks of having to move it up another notch But we don't discuss the notion of suppose we went up to $700 million, would we be willing to risk bringing the rates back down? In that context, we're some times following I think if we thought about it another way and said yes, we can move it down as well as up--the idea being that maybe you do get out in front, and if you have made a mistake, then you'd be willing to--  He would have no way to communicate that, when he dissents on this How's anyone going to know why he dissented unless he spells it out?  Yes Well, you'd have to spell it out  Angels? Or devils?  Is it at $600 million with slight?   Mr Chairman, Lee Hoskins  First, I'd like to applaud your testimony, particularly the statements with respect to your definition of what you mean by price stability and what I thought was the tone that the risks are, if not definite, toward inflation But going from there, it seems to me that to stay where we are now is somewhat inconsistent with that view of the world I remember at the last meeting that we adopted the idea that we would watch for some new data coming out and the data have now come out But, as we look at it here, any particular weakening in the economy [unintelligible] There's nothing there that would cause me concern Again, I agree the complication is the exchange rate, but I don't know what is appropriate, and I doubt whether anyone around this conference call knows what is appropriate I guess what I'm saying is that I don't think we ought to gear policy to that [unintelligible] variable, even for a short period I reluctantly went along with waiting for new information at the last FOMC meeting We were talking about an alternative C there, which I was in favor of, and it was $750 million on borrowing and an 8 percent funds rate It seems to me that the information we have seen to date ought to at least validate where we are and where I think the market should be and move on toward the $750 million That would be my view [unintelligible]; we ought to be leading the market I think right now we run the risk of generating more confusion in the market by staying with the current borrowing target  Mr Chairman, this is Lee Hoskins I have a question on how we are going to [unintelligible] for a borrowing target or interest rates, in convincing the market that we haven't let rates fly back or--  That effect being a 7-3/4 percent funds rate?   I wasn't going to comment because I think my position on this is fairly well known But Jerry has raised the issue in the context, I guess, of orderly markets I'm not sure what a one- way market is other than the fact that people are bidding the price up or down on a particular instrument And I don't see this instrument as much different than any others We trust the markets to do pricing in general, so then I don't see why we have a particular problem with allowing markets to price currencies If it's an orderly markets argument, then it seems to me that we should come in when markets are presumed to be disorderly; and that means not very frequently If we are in all the time, then it defeats the purpose, it seems to me, of the orderly markets argument I'm not in favor of the orderly markets argument either I think there may be points in time when we would want to intervene in situations where there's a panic or crash Other than that I just don't see what we gain by it, other than getting a wider spread between bid and ask It seems that we are adding uncertainty to the market unnecessarily  I have one question Are you perceived in the markets as changing the way that you signal market participants as to where you want reserves or where you want the funds rate? Are you making a distinction between customer and System operations that is different? It seems to me, as I observe it in the newspapers anyway, that we are trying to signal more directly where we are with respect to funds  That kind of gets to the heart of whether we are focusing on borrowings or the funds rate and all that  I was intrigued by your comments about inflation and what might be necessary to get it moving in the downward direction In fact, your forecast does have it moving down and I think you have the peak in the fourth quarter I guess that prompts the question What kind of tightening do you have in mind in terms of interest rates?  The story in the District hasn't changed much There is still strength across the board in the manufacturing sector, so I won't bore you with the details of that What we've focused on, and what many of you have focused on, is what's happening in labor markets We have two areas where we have some shortages occurring right now One happens to be in the service areas, at entry level positions It's particularly bad in the Columbus area, which has had a very strong economy The second area is in the more skilled positions in manufacturing, and that's across the board in a number of different cities where capital projects are underway So, we are experiencing some labor shortages right now A major bank in the Columbus area is talking about total compensation increases in the neighborhood of 5-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent--I can't define it any better than that--because of the difficulties of getting people on board in that market and the rising wage rates at the entry level  -17-    8/16/88  In terms of retail activity, the Pittsburgh market has a 15 to 20 percent hike in wages for entry level people because a major retailer there is in the market trying to hire 1,200 people In terms of sales,  They've noticed a significant increase in what she would call back-to-school buying They would have expected about a 10 percent gain and what they're getting is something on the order of 25 percent Now that is firm specific, so there could be some things that have gone on within the firm generating that The only sign of weakness that I could find happens to be in a little stainless and steel strip indicator that I follow It's an index of new orders put out by one firm, and that's dropped significantly in the month of July What this seems to mean is that we haven't seen any signs of real weakness We don't have a boom but we have continuing strength across the board and some tightening up in labor markets  As we look at the national picture, we don't see it much differently than the staff, a little higher on the inflation side I think we have a little more in terms of the labor compensation built in than they do, but not a lot I think the risks are clear, probably not worth stating, but I'll do it anyway They're obviously on the inflation side at this point I don't think we've seen sufficient signs that our policies have impacted the economy Maybe there's a lag that we haven't seen yet--that they will begin to impact But I think we ought to gear our policy more towards the risk of inflation  I see commodity prices as having moved up more than Bob Heller does I look at the indexes in the Economist magazine and they're all up 20 percent or better versus a year ago  Well, [unintelligible] whether you're using SDR, dollar, or sterling index  I can't tell what's in it It just says all items, food, industrial  Don, I took it that the last part of your discussion, with respect to operating procedures, was [a suggestion] that we might want to discuss them So I guess I would like to make a statement about them in terms of my preferences There were basically three options that were laid out one is fed funds targeting; another is in between which is sort of half fed funds and half borrowings; and the last is straight borrowings target In my view I would prefer straight borrowings target if, as you suggest, we can live with it in terms of allowing the funds rate to fluctuate a little bit more I think there are disadvantages to doing what we are doing--that is, sort of half fed funds and half borrowing--because I do think it leads to some confusion in the marketplace If I had to choose between the three options, I would choose the borrowings target because I think it's the cleanest and it's the one that leaves us with the best chance to get back to aggregates targeting, if we ever get confident with using the aggregates But I would take explicit funds rate targeting over what we are currently doing, as long as we stay on what I would call an economic conditions kind of policy--that is, responding in the short term to changes in the numbers It seems to me we are much better equipped to do that with an explicit federal funds rate target But we have to be aggressive if we are going to move it and get around the concern that you had with that--that it gets too narrow on us And it has been  I, too, was surprised at the asymmetry in Don's Bluebook And I thought about it a little bit and I figured if he can get rid of "A" this month, he can get rid of "B" next month I don't have any faith in this trend  I think that kind of reflects my views on what we ought to be doing I think the surprises, just from six weeks ago, in terms of the staff forecast have been on the upside; we are very strong relative to where we thought we were Now policy is on the move I think the markets expect policy to stay on the move And I think that leads me towards a preference for alternative "C"  I would be much more comfortable if the economy had been growing at 2 percent and we were waiting to see the effect of our policy I don't think then it would be so urgent to move Jerry Corrigan made a point earlier that the inflation problem may already be there, in terms of rising I think he was referring to compensation costs So it seems to me important to try to keep the thing moving along I am sensitive to the issue raised that we have made major moves; and certainly people can disagree on the timing But as I listen to the concensus around here, at least to this point, very few have indicated that we don't need to move And I guess my point is we've started; we probably should continue So we could use "C" with asymmetric language going the other way which would require us to kind of gradually pull towards "C" and not go directly to that  What I mean is we would choose "C" but we wouldn't move agressively towards "C" until we got stronger, until we got more data in In other words, we have a commitment to be at "C" by the time we are at the next meeting--to a gradual tightening  Right So let me just finish off by saying I would prefer to move M2 up in the ranking   Let me just follow up on Bob's questions Since the last forecast session, many of the major economies in the world have had upward revisions in their real growth forecast for the rest of this year and also for 1989 I'm wondering, how do you factor that into your export numbers? Or did you?  Mike, could you refresh me on what the interest rate increase is--the assumption based on your forecast  The District overall remains pretty strong, particularly in manufacturing We have some slow delivery times in particular industries, and we have some price increases coming across, but nothing that startling at this point, particularly in the capital goods area Wage demands on the manufacturing side have remained moderate, but we're concerned that because of the strength in the service wage component--they're in the same labor markets--that in fact, they'll begin influencing each other and then we'll see sharper wage increases across the board than we're currently seeing Retail sales ex-autos have been flat and construction has been rather lackluster As you know well, our directors have felt very strongly about the strength of the economy, except that at the last go-around they were not quite as adamant, as you probably noticed; I saw some deterioration in their concerns about inflation Nevertheless, there's still great strength in the District  -20-    9/20/88  As far as the national economic outlook, I guess I really don't have much reason to disagree with Mike's projections However, if I were to estimate an error on it, I would say the error is probably going to be on the upside in terms of strength and inflationary pressures rather than on the downside We've seen the inflation rate move up a 1/2 percent or so each year And, as you know, that is the wrong direction from my perspective I think we ought to gear policy to that long-term objective, which implies we'd probably have to face more tightening--perhaps more than the staff has in place  I think if we're serious about the inflation objectives, over time we're going to have to face further tightening That's what I suspect right now There's been a flattening in the yield curve; there's been some improvement in commodity prices; and, I think that needs to be recognized But if I push forward, it looks to me like we've got more to do I am encouraged by the moderation in the aggregates relative to the past trend that Governors Angell and Heller raised I'd have a lot more comfort I guess if, when we did see the signs of inflation picking up, we could move aggressively But, I think, given the sentiment of the Committee, I can certainly accept your recommendation   This is Lee Hoskins I'd like to hear the language in reference to the Federal Reserve that's in the press release and also ask who's putting out the press release, as well as a comment or two on the extent of our involvement in these kinds of activities in the past--bridge loan activities And I guess, last, what has been the experience of the Treasury and other governments on some of these kinds of measures before? I'm just wondering if we have any way to gauge the success of those things It seems to me that they have not been all that successful long term  Well, my comment was not directed to non- repayments but was addressed--   I support the change for two reasons One, I came on at the time when targets had already been established, and while I didn't have major disagreements with the targets I feel that I [didn't have] much infuence over them Now, that's a small point The larger point is one to which you alluded There's a sense of accountability that gets attached to the targets when you do it I think people will feel more responsible, and the public will have a much better record [by which] to measure people and their performance So, there's some accountability with this proposed change that I would support  I don't have a question, I have a comment I commend the staff on the research It is cast in very familiar terms for me, and therefore I'm quite comfortable with it I see lots of P's, Q's, and M's, and V's I think it couches the debate, or the analysis, in the appropriate form for the long term, which is price stability If we simply look at our long-term targets that we internally set for next year, 3 to 7 percent, we can be at zero percent inflation with this approach by 1993 by moving targets down by one percentage point each year To make the test a little better, you took a look at actual M2?  And the forecast didn't have that So what you tried to do is to make the test a little clearer You used the midpoints of the target range, since that's the information the Committee had at the time, and it hardly did any damage to your results The root mean square goes up because of 1987  Just a follow-up comment on the comments you made in that I have a concern about it and that is we haven't really formally and aggressively targeted M2 so that the market believed it In that sense, over time you can say we had lots of different structural regimes and all that, but we never tested Goodhart's law We never said this is what we're going to do, and I have concerns that once we tell the market that this is what we're going to do, would M2 function as it has in the past? That's a concern I have  I agree  But if the markets see something in our directive, six variables that we're looking at, one of which happens    11/1/88  to be M2 and which we're not as aggressively targeting as we perhaps targeted the Ms in the early '80s, would we get the same result over time? I don't know the answer If we move forward with four or five things that we have listed in the directive as important to us, the market would say that M2 is one of them And you may not get that effect, but I have no way of knowing  Should we suggest a name for your grandchild? M2 or Base?  My concern is not a new one to this Committee, but I think it has been portrayed rather well in this last month We have been in on both sides of the market which gives an impression that we know what the right exchange rate is I don't feel comfortable that I know what the right exchange rate is, and I'm not sure anyone around this table does If Peter Sternlight were to go in on both sides of the market we might have trouble with that, although he does that on occasion when we ask him to I think we run the risk of setting up the public and ourselves for a nice fall in the dollar simply based on expectations If the belief is we're going to stabilize the dollar until the election is over with and [unintelligible] tell you about market reaction after the election My concern is broader than just that particular issue It's that by doing this I think we continue to confuse the public as to what our policy is all about and divert attention from our long-term objective of stable prices And secondly, I think we run the risk of confusing ourselves as to our abilities to influence exchange rates in an inappropriate fashion  I have a longer-term concern with this arrange- ment other than just the current bridge loan, although I have some concerns about that The Fed has swap lines with what, the G-10, BIS, Switzerland, and Mexico  Denmark Okay Then, I would say there probably are two outliers in that group--Mexico being a clear one The concern I have over time is that we're going in on these arrange- ments with an Administration--whether it's this one or the next one down the road--that is, through Treasury And it seems to me that over time, given I think what the paper pointed out that Mexico needs $3 to $5 billion per year for the next several years, with the drying up of private resources I think we could expect more of this kind of activity The concern is that we would be subject to being viewed as perhaps circumventing Congress by working more closely with Administrations down the road on this kind of activity In that sense, I don't think it's appropriate to continue those kinds of relationships because I think it risks the political independence of this body to some extent That's my longer-term concern As for the shorter ones, I'll wait until I see what you are going to put in your telegram  Given the national slowdown that we've been hearing about and also the third-quarter numbers, we tortured the anecdotal data as best we could and failed to confirm any reasonable slowing in the District The best we could find was a steel company that had gone off allocations to customers In other words, it was back to price and bargaining at that time  Pardon me?  Yes, I'm on manufacturing right now  I'll go to retail  Steel production in the State of Ohio is up about 9 percent in the last three months over a year ago Manufacturers are optimistic In terms of new orders they're still really quite strong Again, the District may not be typical of the nation as a whole Inventories are relatively low and the orders are strong In terms of hiring plans, there has been a survey that was completed recently within the District We have 19 out of 25 of the larger cities where we expect increases in employment Four cities that are strongest are the four largest, Cincinnati, Columbus, Pittsburgh, and Cleveland Retail sales [are up] probably about 5 percent over a year ago, but inflation in the 3 to 4 or 5 percent range leaves a very small real gain But that's not much different  -38-    11/1/88  from the way it has been the whole time So, really not much has changed in the District from what I've been reporting in the past even though we increased our efforts to try to ferret it out where we might be anticipating a slowdown  In terms of the national economy the only thing we might have to add is that we do have a panel of Fourth-District economists that meets quarterly Their only disagreement with the Board forecast would be on the implicit price deflator They are about 4 percent higher than the Greenbook for 1989 But again these are primarily manufacturing-based people who are looking at fairly optimistic sales projections  Well, I guess my views haven't changed much Although I do have concerns about what Governor Johnson discussed, some flattening of the yield curve, I think that does provide some    11/1/88  information Also, no growth in M1 and very low growth rates of M2 cause me some difficulty We ran the Rasche model and we got, using Board staff assumptions, 66 percent growth in the monetary base in 1988 and 54 percent in 1989 That gives me some degree of comfort that the policy path would not be abrupt Given where the staff has M2 growth near year end, and given that I think that would probably be an appropriate growth rate to see in 1989, I certainly can live with your proposal   I have the same problem--  Yes, I have a comment  I think that I share some of Tom Melzer's concerns about market interpretations of this I agree with you, though, that unless we're going to change policy we shouldn't be disrupted in terms of our policy thrust by some [disturbance] to the borrowing functions With respect to my concerns about the market, we could consider releasing this discussion with the minutes of the next meeting to indicate that we had some problems with the borrowing and that we did not do any easing--perhaps quite the contrary   Peter, I'm unclear how you decide how much to adjust in terms of borrowings versus how much to accept in terms of the rise in the federal funds rate on a daily basis One thing we could do is maybe have Don Kohn arrange for borrowings to hold a range for the funds rate But it's not clear to me when you decide to accept a funds rate and when you decide not to accept it  The disturbances or shifts seem to be larger in terms of magnitude more recently, which naturally raises concern about what do I look for going forward And during the time period in which we were setting policy, I think my concerns were the same as President Black's--that we were confusing the public as to what we were about, and certainly if we were to keep talking about reserve restraint as opposed to fed funds rates Somehow, I think it might be clearer if we did one or the other The flexibility, it seems to me, simply gives a perception, at least in my mind and perhaps for some others, that we are doing nothing but following market rates up and not making policy directly That is, we simply support whatever the market believes rates ought to be So, I guess in that sense I'd be happy to cut it one way or the other or to have a more formal agreement on what we are doing with a range for borrowings But if it turns out that the funds rate is what we ought to use, and if it has a wider band, I can support that position  But isn't a risk of what we are doing now that the band implicitly is getting narrower and that we are heading back toward the 1970s? If you did something like what Bob Black wants to do, and maybe Tom Melzer who would tie it probably to the base--  -12-    12/13-14/88  Well, it's not clear to me that the markets know where we are I think the markets pick out the rate that they think we are at, and then we allow ourselves to move to that rate; that's the way I read what's going on We figure out where they are; they keep trading the rate in a certain way; and if we don't protest it sufficiently, we finally decide, if nothing bad happens, to let the rate go to where the market sets it That seems to me to be the way we've been operating, and I don't find that exactly a comfortable way to be setting policy I think you ought to react to the markets, and you ought to understand what they are trying to tell you  I don't understand it We have a conditional directive, and if conditions work out that rates go up, and if the market does it before we do it, so what?  -13-    12/13-14/88  Well, my comments are really along the lines that have just developed here, which would be a notion of an alternative forecast or two It's not because there's anything wrong with this forecast; I happen to think it's a very good presentation, particularly looking out to 1990 and trying to address inflation expectations and the rest of the problems that I think all of us are concerned with So, I would be in favor of some kind of way to look at alternative forecasts I'd like to know, for example, if you've run the model and you've looked at the 1990 inflation rate under alternative interest rate scenarios We've got to know what the price might be to get a 1 percent reduction, say, in the inflation rate  I know you have  -32-    12/13-14/88  I don't think you have any need to be defensive I think the Committee generally has complimented the staff on doing those It's just that if you were to put out a new one, like for 1990, I think it might be interesting just to refresh us as to what that would be  Fine And I don't think any offense should be taken at these comments I think in general the staff has been very candid about their interest rate projections At least, we didn't seem to have much trouble ferreting out--  Yes, that's the second [unintelligible]  Can I finish up with this one? After that, I'm not sure I should venture back out here again! The model by its nature, and I guess the Greenbook as well, works off of an issue I raised before, which is kind of a [unintelligible] notion or a GNP gap notion There is an alternative way to look at this where we don't  -33-    12/13-14/88  have to say that 2-1/2 percent is the historical real growth, and therefore not an inflationary real growth rate, and therefore anything other than that generates some inflation We don't seem to be trying to take account, or perhaps we don't have the ability to take account, of changes in expectations about Fed policy or the credibility of Fed policy So, I'm a little disturbed when we look at resource availability as the only way to get at inflation I think we don't have a very good handle on that Some of us might have tightened very aggressively if we believed the actual [full employment] rate was 6 percent, which many people believed a year or two ago And it looks to me like we might have had a positive supply shock; we've got more labor at the same wage rate than some of us would have anticipated So, I'm just looking for ways to try to look at it without using the traditional method  Despite my carping remarks about using Phillips curve analysis, we've tortured the data in a number of ways and come up very close to what Mike does and we have no other way to do it except that I still am caught with the notion that monetary policy affects nominal variables over time and not real variables And I guess we can attribute this just to our short-term adjustment process  -43-    12/13-14/88  There's nothing that I can add to what's been said with respect to either Mike's forecast or the strength of the economy overall  The District, as I've been reporting consistently for over a year, is strong and we don't see any noticeable softening We don't see any breakout, however, either We have met with a number of small business groups and also with our directors and the stories there are prices increases in terms of product price increases ranging from 3 to 7 percent, maybe a little higher in a few instances Wage rates--our highest is probably around 6-1/2 percent in services areas in the Columbus market There is somewhat of a skilled labor shortage; semi- skilled, there's no problem Manufacturing people can attract the latter without any real upward pressure on wages except for the entry level in manufacturing where there is pressure in the low-skilled jobs So, it really hasn't changed much; it looks like a fairly robust Fourth District The only concern that I have relates to the the monetary base We take the Greenbook forecast and then get an implied growth for the monetary base by using the Rasche model It has a drop of about 1-1/2 to 2 percentage points from this year's growth rate I don't know whether that's significant or not any more I used to think I knew But it does cause me some concern So, I'll address that issue in more detail when we get to Don's presentation Overall, I think the costs of allowing inflation to become embedded in the economy are very high, and I would skew policy and take the risk on the side of being overly tight  Everybody wants it back in now, that's the problem!  I don't have the numbers, but I think the majority expect a recession within the next two years  We tend to roll those things forward  You want short rates at 89 percent, or something like that?  I just wanted to be clear on that Can I just ask a question about something several people have suggested already and that I agree with? The market expects some tightening, but we don't really have an estimate of what that is Don may be able to help us with that And a related second question is, to what extent is a rise in the discount rate expected in the market?  Alternative "gong"  Well, as Governor Kelley indicated earlier I have been an advocate of alternative "D" on various occasions We now have alternative "gong" which I interpret to be a discount rate move as opposed to "C" Not wanting to be the Paul Erdman of this Committee, I do have concerns along the lines Tom Melzer indicated But I think that Governor Angell's summation on the discount rate is the appropriate one So, my preference would be to do a discount rate move and adjust the borrowing targets to ensure that rates are where I think the market expects them which is someplace around 9 percent Your proposal, Mr Chairman, if I read it correctly if we do $100 million now and are sure of doing $100 million later I think is livable I have a comment on the riskless society Bob Forrestal indicated the fact that there are risks every place out there There's one exception, however, and that's deposit insurance I had to get that clear And, secondly, with respect to the point that Bob Parry made, I think that's an accurate observation I would suggest that if this Committee had acted differently in the late 1970s, we might not have avoided an LDC debt crisis but the magnitudes would have been a lot lower in terms of the outstanding debt, the problem that we are facing right now I would link that to the current context of the LBOs, that we may be building the same kinds of things right now with respect to LBOs And I think a signal by this Committee that rates are moving upward and we are concerned would be the appropriate signal to give  Well, one more clarification Your proposal is todo $100 million now and then take a look at whether we need to do another $100 million?  And that means that unless something of major significance happens in the economy or financial markets that we will do roughly 50 basis points either through a combination of discount rate or--   The fourth quarter in the Fourth District really was no surprise at all; it was similar to the rest of the year It has been a very consistent story throughout the year; our economy didn't slow much during the summer and it didn't slow early in the year Much like the situation in the unemployment rate there are [unintelligible] for all of them for the first time in a long time That means service jobs but some on the manufacturing side In discussions with manufacturers in the District we hear that they are operating at very high levels but are very reluctant to add new capacity They are willing to run with higher inventories because they are operating at levels that are going to result in more breakdowns But they are not ready to make the investments yet The only weakness in the District is in Cincinnati and that was the football team!  Pardon me?  We don't have much to say regarding the Greenbook forecast, which is very similar to ours, particularly for 1989 In 1990 we have a somewhat lower inflation rate than the Greenbook because we think a change in compensation practices as well as a continuous clearly announced policy with respect to inflation [unintelligible] As we look at it now, we think that will have some favorable impacts in 1990 and going forward [if we] can do what the Greenbook implies when dealing with interest rates  Don, in your discussion about the multi-year problem, which I think you laid out nicely in terms of whether we stick with 3 to 7 percent or go to something else, obviously there are advantages on both sides One is that we can march down the aggregates--at least the top end--consistently over time to demonstrate to people that we're serious about our policy But that doesn't fit very well with the interest-sensitivity of M2 these days You might want to argue that if we get [unintelligible] centering the 1989 target on 2-1/2 percent and going from 1 to 4 percent or on 3-1/2 percent with 1 to 5 percent and then next year having to say that it's going to go back to 3 to 7 percent or something like that--we have to explain that In that context, if we were to choose to go that way, did the staff consider going to multi-year targeting now instead of in July? We will do 1990, I think, in July So, if we were to go that route, it might make some sense to put out two sets of targets If we were going to go to one, would we adjust M2 to reflect the interest- sensitivity?  Don, I have a question about your earlier statement with respect to the credibility of Federal Reserve policy You said it was important that we have credibility and that we pursue it; you said that we probably gained some credibility along the way as judged by the financial markets I guess I have some concerns about not picking a specific objective over time My concerns are as follows and I'd like you to respond to them We are asking the markets and the public in general to trust us on two levels now on the objective and on how we're going to implement it We have an objective out there someplace called price stability that we may trade off against anything else at any point in time I think we might be able to increase our credibility to some extent if we could at least pin down the objective and then just ask them to trust us on how we implement it, because we're having trouble with the aggregates or interest rates or commodity prices  Just one other comment I think what Martha was alluding to, if I'm correct, was that we are not paying sufficient attention perhaps to the other parts in the Humphrey-Hawkins Act  I would say we're consistent with it If we pursue price stability then we will pursue maximum employment I don't see any inconsistency there  That was the reason I mentioned financial markets and the public  I'll say it now  Yes, I'd like to associate myself with the comments of Gary Stern and Bob Forrestal in terms of their preference for something like 2 to 6 or 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent I am troubled by breaking with tradition; I think tradition is important We've done a good job in terms of marching the upper end of the M2 range down year after year; I think there's a lot of value to that But in terms of the substance of policy, given where the staff forecast says we've got to go--and I concur with that forecast--then the range is skewed in the wrong direction I would be comfortable, I guess, with "III" if we were clear in the testimony that we were going to come out at the bottom end of that range And if we don't come out at the bottom of the range we probably will not have tightened enough  Point of clarification In terms of your testimony, if we opt to put in this 3 to 7 percent is it with no caveats? Or is the testimony putting in the table and then [saying we expect to] come out at the bottom of the range?  I have to ask myself, as I think everyone else around the table does, where the risks are in this situation What is it going to cost us two years from now if we make a mistake now? And is the cost greater for being overly easy now relative to being overly tight? I don't see one structural problem--in the Southwest or with the thrifts or internationally--that would be helped by having an inflation rate of 57 percent, which I think is the rate for the CPI, excluding energy, that Mike has in his forecast It seems to me those problems will be made substantially worse We'll have to move much more aggressively with much higher interest rates In my view, it would be simply a repeat of policy mistakes that we have made in the past It seems to me that we could undo the cost of being overly tight now relatively quickly if we needed to We can't undo the other It gets built in It's serious and it's unacceptable--not just in the sense of the current inflation What we're trying to do  -54-    2/7-8/89  is get the maximum output for this economy There is not a trade-off between real growth and inflation There isn't It's [unintelligible] in the very short run So it just seems to me that we ought to ask ourselves about those risks and then come out on the side, at least from my perspective, of moving away from the approach where the costs are enormous I think now is the time to move I'd be in favor of alternative C  I want to clarify that Is it a commitment to move in a couple of weeks or to reconsider in a couple of weeks?  SPEAKER(?) No, it's not  Can I clarify one thing? In the interest of institutional harmony, when we meet in two weeks will a vote be taken?  Well, end of the month   Sam, I'm just curious as to why we don't buy yen in the open market I notice a couple of other central banks have done so Do we have an agreement with them or--?  I'd like just one follow-up I raised the issue about the Japanese but I haven't heard what their argument is What did they tell us? Why don't they want us in?  Mike, let me ask you Governor Heller's questions perhaps in a different way And that is How would you assess the risks of forecast error with respect to inflation? Do you have a symmetrical risk on either side or are we more likely in your view to exceed it on the up side or the down side?  I'd like to just follow up Since Don raised it, I want to know what base growth you had to get 9 percent nominal  The Fourth District really hasn't changed much over the last year and a half that I've been talking to you about it It's very difficult to pick up any signs that we have a slowing in the area, either through casual observations, talking with people, or trying to ferret through the data What we did this time was to talk to a few capital goods producers, which includes firms like Westinghouse and Eaton Corp, and several other basic capital goods producers, to try to get a handle on whether or not they see any change in attitudes among the people they supply And the answer to the question is simply no Any weakness that you perhaps see in computers or office equipment is being offset, at least in the District, in very traditional capital goods The most optimistic person was a guy in the capital goods industry who estimates real [growth] for this year at 6 percent, fourth quarter-over-fourth quarter It's very difficult to find any signs of weakness in that Now, to some extent I'm a little surprised that we didn't find more price pressures developing than we did They all expect to be able to move prices up in the coming year but they haven't moved aggressively as of yet generally Order books are still good and lead times are in most cases lengthening rather than shortening So the picture for capital goods expenditures--at least what the producers in our District think--is that the outlook for them is quite bright this year, with really very few concerns about a slowing economy One or two raised a concern about that but they hadn't altered their plans for production  In terms of the Greenbook forecast and the outlook nationally, as usual I am chagrined that, to some extent, again we are pushing back another year any decline we are going to see in the inflation rate But that has been a continual concern I haven't seen us making a lot of progress in the last year and a half I agree very much with the comments made by Tom Melzer that we have done some things that are unusual One is the growth in total reserves Maybe Don can talk about that a little later; I don't know exactly what it means I know that it comes from interest-sensitive asset flows being shifted around But it seems to me if it's something that we ought not be concerned about at least we should question whether or not there's some significance to it in terms of the outlook The lag problem is always with us I presume Mike has built that into the forecast Now, I have no confidence that any other forecast is better than this one So, my concerns are the same as his--well, I don't want to speak for him I view the errors as likely to be on the high side in terms of inflation rather than on the low side I'll save the rest of it for the policy go-around  We think that more tightening probably is going to have to take place this year I'm not terribly concerned about the timing, provided that when we do--to reinforce Tom's point again--that we take a very credible action and to some extent lead market expectations at that point We take those actions and we explain them; we tell them what we're doing So, I'm comfortable waiting for a while But I am disturbed Again, many of us have spoken out about price stability; yet as we look at the forecast, we're starting 1991 with roughly the same rate that we have right now I think that's a concern  Well, I think we have to look into the future since, presumably, the lags are 18 months to 2 years or perhaps  -39-    3/28/89  longer And I don't know what else to look at If that's not our objective then I think we probably ought to talk about it   Sam, since our last meeting we have intervened in yen [Prior to] that time, I think, we didn't do that Do we have a change in policy?  Is there any discussion amongst the G-7 and your counterparts as to how much we're willing to do in terms of this intervention?    5/16/89  Just one more question, please?  In your discussions, is there any mention of the rates of monetary growth between the three countries primarily involved in this--that they have monetary growth rates roughly twice ours and that that might have some influence on it?  But it doesn't lead them to think that perhaps the way to rectify this problem is to slow the monetary growth rather than to intervene?  In fact, it has gone the other way  But it has relative to theirs If we have--  At the risk of being dogmatic, the reasons that we--or at least the Chairman--discussed had to do with going along with our counterparts abroad He also discussed the evidence that in large open economies intervention is not a very effective tool If the reasons we intervene are really just reasons of cooperation and not of trying to affect the economic outlook it seems to me that we ought to limit that intervention In other words, I think we ought to limit it and send a signal to our G-7 partners that we're thinking that they need to adjust some of their policies in a more formal way and speed the process along--in terms of making the monetary adjustments that you were talking about, Governor Angell But if we have this latitude they have less incentive to make those adjustments So, I think it depends on the reasons that we are intervening If you believe that it's an effective tool, then sure, go up to $15 billion If you believe that it is not effective--if you're doing it simply for cooperative purposes and you also want to send a signal to the rest of the G-7 partners to adjust their monetary policy--then I think you should not raise it  Well, you can also send the message to the Treasury  And one to stay at S12 billion  No  SPEAKER(?) I counted two noes  Peter, I have a question about the mix of outright purchases and repos during a period of heavy seasonal activity Would a larger volume of outright purchases rather than announced repos perhaps give a better mix so that the market has a better perception of where we are? I just don't understand how you decide that mix  Maybe this is better directed to Don but, given that interest rate forecast, what is the growth rate of M2 running at year end?  In terms of the national economy, I'd like to associate myself with Governor Angell's views on the risks with respect to the aggregates I think policy is tight as judged by the aggregates, perhaps appropriately so right now I'd also like to emphasize the point he made that even with interest rates being held steady, if the aggregates continue to shrink, [that's a] tightening of policy That's something that hopefully Don Kohn can relieve our concerns about shortly I'd like to compliment the staff, Mike's group, for putting right out front in the forecast what I think is realistic and appropriate, and that is that we could have a quarter or two of negative growth  In terms of the District--although I'm a little hesitant to draw conclusions from the District about national economic conditions --we see a rather worrisome trend It starts with the willingness of management, looking at Bethlehem Steel, to sign off on relatively higher rates of increase for pay--8 percent the first year, a 5 percent average over 50 months, and a 3 percent trigger on cost of living indexes, or COLAs We called a couple of other steel people  indicated that it was likely they would follow Bethlehem in a similar type contract Again, they're not at the top level said they would not do it; they thought it was a bad practice in that it was short-term oriented to avoid the strike but didn't fit in terms of the long-term health of the industry It's particularly worrisome for us because of our unemployment levels and also the tendency for some manufacturing to follow the steel model Now, unemployment rates are very low relative to where they have been in both Pennsylvania and Ohio There is a lot of tightness in the labor market Looking around the District, we had an Ohio manufacturing index that came out at 44 percent for the first quarter The only softness that we could dig up--and again we focused on capital goods and steel [producers]--was in certain steel products The stainless strip indicator that one of the companies uses is running about 20 percent below its 5-year average for that same time period, in terms of new orders  I was afraid you were going to ask that We haven't examined it as thoroughly as we should It's one of those things that I tend to watch The answer is that in terms of direction I think it has been all right; in terms of magnitude you can't read much from it So, it would tell me that the quarter should be softer than it would have been if the indicator were higher; but I don't know whether that's 01 percent or 2 whole percentage points But in March and April that indicator was running 20 percent below the norm We asked other firms, particularly the capital goods firms, about the impact of rising interest rates and it has been almost nil They have internally generated funds; they don't see a recession or at least sufficient signs of recession to concern them They're going ahead with their normal production plans So, really, the District continues in some sense to be an outlier; relative to what I hear around the table it has been strong with some softening in certain steel products That's about it  You want to start that again?  I think you've answered this question but let me put it forth one more time We usually hear about uncertainties around tax time--the seasonals, for example And yet the Bluebook seems to read with a degree of certainty that is higher than I would have expected that that was a factor in the slowdown in M2 You've answered part of it by saying you looked at the calendar--  Well, the thrust of the question really is the confidence you have in a bounceback  Yes, I bet on the Caps too, so--  They worked it out at the coffee break!  I don't think I can contribute much to what has been said here already other than to say that the long-term objective ought to remain consistent, and that is to bring down the rate of inflation The reason I gave Mike Prell's staff credit for putting the notion that we might have a recession into the Greenbook is that if we don't walk up and take a look at one we'll end up always having higher rates of inflation than we anticipated and, therefore, less output and employment than we expect Given the way we operate policy, I think we have to be prepared to face the possibility that we could slip, at least for a short period of time, into a contraction Having said all that, I am uncomfortable suggesting that we ought to ease at all I did dissent on the long-term target; I wanted it centered around 2 to 3 percent We're slightly below that right now Don Kohn assures me, however, that we'll be back on target shortly In fact, if we are, we probably won't have to tighten policy down the road So, my view would be to accept "B" I don't feel strongly about the language because I don't think the market will misinterpret  -46-    5/16/89  it The Humphrey-Hawkins report will be in front of them when that language comes out; I don't know what we're going to want to say at that point in time My bias would be to leave it asymmetric as we have been doing   I sound kind of like a broken record, I guess Inflation is too high and I don't think that it's coming down Nevertheless, having said that, I have more serious concerns now than previously about the rate of monetary growth So I would be perfectly willing to go with the Chairman's suggestion of waiting a few more    5/31/89  days and taking a look at the numbers again The reason I'm concerned about the aggregates is that with [a change] of this size--if in fact they are growing much slower than we think they are--then I can see a rather rapid [rebound] in the aggregates in response And I think that rate of growth would be inappropriate as well For consistency and, in a sense, trying to keep within some reasonable bounds in terms of rates of growth of the aggregates, I'd be willing to consider the Chairman's proxy   Sam, on the warehousing agreement When was that done and do we review it regularly at this Committee?  Is that ever questioned by Congress as a way to circumvent the limit that's placed on the [Exchange Stabilization] Fund?  It's reviewed and voted on?  I thought the limit was imposed by Congress    7/5-6/89  Then why do we have to go through a warehousing arrangement? You could just allow them to increase the Fund  There are other ways they can get Congressional approval for more money for the Fund I'm not asking anybody to do that, but it seems to me that to some extent we've got something out of whack here Either the Fund is too small relative to the size of operations we're currently conducting--  I understand that Well, let me ask you another question, Sam    7/5-6/89  Are they accumulating [unintelligible] now? Sam, is that sufficient?  Just a question It may be more appropriate for you, [Mr Chairman] It seems to me, if I've done my numbers right, that we have increased our net exposure some 50 percent in the last couple of months    7/5-6/89  That's about 50 percent So the question is Do we have any practical limits to the exposure that we want to take on in terms of US economic policy? Since the warehousing arrangement can be expanded indefinitely--  I see that differently I see we are not intervening in gold and in my view muddying up the water; we are intervening in currencies I'm just wondering How much would we do?  No, I'm not  How much are we willing to do?  But is there some limit where we will be concerned about it? If we doubled [our exposure] to $60 billion, would that call for being semi-concerned?  No, I'm not talking about capital gains  Well, for the second month in a row, I can report that [businesses in] the Fourth District are less optimistic than they have been for the last 18 months Having said that, overall they are still operating at pretty high levels of utilization of resources Nevertheless, there has been a slowing in the pace of sales, new orders, and even production We have things that were on allocation that are not on allocation now We have some, at least, not accelerating factors Overall, people in the District that we've talked to still expect the inflation rate to stay between 4 and 5 percent and to be relatively stable in that range Among those who are less optimistic, it will be no surprise to you to discover steel Their concerns may have evaporated in the last two days because they were primarily based on the idea that the dollar staying where it was would impact them--being a commodity-oriented business more than some of the others; they had concerns that the second half would be impacted by that level of the dollar Capital goods also are softening, but for different reasons There are cutbacks in auto demand and cutbacks in defense spending and those are cutting into machinery fairly significantly But the backlogs that are in place will carry people in terms of production and shipments pretty much through the remainder of the year There is one other point in the capital goods area [Unintelligible] continues to say that the export side has been very good, that the foreign investment boom is going to continue So they are looking for continued strength through the year in terms of capital goods Inventories overall are not a problem, but people are saying that apparel is starting to back up as are home building and materials a little But it is nothing that they are overly concerned about at this point in time They think there will be very quick adjustments before the situation could get out of hand  The price?  Wage contract?  That doesn't occur for USX until 1990, I think Everybody else is late this year, if I'm not mistaken  National has already done theirs  -25-    7/5-6/89 -26-  Everybody has started but USX doesn't have to face it, I think, until 1990 or 1991  The strike buying?  I'm not sure which--  In terms of the national outlook, we don't have a quibble, really, with the Board staff's projection I'm happy to see that we don't have accelerating inflation and I'm not very happy to see that we don't have decelerating inflation I am concerned that we think we can do more with demand management than we've proven to be able to do in the past through monetary policy And I continue to think that our long-term objective ought to be to get some more progress on the inflation rate than we're showing in any of the alternative scenarios  Listening to the discussion, I hear a lot of words about long-term price stability objectives I could have heard the same thing last year when I sat here The inflation rate is still up there; it's probably higher than it was last year at this time If you look at the Board staff's strategies for 1988 through 1991 there's very little difference in the inflation rate The average is a range of 41 to 46 percent whether we are tight, easy, or stay the same in terms of the baseline If you take the Board staff's baseline forecast and try to run it forward to see when we get to price stability, it takes at least a decade to do that under their baseline forecast Now, if that's the case and that's really what we're looking at, then I think we shouldn't kid ourselves that we're after price stability because we're not If we follow that path we're after controlling inflation at the current rate If we're comfortable with that then I think we ought to say that If we're not then I think we ought to do something more aggressive in terms of moving toward price stability, and that includes [going to] multi-year targeting so that we don't have base drift problems Otherwise, next year we will be at the same point with a different set of concerns about the short term and pushing off the long term So, unless we tie our hands somewhat-- like a portfolio manager at a bank might by requiring insurance against stock losses to be put in place--we're going to continue to drift with the economy and with the vagaries of international developments  So it seems to me that, at the minimum, we ought to go to alternative III, 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent, if the signal is important The idea that we might have to raise it--really, when you take a look at the half point differential, it's relatively small It's not likely that the difference between 3 to 7 percent or 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent is really going to cause much trouble But if we put any value on signaling, then we ought to go for 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent, because we're likely to miss that 1/2 point mark anyway and it's not a big problem for us I think this is a very important session for us every year because it's our only chance to look ahead 18 months And that's what it's all about That's the range in which policy is going to impact the inflation rate and the economy If we've been too tight in the past and we've made a mistake and the economy is already heading down--well, that's history Rushing into the breach now with lower interest rates is only going to produce more inflation down the road for us So, I think we ought to tie our hands a little with respect to long-term targets and we ought to have tighter targeting I'm in favor of alternative III  -41-    7/5-6/89  Let me just follow up on the one Manley asked earlier If you were to lower rates 50 basis points, you would expect M2 by the fourth quarter, or by December, to be growing at 8 percent?  I'd be very close to Bob Black's position As I listen to the comments around the table, it seems that there is a view that the economy is softening Certainly some indicators have [shown] that and some people are arguing that we ought to ease policy on that basis A one-quarter-ahead forecast for real GNP has an error of plus or minus 2 percentage points around it If you go out 18 months on inflation you find roughly the same error The only point I'm trying to make is that we seem to be in the business of fine- tuning; that, I think, has led us into some problems in the past If one is to support your proposition, I think the reason ought to be to ensure that we get Don Kohn's projected money growth for the second half While I prefer to stay where we are on the hope and prayer that Don's forecast is accurate, I certainly would be ready to bias [policy] toward alternative A if the aggregates didn't come through And I'd probably be more aggressive--along the lines of Martha's position  Isn't that what we've done?  -57-    7/5-6/89  My point earlier was if that's how it is, then we ought to start saying that  As opposed to continuing to say "price stability," if [our objective] is really to maintain current rates of inflation then we've got to be honest about it and say that If not, if we really mean price stability, then we ought to take actions to achieve that   Well, I think it was an appropriate request for information It certainly helped me to understand the history of this development in terms of the swaps and the Exchange Stabilization Fund and our activity over the last--well, I don't know how far back we go  I don't understand why we need to make the change in procedure now when we--  I just have one, Peter, on the size of the Treasury balances Does [implementing] that drain when it comes cause ambiguity about the size of our easing move in the marketplace? Have you had any discussions with Treasury about perhaps their changing the variability of their debt issues as opposed to their balances at the Fed? Or is that not really a problem for you?  That's not really a problem?  Issuing debt  I think that's what's--  That's what [Peter] implied    8/22/89  Offsetting errors?  How do the markets interpret it?  Thanks, Bob  In terms of the District economy, there is not a lot new to present here It is still operating at a very high level of economic activity but there are definite signs of some slowdown Let me give you just a couple of indications of what I mean by slowdown LTV, for example, now has many fewer flat roll products on allocation and lead times are much shorter There is a stainless steel [company], Timken, which had all its products on allocation during the spring and just about now has fewer of them and, in fact, is talking about potential layoffs later in the year if demand continues to go in the direction it's going I would add, however, that they have a contract that expires on September 30 So, I suspect that's a position rather than reality Westinghouse has very strong demands for the rest of the year for its electric utility industry There is a small motor company up there that sees decreases in demand I don't know how you sort this out Overall, the economy is really quite robust yet, but there are some signs of slowing The employment rate in Ohio is 54 percent; Pennsylvania is, I think, about 45 percent So it's still pretty strong and there are very, very few signs of weakness in any particular sector of the District  In terms of the national economy, we don't have much disagreement with the Greenbook The only thing that I find a little disturbing is the focus on our short-term outlook for GNP I continue to be concerned that if we fail to lift our eyes from that focus we will not see our price objectives through it In fact, we will always move those objectives back in order to assure that we keep the economy going So, my only concern is that we have no progress on the inflation front in terms of [unintelligible]  Well, we have a strong oversight over that  Let me say first that I think monetary policy that always attempts to pre-empt recessions is going to end up biasing toward inflation and lower output over time I'm afraid that our view around the table often expresses this focus on short-term GNP, which leads us in that direction Our ability to forecast real GNP one quarter out has an error of plus or minus 2 percentage points, which means that we are already walking on the edge of a recession as it is Our ability to forecast the inflation rate 18 months out has error  -44-    8/22/89  terms that are not much different and I think that's where we ought to put our focus So, I'm comfortable with "B," and I think it should be symmetric The comfort comes from the slowdown in the rates of growth of the aggregates over the last couple of years, but I have some concerns about their growth rates in the second half Last February the consensus that I, at least, drew from around this table was that we were supposed to come in at the bottom half of the range even though we didn't explicitly write that down So, I'll be nervous going forward if we see the aggregates coming in much above fourth- quarter-over-fourth-quarter rates of 3 to 4 percent One other question for Don Kohn, a side question If seasonal borrowing is a problem and causes us to change, why don't we think about either eliminating seasonal or at least pricing it instead of subsidizing it?   Where are we relative to our ceiling [on holdings of foreign currencies]? Do you anticipate our having to do more in the intermeeting period ahead in terms of raising the [$20 billion] ceiling?  Where do you stop?  Well, I won't go back to my objections to the whole policy because I've done that before So, let me start someplace else, and that is that in this room it seems to me we have some concerns about whether or not we're going to be hanging together in terms of making decisions down the road In the spring we had a dissent when we went to $15 billion Then we went to $18 billion and I guess now we're at $20 billion It seems to me we had two dissents on the last go-around So, I think that this issue is one that could divide this Committee and it's not the right issue to be fighting over The right issue to be fighting over is price stability; and I think most people in the room agree with that So, my only question to you--and I hope you do convey the feelings to the Treasury if that's really the sticking point because I think it's more important to have good relations on this Committee than it is with the Japanese, and I would cut it that way--how far are we willing to go in spending resources along this line? I'm sorry it's too far for me; but apparently we're not picking a limit We may go on up and I think that would be bad for this Committee--you'll get bigger and bigger splits  Or how much  Isn't that the question?  For coordination purposes I think we've always said--at least I've said all the way along that I'm willing to spend $100 million here and there but not $40 billion, $20 billion of our own We are beginning to talk about potential impacts on monetary policy and influences that are about to get negative on this Committee  It's an obligation we have already passed [on]  Just a minor one Would we have done outright purchases if we hadn't had the intervention?  Would that cause you any concern?  I just meant the substitution of the currency in the portfolio for coupons and bills  The District hasn't changed much since I reported last time We are continuing to have very high operating levels across almost all industries We specifically targeted capital expenditures this time to see if the presumed slowdown was occurring and at least from the anecdotal [evidence] the answer to that is yes Most of the firms we surveyed have orders to carry them through next year but there is a clear slowing in the order books for producers We still have a couple of geographic areas in the District that are really quite strong The Columbus area is one of them We are seeing wage pressures there Service-type industries will be looking at 6 percent increases in wages But overall, we haven't seen a major change Just to put it in perspective, Ohio is at about 48 percent  -30-    10/3/89  unemployment and I believe Pennsylvania is around 43 percent So, we've got pretty robust economies but they're not expanding at rapid rates And I think both [unintelligible]  In terms of the Greenbook, we have very little disagreement with respect to the longer-term outlook for real growth Of course I'm disappointed, as everyone else is, with respect to the inflation prospects In light of the discussion this morning and the alternatives shown in the price forecast, we seem to be working against ourselves When we tried to bring down the dollar it cost us a half a point out there in 1991, if I read the chart right So it seems to me that that's an issue that we have to grapple with at some point along the way I'm not sure I'm ready to grapple with it today after this morning's discussion, however That's all I have to say  Don, on your longer-term projections, I don't know what you're projecting for 1991 The Greenbook tells us we will    10/3/89  have 4 percent inflation or so in '89, '90 and '91 So, given the forecast for inflation, it seems to me that we're implying somewhat higher than a P* kind of M2 growth In other words, don't I have to see some 2-1/2 or some 3 percents, on average, over time to--  Can I follow up? The shorter-term problem, from my perspective and not obviously from other people's around the table, is that we're going to have a growth rate--going into the fourth quarter and starting the first of the year--of around 6-1/2 percent Isn't that kind of a speed problem in the sense that we are accelerating?  Okay  It's just a problem for me to look at M2 growth of 52 percent fourth quarter-over-fourth quarter the previous year and your projection of about 45 percent [for 1989] and now to see you project that M2 growth is going to go back up to 6 or 6-1/2 percent The argument generally has been that the cost of bringing it down because of interest sensitivity is too high--you get big swings in M2 But you can turn that around and say you can bring M2 down with relatively small swings in interest rates  My concerns, again, remain in the longer term, not this short-term consideration My fear in the longer term is not that inflation is going to get out of hand on the down side It seems to me that if it's going to get out of hand it's going to be on the up side That seems to me to be where the risk is trying to head off a recession that is not there will always bias us toward inflation and volatility in the inflation rate I would prefer the "B" path I'm not so comfortable that I'd want to tighten right now but I would have asymmetry in the other direction on the notion of getting the M2 path below 6 percent for next year  He just said as soon as possible  Well, I'd like to discuss that  What model are we going to use?  I never said I wanted to precipitate a recession I object  SPEAKER(?) That's why I said--   I have a couple of questions Did we intervene in support of sterling?  We did not That was [incorrectly] reported?  As an agent?  Is the Treasury involved?  This question may not be appropriate for you Did we disburse any of our funds on the Mexican bridge loan? Because it's being [unintelligible]--  It was already done  Okay  Sam, does the FOMC still review the Foreign Currency Authorization and Foreign Currency Directive in March?  Would it make any sense, since we have changed the rotation of Presidents' [terms on the FOMC] to January to do that review then?  We will do it in February?  No, we have [unintelligible]  The Fourth District is one of those Districts that has no natural disasters to report, although I know some of you believe that Cleveland is a continuing national--I mean natural-- disaster  No, natural disaster [That was a Freudian] slip Not a lot has changed We hear some of the same sentiments that you all have expressed around the table--namely, that there seems to be more caution expressed by business people but they can't find a lot of trouble right now in terms of their own businesses They are still making commitments and making some investments It's true that there is slowing in the growth rates of the order books, particularly on the capital goods side Just one piece of anecdotal information that came out of the who has a major contract RV type of business, [unintelligible] retail, and he had attended a group meeting of these guys that do a lot of this sort of stuff and they said that the year, in terms of dollar volume, is going to be up significantly So RVs seem to be continuing to move along, at least according to him It is true that our unemployment rate is up about a full percentage point--from under 5 to about 6 percent in Ohio Most of that, though not all of it, is just a slowing in the growth rate because we've had a very strong economy But there is no [sense of] falling off the cliff that we could find as we searched around out there People are pretty comfortable with inventories right now  In terms of the national outlook, we have no disagreement with Mike's forecast Now, I presume it's an unbiased forecast, which means to me that the errors could be equal on either side Mike can say it better than I can--and that is that given the current forecast, the error one quarter out on real GNP could leave us either at the start of a recession or could leave us in what we would call a boom So I guess I have some concerns that we're torturing our ability to forecast with this fine-tuning that we are doing currently With respect to Ed's channel, I think we must have made a mistake because we've gone through the wrong channel The channel that I thought we were after was one that was aimed at reducing the rate of inflation The channel we're in here, according to the Greenbook forecast, is one of continuing inflation at about the current rate So, I hope we can find our way to a new channel soon before we end up finding out that the inflation rate is actually accelerating  Don't let that stop you!  I'd like you to talk a little about why we don't have an alternative C It surprises me that the risks of recession clearly dominate the staff thinking relative to the risks of inflation Another way to say that is that to me it looks like Federal Reserve policy is designed to prevent the inflation rate from falling  Let me just follow up with a question about when you might bring it back in What are the odds that money growth will go to 9 percent rather than 7 percent? Or if it stays at 7-1/2 percent through the year-end are we going to look at "C"?  My only comment on where we are right now has to do with our experience when we attempt to prolong expansions and that is that will induce a recession at some point if we pursue that path I think what Roger Guffey has indicated, and Wayne did before, is right on target that where we are now is a function of what we did earlier If we were concerned about a continuing monetary policy mistake, then we ought to check the aggregates If they were shrinking or not growing then I would say yes, we ought to be easing because we're making a monetary policy mistake But in fact they are growing In terms of the proposal in front of us, I would again agree with Roger Guffey that given where we are there's not much choice I'd prefer "B" [Unintelligible] reminds us that there are two sides to risks in a situation; we ought to be reminded of that and take a look at that on a regular basis So, I think we ought to go with "B"    11/14/89  I don't believe in fine-tuning We've made the move, so let's live with it for a while   Yes Again, I think the staff did a good job in terms of laying out alternatives; let me compliment you on that And I also compliment you on that last statement because I think that's absolutely accurate We have poor tools and we do the best we can with them Several comments have already been made, most of which I agree with I think Manley was trying to get at the idea, and I share some of its content, [unintelligible] that the 1980 examples surely must be an upper limit to the sacrifice ratio, if you want to put it that way That's just an observation I want to make about it Now, I'm also struck that the [policy prescription] not only of a Milton Friedman but a James Tobin in the late 1970s and early 1980s [implied a] horrendous cost to keep inflation down for a very long period of time Again, not to be overly critical of these kinds of exercises, I think the staff itself in 1983 ran roughly the same kind of experiment here at the Board We looked back at that exercise and found that it substantially overestimates the cost--at least it looks like it does now--of getting inflation down So, I think we do run the risk of seeming to err at least on one side in these exercises-- unless you bought the full credibility model, in which case we'd probably run the risk of erring on the other side of it Having said all that, one observation I'd make, which I think Governor Angell was getting at, is that we are measuring the cost of reducing inflation If one is trying to make a decision about whether or not it's worthwhile doing, one needs to measure the benefits of having a zero rate of inflation--that is, in the next 5 years out or 10 years--and then compare that with the cost of the transition, because many of us believe there are some gains to maintaining price stability in terms of economic performance  Finally, I have a couple of specific questions and I'll just rattle those off 1) Why do international investors lose confidence in the dollar when we've stabilized it? 2) I'd like you to explain to me the relationship of real interest rates to the deficit And 3) I guess Wayne has already made this point, which has to do with oil prices; I would concur with his observation that in a price stability    12/18-19/89  case you're much more likely to have oil prices in real terms perhaps declining rather than rising  How real interest rates are related to the deficit and what economists might have to say about it empirically  I'd just comment on Mike's budget [response] I think that was a fair statement on the deficit You also mentioned the possibility of [spurious] correlations Some people argue that it may be the level of government expenditures that is correlated with deficits That's one source of it Another source would be a change in savings based on something like appreciation of the stock market    12/18-19/89  Let me ask you Would you want to stabilize the rate of inflation at 10 percent? Or zero inflation?  Let me just ask the question again, more generally, to anybody who wants to take it on If you were sitting in 1980 or 1979 and you were looking at the estimates that either Friedman or Tobin gave to Gary's point you wouldn't do anything to monetary policy because the costs would appear so high We are having the same debate now but we are looking at much lower costs So it seems to me that the benefits, whatever they are, of a price stability policy become even more important because the costs are a lot lower now than they would have been if we had to do this at some other point in time So I think we can trap ourselves with these estimates I don't know how they're going to come out I know what we've done in the past when we tried to do estimates; and what we've done in the past is overestimate the cost, at least in several cases that I've  -22-    12/18-19/89  looked at So I think we have to be cautious about just saying the costs are high and the benefits are uncertain It seems to me that we ought to look at the benefits and one, of course, probably has to do with uncertainty premiums built into interest rates That presumably could be modeled We could have some impact that would reduce whatever uncertainty premiums were there There are a number of other potential benefits and I don't want to run through them now I'm sure the staff is aware of them, but they are also aware of the difficulty of putting your arms around them  You feel strongly about that Wayne!  I probably should start with a disclaimer that Wayne and I didn't get together and have a coordinated statement here With that in place, let me start out by saying that we are a central bank and if we don't speak out for price stability I don't know who is going to do it The integrity of the currency, whether it's a reserve currency or whether it's our own domestic currency, seems to me to be an extremely important matter If you want to say it's a moral matter, I'm comfortable with that as well There was a Governor here, Governor Wallich, who at one point in time made an argument, if I can paraphrase him, that a society that allows for inflation is a society that lies to its people I think he made that statement, and some of you may remember it, in this Board Room And I don't think that's [in]appropriate at all One point is that if the public isn't comfortable with lower rates of inflation, then it's incumbent upon us to do the educating because no one else is going to do that With respect to this idea of zero inflation and some definitional problems, I admit that they are there I think Governor LaWare said it very well that there may be improvements in quality that we need to capture But saying that implies that we know what those might be--1 or 2 percent it seems to be We could work to adjust the price indexes to take account of that just as well as saying that we can allow 1 or 2 percent inflation The zero inflation concept, at least as I understand it, really is tied to a price level Without the  -39-    12/18-19/89  price level tie you have no anchor I think that's the same thing Governor Angell was saying It isn't mechanistic; it doesn't say that we have to react quarter-by-quarter or even year-by-year to a particular set of circumstances that cause inflation to rise What it does say is that over time--and I'm comfortable with your definition in the Neal Amendment--that the price level really shouldn't rise That implies some declines in the price level as well as rises And that gets at your question about shocks; I would expect them to be on both sides Over periods of 5 or 10 years under a zero inflation policy, which is really a price level policy, I would expect that we would have a stable price level  I think the Chairman answered that in the sense that we have to decide what kind of shock it is If it is a drought, I wouldn't do anything I don't see how anything would help We expect offsetting results on the other side of that With an oil price shock, it depends on how countries respond to it That is, if they accommodate it--and this Committee at the point in time of the initial oil price shock, if I remember correctly, decided to partially accommodate it--in order to lessen--  Yes  Let me finish off, then I would see us making the same kinds of decisions and struggling with the same problems that we struggle with now, except we would have a framework or anchor point that we were working against out there That's the advantage that I  -40-    12/18-19/89  see, though I don't see this as being an automatic process There are uncertainties and judgments that we're all going to have to engage in but we would have a frame of reference And all I meant by zero inflation policy was essentially to anchor ourselves to a price level out there some place in the future The last point I generally believe that people operate more efficiently when they have more information, which is the point that Gary Stern raised I think we ought to be perfectly candid and tell people what we think the consequences of our actions are going to be; and I'd indicate that there are circumstances in which we could get thrown off our path temporarily, but that we're after this objective over time So to answer your questions Yes, I would prefer the price stability objective; and I think the time frame is important because it is a way of providing information to people I don't know the magnitude of that It may be closer to where Jerry thinks it is--not worth much, but something--or closer to where I think it might be, which is worth more The third question that you raised was Is there something different about a 4 percent rate as opposed to a zero rate? I think there's a qualitative difference because I'm anchoring it to the price level If you're taking 4 percent, or even a low rate of 2 percent, you're arguing that there's some kind of trade-off there And if there's a trade-off there, then why don't we just pick 4 percent? Or maybe a circumstance will come along where 6 percent looks good I don't think that's an appropriate thing to be building into people's planning horizons I've said my piece  What I said, Martha, was that I think it's incumbent upon us as central bankers to educate people to the value of stable prices On this other point that has come up a number of times about our credibility and that we run a big risk of loosing it if I read market yield curves correctly, I don't think we have it to the degree that we might The markets are not telling us that they believe right now that we want price stability It seems to me that they are telling us we're going to have 4 or 5 percent inflation  I think the political issue is a troublesome one and it's clearly reflected in the views that people put forth around this table this afternoon But I look at the problem as one of changing the attitudes This is a democracy, as Ed Boehne indicated Democracies learn and they do change I think it requires us to have character, will, and resolve; it requires us to have some leadership Five years ago I wouldn't have guessed that we would have an amendment or a joint resolution even proposed for zero inflation So, things do change over time when people pursue them aggressively Five years ago the sage advice was to live with the Iron Curtain the way it was and to accept that compromise We've been surprised, I think, by the rapidity of change that has taken place there So, I'm not willing to say we can't change things because we don't currently have popular support It seems to me that it's up to us to make the case for it I think a lot of good ideas have come out The Chairman testifies regularly and has stated that price stability is the objective I do not see inordinate attacks on him by Congress when he's up there I read the testimony and I just don't see the vehemence In terms of practical things that we might do, one thing is to expose our ideas directly to Congressional people I have been called in to meet with a Congressman or two with respect to my views And while they just don't jump over to my side of the fence at the end of the half-hour meeting, at least they see that we have concerns and that we are not uncaring people and that we may have some worthwhile arguments I think we can do more to make our case than we have done and I think we ought to do that  That's what I meant  Nothing wrong with the truth  In regard to your dealings with the Treasury, doesn't the current limit give us a little more leverage with respect to arguing that we shouldn't be intervening?    12/18-19/89  That was essentially what I was going to say I don't think it's appropriate to tie Sam's hands on this one If in fact we're going to have a full discussion down the road as to [the role of] our agency and the principal function with regard to the Treasury, I wouldn't want to see us stay in a mode of going up a notch here and there without ever questioning why we're doing it in the broader perspective--particularly when we're at this magnitude I understand your argument for coordination but that doesn't seem to me to be an argument for $20 billion of Federal Reserve or $40 billion [total] of US [participation] I think we ought to visit that issue very carefully--that's the intent of the study--and [for now] I think we ought to pass on Sam's [recommendation] and get on with it  Yes, but the question is magnitude isn't it?  How big do we want it to be? The bigger it gets the more that becomes a policy variable that I think is an inappropriate one It takes our eye off the domestic economy and it takes our eye off price level stability  I understand Sam's problem now; I don't have any problem with that But I think we need to revisit the issue of why we do foreign exchange market intervention and, in particular, the size of that intervention  On this last discussion, I think Mike was right to say one should not focus on the quarterly numbers He has to focus on them because we want to see them I don't know what the bands of error are around this, but I think somebody ran off a staff forecast yesterday that indicated the errors are really quite large one quarter out So I think that was an appropriate comment Also, having been in the business of forecasting quarterly numbers publicly, that's a very uncomfortable [position] People ask you for those numbers but in fact you don't have great confidence in them If your error--  The second point on the issue we're struggling with on the autos In a policy sense, is this a structural problem as opposed to an aggregate demand problem? I think that's really where you're heading with it and my comment is that it is pretty hard to sort that out right now Let me go on to my question, which like  -72-    12/18-19/89  Manley I think I know the answer to, but I'll ask it anyway As Wayne pointed out yesterday, we've had over 30 months of fairly reduced monetary growth--4-1/2 to 5 percent using the projection that this year will come out at about 5 percent Many of my monetarist friends argue that the inflation rate is going to come in next year at less than the consensus forecast They are not using structural models The question to you is this Is the probability equal in terms of the errors on either side of your inflation forecast or do you believe the probability is higher one way or the other?  Is that running it with that 5 percent or 6 percent?  For the first three quarters of the year the District really did quite well, as I have reported to you all along Since that time it has slowed but it's not shrinking at all with the exception, of course, of auto-related activities and some construction-related activities There hasn't been a major downturn in any of the industries to the extent that it has caused people to say "We have a major problem on our hands" Services continue to grow in our District By cities, Cincinnati has relatively strong growth; Columbus is probably next in line; Cleveland is close to being flat; and Pittsburg is flat Now, just so that you don't think I have reported this District as being extra strong in order to influence [others toward] my policy position, I had a witness at our last board meeting to hear all the branch directors speak That witness was the Chairman I think one might categorize their statements as rather sanguine about the outlook So, the District may be somewhat peculiar in the sense that to the business community things may seem to be softening a little but not sufficiently to generate major concerns for them  In terms of the national outlook, I think Mike's guess is as good as anyone else's with respect to the course of the economy and I don't really have any major disagreements with it My only concern is that we may focus overly on a particular quarterly change I think that the economy needs room to make those kinds of changes before we do something with respect to policy I expect variations quarter-by- quarter  Relative to your projections in September what are the aggregates running? What were you forecasting in September for money growth for this three-month period?  Do you have any feeling as to why it's running above?  Yes  Just one more It's my usual fragility question, Don Aren't all the rates you've shown in all the alternatives, carried out, consistent with perhaps some acceleration in inflation over time rather than--?  Yes  No, you understand the question The question is if we were to continue at these current rates--  Into '90 we'll have a problem  But without raising interest rates you expect [growth] to slow to 6 percent?  Listening to the comments, it seems to me that in some cases we have forgotten yesterday's meeting It's like micro and macroeconomics they don't seem to be linked up, at least in the text books So, I'd like to start where I think we left off yesterday with regard to the comments around the table when we talked about price stability There are some who want zero inflation and there are others who want one or two percent inflation And I don't see us moving in that direction with the current recommendation on the table Our goal is a long-run goal to provide price stability I think policy is a long-term instrument to achieve that We know the economists and policymakers can consistently predict business cycles We look at the forecast; we have no recession now in the forecast and I don't see any reason to second guess that What disturbs me a little is that to some extent we're following the same mechanisms that we followed [unintelligible] absolutely have to react on the other side Now, maybe we're a better body than those people who made policy then, or maybe we've learned some more and we can continue to use that mechanism but do it better I think that's what people are trying to argue around here I'm not so confident that we can do that With respect to the political issue, I look back five years and we've had five years of what I would call stabilizing the inflation rate Certainly during that period there must have been some windows of political opportunity to move down and yet we have not done that in terms of the inflation rate I think it's important to recognize the growth rates in money Somebody like Ed Boehne recognizes [unintelligible] hasn't been out hammering out money continuously I take note of that I just don't see the political argument as persuasive; I think it has as many traps and pitfalls for us as it has at any other time I find all the growth rates a little too high in any of the alternatives But if I were to [choose], my recommendation would be for alternative "C"  -97-    12/18-19/89  I would support Governor Angell's  I would agree with that if we get the order right  Put the word "long-term" in there, then   Where do you put Senator Moynihan?  The fact that you're using high employment--  We have a forecast that's slightly stronger than the staff's forecast, particularly if the current monetary growth rate of M2 remains near the upper end of the range for the rest of the year Around the District the slowdown in automobile production obviously has hit us fairly hard, but it has not spilled over into anything that we can find We're also fortunate to have some transplants that do quite well in the area Capital goods and capital spending are on a solid growth path according to our contacts-- companies like Timken, Eaton, and Inland Steel Our stainless steel measure that is drawn from the orders for stainless steel strip which goes on all consumer products is below last year but higher than the company expected So that has turned up even though it's still at lower levels than it was last year at this time And steel producers say that first-quarter orders have picked up even from the auto industry I'll mention another set of forecasts, for what it's worth We have a Fourth District round table meeting quarterly, which involves economists from the financial as well as the manufacturing sectors, and their outlook for real growth is 21 percent with essentially the same monetary policy as in the Greenbook  For all these reasons, we think the risks remain on the high side of the outlook for 1990 Having said that, and taking account of Governor LaWare's and others' concerns, I remind myself that the forecast error of plus or minus 2 percentage points is certainly enough to result in a recession, given the Greenbook forecast So, I share the concerns I also share Bob Black's concern that we have made no progress with respect to inflation And I think we should keep that in mind when we set the targets tomorrow  In terms of long-term strategies, I'd prefer strategy II or something better--or tighter, should I say  Mike Prell might point out that in these long- term strategies that we're looking at, we're talking about a percentage point difference in the three strategies And that probably is well within our ability to miss I understand what the staff is doing They are trying to be reasonable because we're all reasonable people around the table But as the Chairman has indicated, probably none of these outcomes is what we're going to achieve I might suggest that we be unreasonable once in a while and look at what could happen and take a tighter policy to get to where we say we're going to go, or we shouldn't be saying it's where we're going to go And I don't mean zero inflation There are many people who don't want to be nailed to that cross and I understand that But I do think the statement that Gary Stern made is an appropriate one, at least the way I interpreted it You may have to clarify this because I interpreted what you were saying as something different than Dick Syron said, and that is that you're not comfortable with the progress in this scenario--that you want lower inflation and we have not made any movement toward lower inflation  I might also point out in terms of long-term strategy that the only one that has 3 percent growth in 1994 for the real economy happens to be the tighter policy And isn't that where we want to be? In some sense it seems to me that a tighter policy over that 4-year period or 5-year period is really what we ought to do We averaged 46 percent monetary growth in the last three years I don't see any reason why we should raise that in the next 3 years or 5 years, since that would be giving up some gains that we fought pretty hard to get As I look at what has transpired in macro-economic theory in the last 20 years, it seems to me that the one thing that tends to come out is that policy ought to be predictable and it ought to be credible I don't know what else we can say about policy than to make it predictable and credible And it seems to me we're trying to do this backwards We're trying to say let's get lucky and have the monetary growth rates fall out low and then we'll move our target ranges down to match it That to me is not predictable and credible policy  Just as a side note As many of you know, I received a letter from the ABA group of economists that suggested we have a range for [M2] of about 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent So, I don't think the markets will be unduly shocked if we come out with a range of 2 to 6 percent    2/6-7/90  I understand All I'm suggesting is that there are some people out there who happen to believe that a predictable and credible policy might be important In terms of the alternatives, I would like to see a 2 to 6 percent growth rate for M2 I don't care about the other two, ie, M3 and debt  He wants a straw vote  Bob raised my question in part, but let me rephrase it If we were centering our ranges for the year, that would imply a 5 percent monetary growth What kind of interest rate increases would we have to have to generate that?  Yes, I agree with your analysis of the problem That problem is, if I read your analysis correctly, that we have a real economy that looks like it perhaps has been through the worst in terms of the numbers that we're reading, and that we will get the growth that Mike and the rest of the Committee essentially forecasted yesterday I also agree that there's fragility out there We hear the same stories that were repeated the other day about credit rationing, and people want me to express concerns in this meeting that something is going to happen in 60 days unless the banks start lending again [That type of comment] comes in a lot So, I agree that there is fragility But I don't think we can deal with that concern as  -49-    2/6-7/90  directly as we might want--or at least that's my view I think it depends on the measures of policy that one uses If you argue that interest rates are the measure of policy, then I think your analysis is appropriate; that could upset the wagon If you argue that the measure is stability in monetary growth rates over time, then I think we're running the risk of upsetting the apple cart or the wagon by allowing M2 to grow 6-1/2 percent for this year It has been averaging 46 percent for three years It seems to me the midpoint of the target range was about an appropriate place to be Now, I don't think we can get there by raising rates 150 basis points now because I'm not willing to run that risk But it seems to me we need to indicate to the public that we want to make progress toward reducing the rate of monetary growth closer to the midpoint So I'd be comfortable if we could make some moves in the front half of this year, maybe 50 to 75 basis points, that would produce a slower growth rate in the second half of the year And I think the strength in the economy, if I remember your forecast correctly, is in the second half  They average the same So, we run the same risks in terms of weakness, I suppose But we might have a better grip, certainly, by then on the fragility issue So, I think it really boils down to what our measure of policy is here What do we think is driving us in terms of economic activity? I tend to come down on the side of monetary growth rates, so I would be in favor of alternative C  Will the papers be distributed before?  Yes, I know  I think the answer to Ed's question depends on what is in or not in the papers   Peter, I was interested in your comments on Drexel In particular, do you sense any change in security firms' behaviors coming out of the Drexel [situation]? Secondly, do we send any different signals to primary dealers now about how they manage their affairs or--?    3/27/90  Have we done that? Have we pulled a primary dealer?  One of the arguments bankers use on that is that they have commitments and that once you're in, you're in--you have no way to get out So they keep putting new money in, and we won't see the real impacts of this tightening--  Yes, until what's in the pipeline dries up John might--  I'll ask Mike a timid question We've had a pretty big surprise in terms of increases in the inflation rate--a full percentage point since the last meeting on the CPI as well as the fixed-weight If we were to look at a simple forecasting model, not necessarily a judgmental one, wouldn't a surprise like that tend to be built into longer-term inflation rates? I'm just wondering--well, I'm asking that question of you But secondly, I'd like your judgment about the issue that Wayne has raised Even though you haven't done an alternative forecast, there may be some expectational effects from moving early and small as opposed to moving later and large I think that kind of gets at Wayne's question I'd just like to hear your observations on the latter and also your comments on what simple forecast models would do, given a surprise with respect to long-term inflation  Well, I'd just like to compliment you on the boldness of your answer to the previous question, which I think was appropriate That is, if you look at this Committee and try to deduce what it's going to do, I don't find anything wrong with your Greenbook projection  In the Fourth District, the pace of economic activity is continuing to improve in almost all sectors Manufacturing employment now is back at its highs of mid-1989 A lot of that--about half of it--is auto-related, which had a pretty nice bounceback In terms of auto production, everybody who has been on layoff has now been recalled, essentially  No, I said manufacturing It has come back to its 1989 highs and about half of the rebound that we got recently was due to auto-related manufacturing  -30-    3/27/90  My infamous stainless strip measure, which has predictive values slightly worse than the leading indicators--the direction is right--also has slowed fairly sharply It had been reported at 20 percent below its seasonally adjusted levels in terms of new orders and now it's running about 5 percent above that Price increases in that industry are likely to be forthcoming, given demand and the potential for some backlog In terms of anecdotal information, the only good news I could dig out was that [BP] and Marathon think that inventories are going to be high and that going into the second quarter we will see some price reductions in petroleum products  With respect to the Greenbook, as I said before, given the implicit policy assumptions I wouldn't have much disagreement with it I have trouble with the policy assumptions that are in there My concerns stem from the issues of inflation and inflation expectations If people do begin to build this kind of inflation expectation into their decision-making, then we will pay a price in terms of lost output when we finally have to bring the inflation rate down So, that's something that I certainly would want to consider in setting policy this time  Don, to link your story up with Mike's We have an increase in inflation even in terms of the Greenbook forecast, and my question revolves around the issue of how much of that increase in interest rates of 1/4 point or so over the last quarter you would attribute to inflation expectations versus real What I'm really wondering is If it is expectations about inflation, to keep policy neutral wouldn't we have to raise interest rates 25 basis points?  If you answered the question "Yes, it's all inflation expectations," then how would you answer the second part of the question? To keep policy neutral, what do we need to do?  Is the agenda here to go through Ted's four policy questions, which I thought were quite good?  Well, let me just start where I think Ed was going There are a number of points that could be raised around the issues that Ted put down; we probably ought to discuss those because I think they're fair and to the point I suppose one response to Ed's statement is that we did approve those limits regularly, and there was some protesting along the way occasionally But sooner or later we found ourselves in a situation of [spending] $20 billion And I'm uncomfortable with it, as Ed is, for some reasons that are political I think it attracts attention And I think we ought to ask the question Does it allow influence by the Treasury on us because of that relationship? I don't know the answer to that but that seems to me one question that we ought to deal with Ted started off with the [question as to whether] we should be doing it for our own account It's one thing to execute [transactions] as agent [for the Treasury]; it's another to give tacit [permission] to manipulating or trying to maintain exchange rates  I don't disagree with what you said, but the balancing wheel this time seems to me to be in order of magnitude completely out of proportion to what we've done in the past It's roughly four times the level relative to our portfolio that we've experienced  But you can only relate it to our portfolio because if you're looking at channels of influence, it's true we can influence the Treasury But the other side of that coin, it seems to me, is that Treasury can have some influence on us One of those influences might have been that it had to get very large before we got our backs up  -49-    3/27/90  No, they can influence us in the size of our foreign currency holdings  SPEAKER(?) That's a separate issue  It's not clear to me in what other ways, once we have a position of that size Could we be influenced by a potential loss in that and would we adjust policy in order to avoid a potential loss? It's just a number  But it is extraordinary relative to our portfolio  SPEAKER(?) To our portfolio  If we continue to intervene, that's true  There's another issue here it seems--  May I ask a question? You asked me before about policy and how we could be impacted by this When you read the newspapers or listen to the discussion this morning, there is an expectation that the Fed won't tighten because of dollar concerns-- that is, that the dollar is getting too strong We heard it at the table to some extent just this morning Suppose we have an increase in the inflation rate like we've had and we continue to have additional increases and we continue to say that we're supporting the Treasury in terms of intervention? It seems to me that we'll have no credibility at all At what point do we decide to fight inflation here? The yen may continue to fall even if our inflation rate rises, even if they raise their interest rates 100 basis points We don't know what's going to happen there And I think Wayne's point is right about separating ourselves to some extent from the process because then the expectation is that we run monetary policy--that the Treasury may intervene, but the Fed will fight inflation when necessary  I'm sorry to interrupt  I don't understand that, Jerry  But maybe the evidence is that by our being [reluctant]--  --that Treasury won't do it  No, there were some--  It's not sterilized  As opposed to holding it down?  My views on this issue won't come as any surprise to you or to the Committee I was concerned about the level of both our warehousing and also the Exchange Stabilization Fund when we hit $10 billion It may come as a surprise to you that I do have a pragmatic bone in my body I am willing to suggest that there is some level at which we should cooperate with Treasury and be involved However, the level has gone beyond the bounds that I'm comfortable with in either case I voiced the concerns when we went from $10 to $12 billion and from $12 to $15 billion and then from $15 to $20 billion or wherever it went along the way And now we're going to $25 billion And much the same arguments were made [each] time as to why we were going up and the necessity of going up My concerns are that  -76-    3/27/90  we'll be here for the October G-7 meeting and we'll be talking about a $45 billion Exchange Stabilization Fund limit And it seems to me that where this [discussion] started, at least the way I interpreted Ed Boehne, it's the size of our involvement that attracts the attention and that we could probably get away with cooperating with the Treasury at a much lower dollar figure So, my concerns are in a sense political concerns [unintelligible] surrounding the sheer size of what we're getting into and the likelihood of that unless we get lucky and the dollar goes the other way I suppose that's not lucky for some people--sorry, Wayne--that we can wind it down and use that "stuff," to use Gary's word I just think it's a matter of facing up to it either now or later in terms of the crunch with Treasury I prefer a Treasury/Fed Accord II now rather than down the road when in some sense we're already implicated in this process of, to use Wayne's words, appropriations around the Congress And as Tom Melzer said, [we are charged with] responsible management of our assets and accountability to our directors So, I am not in favor of increasing either one at all I don't want to tie your hands unnecessarily I suppose a way around it would be for some indication that we will wind this thing down over the course of the next year But, given what you've said, I think the Treasury would find that totally unacceptable and threatening  I don't find that attractive but what I'm saying is that we did the $45 or $50 billion and at what point do we draw the line?  Just one more technical question, I guess to Peter  If we increase the warehousing limit to $25 billion and we use it, what do you see in terms of collateral problems?  We'd collateralize with foreign currency  The risk  We could also use it to argue that we know right now that we're going to exceed our collateral in terms of the securities, and we will be going ahead and using collateral in the near future and that may or may not be acceptable to Congress, so perhaps we should not do that  Because Congress may tell us that it was completely inappropriate to do that At this point we're asking for counsel and advice  We don't have the power  See, that's the answer they're not called Treasuries!  Yes, but the principle is the same, so I think you're right  Nay  I have a question  We did the first one; there are three other [questions] on the [the list]  There are a number of issues that Ted raised that I didn't think we addressed Are we going to come back to them at some other date or--?   Mr Chairman, Lee Hoskins  Do you have any observations to make as to why the Secretary of the Treasury changed his views with respect to intervention?   Peter, in March I asked about collateral to back the Federal Reserve notes You thought there might be a problem in May, but I guess the Treasury balance situation solved that Or do you see a problem coming up soon?  I have two questions, Mike One has to do with an earlier period--1988 and early 1989--when we raised the funds rate 300 basis points, I think I'd like you to contrast how you view that tradeoff now We raised interest rates a lot and not a lot happened You have built into your forecast an increase of 125 basis points or so and are expecting to get some bang for that at the end of 1991 I'd like you to compare those two periods if you can  Okay, that narrows the tradeoff down a little The point I'm making here is that we acted fairly aggressively at one point in time and did not get much, as viewed by some people, in terms of [lower inflation] rates We did not necessarily get disastrous results either in terms of slowing growth, but also we didn't gain a lot We kept the inflation rate roughly where it was I guess it could have gotten a lot worse had we not done something I don't know if you see any difference between those two periods that would enlighten us now--perhaps not The second question has to do with the deficit issue If you argue that we could get some benefit from a lower deficit in the future, and if you've revised your 1990 deficit up, then couldn't you argue that we might need to tighten to take account of that now instead of in the future?  It's not real debt!  There is not much change in the Fourth District since the last time we met There are high levels of economic activity We had a meeting with 25 economists representing businesses located in the District To make a short story out of it, they see no credit crunch within the District, continued export growth, no cutback in capital spending plans, and real growth in the neighborhood of 2 to 2-1/4 percent for next year  They are District economists forecasting for the national economy The only surprising or perhaps worrisome trend as reported by these forecasters is that out of the 25 none of them had a recession in the forecast horizon, which means they are probably wrong My infamous stainless steel strip new order measure reached a 5-year high in April; that's seasonally adjusted It indicated a very strong export side as well as domestic It's muddied up a little by some inventory building by automobile companies in anticipation of a strike in the third quarter  It gets the direction right usually; the magnitudes are terrible  No; the other anecdotal information surrounding this particular firm is that in two lines they are already sold out through the end of year and most of these sales are export oriented So the steel side, at least the stainless steel side, seems to be doing quite well They tend to argue that it's a proxy for the economy We've tested it, as the Chairman has indicated, and it does less well than the [leading indicators] over time They did post price increases a month ago of 4 to 7 percent, and they had no problem making that stick  In terms of the national outlook, I want to thank Mike again for making, I think, a real attempt to show us what we need to do if we want to tackle the inflation issue Most of the risks in the forecast, it seems to me, are weighted toward having a little more inflation or perhaps having it stay the same I understand that there are always going to be risks of fragility in financial markets; we've talked about that now for six months And there is always a potential budget deficit deal But I think we have to gear our monetary policy to the objective that we can achieve I agree with Dick Syron that credibility is important, and I'm not sure we're maintaining it I'm not unduly pessimistic about inflation, but we do have an objective of bringing it down and not much seems to be happening I might quibble on the cost of bringing it down, though  Don, if we have credibility in the marketplace with respect to our [commitment to] price stability, why would the markets have any problem with alternative C?  Would be a tightening in policy  All I'm suggesting is that, if we were credible, that would mean we would see a drop in longer-term rates  Let me follow with just one question on the aggregates If we didn't do any tightening through the rest of the year, what would be your estimate for fourth quarter-over-fourth quarter [money growth]?  That 5-1/2 percent was with the Greenbook interest rate path?  Our goal is to achieve long-run price stability We have to make those decisions in the context of short- term policymaking and there is always lots of noise in the data when we do that M2 is slowing; the yield curve may be flatter than it was; maybe commodity prices always give us conflicting signals in the short run because of the noise there I asked Don Kohn questions about where M2 was likely to be at year-end if we do nothing; his answer was 6 percent or higher We have done a good job I'm not pessimistic about the long-term inflation outlook in the sense of it rising We have had three years of 4-1/2 percent or so growth in M2 To give that away by producing a 6 percent growth in M2 this year is not an acceptable policy to me if our goal is long-run price stability In terms of where I'd like to come out at year-end--and  -30-    5/15/90  that will condition the way I would vote today--I would like to see M2 come in at 4-1/2 percent or below, fourth quarter over fourth quarter It seems to me that then we would be making progress toward price stability In terms of what M2 means right now, it's positive from my point of view in that it's slowing But I'm not sure that it's going to stay there Somebody already has used the expression that insurance may be appropriate at this point in time It's a lot easier to lower rates if we make a mistake in this environment than it is going to be to raise them down the road In terms of the short-term outlook, one can just simply look at the Greenbook, which also supports the notion that if we do nothing at best we'll stabilize the inflation rate and at worst we will have a rising inflation rate So, I prefer alternative C  That sounds like alternative "C" to me, Wayne   I noticed in the New York Fed's [report on its] financial panel that there was a comment by Scott Pardee indicating that he felt the pegging of the funds rate was not allowing market forces to show through and was creating a situation whereby even moving the funds rate a little would be viewed as a very strong signal Can you evaluate that? Do you sense the same thing?  Just one question for Mike It really is not a fair one because he probably hasn't looked at it But, if the average error in the forecast one quarter out is plus or minus 2 percentage points when we have normal times--that is, no fiscal policy change-- what would you [estimate] the error is going to be with a fiscal policy change?  Well, the Fourth District is a little more like Si Keehn's District than it is Ed Boehne's There is not much of a change from the last time I reported In terms of the manufacturing side, I would say we're more upbeat than the national counterpart, perhaps because we focused on capital spending and it turns out that in real terms capital spending plans for most firms are running increases of between 5 and 10 percent, whereas the Commerce Department's [number] is running at 3-1/2 percent Again, like Si's District, steel is relatively strong I don't have a really good explanation for that In carbon, they are looking for a pretty good second half And in stainless, a major firm in our area has very close to a record year in terms of its order book in the next two months Also, a good portion of this is driven by a very strong export sector in the District The weakness, as you might suspect, is in retail sales and construction  In terms of the credit crunch issue, we have talked to our small bank advisory council and, of course, to all of the major banks Small bankers report no change in their standards; they are worried about the regulators coming in And these small banks are seeing more deals come across now from S&Ls that have been closed; developers are moving over and searching the banks So, there are plenty of deals in front of them, but most of them aren't very good In terms of larger banks, we see rather flat to modest growth in loan demand--nothing spectacular The one thing that I do sense in talking to my directors, who have been and remain very concerned about inflation-- and it's very apparent more recently--is that there is some concern about the economy When I press them on their own firms, all of them are doing all right--some robust and some flat, but nobody's going over the cliff Their perception is that somebody else is going over the cliff, but they don't know who at this point in time So, there is a greater degree of caution in the minds of the business community in the District, it seems to me, than there was just last month  As far as the national outlook goes, we're a little stronger in terms of real growth than the Greenbook and a little less optimistic about reductions in inflation I think the difficult times, looking at what has happened to money, are making some sort of sense out of that Staff [unintelligible] but the confidence level around the forecast of velocity leaves me a little cold as well The problem with retail sales is also a bit of a concern I don't like to be much of a fine tuner; it has been going on for a time so I'm comfortable watching things for a while  Don, I think you mentioned the other day that we did mid-year adjustments twice before Do you remember in what kinds of circumstances and for what rationales?  I favor strategy II for the long term I think that [presentation of alternative strategies] was nicely done I think we ought to be comfortable, as many people around this table have already indicated, that we have made good progress toward that [objective], probably more than I thought we would early on I agree with Tom Melzer's point that it is important not to bounce the ranges around I would not want to see them have to be moved up because of suspected shifts in velocity But that doesn't pose a particular problem for me since I wanted a 2 to 6 percent range [for M2] anyway I have some concerns about the aggregates and about the point that Dave Mullins made--that they all are sending us the same signal and they are slowing rather dramatically But since I was comfortable in February with 2 to 6 percent, I think we ought to go to 2 to 6 percent There is a rationale to explain that It is our best estimate of where we are at this point in time and I think Congress ought to have that information I would accept all the other ranges-- for M3 and debt--under the alternative for 1990    7/2-3/90  Yes  Yes  The 1991 alternative as listed by the staff [in the Bluebook]  It's 4 to 8 percent for 1991  I want the staff's alternatives both for 1990 and 1991  No, it's 4 to 8 percent [for debt] for 1991  Mr Chairman, as someone who has worried consistently about the growth rates in the aggregates, I find myself in one sense pleasantly surprised that the aggregates are at about the growth rates that I thought were appropriate for the year Unfortunately, I'm uncomfortable with how we got there I think your explanation may well have some merit for pegging the funds rate [when] the economy is weak We're not running monetary policy by supplying reserves; we're running it through interest rates Having said all that, and given the staff's forecast of where we're likely to be, I'm equally uncomfortable with the velocity projections So, that leaves me in a position of great uncertainty And in that position, I'd be more comfortable with "B" symmetric   Sam, was the unwinding of the DM warehousing related to any collateral problems that we have with respect to notes? Why did the Treasury do that? What reason did the Treasury give?  Are we looking to bring ours down?  Yes  Yes, I want to get back to your simulation If I understand it right, you have a neutral policy going forward to generate essentially the same nominal GNP It's just that the components would differ; you would have lower output and higher inflation You open up slack in the economy and the inflationary surge is temporary You say that you don't take account of expectations; you haven't talked much about that I think one could argue that with interest rates going up around the world--every place, really, except the United States--we could see a deterioration in inflationary expectations My question is What do you think about that? And secondly, what does that do to your real forecast?  Let me follow up Assume that inflation expectations got worse and go back to the real side of the economy Presumably, you'd be forecasting higher unemployment?  Right Well, suppose we don't accommodate those expectations  Well, I agree with what you said I guess what I'm getting at is that markets may now behave somewhat differently with respect to expectations perhaps than they did in the 1970s in that they in fact are not fooled And when we have higher real rates, the implication seems to me to be higher unemployment quicker And if we want to avoid going back to the 1970s [experience], one policy response would be to signal the markets that we're not going to accommodate it and in the long run that could lower our costs [unintelligible]  Business conditions in the District really have not changed much from the reports I've given you before, and we continue to operate at high levels of economic activity What has changed, obviously, is what everyone has mentioned here already and that is the uncertainty that people have going forward In response to that [uncertainty, the comment I heard] when I dug around a little was that firms were not planning to reduce production now or to curtail capital spending plans Their plans had more to do in some sense with anticipating slower growth out there and preparing themselves for reductions in their labor force in the future The responses that some people seem to be making to the uncertainty about the fourth quarter included using overtime as opposed to adding new people; letting attrition run down the work force a little; and using contracted help One response from a steel company executive was to protect the company in the fourth quarter by exploiting opportunities in Europe where steel demand is very strong and mills are booked out through December He has the opportunities for business in that area The only cancellation, or at least deferred sale that I know of, is at a steel company that had a transformer on a ship to Iraq I don't think they're going to complete that sale for a while!  They'll need it more later In terms of the national outlook, it's obvious what we face The oil shock has given us two outcomes for the economy higher inflation in the near term and reduced output It seems to me also that one could argue that real interest rates need to be--and probably are--somewhat higher to ration or reduce the supply of output over time With respect to monetary policy, I think there's little that we can do constructively to get more oil And there's not much we can do constructively to lower real interest rates There is one thing we can do and that is to keep the long-term inflation expectations from being built into this economy  Just a point of clarification  In the context of what you said on asymmetric language and the conference call, are you suggesting that you are suspending what I guess has developed into a tradition recently of asymmetric meaning you have two calls of your own of 25 basis points, or would you confer?  Yes, that was what I understood it [meant] around the table when the language was asymmetric But my question also relates to--  Well, I always interpreted it as that you had [as Chairman the authority to make] a 25 basis point move either way if the directive was symmetric That was my understanding If it was asymmetric--  Mr Chairman, I agree with your analysis this time almost wholeheartedly with respect to what monetary policy can and can't do As I said before, we face the fact that there is an oil price shock, that output is going to be less than it otherwise would have been, and that inflation is going to be higher than it otherwise would have been There's not a lot we can do about that The one thing we can affect, however, is how people in the marketplace view the future for inflation--that is, inflation expectations My view would be that we should look at that more carefully or at least give it more weight than perhaps we have in the past This is a policy mess, but there is a silver lining in it It does offer us a chance to regain some of our credibility or to increase it That would argue for a position very close to Wayne Angell's One could make a case on those grounds, I think, for a token tightening But since the market already expected an easing by us, that would argue in my mind for staying where we are for stability reasons But I do think we are at risk with respect to our credibility in terms of pursuing price stability My preference would be that we have symmetric language in "B" and that hopefully we would have a Committee discussion before a move is made   This is Lee Hoskins, I am here now  Mr Chairman, this is Lee Hoskins I'd like to associate myself with Gary Stern's comments I think it would be premature to move at this point, particularly with the aggregates coming back roughly to trend I think we ought to stay where we are    9/17/90   Peter, I've been on the call on occasion and I've watched the market tend to focus more and more on the funds rate as the measure of our policy To an extent, at least based on your report, we are beginning to alter our program so as not to indicate that we made an easing [move] In other words, we had to add [reserves] and we didn't do it because the market might have reacted  The question to you is Are you comfortable with that or would you be more comfortable with more flexibility around the funds rate? And if you would [prefer the latter], do you have any ideas on how we can get that without disturbing the market?  Well, I don't either That's why I asked you  That would take a public statement  Mike, my question is about your relatively quick drop--from my point of view--in the inflation rate out in 1992 My question focuses on a couple of observations One is that ex food and energy, the trend has been upward in the last couple of years; and I'm wondering what you think is going to put the squeeze back on inflation The second has to do with potential GNP If the oil price doubles, or under the other assumption increases by 50 percent, that must have some impact on the potential GNP that you've built in, which means that you have lower growth for the real economy but you also have lower potential GNP I'd like you to sort that out for me  Thank you  Let me just follow up on--  I'm sorry  I was just going to follow up on your comment, but it's so far removed now that I don't think we ought to put Mike back on the rack to torture him more on that  If I listened to your comments correctly, [the implication] was that if we do have a slowing in real GNP and potential GNP is also slowing, we're running off a gap or slack model and the 6-1/2 percent unemployment isn't going to buy us the same reduction in inflation That was the only point I was trying to make But it isn't [unintelligible] and nobody knows  First on the national outlook, I don't have a lot of problem with Mike's forecast But there is a very large error band around forecasts, and as the Chairman indicated last week to the business economists, that error band is increasing, not getting smaller, certainly relative to 20 years ago That error band is a couple of percentage points either way So, I'm not so worried about the forecast as I am about our perceived response to it As several people already mentioned, we had an oil price shock; that was a real shock There's not much we can do to increase output because of that We have had a wealth loss and I don't think that calls for much of a response by us Some of the other concerns, of course, relate to our  -30-    10/2/90  ability to fine tune in some sense I don't think we have a very good record on being able to pick out when the appropriate time is to increase the rate of growth in money and when the appropriate time is to shut it down Nor do I think the evidence from the academic community, at least as they judge policy in terms of the importance of expectations, supports our doing anything other than providing a stable monetary policy I would judge stability by the rates of growth in M2, and we've had a pretty stable rate of growth for three years as Tom Melzer mentioned And with Don's numbers--they are coming up--it looks like we're going to be fairly close to that number of the last three years So, I think the problem now is not making an error to signal the markets, essentially the currency and bond markets, that we're running a risk of making some of the mistakes that we did in the past--that is overdoing it in the face of a potential recession So, I think we need to find some way to [provide] some certainty or at least not increase the instability about the future I suppose one could make an argument for tightening policy as a way to send a signal I'll save that for later  Let me talk about the District The Fourth District is doing generally better than the nation, but not a lot better As just one example, our employment in manufacturing in the last year has been flat while the nation's has declined about 2 percent Our unemployment rates, after tilting up in the second quarter in Ohio and Pennsylvania, now are back at 53 and 48 percent respectively So, the level of activity is holding up pretty well Capital goods producers, which we have a [unintelligible], are still filling their order books, but they are less optimistic One turnaround has been in heavy duty truck activity; the orders there are starting to revive Also, the export side, which has been a strength for us, still seems to be strong but we're beginning to get some signs of a softening there We recently talked to an economist at one particular construction machinery company who indicated that they had experienced a very sharp falloff [in demand] for construction machinery worldwide starting in August So, there are some signs that the economy has softened, but as far as the numbers go, in general the Fourth District seems to be holding up okay  In terms of attitudes, they are very similar to what people have indicated around the table I went through the District last week on a bunch of road trips and when I talked to individuals they always seemed to have a good reason why their business was doing okay Everyone had his or her own peculiar reason--we just got lucky or we got this order that will take us out through the second quarter of next year But there is this pervasive view of impending disaster out there I think there is some tightening in terms of cost control within the larger firms because of that, even though their order books haven't shifted much Overall, I don't think the District has changed much other than in terms of the attitudinal caution because of the oil price shock  Back to David's comments about the components of the aggregates Instead of looking into that aspect, let's look at [velocity] You put a memo out in June, I think, saying that there might have been a shift in M2 velocity If that were the case, isn't the [recent] resumption of growth inconsistent with that? Wouldn't you expect lower growth rates?  I have a question If this problem with banking is a kind of nonprice rationing, I don't see how lowering prices at the banks is going to help a lot in terms of availability of credit  No, more generally about lowering interest rates If [banks] are tightening their standards and they don't want to make real estate loans, then lowering rates 1/2 point probably isn't going to change them  Well, we can discuss it some other time I can see the reserve requirement effect a little better and, by the way, I would be in favor of something like that because it is a direct tax You do increase capital almost instantly for them; that's clear What's not so clear to me is whether you increase demand for loans when you lower the funds rate and all loan rates go down  Or you'll increase supply if bankers are not rationing on the basis of price but on the basis of credit quality  Don, what is the relationship between the changes in the components of M2 that you can discover and spending in the economy?  There's one problem If we go back into a Committee meeting and then we come out with asymmetric language again, I think a lot of people don't like to dissent around asymmetric language  I was going to give the case for alternative C that Don didn't have time to give Given what's on the table here, I think I better address the issue  I think there is a danger of our losing sight of what the fundamental job of a central bank is, which, of course, is to bring down inflation over time And this is the kind of period when I think we typically have lost sight of that in the past, so I'm very cautious about any wavering at this point in time Monetary growth is returning to the 4 to 5 percent range I think our growth ranges are rather wide I dissented in February because I didn't want [M2] to get to 6 percent this year; I wanted us to keep the rate of growth around 4 to 5 percent So, I would not be happy to see M2 surge up to that level I don't think we have the credibility that some people around the table think we have, though of course that's debatable; I think we have to earn it yet But with respect to policy moves, I'm very concerned about the reaction in the marketplace--that they might see us as tossing in the towel on inflation So, I do think that the explanation that you give--and I would prefer to link this motion if it carries to the economy and M2--needs to be done carefully Again, I didn't want to tie it continuously to the credit crunch because then we're locking ourselves in As the banking system gets weaker, which I think is a structural problem over time and not a cyclical problem, we'll be tying ourselves to something like that  Well, I would agree if I could see a little more clearly that that was happening If, as I think Don suggested, we begin to see some real weakness in M2, then we would recognize this as a severe credit related problem I don't see that yet, and that's why I'm having a little trouble right now  My preference, of course, contrary to popular opinion, would be not to raise rates at this point, but to stay where we are I would agree pretty much with [others on] this side of the  -56-    10/2/90  table that 50 basis points is a lot to do I'm uncomfortable doing that for the reasons I've suggested  There's no implied second move   I have two questions One has to do with the warehousing arrangement Sam, I didn't catch what you said in terms of our exposure now and where our ceiling is And, is it advisable to consider lowering it?  And limits?  So, we have a $15 billion limit but we're currently at $4-1/2 billion I'm wondering if we should consider bringing the limit more in line with the outstandings, especially since it has attracted some attention  My second question has to do with the swap arrangements I've brought this up before Most of the countries on the list are industrialized countries with AA ratings for their debt and an exchangeable currency There's one exception, and that's Mexico My view on Mexico has been that it doesn't meet the goals of why that swap arrangement was originally set up In a sense it's more like foreign aid or a loan to Mexico by the Federal Reserve and that's more or less outside the goals of swap arrangements Mexico is a different [type of] country than the other ones  This is just a hypothetical question If the funds rate were to come down, do you see any problem with the discount rate--with the spread being narrowed? I know you're not using it as the fulcrum anymore  Yes  It seems to me in the current environment--the way we're tending to operate by pegging the funds rate--that we probably could go ahead and operate with a penalty discount rate Is that right?  I had one other question, the perennial one Given all these changes that have gone on and the consideration of potentially reducing reserve requirements as well, are we going to have a collateral problem soon?  In the interest of truth in labeling, given the way we've been operating, it would probably be a good idea to get rid of it because that is a straight-forward, honest interpretation of what we're trying to do However, the issue that Wayne raised--and you correctly identified it as substantive--is an important one I have asked Peter before and maybe we should ask him again, in moving toward the substantive area Would you want some more variability in the funds rate than we have now?  Would getting rid of this sentence do anything to your operation in terms of how people might interpret what goes on in the funds market?  We've been on that road  Or, following those up, we could go to saying explicitly what funds rate we are targeting  I think the interest in the Committee would be to provide more information, though maybe not necessarily that piece of information  Just a follow up on Dick's question again, because I'm not sure I have your orders of magnitude right One concern that I have is that there's still a reasonable chance that the fourth quarter may not even turn out down But if I listened to you correctly you're pretty confident--meaning 80-90 percent probability-- that we're going to have a negative?  That's close enough, thanks  Well, let me be very brief The District is not too much different from what I reported to you last time People were pessimistic last time, if you recall, but when I checked their order books they also had a reason as to why their own specific firm was going to do all right Now we're actually picking up some cancellation of orders to firms and that kind of thing So, it's a little softer But perhaps surprising to some of you is that manufacturing employment still is almost at the same level it was when it reached its high in early 1989 So, there hasn't been much deterioration and there probably still is some growth left in the District Steel, for some very special reasons, is running at a pretty good rate Those special reasons are that the dollar is weak and imports are shut down and Canada, of course, has a steel strike under way So, we're getting some special help there What has changed the most is what I would call a loss of confidence by the bankers in the District It's not so much a view that the world is coming to an end but just this hunkering down attitude that we're going to build a fortress balance sheet and that's the way to survive That's the nature of what we hear all the time and that's a little disturbing to me  Switching to the national outlook, I haven't any reason to object to what Mike has presented in the forecast I have trouble with forecasts because the errors are really quite large in them But the reason I asked the question was that it seems to me there are two kinds of errors that we can make if we are in a recession or heading into one One is that if we try to head off a recession or keep it relatively short in time or very shallow without having all the necessary information about where we are in the economy, by an aggressive easing of some kind we could actually cause an increase in    11/13/90  inflation, notching it up and making ourselves worse off That's why I was interested in your confidence intervals So, it seems to me that one mistake we don't want to make is to ease aggressively, cause inflation to rise, and be caught in that potential trap that Wayne alluded to The second kind of error is the one that concerns me and really is the subject of Don's talk later on, and that is that we've been pegging the funds rate If the economy is weak and we're pegging the funds rate too high, then the aggregates are going to shrink and we will provide a monetary shock to the economy And while two months don't make the case, as Governor Mullins pointed out, we've had a rather strange pattern in M2 So, I have some concerns about that risk as well  Don, how do you get your December number for money?  No, I was just curious because the model hasn't been performing very well and--  I'm more in the Melzer-Guffey camp on this in the sense that the economy does really appear to be softening up, but I think the reasons have to do with structural problems that we've all  -44-    11/13/90  talked about, as well as the oil price shock, not necessarily Fed-type policy I'm not sure there's much we ought to do about that I do think we ought to guard against the error of having a continuation of money growth that is so low that we will shock the economy Now, two months doesn't make a trend, but given the other things that people have talked about here in terms of a weak economy and fragility in the banking system, I can go along with your proposal I would like to delay it, but I won't make a big issue out of that   You mentioned that negotiations to ratify the swaps are finished My question is Given the size of our current foreign exchange holdings, why do we need to ratify those levels?  Peter, I think you alluded somewhat--maybe I misread you--to the idea that in your day-to-day operations it's a little more difficult to signal where we are, given the reserve requirement change I'm wondering if we should view this as an opportunity to get a little more variability into the funds rate and to get back toward more of a reserve borrowing approach Of course, that would require the discount rate to be moved if we were to choose to operate in that way Is this an opportunity?    12/18/90  Maybe we ought to signal explicitly then and tell the market what the funds rate [objective] is  Some may retire sooner than they expected!  The District continues to perform better than the nation Just as an example For the year October-to-October, output in the state of Ohio was up 5 percent and in the nation it was up about 2 percent The weakest link, as you might expect, is in autos right now There is one exception We have an announcement of a new auto plant in the Lexington area that is going to employ a number of people The Lexington area is an abnormal situation; the unemployment rate there is 32 percent But the unemployment rates around the District over the last three months average 55 percent in Ohio and 42 percent but rising in the Pittsburgh area Economic activity is definitely weaker than it was last month but that weakness is nottranslated, at least by most participants that we surveyed, into a recession in the District They're apprehensive that one will develop there; they believe one is under way in the nation But when  -19-    12/18/90  we talk about a softening market, we talk about reducing overtime And other than in autos and construction, we haven't had major layoffs in the District So, it's still performing quite well In fact, the capital goods side is still doing better than manufacturing overall, but not quite as well as it was before It's a little more mixed now, but there are still some positive signs Heavy trucks had their third best month of the year, in terms of new orders, in October So there is still a little strength around the District in capital goods Retail sales are flat, as everybody has indicated already  In terms of the national outlook, I think we'd be pretty happy to see Mike's forecast come true It has a declining inflation rate We'd like to see a little more of that I would simply like to focus on the fact that that's a relatively short recession he has forecast and that whatever is causing it--whether you believe it's oil or the credit crunch--neither is laid [at the foot of] monetary policy And the kind of decision we're going to make later today really is going to have its impact at the time Mike has a snapback in the forecast in terms of real growth So, that is something that we ought to think carefully about in terms of making our policy decision In the longer term I guess Mike has 24 percent growth, which is close to our potential growth; but I would expect us to see in his footnotes a note that our potential may be somewhat less now We have a lot of asset prices that are coming down It seems to me that those represent some excesses that occurred in the past and that resources have to flow out of those areas I don't think there's any way around that We have some defense restructuring to do and obviously some restructuring in financial services It seems to me that those things, along with the factors that Mike pointed out, argue that our potential growth probably will slow in the future So, I don't have the sense that anything is falling apart on us at the moment Several of you suggested a number of risks that are out there, and I think those are always there What that points out to us is the size of the errors around the forecast--that we are very uncertain about those And when we're uncertain about them I think we ought to proceed cautiously If there is a reason to ease, it seems to me it has to do with the monetary aggregates About the best we can do in terms of managing the economy is to keep inflation low and let the economy take care of itself That means we've got to watch the aggregates  Toyota  Don, to your surprise, I'm not going to ask you where alternative C is today I do have a question  I started early, Martha I do want to follow- up on a couple of questions that have already been raised You have pretty rapid growth--accelerating growth--in January, February, and March The quarter finishes at 76 percent And I guess that's really what David was [raising] To press on What happens in the next quarter? Do you expect us to go back to a 6 percent growth rate or 5 percent or lower?  Yes, if we adopted alternative A  So, we'd have a pretty strong first half, at 6 percent or something like that? It seems to me we'd be giving up some of our gains--  But instead, under alternative A it will be about 6 percent money growth for the first half of the year, or somewhere in that range You have 5 percent in the first quarter and 7 percent in the second  Well, we've been concerned about the model because, as you know, we put a lot of emphasis on M2 We did try running a different version with no trend variable in it What we put  -29-    12/18/90  in was a thrift share as an explanatory variable and that did get rid of the drift in the model It doesn't make money grow any faster, but it tries to get at the problem in a different way  Clarifies it  And what if we didn't do anything? Would that be a surprise?  Are you recommending that?  I wanted to get a clarification from Governor Angell Are you suggesting that we stay at 7-1/4 percent asymmetric toward ease and, not to prejudge what the Board will do, but suppose that it lowers the discount rate 50 basis points, that all of that will be passed through? Or is that just a signalling device?  Let me finish off then My preference would be not to change; I could live with asymmetric language But I would agree with Governor Angell's proposal that is, if the Board is going to change the discount rate, do it first and see what happens Then we would have the opportunity, if the foreign exchange markets reacted badly to that, to sit for a while or to move forward It seems to me to give you more degrees of freedom But my overall preference--  No, I'm saying that [unintelligible] you've lowered the discount rate, say, 50 basis points, but you don't do anything with respect to the funds rate until that reaction--  I just wanted to finish the policy statement separate from the discount rate issue I think we ought to have asymmetric language I'd rather have the 25 basis point move in the hands of the Chairman at his discretion We have made some significant moves in terms of interest rates in the recent past and we haven't seen those fully show through yet Don's projections presumably could err on both sides, not just one side, and we may well get a faster growth rate of money But even with the projection that we have, a 50 basis point move puts us at the top of our tentative target range for next year by June And it seems to me that some patience is needed here and some careful watching of the aggregates I'm not averse to moving if the aggregates pan out to be more than a 26-week fluke But maybe we ought to see what's in that aggregate box before we move ahead  We didn't have a recession then; it's a lot tougher when there's a recession on  -43-    12/18/90  SPEAKER(?) No, that's right   Just a clarification on the paper The mandate is to look at the operating instruments as well as the relationship of the discount rate to the funds rate?  I have a couple, Sam One is What happens if we don't renew it? Does it automatically expire or is this a process that the FOMC has set up to review this annually? If so, I guess the idea is that the Committee is endorsing this kind of activity    2/5-6/91  So, if we endorse the recommendation of $10 billion, would that essentially mean that the FOMC endorses the activity of warehousing?  I have a question on intervention activities with respect to the mark, since that's the only currency involved in the intervention we've been doing I presume that is supposed to be a sterilized intervention The question really is If we're pegging a rate like the funds rate, how do we know we're sterilizing it?  Yes, but you're sterilizing around the funds rate and not around total reserves  Total reserves is what we think drives money and we're trying to get money to grow So, if one is worried about the slowness of monetary growth, one might worry about this practice    2/5-6/91  Well, this point has already been tortured by three other people, but the problem is not the market knowing where we want the funds rate; they know where that is The problem is in the latter part of the day What you said about having to have everything done by 130 pm sort of defuses my question; otherwise you could just stand ready to buy and sell at 6-1/4 percent as an alternative to what we're doing That leads me to another question--really for you, Mr Chairman In this commission that you have just given to Don Kohn, are we going to consider alternative operating procedures? Was the mandate that broad?  I, too, want to compliment the staff on its professionalism and objectivity in presenting this very interesting report I have one question with respect to the longer-term averages that you present here A naive and uninitiated person--nobody at this table, of course--could read this as saying that with the baseline [policy] we will average 2-1/4 percent [real growth] for 5 years and if we have an easier monetary policy, a pro-inflation policy, we will average 26 percent So, over long periods of time it looks like if we have a pro-inflation policy or rapid money growth, we'll have higher rates of real growth And that simply doesn't seem to [happen] over the longer periods of time I presume your answer is that 5 years isn't [a long] enough time period  If you were to run your model with expectations of some degree of credibility or full credibility, would you expect to get the same results?  Yes, the one that has the five-year average  Built on the 23 and 26 percent projections for--  The District's [economic] activity has softened since October but is still generally stronger than the nation's The unemployment rate in Ohio is up about 1/2 point but employment is about the same; it hasn't changed much In fact, if you look at [initial unemployment] claims, the peak seems to be in the first week of January at 44,000 and they declined gradually each week to around  -31-    2/5-6/91  24,000 The hardest hit, of course, are autos and auto-related industries; that has impacted steel companies, which are operating at about 70 percent [Unintelligible] cited a recent survey by a bank of its customers and 85 percent of respondents said that in terms of new projects they have no trouble getting credit; in terms of operating monies, 91 percent said they have no problem As for straight-out anecdotal information, the international airline with which I'm familiar, since my wife works for it, has offered a month off without pay to anyone who wants not to work That's clearly associated with the war and lack of travel  And you're probably all waiting for my stainless steel strip index, but I'm not going to give it to you because I've latched onto a new one the Smuckers Index! I had a chance to talk with Paul Smucker, an elderly gentleman who has been through many business cycles and he told me that apple butter sales remain relatively soft and that's a good sign because during deep recessions apple butter sales soar [Laughter] So, I'll be reporting to you on apple butter  I'll make my comments on the national economy really short after that! As I look at it, I agree with the staff's view and also with what the Chairman has been saying This is principally a situation where the downturn occurred as a result of the war and the consumer sentiment associated with that With respect to problems in real estate, I think Gary Stern has it right It's a long- term problem; there's no easy way out of it And I don't think monetary policy can help either one of those situations Now, I'm sitting here looking ahead at policy There's a lag that we all know about, and we have a forecast that says the economy will be rebounding at about the time that the average lag says [current] policy is going to have an impact So, I have some concerns about that, but I'll save those for Don Kohn What I think we, from the point of view of a central bank, ought to be focusing on--[unintelligible] some of the concerns that people around the table have particularly from the areas that have been impacted hard--is what is happening to money Perhaps some of you are interested in credit, but I would tend to focus on money If we're going to worry about anything, I think we ought to worry about making sure that we don't permit a procyclical monetary policy at this point  Well, I'm pretty much in the same mode as Wayne and Roger and Tom Our job is to reduce inflation over time I think all of these ranges allow us to do that, as Mike Kelley pointed out Midpoints are important and I would hate to have us think that if we do come out for your suggestion, we have to hit the midpoint because that's above where growth has been averaging I think that was Wayne's point So, I'm for strategy II, a tighter [M2], because that's the one that makes inflation disappear on this piece of paper in front of us I'm not sure it will, in fact But I'm not troubled by marching the ranges down slowly over time because there's a consistency in that that does lend itself to credibility And we are moving down a notch So, while I would prefer to be more aggressive, I can understand your arguments and would support them  Don, what does your model tell you for M2 for the first half, given the [policy] moves that have been made?  But our confidence in the model has fallen?  Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation I was particularly encouraged--and you have said it all the way along, so it should be no surprise--[by your] preparing this group for having to tighten if things start to grow However, on the asymmetric language, I'm comfortable for different reasons I hope we will be emphasizing slowness in money growth as the reason for moving rather than weakness in the economy The errors in our ability to predict the economy one quarter out by anybody's forecast evaluation are really quite large I think our best chance of getting to where we want to be in the long term is to continue progress on relatively steady money growth over time So, I would hope that the asymmetric language would be exercised if we get bad news--that is, slower growth in money than we anticipate  I probably don't need to comment   I'm not sure what "enhanced consultation" means I don't know if it means we're going to take a vote more frequently I think the issue here clearly focused on whether or not the FOMC as a body had in some sense authorized the extent of the moves that occurred And that was in conflict, I think, with the Board's view of what the discount rate function was I find the statements somewhat ambiguous, particularly when I read the last page on the legal section which states clearly--at least it does to me-- that the authority for monetary policy actions at least with respect to this group is with the FOMC That's the way I read the conclusion on page 9 And that seems somewhat inconsistent with what you're suggesting Maybe Virgil has a comment on that  Sam, you were in on both sides of the market, buying and selling Is there some intent to re-establish or confirm target zones by the G-7?  I'm not clear about what the point is Are you seeking advice on what to do with this stuff?  I'll repeat where we started, or at least where I started in late '87 and early '88 The discussion around the table at that time, as I recall it, was that there was some sense of  -11-    3/26/91  agreement in some parts of this body that in large open economies sterilized intervention does not impact exchange rates over time and that, therefore, intervention is nothing but churning and noise to the market and it can interfere with our policy efforts At that time the argument was--and I think it was an appropriate argument--that we ought to have some [foreign currency balances] at least for cooperation purposes, to show the flag and to be part of this process But then we were talking about less than $10 billion If I remember correctly, that limit moved up and there was a dissent at $12 billion; then it went to $15 billion And now we have backed ourselves into a situation here where we're turning this accumulation into a rationale There was no rationale; we just did it And for a body that has some concern about Congress and its inspection of the Federal Reserve and its willingness perhaps to change the Federal Reserve Act it seems to me that we're in a bad situation if we continue to run these kinds of potential losses plus the warehousing I think that's a potential problem for us as well So, if you're looking for recommendations, I would bring [our holdings] back down to some level where we can show the flag and be part of the process but where we don't expose ourselves to the other kinds of political difficulties  That's an idea We'll give them the deutschemarks!  SPEAKERS(?) Good idea!  -18-    3/26/91  I just had one In your earlier report, did you talk about a swap with Romania that was paid back?  By Treasury, not--  Just a question on whether anybody, in terms of the market participants, is looking at money When do you think that would be a concern, if it isn't now?  The District's goods manufacturing is pretty much deteriorating And for the first time we have in Ohio an unemployment rate that is higher than the national average I rather wish that Martha were here to hear that because she has been saying all along that our region has been a lot stronger It's about the same in Pennsylvania; it has deteriorated a bit there as well And it's in the usual suspects--autos and steel; Si has already mentioned steel We are seeing some bounceback, though, in activity in department stores and in home mortgages So, the signs the rest of you are picking up, we're picking up as well The only anecdotal story I want to share with you, because it was a little surprising to me, relates to my specialty steel producer  I called him up before I came down here and asked about his order book It has been very weak, as steel was weak throughout the fall and the first quarter He started out very cautiously in saying that they were going to make it through the year and it will be fine And then I pushed him a little and he said that the export side of his business is very strong; he has booked in the first quarter more than he booked all last year on the export side Now, his concern as we went down this path a little--and I found this to be an unusual one--is that his people can book him out through the third quarter but if he goes ahead and does that on the export side and we get a snapback in the economy, he won't be able to service his local customers So, he's almost in the position now of thinking about not booking the export side of the business He can't turn the orders away, obviously, but that was one unusual story that I heard I don't know if it's typical or atypical  In terms of the national economy, as I look at the Greenbook and what we went through in the last six months around here, it just reminds me that, at least the way I look at it, we don't control much on the real side A lot of other things happen; Dick has mentioned a couple and other people have too So, I don't think we should view ourselves as managing this recovery any more than we managed the  -35-    3/26/91  downturn What we control over time is obviously the price level, and we put ourselves in pretty good stead to continue to do that if we continue to watch the aggregates I'll save those comments for later  To the extent that we have or believe that we have countercyclical capabilities, it seems to me they rest on our credibility; that's the only clothes we have to wear And our credibility depends largely on our actions that support price  -44-    3/26/91  stability We have no price anchor; we're not tied to a price level directly And the only thing I think we can do over time, as I have said many times before, is to maintain money growth at a low rate That's a long-winded way of saying that I think we ought to watch money growth and I support your recommendation   Mr Chairman, Lee Hoskins We had a board meeting yesterday and we had some talk about the fact that we don't have much strength on the industrial side in our District, as you pointed out We don't have any appreciable weakness or deterioration either But beyond that, I have a very strong disagreement with moving either rate at this point in time We have put into place what I consider to be a good monetary policy And I don't believe that we can alter that based on market expectations We have trained the markets to react to monthly numbers, whether it's employment numbers or CPI numbers And I think that's a bad precedent to continue to set What we ought to do is to let the policy that we've put into place--which, as I said, is a good one--work its way out If it proves down the road that in fact things were weaker than we thought, we could reassess at that point But I really feel strongly that we should not train the market to react because of numbers and then react to their expectations [based] on those numbers I just think that's a wrong-headed policy   Could Don Kohn bring us up-to-date on the growth paths and add anything on the projections?   I just have a short one for Peter The Bluebook indicates that the [funds] rate traded low because of market expectations And I was wondering if you were having trouble signaling to the market  Not a lot has changed around the District since the last meeting There has been no drastic drop-off in anybody's order book that I can find and no drastic increase either Really, very little has changed We're running at an unemployment rate somewhat higher than the nation And the same comments that others had about pessimism apply to the District  In terms of the national outlook, I have some discomfort perhaps even with the way we structure the meeting We talk in these meetings about the forecast as if it's something that we can control; we can control the forecast but not the outcome very well There are a number of real events that we simply are unable to anticipate that will change the actual outcome from the forecast So, we almost set it up in some sense to lead us toward more of a fine-tuning approach than I think is warranted by the knowledge that we have as policymakers or as economists That leads me back to Tom Melzer's and Wayne Angell's comments in terms of what we ought to be thinking about in the future, and that is not to be making tradeoffs for inflation and employment It seems to me that that's nothing but a potential problem for us Because the inflation rate is low by the standards of recent history that is no reason not to continue to press forward with  -17-    5/14/91  what I think is the right thing for a central bank to do, which is to eliminate inflation We can look at long-term interest rates all we want but there's not much we can do about them unless we get rid of the uncertainty about inflation And the way to do that is to have a credible and predictable policy I think at this point the Federal Reserve's credibility will be tested and it's very important for us not to err in that test I'll save the rest of my comments for the [policy discussion]   Sam, what is our outstanding foreign currency exposure now relative to the limit?  Sam, it seems to me that there might be some merit in having the Committee consider formally lowering the limit for a couple of reasons One, it's symmetric; it shows that we can put a reference point back around this Committee discussion of when we want to take a look at the portfolio That is, we have to move them down [given that] we move them up Second, we can face some discussions in the market that we're simply reloading--that we did a swap and we're reloading to go after protecting [our] currency again--and I think that would dispel that Lastly, I think it's the right thing for us to do both in terms of the currency holdings as well as the warehousing arrangement; since the warehousing arrangement is $4-1/2 billion and the limit is $10 billion, it's not a real limit I don't think that cuts down our flexibility It seems to me that it indicates to a lot of other players--Congress, other central banks,    7/2-3/91  and the markets--what our intentions are with respect to the currency And if there is a reason that the Committee has to move, then we can take a look at the limit; and if we run up against it, then presumably we'll have a good reason for moving it But it gives a point of reference and framework for discussing where we want these activities to take place and the magnitude and why we're doing them But if we leave the limits where they are, we're working in an asymmetric way We only bump the limit when we hit it and we never lower it  In the same vein, I guess Have you looked back at the Greenbook to see if, at this point in the cycle, there's a systematic error? Do we tend to underestimate the expansion? My intuitive notion is that we underestimate money growth rates, we underestimate the expansion, and we underestimate the rate of increase in inflation Do you have any feel for that?  Just to follow up, though maybe it's more a question for Don later on How do you get this--to me, troublesome-- 5-1/2 percent money growth [assumption] in the Greenbook? Do you view that as a monetary stimulus? Do you view it as a neutral [factor], even though it's an increase in money growth? I'm not sure how you get your forecast Do you start with nominal [GNP] and back out money and velocity or--  Then you'll have a very unusual velocity behavior for this recovery, because there hasn't been a recovery that has had positive velocity--at least in the last four  Sure  We usually have money growth for eight quarters after recovery starts that is a couple of points faster than the trend rate prior to the recession  And velocity is usually negative for eight quarters on average  My point was that there is a rationale; I anticipated it, and it's a sensible argument The problem, as we look back over 30 years of M2, is that all kinds of special factors have occurred and yet if we ran M2 at 3 percent forever we seem to get to price stability So it troubles me because we're moving away from a trend rate that we worked very hard for four years to bring down to 4 percent, and it's causing me some concerns All I'm saying is that there is a lot of slippage in terms of forecasting these things, and I don't put a lot of confidence in these relationships  Well, I want to raise one last point and that's your sacrifice ratios that are involved here If you ran a forward- looking model with forward-looking expectations, then I think you would get a different picture  That's the disturbing page that has the baseline for three years at 5-1/2 percent money growth  Just one question on the baseline One way to do a baseline would be to take the past growth rates You must have something else in mind  Some people will judge policy change as a change in the monetary growth rate  And so for them a baseline would be just a consistent growth rate; and that's obviously my problem  I understand that  Only one  And they want a whole write-off  They wash out over time  Mr Chairman, I wanted to come here today also and congratulate Mike by confirming that the recovery started in the quarter in which he called it However, I was not able to get hold of Mr Smuckers to get my apple butter index and come down here and report And that's unfortunate; that index is really reliable  The District isn't showing anything much different from what anybody else's District seems to be showing, at least from what I've heard here In the state of Ohio employment in May is up one percent over what it was a year ago; in Pennsylvania it is down a percent and a half or so All the anecdotal information suggests that we've touched bottom and will be beginning to head up soon The employment numbers in Ohio would tend to indicate that The capital goods people are all nervous The order books aren't dropping or anything like that, but they don't see any sign of a pickup in the third quarter, with the exception of large trucks; there has been a pretty good surge in that  A surge in the last couple of months in the order books for large trucks The one thing I hear uniformly from talking to people is their comfort with the inventory levels There was not one person we talked to who thought they didn't have their hands right around inventory; inventories were very low and right where they wanted them That's the only consistent [comment] I got across the District in talking to manufacturing people  In terms of the outlook for the national economy, again, we're not too much different from the Greenbook We just have different monetary assumptions than they do I guess I'm a little troubled by our concerns over all the risks that are out there We have to be cognizant of risk but I think everything we know about the empiricism of macroeconomics, as well as macroeconomic theory in the last 20 years or so, tells us that we probably can't control most of those things very well And trying to offset them with monetary policy is not going to help us a lot, whether it's unemployment caused by defense changes or troubles in the real estate industry So, it seems to me that we ought to keep our eye on what we can control over time If we want to get long rates down and get some credibility, then we ought to take a tack that focuses on inflation Now, if 4 percent money growth isn't going to get us there, then I think we ought to go lower Governor Angell is concerned that we haven't gotten far enough; maybe that's because the relationship is disturbed The objective is not money growth; the objective is price stability So, I think that's where our focus ought to be  I sort of asked you all these questions yesterday, Don, so let me try it differently this time The Bluebook and the alternatives that you present for the Committee give us the impression that we can shape the contours of output in the short run without giving up disinflationary efforts What I want to know is What is your comfort level with these kinds of projections based on the models that you use? They're not forward-looking particularly, and our experience with them leaves me uncomfortable  Let me just follow up Would you make that same statement if we were talking about money growth over a 5- or 10- year period?  But you wouldn't be comfortable?  I just had one other question, not on that subject At one point we widened the bands on M2 and the [other] aggregates because we thought there was significant volatility As I look at the numbers over the last four years, we've been within a 1/2 point or so of the midpoint of the range on a fourth-quarter-over- fourth-quarter basis So, it seems to me that maybe we don't have the same degree of uncertainty about where we're going to come out I guess I'm asking you Would you be comfortable with a narrower range, given our experience of the past?  Our goal is price stability I agree with you that we've made progress in terms of bringing money growth down What we know about money--or at least what we think we know--tells us that we ought to get some progress To date we haven't gotten the progress I'm not wedded to a particular money growth; I'm wedded to price stability And it seems to me that what we think we know about it is that we're about a percentage point away from a noninflationary economy in terms of money growth And to look to raising the growth rate in money-- Even though I know it's a residual that falls out of your output, price, and interest rate model, I view it as a policy instrument And I just can't see how we would want to tolerate a 5-1/2 percent rate of growth in money for any significant period of time when we've worked so hard to get where we are If the 4 percent growth rate [over the past] four years doesn't get us anything, then I think we ought to move on down to 2 percent or whatever it takes to get us there in a reasonable time-frame I just think that we shouldn't be considering anything in the upper end of this target  -36-    7/2-3/91  range I would argue that we ought to lower the midpoint of this target range and center it on 3 percent because that's where we want to be And if that doesn't work, then we should center it lower But I don't think we ought to abandon our efforts to bring money growth down when we seem so close We can stay with the current targets for the rest of this year but, for the reasons that both Bob Black and Wayne Angell have already given, I think we would do ourselves a great service by clarifying our commitment to price stability by lowering the target ranges I'm not even comfortable with a 2 to 6 percent range; I'd like one centered on 3 percent or at least I'd collapse the top end of the range  Well, I'll compromise and opt for a lower target range of 2 to 6 percent That's my recommendation  With our hard peg on the funds rate, as everybody has said, money is the residual; and we don't much know what that residual is telling us If you want a suggestion for what we ought to be targeting, it's probably the CPI And if it moves up, we ought to raise rates  "B" symmetric! [Laughter]   Don, this is Lee Hoskins Maybe I missed it, but did you give a third-quarter projection and where would that leave us year-to-date in terms of the target ranges?  Mr Chairman? Lee Hoskins    8/5/91  I think concern over the real economy is somewhat misplaced in the sense that our policy driver in terms of the monetary growth has been relatively slow and we'd expect a relatively modest recovery I can't forecast next quarter's growth or even this quarter's very well The real concern that I have is that we [not] allow money growth now to slip very close to the bottom of the range or perhaps outside of it Coming off a four-year trend [of M2 growth] of around 4-1/4 percent, I would regard it as somewhat of a monetary shock if it came in at 2-1/2 percent or less I think we ought to be concerned about where the economy is going to bulge in the future, and related to that we ought to be continuing to produce a monetary growth rate in the 3 to 3-1/2 percent range if we want to get an adequate response in the real economy and maintain our control over inflation So, I would lean strongly toward looking for a way to get monetary growth moving again and that obviously would require us to give a little operating room to the federal funds [unintelligible] We don't have to do it today; but certainly if these numbers look like this going into the meeting, I would recommend that we consider lowering the funds rate at that time My last point is simply that I think it would not be politically acceptable to be outside the target range, particularly in this environment   If we're to serve [the needs of] economic policy, then we ought to have a monetary policy that is credible and consistent Putting more fluctuation in the funds rate doesn't provide the markets much information with respect to either one of those goals I would be in favor of trying to link the funds rate to a broader target like M2, but even tying ourselves to an aggregates target without any explicit long-term objective in mind seems to me to run the risk of introducing some uncertainty with that target as well So, just to follow up on what Bob Parry suggested Although I wouldn't go for nominal income targeting, I would like to link the funds rate a little more tightly to a broad aggregate like M2, but then I would like to have a multi-year price level objective in mind so that we don't introduce more uncertainty by focusing more on the monetary aggregates  Well, that gets back to a thought that I had when Dave was speaking It's not clear in my mind what you mean about research It seems to me that we've done a lot of research; more can be done Are you getting at the idea that the problem of implementing some of those research findings has more to do with the Committee's view about multiple objectives rather than focusing on a single objective? Are you saying that we have some research to date--  That's right  I think there's some merit in focusing on our longer-term objective right up front and consistently saying what it is The question is whether we can agree on it I guess we can as long as we don't put a time frame around it If we start to say we're going to do it in three years or five years, then I think disagreement will arise But I think highlighting that as the major policy thrust over time is important  I think we're trying to serve two purposes here One is to provide information And the second is procedural to help us conduct our policy affairs and make sure we're getting things right Where I come out on the information question is that there's not much informational content because what these five or six factors that we list tell people is that we have multiple objectives We can say price stability and long-term economic growth until we're blue in the face; but if we list those, we're signaling to the market that those things are important to us and we'll shift them around when we feel like it I don't like the list personally because I don't think half of the items should be in there So, I'd go essentially for Bob Black's and Tom Melzer's suggestion and reduce the list I guess that's 4b on page 3 of Don's memo  On this issue of concerns about the economy, we do pick up the same concerns when talking with business people But when one pokes at their order books and asks them what is going on, really it's a matter of perception in that they [anticipated] they were going to get a stronger kick than they have gotten and their orders are either flat or up only marginally So there is this lack of fulfillment of their expectations about what a recovery is all about There are a couple of points to make about that I didn't look at the numbers, but I suspect that going into a recovery in past cycles there was a lot more monetary stimulus in place, which ultimately led to some problems So, I would tend to argue that this ought to be the kind of recovery one should have rather than the other kind In terms of the risks that the economy is facing, I prefer to look at it the other way around Namely, that a major mistake--if there's one being made or the risk of one being made--is that inflation expectations are too high relative to the policy that we've been delivering And it's crucial right now in the [wage and price] setting processes that people recognize the kind of policy that we've delivered because if they don't and they set prices too high, then another adjustment will have to be made People's [sales] expectations won't be fulfilled in terms of their price increases And it seems to me that the only way to convince people, given that we don't tie ourselves more explicitly to a price level target, is simply to wait it out The problem with waiting it out for better numbers-- and I'm confident that we're going to get those because I think we've put a policy in place that will generate a lower rate of inflation in the near term--is that we're in the business of trying to change expectations and get people to adjust their price setting to reflect the policy we've delivered Yet we could be in a position I think, at least I hope, of trying to boost monetary growth at the same time So, this is a long-winded way of getting back to the idea that we probably ought to tie ourselves to multi-year targets and they ought to be associated with the price level so we don't end up in this circumstance again  The Fourth District hasn't changed much [Business activity] didn't go down a lot and is not coming back very strongly The consumer side is picking up a little The capital goods side is  -29-    8/20/91  rather mixed; some people feel they're at the bottom; others show slight improvements in their order books Overall, the District is holding up pretty well because it didn't go down much  I have two questions for you, Don One is on the P* chart Have you run that out any further in terms of assuming a monetary growth rate in the middle of the target range and seeing what you would get for the inflation rate in 1993?    8/20/91  We did it and it comes out to be 1-1/2 percent  But my second question to you is Do you have any sense of what kind of deviation from trend growth in M2 for a period of time has an impact on the economy?  Mr Chairman, I can live with your suggestion I would prefer to move now--not because I'm so wedded to M2 that I'll live and die with it, but because it's the instrument that we've been using In terms of our targeting, it's the one we've been telling the market that we were going to deliver on, and we're running the risk of falling outside the target range It also seems to me to be the aggregate that better affects the future I don't know what we can do about the economy today or tomorrow; I don't think we can do much But we can do something about 1992 And if we've erred and M2 comes back, then I'm perfectly prepared to reverse course But I judge policy essentially by rates of change in the monetary aggregates, and we're deviating from trend [M2 growth by] perhaps as much as 2 percentage points What we think we know about that is that it's going to slow the economy--unnecessarily, I think--in 1992 So, I would urge you to move sooner rather than later
