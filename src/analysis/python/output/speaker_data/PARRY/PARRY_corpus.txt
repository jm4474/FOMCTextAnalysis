 Do you think the long-term effect of lower oil prices will be negative for the dollar? Can a case be made that longer term it could have favorable effects, particularly in relation to sterling and the Canadian dollar?   I like your model forecast   Yes   But the debt is denominated in dollars   Our forecast of real GNP is really quite similar to that of the Board staff's; it's just a couple of tenths higher There are significant differences in the composition, however When I look at the differences that we have in residential investment, I actually think that I would be more comfortable with the Board staff's forecast; consequently, we might even conclude that our forecast would be even stronger relative to the staff's than I first thought   One other point I would make is close to that made by Frank Morris Given recent developments, I think there is an excellent chance that growth in the first half will be stronger than indicated by the Board staff's forecast--and for that matter, by our own But I have a feeling growth is going to be more in final sales than in inventories because I don't think there is much indication that inventories are going to grow at a very rapid pace in the first half of the year There is a fairly significant difference between us and the Board staff on the rate of inflation; actually, we are almost a point higher in 1986 and somewhat lower as it turns out in 1987 That mainly reflects the differences in the way we see the interaction of the effects of a lower value of the dollar and oil prices As I mentioned before, we see lower oil prices having their major impact on inflation in 1987 whereas the dollar's major impact on inflation is centered more toward the end of 1986 In any case, if one looks out to the price level at the end of 1987, I don't really see much that would differ  If I may make a few comments about the Twelfth District It appears to us that the District's economy is expanding at a faster pace than the national average Geographically, it seems that the  -14-    2/11-12/86  strength is centered in California, Arizona, and Hawaii One of the more striking numbers that we received on Friday was that California's unemployment rate fell to 58 percent; that's a huge drop in the last two months I wasn't able to get the numbers on where all of the growth in employment was but I would suspect that it was in services, where it always is strong, and in addition to that in construction since the weather has been quite good By industry, the strength is in consumer spending, particularly for services and durables; we see good growth in residential construction and in addition, defense- related aerospace and electronics The weakness centers in nondefense electronics, where there is so much foreign competition; in agriculture, which continues to suffer from some of the same ills that it has for the past two or three years; and in mining and oil drilling and forest products, although one can make a case that there is a slight light at the end of the tunnel with regard to forest products Our expectation is that for 1986 the District will outpace the growth of the rest of the nation by probably 1 percentage point; if one were to focus just on California, I think it could be even greater   I would emphasize the continuing uncertainties with regard to the demand for money and that leads me to argue for a wider range; I would recommend 3 to 8 percent I think we ought to keep in mind that Ml, even with a 3 to 8 percent range, is likely to grow at the upper end of the range Since the Board staff's forecast calls for 68 percent growth, I think it's important to keep in mind that nominal growth in our forecasts seems collectively to be a bit above that and, therefore, growth in the upper end of even a 3 to 8 percent range would be likely Finally, I would favor retaining Ml as a target for 1986 for the reasons expressed by quite a few others and particularly by Mr Melzer   Why not widen the range on that one, if there are so many uncertainties?   Sure   It seems to me that recent economic statistics suggest that there will be surprises on the plus side in the first half of the year I don't know what that implies for the second half but in that kind of environment alternative B would seem to be the appropriate policy to follow With the strength that may be present in the first half of the year, I don't think alternative A would be an appropriate policy to follow   Is a range of $200 to $400 million inappropriate?   Mr Chairman, although recent statistics certainly present a mixed picture of the economy, I believe that the fundamentals will produce a relatively strong pickup in the second half Our forecast for the second half of the year is a little less robust than the Board staff's forecast, but I think that is due to the fact that we do not have the dollar declining as sharply as the Board staff's forecast does Plus, we do not have the same term structure adjustment that produces as low long-term rates as in their forecast In any case, we are expecting real growth to average roughly 3 percent for 1986 and a similar growth rate for 1987 Our inflation rates are quite similar We don't have as much of an increase in inflation in 1987 but I think that again is probably due to the difference in assumptions about the value of the dollar between us and the Board's staff  As for developments in the District, I think there is basic strength in the Twelfth District but the picture is still somewhat mixed We do have weakness continuing in agriculture, and energy has imparted a lot of weakness in certain areas of California and has produced very bad effects in Alaska But in the forest products area, where we have had nothing but weakness in the last several years, we are beginning to hear more optimistic talk; and even in agricultural there is some improvement, I think, particularly in those areas such as almonds and wine where there are export markets that are of some significance The employment picture in California, I would interpret as being relatively good There have been steady gains in employment in California We have seen a very erratic picture for the growth of the labor force and that has caused the unemployment rate to jump around most recently from 58 to 72 percent But that is solely the effect of changes in the labor force and employment continues to rise As for other areas of strength in the Twelfth District construction is quite strong; residential construction and aerospace remain strong; and commercial aircraft orders throughout the District--Washington and California, in particular--are quite strong One small comment on Tom Melzer's point We are seeing refinancings that oftentimes involve a loan that is somewhat larger than the existing loan In addition to that, there are a lot of lenders who will fold the points into the    4/1/86  loan itself So, I don't know how much of a cash flow bind refinancing is in the state of California   I think that Alaska is a disaster situation   That's right   I haven't heard of any   What if you looked at domestic output?   Would you have inflation the same in 1987 as in 1986 if the dollar didn't depreciate from this point?   That's what I mean   Almost all of that increase in inflation is due to what happened to the dollar?   Isn't that the assumption of the forecast? I thought a flat yield curve was the assumption of the forecast   I mean the shape of the curve   I would favor alternative B for many of the reasons that were mentioned I think the possibility of a pickup in the second half of the year is a sufficient condition to recommend alternative B I would make the point that the assumption under alternative B of the relationship between the economy and the aggregates basically states that we are going to see a continuation of a sharp decline in velocity And I would just raise the possibility that given this economy, with these interest rates, we could even see the aggregates grow more slowly--which should not be interpreted as a  -24-    4/1/86  tightening move The second point I would make is really a question, since I am rather new at this Under the operational paragraph, we said last time "maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions" If we were to adopt alternative B, we would say the same thing; but shouldn't there be a parenthetic phrase inserted to say the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions that has persisted since the cut in the discount rate? Because, in effect, if we had cut the discount rate and didn't change the borrowing assumption, we actually would have eased reserve positions And the historical record--   Yes   In alternative B, in terms of growth of the aggregates, Ml is 7-1/2 percent   Well, the staff has said that the second-half's growth will be 4 percent on average, right? The question then is Does the group think, if it's going to be on either side of that, that it's more likely to be less than that or more likely to be higher? If I recall the discussion, I think there were only one or two who said they thought growth would be greater than that 4 percent That might give some indication of lack of symmetry, in terms of the way we discussed it   Sam, what has been the change in the yen relative to other countries that are competitive with Japan like Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong?   Did that revision in the first quarter make you somewhat more pessimistic about the second quarter in terms of inventories?   Jim, with regard to the forecast, if one were to assume tax reform roughly similar to the Packwood proposal, given the difference in timing between the elimination of exemptions and the    5/20/86  effectiveness of the lower tax rates, how would that affect your estimates of real growth in 1987?   A short one will do   My view about the outlook is very similar to that presented by Jim, both in terms of real growth and also inflation I would also agree that the dichotomy between what appear to be very favorable fundamental factors and the current sluggish performance of the economy clearly persists However, in one area--the dollar--it would appear as though the favorable fundamentals for growth have improved, as Sam indicated The dollar is now 6 to 7 percent less than it was in early April when we last met On the other hand, I feel as though the current greater likelihood of tax reform indicates that fiscal policy may move in the direction of somewhat greater restraint than we have in our forecast and perhaps in Jim's as well  In the Twelfth District we feel as though there are convincing signs of improvement Southern California appears to be in the midst of a broadly based expansion, with particular strength in residential construction In the Pacific Northwest, the forest products industry is posting its best performance in several years, with prices of some products up 22 percent over year-ago levels The semiconductor industry is improving somewhat and strengthening orders for commercial aircraft have benefited companies such as Boeing in Seattle as well as many subcontractors in California Finally, lower gasoline prices and concerns about terrorism abroad are expected to boost tourism revenues very substantially, especially in the Northwest with the added draw of Canada's Expo Just as an aside, we know from an Alaskan banker that there isn't a room available in Anchorage for the entire summer as a result of the pickup in tourism activity So cancel that city from your list Areas heavily dependent on agriculture and energy continue to suffer, however In California, drilling and rig activity are down very sharply and Alaska has been particularly hard hit Estimates are that each dollar decline in oil prices costs the state of Alaska about $150 million in revenue loss   It should be substantial in terms of changes in depreciation regulations Also, for rentals I think the maximum loss one can write off is $25,000, which is not very large   On the point that you made, Mr Chairman, about the reduced growth among our trading partners Related to that is the fact that their currencies have appreciated even more, so that in itself is a factor that may be an offset   I would choose alternative B, which I feel is consistent with growth of around 3-1/2 percent in 1987 and further declines in unemployment It seems to me that alternative A is not as desirable because of my concerns about the value of the dollar and its inevitable inflationary implications Also, if we were to choose alternative A, it would come in the context of already very favorable fundamental factors; those that we've mentioned would include lower interest rates, lower oil prices, a value of the dollar that is considerably lower than expected, and of course, the strong growth in M1 Alternative A does not appear to me to be consistent with a goal of longer-term price stability Also, at this point I would not favor "C" because I think it runs the risk of not permitting good growth in 1987 On the other hand, my concern about the future direction of inflation and also the persistent strength in Ml would lead me to favor variant III of the directive To inform financial markets that there is concern on our part about the growth of money would seem to make some sense  The other point I'd just add parenthetically is that I can come up with a scenario where M2 and M3 may become somewhat more of a problem Over the last 6 months to a year we've seen an awful lot of money going into mutual funds, stocks, bonds, and municipals, and when investors believe that the interest rates are going to turn those funds are going to come back to short-term assets And if they come back short, they're going to go into M2 and M3 and we could see much    5/20/86  faster growth in M2 and M3 at that point--primarily as a result of portfolio shifts It would not necessarily indicate that people are going to be using these [funds] for transaction purposes But I wouldn't derive a great deal of comfort by the well-behaved pattern of M2 and M3 at this point   Are you saying that if money does not slow at all over the next six weeks and we have continued [high] growth rates, that you would not be of a mind to make a move?   I think that's really where the difference is I think there are some people who say they would I think that's a difference of substance  -32-    5/20/86   I think I wouldn't want to say that What I would want to say is that if money continues to grow, I have a concern I think you're saying that if money continues to grow you don't have this concern until you see some other things occurring I am not so sure that I could support that   Well, it depends on what happens to the economy   But even there I have a problem because these are not contemporaneous events If one is expecting the real developments  -36-    5/20/86  to follow what has happened with regard to the aggregates to some extent, then if we are waiting for that kind of confirmation and it occurs, we may have to do a lot more later than we would like to do   It's obviously closer   Governor Angell, I think we all agree that if money begins to grow more slowly, we would have some degree of comfort in that I think the first issue, and one where we seem to have some disagreement, is what if it doesn't? What does that imply in terms of what we say and do?   Of course   To me the phrase "if such a slowing does not develop" was the one that made the difference    5/20/86   That is one of the nice things about alternative III   I never was off it   "Pronounced" makes the difference   This intervention is not directed at some momentary instability in the market? You are talking about something to change the direction of the currency?   The purpose of this is to communicate to the market what we think--   What I'd like to ask Sam about is this If you have a situation where the French and the Germans and the Japanese did nothing and we eased policy and we intervened, I have the feeling that the New York traders would sell dollars   Well, if they think that it's going to come back to a natural rate then you're giving them even more profit because you took the dollar up They'll sell and then [unintelligible] down Right?   Traders very often have bet against intervention because intervention hasn't been very successful   But [unintelligible] with the fundamentals   Yes   The small decline in inventory investment in the second quarter has a very important influence on the strength and pattern of growth in the second half The April numbers certainly would support that kind of conclusion In terms of the production numbers for May and what you anticipate for June and the personal consumption expenditures for May, do you think that you might see an even greater reduction in inventory investment than what you have in the forecast? Would you be more optimistic?   But the PCE expenditures for May, at least at some point I hope in that area [unintelligible]   Yes, I have a question for Mr Truman One of the things that I think has had a big impact on our import demands has been the failure of the values of currencies in Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan to change relative to the dollar What are you anticipating in the forecast with regard to these areas, and what impact is that likely to have on our import demands?   Isn't the impact of energy price developments even greater for them because it's a multiplier--   There is less of an offset to the higher increases in other components in 1987 than in 1986 and that can do it   I would be strongly against rebasing and also against changing the range It seems to me that basically we have all concluded that we don't know very much about the relationship between money and economic activity in the last 18 months, but more importantly, that we don't have much confidence that we will know all that much more in the future Consequently, it seems to me that the most honest thing to do is to leave the range for Ml where it is and simply indicate, as is shown in the proposed language of variant I, that for 1986 we are leaving the range at 3 to 8 percent but we are not going to pay a great deal of attention to it As far as 1987 is concerned, it seems to me that if you buy that--particularly if you buy the idea that we are not confident of knowing what kind of relationship will exist between economic activity and money in 1987, then the choice is really an obvious one, and that is Don't set a range Because if we set a range--be it a range from a changed base    7/8-9/86  or whatever--it implies that we have some degree of confidence about a reassertion of a predictable relationship between money and economic activity And I don't have that confidence   I have two additional comments With regard to 1986, I would be reluctant to support either alternative I or II because I don't have much confidence that they could be reached, particularly if for some reason we felt that a somewhat more accommodative policy would be appropriate in the shorter term The second point relates to a comment Jerry made I agree with Jerry that we should have a target for M1 to operate on in 1987 But please keep in mind that this is July of 1986, and what we basically could be saying is that we are not specifying a target in July because we do not have enough information One could certainly address that issue for 1987 at the beginning of December, if one wanted to, for operational purposes   If you talk about language for 1986, variant I doesn't use the term "monitoring" but accomplishes it   I think it's nice without it    7/8-9/86   Doesn't the language of that first variant get us out of some of these problems? It doesn't use the word "monitor" but it says on the second page on page 21 [of the Bluebook] "In light of the uncertainties and of the substantial decline in velocity in the first half of the year, the Committee decided that growth of M1 in excess of the previously established 3 to 8 percent range for 1986 could be acceptable, depending upon the behavior of" etc   Page 21, the second line beginning with "In light of" This is variant I   And that gets away from having to use the word "monitor"   Oh yes, for 1986--the one we established in February   Our forecast is very similar to that of the Board's staff We do have a slightly more rapid pickup in the second half of this year, but I must admit that more recent information that we have about inventories raises the likelihood that the pickup will get a later start Also, our forecast for business fixed investment is slightly greater than that of the Board's staff For 1987, our forecast for growth is virtually the same We differ in our inflation forecast; but I think our forecast of a percentage point higher number for inflation is not all that significantly different, given the uncertainties associated with the forecast at this time  In the Twelfth District, the general economic picture remains quite mixed We have quite a few industries that are doing well, such as commercial aircraft, electronics, and retail trade But we also have our share of weak industries Agriculture is weak and a little weakness has shown up again in the forest products area The thing that I would like to note is that in recent discussions with our directors and also with our business and agricultural advisory council and others in the business community, there has been a noticeable erosion of confidence in the last month or two Before we were hearing optimistic signs from all of these people; now they seem to think that things have become noticeably worse Basically, I think their comments are reflecting the weakness that actually did occur in the second quarter And frankly, they expect it to continue in the second half I sometimes think that their forecasts are based primarily on what they see over their shoulder or what they are experiencing at the present time But I think it is significant that their sentiment has changed in the last month or so On Thursday, we will have a meeting of our board of directors It's interesting to note that at the last two board meetings there has been a very close vote against lowering the discount rate; I really think it's quite likely that that's going to change at this Thursday's meeting   I guess I come out differently It seems to me that if we want to signal a concern about continuing to make progress against inflation, it might be a very good move to reduce it by half a point   It seems to me that if we are possibly going to become somewhat more accommodative in the shorter term, then it would be useful to have a message about our continuing concern about inflation over the longer term And I can't think of a better way to do that than to reduce the range for 1987 at the same time that we are going to be talking about the possibility of shorter-term ease   It seems to me that we all are saying that we don't have any confidence about the relationship between money and the growth of economic activity at this time Therefore, I don't understand why anyone would try to set a range for 1987 at this time Is there some procedural reason why it makes sense?   It's possible   --before year-end or something like that   That puts the funds rate about where?   But that's not an unchanged degree of restraint if the discount rate is down and we maintain borrowing at $300 million   You would want a higher level of borrowings   I would favor the recommendation of Bob Forrestal and Karen Horn reducing the discount rate by 50 basis points and maintaining the borrowings at $300 million I hope that we would characterize that as a lesser degree of reserve restraint because it is   Just say that we are going to try to achieve a lesser degree of reserve restraint For practical purposes, that [discount rate reduction] causes the funds rate to go down 50 basis points   I don't understand what you accomplish by doing that   How would a narrowing of the range be interpreted?   I think there probably will be about three articles in the financial journals talking about it, saying we are getting closer to interest rate targeting or something like that   Let's vote   Jim, do you have those numbers for inventories and net exports in the second quarter in real terms?   Dollars   That change in inventories from the first to the second quarter is very substantial I don't recall exactly what you have for the third quarter, but does that raise the possibility in your mind that we actually could get more growth in the third quarter as inventories perhaps come back into better alignment with what activity is?   We don't know--   Yes   As I'm sure you know, there's a lot of port activity on the West Coast and the--   Port activity on the West Coast The international trade picture there is very mixed The public figures on port activity really don't provide much of an indication of a turnaround in the net export picture But having said that, we certainly have picked up information that there are several key products where the situation has changed rather dramatically There are larger exports of such things as citrus and almonds, particularly to the Far East Wine is doing quite well and, just looking at it from the net export position, there has been a very substantial decline in imports again Wood pulp is up significantly as well as seafood So there seems to be some change but it's more anecdotal at this point and hasn't shown up in the port [activity figures]   Yes, I'd like to return to the trade issue a minute Clearly, the lags are very long in terms of improvement I really don't have great difficulty with where the Board staff's forecast ends up at the end of 1987 We're slightly more pessimistic, but not much more It would seem to me important for those who are negative to quantify how much they are negative If they don't see improvement, then I think that turns what might be an acceptable economic performance in 1987 into something that clearly is unacceptable So, I'd like to know what the degree of pessimism is here on the part of those who are not optimistic   To continue along the line of inflation, Jim, your forecast for the fourth quarter of 1986 shows a fairly significant drop in the inflation rate from the third quarter I know most model forecasts are monotonic and I wonder if you had something in there that is special that we should note since the price level in your forecast is probably a lot lower than a lot of other people have   Yes The deflator goes from 25 percent to 2 percent and that's not usually what happens in a model forecast   Okay   Okay   So the domestic deflator probably would show this continuing increase   Okay, thanks   What is the assumption about borrowing?   Wouldn't "B" be roughly consistent with that? It seems to me that "A" would be consistent with a discount rate change of more than one-half point   Oh, really? But you have a midpoint on the fed funds range which differs by a full percentage point That's all [unintelligible] associated with "A" or "B," one-half percentage point    8/19/86   Just to pursue the point a little further If we reduce the discount rate 50 basis points and keep borrowings at the current level, it seems to me we're talking about a funds rate that is about 5-3/4 percent That seems to me more consistent with "B" I would call that more "B plus" than "A" So it would seem to me logical to go for alternative B even if one were in favor of a half- point reduction in the discount rate   No I am not talking about keeping borrowing the same in both discount rate environments   No, I am saying I think it is closer to "B" than to "A"   I would favor alternative B I have many of the same fears that have been mentioned by Presidents Corrigan, Stern and Melzer about an easier policy I am especially troubled by the implications of an easier policy as far as the growth of the aggregates is concerned With regard to the discount rate, I think a case can be made that there is no urgency at this point and that, really, there probably is a reason to delay a decision for a couple of weeks In the next couple of weeks we are going to get a lot of data about the economy Although that may not provide any definitive information, it is certainly going to provide a lot more information about the beginning of the third quarter than we have at the present time So, it seems to me that "B" with no change in the discount rate is a reasonable course to follow for the next couple of weeks   Isn't one possibility just to maintain the $300 million and when a discount rate change occurs, if it does, to revisit the issue of reserves at that time?   Do we anticipate that that growth will continue? I noticed that the assumption about growth for the OECD countries has a fairly sharp fall-off in the second quarter   The inventory pattern that you have for the third and fourth quarters I know is related to autos, but what indication do you have that that disinvestment in the third quarter is likely to come about--particularly in light of the numbers that we have for inventories in July?   The other issue is on net exports You have roughly a $17 billion growth in the second half coming from net exports Going to the July data again, the fact that you get an improvement of roughly $7 billion in the third quarter looks a little suspect at this point   I get the impression that your level of confidence is not the highest on that one   Okay   The improvement in, let's say, the period from the fourth quarter of '86 to the fourth quarter of '87 certainly looks reasonable; it's that pattern in the last half   Yes, it's other things equal   I'd like to ask a question about the inflation rate that you have, the implicit deflator, and the dollar The very small increase in inflation in the fourth quarter we talked about last time and you mentioned that it's primarily the fact that the deflator on imports is rising That's part of the story in the sense that in subsequent periods one would expect that as profit margins get narrow the [price increases] would get passed on in terms of higher domestic prices on goods that use imports as raw materials, and also in terms of domestic goods that compete with imports How do you explicitly capture that? Do you do deflators by sector or is this a judgment?   So that would be adding how much--roughly a percent?   Was there a revision in the--   Do I remember correctly that you said most of those major Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas orders were not booked yet?   So there could be even greater strength coming along   And they're big orders   The economic situation in the Twelfth District is basically unchanged from the last meeting, but I think there are a few more signs of strength in the District In August, growth of employment in California was very rapid And the July-over-July increase for the entire District, which of course includes 9 states, was a full percentage point greater than the national average, with only Alaska and Oregon being under that average Even in a few of the problems areas of the District we see some glimmers of greater strength The mining industry got a boost recently in Utah with the signing of a 4-year contract by Kennecott with the mining union that is going to result in a resumption of production and will probably add about 2,000 workers between now and the middle of next year The lumber industry is doing quite well at the present time It has been helped by several developments, including strong domestic demand for lumber and a 22 percent increase in exports in the first half There's also an industry strike in British Columbia which is affecting the Pacific Coast lumber industry positively And there is an expectation, in the industry at least, that the International Trade Commission is going to find that British Columbia has subsidized soft- wood exports and that that's going to accrue to our benefit On the negative side, as far as the District is concerned, most of the talk centers around the tax bill and is basically in line with what Si Keehn mentioned  Our forecast is similar to that of the Board staff's with the exception that we don't have quite the same pattern for net exports and inventories, particularly in the second half of 1986, and for inflation over the entire period We agree that the trade account is likely to be an important source of growth in 1987 but we are not very confident that the turnaround will occur in the third quarter or that we'll get as much strength in the entire second half as indicated by the Board's forecast We looked at some data that we have for Pacific Coast customs districts, which represent about 25 percent of all trade Those data have a lot of problems, including the fact that they are nominal--we don't have any deflators in them--but they do indicate that the trade balance has deteriorated consistently through July It appears as though that deterioration is a result of greater imports from Canada, Mexico, and perhaps also the Pacific Basin mix In the inventory area, we see more strength in the third quarter and perhaps a little less in the fourth I must admit that the contribution to growth of $258 billion in the fourth quarter in the Board's forecast is quite a bit more than we have Also, we do not have such a sharp fall-off--going from 56 to 09 percent--in final sales So, there's quite a difference in pattern but we end up with a real GNP growth which is not that much different for the second half Finally, I have a somewhat greater concern about inflation through 1987 than is in the Board staff's forecast We talked about that a little in the discussion I think there is a chance that we'll see more of an effect in other sectors of the passthrough of the higher dollar cost of imports I also wonder if the growth rate of the economy, averaging 3 percent between now and the end of 1987, would    9/23/86  enable producers to pass along larger price increases than are incorporated in the Board staff's forecast As a result, our inflation rates have a tendency to be running about a percentage point higher than those shown by the Board staff   We still don't know It's mainly in British Columbia and that's why it seems to be accruing to the benefit of--   The one domestically has been settled   Yes   It was mainly rules I don't know what it was on wages is not nearly as optimistic as because it is apparently accruing very much to the benefit of  is not as much affected--   Yes   Alternative B would be my choice We have been expecting the fundamentals to produce a pickup in economic activity, and it appears from the recent data that that is occurring At the    9/23/86  same time, I think financial markets are concerned about inflation and the effects of a particularly easier policy on long-term rates and the value of the dollar would be adverse at this point I share Tom's concern about overshooting our targets for M2 and M3 If I had to introduce a nuance, it would be at least in terms of verbiage leaning slightly toward greater restrictiveness   Isn't this the same discussion as last time? I think it was 7 to 9 percent, the same numbers   There are two effects It's the change in weights and then the change in prices  SPEAKER(?) One question about the near term I noticed that you have a fair runoff in farm inventories and also an increase in government Is that an offset? Is there a CCC thing going on there?    11/5/86   Well, that should show up in government spending at the same time It didn't last quarter, I don't think Government spending last quarter actually declined very substantially The rate of growth in the fourth quarter was up, so maybe it just got swamped   Are there any indicators that support the slowing in state and local spending to that extent?   I think there have been more signs of possible strength in the economy since the last FOMC meeting than there have of weakness The signals that we see coming from the Twelfth District, on balance, are really rather positive Total employment and unemployment figures showed continued improvement in September and they paint a better picture than that for the nation as a whole As an example, the District's unemployment rate fell in September, in contrast to the nation's, to 68 percent; and we've seen employment growth over the past year averaging just under 5 percent compared to 22 percent nationally We also received data on trade from the Pacific area customs districts for August and September and nongrain agricultural exports, particularly cotton and also rice, seem to be benefiting from the lower dollar and also from the effects of the 1985 farm bill The lower dollar and Canadian strikes are also helping the forest products industry Aero-space and related electronics are a source of considerable strength in many areas of the District and the service industries are performing well  At the national level, it would appear to me that the signs are relatively strong--clearly not as strong as the western region, but favorable Recent monthly statistics that have been mentioned for orders, for new home sales, and for leading indicators in merchandise trade do indicate some strength And I do believe, similar to the Greenbook [forecast], that the third-quarter runoff of inventories should lead to greater production in the current quarter And it would seem to me that based upon, admittedly, a very preliminary reading of the third-quarter trade numbers that there is a chance of a turnaround in net exports in the fourth quarter The monthly trade numbers for August and September looked as though they had improved somewhat and, at least in some of the deflators I've looked at, the prices of durable imported goods are rising rapidly So it appears as though the prices of US exports are becoming more competitive In summary, our forecast for growth in '87 is very close to that of the Greenbook We expect a pickup in inflation next year of relatively modest proportions The changes in our forecast since the last FOMC meeting produced a little lower rate of inflation next year, so our forecast suggests a better trade-off between growth and inflation than we had before   I'm not quite sure I understand what you're saying, Ted You have a $193 billion improvement in the real net export position That's got to show up--   Yes, but I think it's going to show up in the monthly numbers; if the monthly numbers get much worse than they were in September you're not going to get a $193--   I see   So you're comfortable with the second-half improvement?   Yes   [Unintelligible]   I think on the payroll survey they wouldn't show up, because many of the companies that do this actually keep them on the books for maybe a three- or six-month period   So I don't think they would show up   Ted, you focused on net exports for 1987 The growth that you have for the fourth quarter of 1986 is very large   It is certainly interesting to note that the growth in real terms is $286 billion for the fourth quarter of which $272 billion--   Are you saying that in the estimation the interest rate elasticity may be somewhat higher than is really the case--that it may be more of a one-time shift?   As I recall our discussion about Ml in July, after lengthy discussion, I think we came to the conclusion that it would be best to show a range for M1 and that we would stick with the current range and note all the uncertainties associated with it In 1986 we have had very sharp declines in interest rates We are now expecting, at least on the basis of the general discussion, that interest rates are going to be flat So it seems to me that one could repeat what we set out as a tentative target and feel a little better about it   I basically agree with what Jerry said It seems to me that having Ml still play a role--and with a range--makes some sense   Well, he stated a range He even stated a specific range for Ml, but a monitoring range   Under the assumption of little or no change in interest rates in 1987 and the kind of nominal growth that is incorporated in the staff's forecast, on the basis of the staff's analysis and some analysis that we have done we think we would get growth of M2 and M3 at the lower end of the tentative ranges In fact, we got 5 to 6 percent on M2 and 6 to 7 percent on M3 It seems to me that one could argue for perhaps a 1/2 percentage point reduction in the existing tentative targets [for 1987]--to somewhere around 5 to 8 percent   But the forecast for 1987 is quite different than the experience for 1986 in terms of interest rates, and that's one of the most significant factors in determining the growth of the aggregates So why wouldn't that make a difference in your view?   Yes, but you have to base your determination on expected values and we are expecting--or at least the staff forecast is--that there will be no change in rates If one thought that rates were coming down, that would certainly give a lot of reason to support that If you buy the idea that rates were not going to change very much, why wouldn't you expect a significant slowing?   Change it   Our forecast is about as close as one could get to that of the staff We feel confident that the fourth quarter will show strength of 3 percent or more; I think the available national statistics on production, sales, inventories, and employment would support such a conclusion Plus, what we see in the Twelfth District is indicative of a strong economic picture for the fourth quarter When I look at 1987, one of the things I would note is that, first of all, we do have a fairly sharp slowdown expected in the first quarter; and we have a fair amount of uncertainty about how sharp that slowdown might turn out to be We expect it to be centered on weakness in both nonresidential and residential investment spending We still don't have much of a handle on what the effect of the tax reform is likely to be in 1987 It seems likely that it is providing some strength to the current quarter and also, given the timing of some of the changes in taxes in 1987, that it will be a negative for next year With regard to the trade sector, which we have talked of as a key factor, we did some studies based upon alternative assumptions of the speed of passthrough of import prices and what that might do in terms of the demand for imports And any statistical study we did produced a greater improvement than we have in our forecast and that the Board staff has in its forecast In addition, regional anecdotal evidence suggests--    12/15-16/86   No Even if one uses some of the series that do not have much of a passthrough, you still get a sharper slowing in imports than is included in our judgmental forecast and in the Board staff forecasts that we have seen So I think we are running on judgmental forecasts as far as imports   Right--faster than what we have In other words, if you look at the statistical studies, we all seem to be taking conservative positions with regard to the net exports That's not very comforting, given what we have seen to date We have some regional anecdotal evidence that suggests more signs of a pickup in export volumes in the Twelfth District There has been a strong pickup in foreign demand for aircraft We have had foreign orders for electronic products, including computer graphics and certain measuring devices There is some additional demand for agricultural exports and not much sign at all of any declines in imports, I might point out It appears as though the bottom line, as far as the net export sector is concerned, is that there is a chance of some positive surprises in the trade account   I would favor alternative B mainly because I think there are convincing signs of strength in the economy at the present time But I share the view that the extent of the slowdown which we all seem to agree is likely to occur in the first quarter is uncertain and that, of course, should be noted in the policy statement as well That could be done either in terms of asymmetric language or in some other more direct way   That's right    12/15-16/86   Well, the questions could get a little harder at that point   Peter, my impression is that the price performance of the long-term tax exempt market has been a lot better than the taxable market in this period Is that due to supply or the fact that, with the new tax law, investors really don't have as many opportunities to shelter income as they did before?   The fact that the Bluebook alternative B has a 6 percent funds rate I guess means that you agree, Don   I have a question for Mike Prell on personal income and savings, chart 14 I think it may have some implications  -10-    2/10-11/87  for the PCE forecast The saving rate clearly has been coming down in recent years Your forecast would have that saving rate trending down--not looking at the quarterly pattern, but on average--in 1987 and 1988 Of course, if that did not occur there would be some implications, potentially, for the growth of consumption With disposable income rising more slowly, I can understand why it might be a difficult environment in which to build savings, but at the same time I have difficulty seeing the rates coming down to those levels I don't know if you can ever find saving rates down at those levels Continuing that trend would be of considerable interest and significance   Mr Truman, on chart 6, that wholesale price chart, if that were net of oil, am I correct that probably you would have seen more of a depreciation in the United States than you would in the foreign countries?   But oil is denominated in dollars, so the depreciation of their currencies must have had a very large impact on those indices   So net of oil, our inflation improvement probably was better   I see   I think something of an offset to that, Jerry, is that because of the depreciation of the dollar the foreign investor is, in effect, buying at a cheaper price   I didn't hear you   I would start out by saying that our forecast is not very different from that of the Board staff But I do want to comment a bit on the risks that I see to the forecast because I think they could have implications for policy It would appear to me that the risks as far as inflation is concerned are on the up side We have assumed that the recent decline in the value of the dollar is largely permanent and that the dollar will end 1987 at a lower level than we had in our previous forecast The pass-through of price increases resulting from the dollar's decline has been slow to date, but I believe profit margins of many foreign suppliers of goods to the United States are really quite narrow at the present time and, therefore, future pass-throughs could be considerably greater Secondly, it seems that the momentum of oil prices at the present time is in the direction of rising oil prices, or at least not declining Thus, our assumptions about oil prices could turn out to be too low and inflationary pressures more intense The dollar and also the oil price issue are largely factors that one would presume would be temporary as far as inflation is concerned But a third risk for inflation would be more prolonged, I think, in its impact The staff projection of the unemployment rate at year end is around 6-1/2 percent By some estimates that rate gets close to full employment and thus any positive shock to demand could produce more serious price pressures than are included in the forecast  -15-    2/10-11/87  On the real side, I am basically comfortable with the staff's estimate of just under 3 percent, although there is a risk to the projection, probably, on both sides of the forecast I would like to note two risks on the downside The first one I really was hinting at when I asked the question about the saving rate It seems to me that it is conceivable for the saving rate not to deteriorate from these levels If that were the case, it's possible that consumption would grow at a somewhat slower pace than is incorporated in the forecast Obviously, another major uncertainty on the real side is net exports We have talked about that considerably, but to me a conservative stance would be to assume that the failure of the dollar to decline relative to currencies of numerous important trading partners will lead to an improvement in net exports that is somewhat less than the Board staff's number  On the regional front, we continue to see growth a bit faster than the rest of the nation Last year we saw employment up 35 percent compared to 23 percent nationwide We also saw a huge jump-- 67 percent--in California building permits in December, but that was a response to a large builders fee that went into effect January 1 It's interesting to note that the increase significantly added to the national totals; it probably caused about 17 percent of the increase in the December leading indicators So it was not an insignificant development A couple of other points in the District We had a rather interesting experiment regarding the effects on consumer behavior of the removal of the sales tax deduction Oregon does not have a sales tax, and consequently, one of the things that we observed was that there was no surge in car sales in Oregon in contrast to the year-end surge in other states with sales taxes We also heard from a member of our small business and agricultural advisory council that apparently one major Japanese car maker is beginning to ship stripped down models to the US I think that is interesting because it may mean that the volume of Japanese car imports may not decline as much as had been expected and that, conceivably, price competition in the industry may turn out to be more intense Finally,  pointed out to us that he was having much greater success in selling to the Canadians because they were now substituting our exports for French exports We have been focusing on the failure of the Canadian dollar and the currencies of [unintelligible] countries to appreciate and thus to enable us to cut down on our imports One thing that is sort of interesting is that the failure of their currencies to appreciate relative to ours is probably raising some export opportunities that perhaps we have not been focusing on   Mr Chairman, I would favor alternative II as well And I would make a suggestion as far as sending a message about the commitment to price stability Some work that we've done indicates that it's quite likely that M2 will grow at the lower end of this range and, from reading the Bluebook, I got the feeling that some of the quantitative work the Board staff has done would suggest that as well It seems to me that one thing we could do is have 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for M3 and 5 to 8 percent for M2 That change, as far as M2 is concerned, would represent a full percentage point decline from what we had in 1986 And I think that would send a message   Have M2 at 5 to 8 percent--   And M3 at 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent Some of the work that we've done would support that and--maybe Don can comment on this--I think some of the quantitative work the Board staff has done suggests that M2 would grow in the low end of the range   No, no   I don't vote on the discount rate   If it's written with that warning, the fact that we dropped a specific range won't be interpreted as meaning that we're dropping M1 as something of significance or potential significance in the future   Just a point of clarification The way it has been discussed it's almost as though we're not talking about an operational target but we're talking rather about predicting M1 on the basis of the economy   Yes   How about "significant"?   How about "rapid"?   Yes, just a minor point in the last sentence of the first paragraph Isn't "appropriate changes" a little misleading? Wouldn't it be better just to say "changes"?   That would be better Or just leave it out And if that is the case, it's the same thing in the last sentence of the second paragraph where it refers to appropriate growth It is a little misleading--we are going to evaluate growth in M1 from time to time as to whether or not it is appropriate  -63-    2/10-11/87   No, it says here "appropriate changes in M1 during the course of the year will be evaluated in light of" etc We are going to be evaluating changes as to whether or not they are appropriate   Sam, with the appreciation of sterling and the mark, are pressures developing in the United States?    3/31/87   Mr Chairman, discussions with our directors and others in business in the Twelfth District indicate that business conditions are improving to some extent There clearly are exceptions, and the two that I would note would be Alaska and the central valley of California However, California's total employment has been quite strong California's employment represents 60 percent of the District and it surged in February, pushing the District's unemployment rate below the national average Some fragmentary data that we have on retail sales for the beginning of the year indicate that the fall-off that was so pronounced at the national level in January was not shared by the Twelfth District Also, data that we have on trade from the Pacific Coast ports provide some evidence of improvement in our net export position, as the trade deficit has narrowed significantly in the past 12 months  Turning to the national economy, our forecast indicates a somewhat worse trade-off between growth in output and inflation than is incorporated in the Greenbook We have slightly less growth in 1987 and 1988 and inflation--at least in our forecast for 1987--is 1/2 percentage point higher We have a similar inflation outlook for 1988 because we agree with the Greenbook that we are likely to see upward inflationary pressures arising from import prices persisting through all of next year However, in contrast to the Greenbook, we expect these inflationary pressures to emerge as early as the second half of this year Thus, we see a period of upward pressure on nominal short- term interest rates beginning soon and probably extending into the second half of 1988 In my view, it will be necessary to allow nominal interest rates to rise; if we don't, short-term real rates may be pushed too low We also are looking for somewhat stronger growth toward year-end 1987 than the Board staff, as we have slightly higher consumption and, of course, the trade account begins to improve at that point Thus, we believe that it may be appropriate to allow real interest rates to nudge up toward year-end In our view, it would be a bit too risky to allow the pickup in demand pressures to the point where the temporary price shocks become a factor in longer-term  -18-    3/31/87  inflationary expectations In our view, the gap between actual and potential [GNP] is really pretty small Some estimates that we ran suggest it's on the order of one percentage point Therefore, available slack in the economy is also small, and we think that inflationary risks at the present time are fairly significant   Mr Chairman, I would favor alternative B and, like President Black, I would favor language that tilts toward firmness As I indicated previously, I believe that inflationary pressures will require some interest rate increases in the second half of the year; and if inflationary pressures surface sooner, policy may have to respond earlier as well With regard to the aggregates, I think it's quite likely that we will run into a period where they are growing toward the low end, or even below the low end, if we see interest rates rising If that's the case, we're likely to tolerate that I would think that we would have to change the wording of the directive because the way the directive is worded today any change from the existing reserve restraint depends primarily on the behavior of the aggregates, taking into account business conditions, etc I think we almost want to reverse that and have as the primary determinants what we really are focusing on, which is business conditions and progress against inflation, and so forth   Isn't the important answer that term interest rates would [unintelligible] less of a problem now? With higher interest rates, the chances of success are greater than with constant interest rates   Bob, but the question is What's going to take you there? The question is whether or not you're going to need somewhat higher interest rates to get that smooth movement I think the interest rates that Jerry and others are talking about do not involve doing something to preserve the rate as it exists today  -40-    3/31/87  necessarily, but to provide a more orderly movement And I think that linkage is key   I'll be honest with you I have a little difficulty understanding what that means When I first read that I thought what it was telling the market is don't get confused by our sterilization actions, the fact that we'll be putting in reserves to sterilize our foreign exchange [intervention] I'm not sure I understand what that sentence means I think something probably ought to be in there, but I'm not sure this is it   I think moving the aggregates away from that position is good   Just add a phrase "and the behavior of the aggregates"   Aren't there some operational advantages to perhaps running with a little higher borrowing level? We think of $300 million as being almost the low point that one can reach, and there might be some greater flexibility if we were working with a slightly higher borrowing target in our operations   I think the way to do that, which would capture what we have said, is to say "Somewhat greater reserve restraint might be acceptable depending on developments in foreign exchange markets, the strength of the business expansion, progress against inflation and conditions in domestic and international credit markets, taking into account the behavior of the aggregates" We've got it all there   Well, it's there and it's first   I don't think we have reached an agreement on that, have we?   In Japan, it appears that what they're suggesting is mainly increased construction And those kinds of projects take a long time It isn't so much taxation   Right   But doesn't the differential itself indicate that people think it's going to go down?   On what you've said about the market's reaction so far, are you saying that the market is probably assuming that the borrowing target is higher than it is?   Jim, your forecast for consumption is quite weak, particularly the nondurable and services components and I have a comment and a question With regard to services, as I'm sure you know, there's a strong secular component for the growth of services The growth rate that you have probably is the kind of growth rate that one sees in recession periods To me, that's a bit surprising I think I understand why this is occurring in terms of your forecast I guess the decline in the value of the dollar causes the PCE deflator to go up, which hits real income and then slows the growth of consumption What I'm not sure I see is this Why doesn't that increase in the PCE deflator affect other prices as heavily? I don't think I see it in your inflation rate I don't have these deflators, so I'm trying to--   Would you say, looking at the risks in the consumption area, that they might be on the high side? Well, not durables   Compensation per manhour, which I'm sure is the key element of your inflation forecast, seems to change dramatically    5/19/87  in 1988 Why is there such a change so abruptly? I'm not questioning that it's going to rise It just seems to be going at one level, and you have a step function, and then it stays at that [higher] level   Well, I'm not sure that they're completely inconsistent Almost all the increase that we've seen in the employment area has been in the services area, outside of manufacturing As far as policy is concerned, the question is whether or not relatively full employment of labor resources could lead to demand pressures That could occur in the services area and I wouldn't--   Is that excluding autos?   Mr Chairman, basically, I agree with the staff's forecast of real GNP for this year and next The growth rates of 3 percent and 2-1/2 percent, respectively, certainly seem reasonable to me I also would agree that the primary source of strength is likely to be an improved net export position However, as would be indicated from some of our discussion, I would expect the improvement in this area to be somewhat less and the strength of consumption, particularly that of services, to be slightly greater In the inflation area, I think a good case can be made for a 4 to 4-1/2 percent rate of inflation in the remaining quarters of this year, as compared to the staff's forecast of a gradual decline to a 32 percent rate in the fourth quarter of 1987 We have seen a large increase in the real price of oil, which could have significant effects on the inflation rate during the rest of this year I think it's generally agreed-- certainly in our forecast and the staff's forecast--that prices of non-oil imports are going to continue to rise in an area in excess of 10 percent Moreover, the decline in the unemployment rate, I believe, takes us into the range of full employment of labor resources And, finally, inflationary expectations seem to be more serious, judging from financial market developments for the last six weeks As far as 1988's inflation rate is concerned, there is quite a pickup in the staff's forecast of the inflation rate And I think the factors that I mentioned are likely to cause that to occur   Non-oil import prices were up over 10 percent over the last quarter That's strong That's one area   The other point is that the forecast has the rate--again excluding food and energy--at 5 percent and above for 1988; so it's not only that it has been running relatively high, it's anticipated to pick up as well   Paul, are the rumors sufficient that I could call an institution that I might have some concerns about?   Do you mean an unwinding from April? Is that the special circumstance?  -24-    5/19/87   Mr Chairman, I would support Bluebook alternative C It seems to me that the prospect of high inflation is the main reason to support some tightening from the stated policy at the present time As I mentioned before, it is my view that the economy is certainly close to full employment in terms of labor resources, and we expect the economy to expand this year at a rate which is slightly faster than its current long-run potential growth rate It seems to me that this consideration is particularly important now because of the declining dollar and recent increases in oil prices, which are causing and will cause inflation rates to go up even without any demand pressures I think there is a danger that increases in inflation this year and next could become imbedded in inflation expectations And, given what I think is the apparent strength in the economy, the risk of cutting economic expansion short by such a tightening of policy seems to be small I would have a preference, too, as to how that is accomplished if that is something you want brought up   Yes I would prefer an increase in the discount rate I was going to say that sooner would be better than later but I must admit that this little item that you brought up would suggest to me that maybe it should be a little later   Put "depending on"   Don, your work indicates that the relationship between the spread and borrowing is linear Is it more reasonable to think of that as a nonlinear relationship, since banks have a tendency to become more reluctant to borrow as that spread widens?   Right   Right   I have two questions With regard to the inflation assumptions for 1988 and what might be the interest rate implications We have a forecast of inflation that is really not very much different from what you have for 1988 But to achieve that, to keep a lid on inflation, we had to generate some slack in the economy and that was done by having short-term rates--in this case the commercial paper rate--rise a little more than 200 basis points to 9 percent In your principal assumptions you referred to an appreciable rise in interest rates over the projection period I wonder if you could be more specific What is the extent of that increase in rates and where would you have the commercial paper rate at the end of 1988?   I see The second question is [about inflation] Your forecast for 1988 has a slight upward trend in the last three  -14-    7/7/87  quarters in the fixed-weight deflator And, if I remember correctly, you have import prices rising about 10 percent, the dollar declining less than 10 percent, and little slack in the economy given that the unemployment rate remains relatively constant around 63 percent If you were to continue your projection beyond 1988, it sounds to me as though your forecast implies that inflation rates continue to move up in 1989 Is that correct?   But even a decline in the dollar through 1988 would probably have some inflationary impact in 1989   Yes Thank you   What deflator does the Commerce Department use on their surveys? Don't they use last year's price experience?   So they're probably overstating?   Yes   Our forecast really is in agreement with the broad outlines of the Greenbook forecast We're expecting growth of just under 3 percent this year and a slowdown next year, although perhaps more of a slowdown than is included in the Greenbook This greater weakness that we have is in spite of a little faster growth of consumption It's a result of a smaller improvement in net exports than is in the Greenbook forecast and a somewhat weaker housing sector Our inflation forecast for this year and next, as measured by the fixed-weight deflator is 4-1/2 percent for this year and 4 percent for next year And higher import prices are certainly a significant contributor to these inflation rates But I just want to repeat that the only way we were able to keep inflation to these levels was to  -24-    7/7/87  produce slack in the economy by means of a fairly substantial increase in short-term interest rates on the order of 200 basis points And frankly, I'd be very interested in what types of trade-offs other members of the Committee ran into as they addressed this issue of the relationship between their forecast of inflation and its implications for interest rates in 1988   What kind of interest rate increase do you have in that forecast?   Modest?   But the higher inflationary rate doesn't feed through   Well, I will confine my remarks to 1987 and M2 I think that there is a compelling reason to reduce that range Projections that I have seen, including the Board staff's, would indicate that the growth is going to be about 4-1/2 to 5 percent If indeed that is what the growth is likely to be, why don't we change the range? And 4-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent makes a lot of sense to me   Do you think that is the best target today?   But if you thought that the best target was 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent before, and now six months later you think that it is something lower--which I think most people do even though they say don't change the target--why wouldn't you want to communicate that?   You say it will be at 5-1/2 percent or close to 5-1/2 percent?   I would favor alternative II as it is, mainly because the kind of growth rates of the aggregates that we see for next year are consistent with that As a matter of fact, if one were to look at the projections more precisely, growth of M2 is at that lower end of 4-1/2 percent and one could even argue for a slower growth I don't know, but perhaps the projections of those who are supporting 5 to 8 percent do have 6-1/2 percent growth of M2 in their forecasts I just find that difficult to see   But if you have stable interest rates what inflation rates do you have?   That's sort of the critical question though, isn't it?   I think that interest rates have an effect on the real side as well   What concerns me is that if one goes to these higher rates, one is implicitly saying "I am comfortable with the potential for higher rates of inflation"   Show me the analytic work that leads you to a different direction  -39-    7/7/87   But that is not independent of what happens to inflation For example, work that the Board staff has done and work that we have done would suggest that if you don't get those kinds of increases in interest rates, it has an impact on inflation Would your work show that? What if M2 rose 6-1/2 percent or to the midpoint of the 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent range? What would happen to inflation?   If there are too many unknowns, what do you do? How do you proceed?   I think it is dangerous   One thing I don't understand is what you think the interpretation of not changing it would be Wouldn't not changing it indicate--   By lowering it you wouldn't be tightening Why would you be tightening?   Why would you be tightening?   You mean you would adopt a different borrowings target as a result of that?   Could I ask a question? Don, what was the forecast of M2 in February?   I would like to ask a question about this uncertainty issue and the 4 percentage point band Are we suggesting that there is a greater uncertainty because the analysis that has been presented by staff and others suggests there is greater uncertainty? Or are we just trying to widen the band because there is a greater difference of opinion and we can't fit people within a 3 percentage point range? I think there is a big difference  -51-    7/7/87   Nothing has been said about that   So will I   What about in relation to sterling?   That may indicate whether or not it is related to oil   That's not oil   That's right   I have two questions about the forecast If you were to take another look at your forecast for the third quarter-- incorporating the most recent data with regard to employment, retail sales, and production--do you think the number you'd come up with would be higher? And is it possible that the weakest quarter of the year, in fact, could turn out to be the second quarter?   My second question involves inflation You have a very sharp drop-off, as you did last month, in the second half's inflation rate in terms of the GNP fixed-weight deflator It seems a little surprising to me, particularly given the revisions to GNP data that we saw in the last month and also the somewhat brighter glow to the economic statistics I'm not sure I understand what's causing that   But you have more than a doubling of the growth rate of PCE, and final sales are up very substantially in the third quarter   Not in the third quarter   Mr Chairman, our forecast is in basic agreement with the Greenbook forecast, but I'd agree that the risks, in terms of growth, are on the upside, for many of the reasons that have been mentioned For example, we have assumed the $25 billion deficit- reduction measures which are indicated in the Greenbook, and it's possible that some portion of those measures will not be enacted That's another area, in this case resulting from the government sector, where we could see a greater boost to GNP, at least until some of the secondary impacts of a greater deficit are felt Moreover, when we look at the 12th District, the data to us, particularly in the area of employment and retail sales, indicate strong growth And the discussions I've had over the past month with directors--not only at the head office but also at our four branches--indicate a greater optimism about business prospects than I have ever seen in the year and a half that I've been with the System I'm more pessimistic on inflation than the Greenbook, since I believe that the fixed-weight price index will continue to advance at a 4 to 4-1/2 percent rate in the last half of this year and remain in that range in 1988 It seems to me that recent tightening in labor markets raises the chances of price increases in 1988, and it certainly heightens my longer-run concerns about inflation It would appear to me that, at this point, our room to maneuver is rather limited, with the labor market around full employment, nominal short-term interest rates rising about 100 basis points next year--at least in our forecast--and real interest rates rising only slightly The current forecast that we have and the one that is in the Greenbook hold out little or no prospect of the inflation rate subsiding in the near future   Mr Chairman, I believe a strong case can be made for alternative C and I would characterize that, at least in terms of anticipated effects on interest rates, as being a small move In July, several Committee members expressed the view that a tighter policy would be necessary in the coming months and I think developments since then strengthen that view Most data released since our last meeting suggest that the economy and inflationary pressures are picking up Inflation in the first half was over 4 percent and real growth was at a very strong 3-1/2 percent rate Data that we have seen so far on economic activity in July--particularly employment data, retail sales, industrial production--indicate that the economy remains strong in the current quarter Given that it takes a long time for our actions to affect inflation, I believe we should make a policy adjustment If we delay much longer, until inflation has really gained momentum, more severe action will be required to bring inflation under control For those reasons I would support the adoption of alternative C as presented by the staff   $700 million   Peter, has there been much discussion of the impact of higher interest rates on Treasury requirements? One hears a lot of discussion from the Administration recently about the deficit, at least in fiscal 1987, being somewhat lower than their estimates because of revenues going up But I don't hear much discussion of the impact of higher interest rates on future requirements   I would like to ask two questions about your assumption with regard to fiscal policy This time, as has been the case in the past, there is an assumption that there are spending cuts of around $25 billion I think there is a substantial risk that that will not materialize Some work we have done suggests that if policy is accommodative and you don't get that $25 billion deduction in spending, that it could add approximately a percentage point to growth in 1988 and a half percentage point to inflation Would you think that to be roughly [the magnitude]?   You don't get the $25 billion reduction; you get zero    9/22/87   One further question I notice the change in the assumption you have made with regard to the size of the deficit I guess it would primarily be the higher interest rate assumption over the forecast horizon Does that feed back into income? In other words, is the loop closed in the model so that you get higher growth of disposable income as a result of the higher interest payments on the deficit?   But the underlying inflation must pick up quite a bit, because you have a marked acceleration in labor costs   I just want to raise an issue to shed a little light on this concern about a slowing in the interest-sensitive sectors of the economy, such as housing It seems to me that with the economy operating where it is, in terms of employment at least, if we did not get that slowing in the interest-sensitive sectors of the economy at the same time we are going to get the strength in net exports, we would have a real problem So, one can be concerned about the implications for housing or for other sectors but the picture doesn't really fit together very well if you don't get that kind of slump And I would assume that's the problem   Mr Chairman, with regard to your question about real rates, we look at it in two different ways first of all, through a model approach and, secondly, at the survey that is referred to as the Hoey survey from Drexel Burnham Lambert Both of these give us a similar reading with regard to your question In both of those instances, much of the increase in nominal rates has produced an increase in real rates For example, the Hoey survey shows an increase of only two tenths of 1 percent in inflationary expectations between January and June So, in effect, what we got was a very sharp increase in real bond rates when we saw bond rates increase so sharply in the April-May period This has a big impact on our forecast--and I think also on the Board staff's forecast--because it does damp the growth of the interest-sensitive sectors of the economy In some respects, I draw a little comfort from that because we also have strong growth in the net export area and, in effect, it is the weakness in the interest-sensitive sectors that makes room for this growth in net exports  With regard to our forecast more generally, we estimate that real growth will average between 2-1/2 and 3 percent over the forecast period We have actually shaded slightly our expectations with regard to net exports, but we still have real net exports contributing approximately 1 percent to real GNP growth, both this year and next year Also, and here we have somewhat of a difference with the Greenbook forecast, we have greater strength in consumption in next year's economy than the Greenbook forecast That has something to do with differences about the growth of real disposable income, if I'm not mistaken We are concerned about the inflationary impact, not only of our own forecast but also that of the Greenbook As you know, in the Greenbook forecast, inflation averages 4 to 4-1/2 percent, at least in terms of the fixed-weight deflator; and we are not much different from that But what concerns us is that, in some respects, the composition of that inflation in our forecast changes rather dramatically We are somewhere in a zone close to full employment, at least according to our staff work, and thus, in our forecast and in the Greenbook forecast as well, wage costs begin to accelerate To the extent that the inflation in 1988 is more a function of what I would characterize as underlying factors and less a function of some of the temporary factors that we drew on this year, we think that the inflation problem will become more persistent Finally, I do think that in some important respects, the risks to the outlook are on the upside with regard to real growth and perhaps in inflation as well My primary concern here centers around government spending because I think that the assumption of the $25 billion cut used both by us and in the Greenbook may not materialize And if it does not, then we are likely to get more strength from that sector than is included in our forecast Thank you, Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman, at this meeting, I certainly could support alternative B, but I do have a preference for alternative C, for many of the reasons that I mentioned in the go around The prospect, in my view, is for growth in aggregate demand at, or above, long-run potential Given the fact that the economy is operating in the zone of full employment, this strength in demand, in combination with the declining value of the dollar can be expected to put upward pressures on prices Also, growth in labor costs, which is part of our forecast and that of the Board staff's as well, should lead to an underlying inflation rate that is higher in 1988 Moreover, this inflation prospect could be significantly worsened if the expected reduction in Federal government spending does not materialize Given that it takes a long time for our actions to affect inflation, it is important, in my view, that we not delay until inflation already shows signs of becoming more persistent Finally, I'd make the point that, if I read footnote 1 on page 10 correctly, it looks to me like, in the not too distant future, alternative C is assumed by the Greenbook, as it is in our forecast So when we talk about the economy and its performance, and particularly the Greenbook forecast, please keep in mind that that assumes alternative C in the not too distant future At least that's the way I read that footnote   Doesn't the futures market support that conclusion?   I have a question about borrowing Since October 19th there has been a change in the willingness to borrow What are    11/3/87  your assumptions about how the demand for borrowing may change over the next week or two? Are you assuming that basically the shift is going to continue over that period or that there is going to be a restoration of more normal relations?   Wouldn't that suggest that as long as there is that uncertainty it's probably wiser to focus on rates rather than borrowing levels?   I'm sorry, I'm not used to using words like that!   Probably 7 percent or a little below   That's what I think   Mr Chairman, I have a comment and two questions concerning the Greenbook forecast My comment considering the modest wealth and cost of capital effects of the stock market decline, and also what is referred to as an expected appreciable fall in interest rates, it's surprising to me to see real growth for 1988 at less than 2 percent Now, my first question deals with real disposable income We have talked about this in the past but I think it has even greater importance today Real disposable income in the Greenbook forecast rises so slowly relative to real GNP that I really doubt that that forecast will occur The difference in growth rates is 12 percentage points In our forecast, there's a difference of one tenth of a point; in the Blue Chip consensus of 30 economists, it's two tenths of a point A distinction of that magnitude is, I think, pretty much without historical precedent It is my understanding that the way that occurs is that you have an increase in inflation as a result of higher import prices, which causes the PCE deflator to rise very substantially relative to the GNP deflator And, as I am sure you know, the relationship between the PCE deflator and the GNP deflator is one of the most stable relationships we have We looked back to 1973 and that relationship varied between 988 and 1021 In the forecast, it gets up to 1026, which is an incredibly high level I don't think it has ever been that high And my question is If you had a ratio between the PCE deflator and the GNP deflator which is more traditional, how would that affect the staff's forecast of both?   No I think what happens in their forecast is that the higher import prices show up very dramatically on the consumption side but not on the investment side   Well, perhaps this will happen, but I don't think it has happened to date I'm not sure I will have to look at the 1987 data; I'm not sure we agree on that in the second half   The statistical work that we have done indicates that all of the increase in the PCE over that period that you just cited can be attributed to oil and none of it to foreign exchange   Yes, but it depends on the lag, of course   It's a difference in the forecast   It appears to me that recent developments have had a very substantial impact on [your forecast for] final sales and inventories in the fourth quarter There's a very large impact on inventories in the fourth quarter and then these unintended inventories are worked down over 1988 and that's in large part why growth is so weak in 1988 Why is there such a large impact on final  -14-    11/3/87  sales in the fourth quarter, given the assumptions about modest impacts of wealth and cost of capital effects in recent developments and also the lower interest rate? What if you have an inventory situation that really colors that entire forecast very substantially through the end of 1988?   With regard to developments in the Twelfth District, I think economic conditions remain relatively upbeat and, at this point, very few effects of recent financial developments have shown up yet But, it's clearly too early to see the real effects We are, however, seeing broad-based effects of the reduced value of the dollar, in addition to the greater exports of lumber and selected agricultural products that I mentioned previously For example, a Utah steel plant which was formerly owned by US Steel recently reopened and it was interesting to note that part of the decision to reopen was based upon a German firm's five-year commitment to buy 40 percent of the plant's production I think that is rather interesting In addition, the price of titanium dioxide, which is a key ingredient in paint, has increased substantially due to the dollar's decline; and a major paint manufacturer in our District is turning increasingly to domestic suppliers So wherever we look, we seem to be seeing some effects of the declining value of the dollar in terms of expanded export opportunities or increased import substitution  With regard to the overall economic outlook, we estimate that the wealth and cost of equity capital effects of the stock market decline would reduce real GNP by slightly less than 1 percentage point, assuming an unchanged path for interest rates Given the easing that has already occurred and the expected lower path for interest rates that is mentioned in the Greenbook, we would have  -16-    11/3/87  growth closer to 2-1/2 percent than 2 percent and the employment rate basically unchanged   Why is there such a significant change going from November to December?   Yes M1, and a little on--   All right   Mr Chairman, I would favor Bluebook alternative "B", which I would interpret to mean a funds rate of around 6-3/4 to 7 percent It seems to me that with rates at that lower level relative to what we had been looking at six weeks ago, we will offset most of the negative effects of what has happened in the stock market In addition, I would favor Variant I and it seems to me that, given the uncertainties, symmetrical language would be appropriate  -33-    11/3/87   Symmetrical   I think that would make some sense   If your concern is about the dollar why would you then go in that direction?   Would one be willing to say instead of "may call for" just "calls for"?  SPEAKER(?) Sure   That barn door is no wider now that it has been for years   I think so  SPEAKER(?) I think that would, though   Well, that has been true in certain markets but in terms of demand for borrowing, things are still very different from the pre-October 19th period In fact, it looks as though that difference now may be as great as it ever has been Isn't that correct?   Borrowing would have been $400 million   I was just thinking that it certainly would be very desirable to get back to where we were, with the emphasis on borrowing, but it seems to me that as long as we have the demand for borrowings along its current track that will be extremely difficult to do With the relationship between the discount rate and market rates at its present level, we are so close to frictional levels, your alternative (4) probably ought to be deferred until we see something that would be more of a traditional relationship in terms of demand for borrowing   I think it's important to know that banks have been very poor at making estimates of what their demands would be at the end of the year Typically, it has been almost a perfect, opposite indicator of what the demands were going to be Last year there was a large demand that some people said was associated with the new tax legislation To assume that that's going to carry on into 1987, I think requires some--   Well, the mere fact that they are positioning themselves, for example, in the CD market to go out beyond year-end probably--   It probably indicates that you won't get the borrowing at the end of the year That's what I'm saying   One of the interesting things, of course, is that 30-day CD rates are about 25 basis points higher than the 90-day rates   Don't you think the market will figure that out pretty quickly?   Don, I was trying to remember a discussion that we had last February My recollection is that the econometric work that was done by your staff, and obviously some of the other staffs, would have supported setting targets which were somewhat lower than the ones we did set and would have indicated a distinction between M2 and M3 growth of perhaps a percentage point And, of course, that's the way things have worked out But, the complicating factor is that the economy has changed a bit since we were looking at it at that time Nominal growth in the economy has been higher; probably, if we had had that nominal growth when we did the analytic work, we would have expected faster growth in the aggregates But I don't remember what we were assuming about interest rates   Right Right   Well, the point I wanted to make here is that the aggregates--or at least M2, in this case--are well below their current target ranges, but I don't fault our analysis I think our analysis was leading us down the right track, but we were in some ways reluctant to make that kind of a change in the targets--at least in February and to some extent in July--because we thought that might be telegraphing to the markets greater restrictiveness than, in fact, we were trying to accomplish Do you agree with that to some extent?  -21-    12/15-16/87   Good   Are you saying that--   Don, when you were talking about chart 18, you made the comment that you thought the current interest elasticity on M1A was probably greater than what showed up in that statistical exercise That's probably also true of the other aggregates as well, isn't it? My question is What has happened to the relative elasticities of the three aggregates and do you have conclusions on that?   Yes   The biggest change would be in M1A?   That was in Berkeley   But that would raise the interest elasticity, wouldn't it?   Ted, what is the futures market saying about the yen and the mark?   Isn't the decline since the beginning of the year of the Taiwanese dollar--   I have a question regarding liquidity and quality concerns Is central bank intervention in foreign exchange markets also a factor? And if it is, doesn't that imply that we will have to see not only quality concerns go away but also greater stability in exchange markets before we can see more traditional relationships reestablished?   Mike, you talked about the decline in interest rates and I wonder if you could give us some idea, in terms of numbers, of what kind of short-term rates you expect in the first half in that Greenbook forecast   That's fairly significant  -46-    12/15-16/87   Yes   What is that forecast?   How much of an adjustment would you make to the fourth-quarter net export number given October's rough order of magnitude? We have $185 billion included in--   With a small change like that, it might be too early to give up on that 3 percent for the fourth quarter   A point of clarification Are you saying that policy today ought to be directed at preventing the dollar from declining?   Probably volume as well   Mr Chairman, the generally healthy Twelfth District economy has experienced few significant changes since the stock market decline The firms we surveyed indicated that they were going ahead with planned capital spending projects for next year Moreover, retail sales appear to be holding up well, according to representatives of several major department store chains  from September to date, which of course, is the most important part of the Christmas period up to this point, his sales were up 13 percent He has had no price increases so that is basically a volume increase Evidence from the mortgage market in our area is mixed but, on balance, activity in the residential area appears to have weakened slightly in the wake of the stock market decline One little vignette in terms of exports comes from a large lumber company He said that, unless there is a significant decline in the demand for lumber domestically, there is no room for further exports of lumber; capacity in the industry is not going to be added to significantly for the next two years, and you just can't count on lumber exports at a higher level unless there is a significant decline in domestic demands Our economic forecast has a little more strength in activity next year and the same rate of inflation as the Board staff's forecast The slowdown that we have in the first half, of course, is a result of the negative effects of the stock market decline It is important to point out that both our staff's forecast and that of the Board staff--and I think a lot of the forecasts that have been mentioned around here--have included a fairly significant decline in interest rates in conjunction with the slowdown It would also appear that those forecasts imply an easing in policy in the near term Now, I want to emphasize the point that the forecasts all assume the negative effects of the stock market And it seems clear to me, at least at this point, that as yet there haven't been any signs of such slowing The second-half pickup, which is a little stronger in our forecast, results from the dissipation of the adverse wealth effects In addition, the decline in interest rates in the first half has a role in causing the economy to grow more rapidly in the second half and, finally, the recent sharp drop in the dollar also adds strength to the second-half growth rate Finally, although short-term prospects for inflation appear comforting, I don't think I could describe the expectation of 4 percent inflation next year, following a similar increase this year, as comforting at all   I think it would be a real mistake to indicate that we're following a funds target for the short term because I think it will really confuse the market, particularly if we intend to switch when things become more normal in a couple of weeks I think handling it the way we did before is a better --   Yes   I would favor alternative (3) and probably would move in that direction after year-end With regard to the alternatives, if I were to follow the analysis of my staff and that in the Greenbook, I think it would lead to a recommendation that monetary policy soon be eased in response to a significant expected slowing of the economy in the first half of next year and the accompanying declines in interest rates However, to date, I haven't seen the signs of the negative effects of the stock market decline Consequently, I would support alternative "B" with asymmetrical language providing us with the flexibility to ease before the next FOMC meeting should that become necessary With regard to the specifics of the funds rate and the borrowing, I'm completely satisfied with the work that the staff has done in the Bluebook It seems to me that the 6-3/4 to 6-7/8 percent funds rate is reasonable In light of what we've seen with regard to the demand for borrowings, I also would accept their $300 million borrowing number, expecting that it probably would be below that between now and year-end Conceivably, we could get to the $400 million level after that, but I don't know how fast   Mr Chairman, it appears to me that the Twelfth District is exhibiting modest but steady growth Currently available information indicates that retailers experienced a 5 percent growth in nominal sales in the final three months of the year versus the same period in 1986 We conducted surveys of retailers about inventory levels and it was a bit surprising to us that they were generally satisfied with their inventory levels; and as many indicated that they had shortages as indicated that they had excessive levels of inventories  In the auto area, there's no question that at year-end auto dealers had high inventories But a more recent check at the end of January indicated that that was pretty well rectified Based upon what we've seen there are few signs, if any, that the Twelfth District had weak consumer spending or excessive inventories However, there's no question that the numbers for the national level indicated excessive inventories in the fourth quarter I agree with the staff that we probably are going to see a somewhat unique adjustment to that inventory picture I think you can make a strong case that there will be a more modest inventory correction One of the things that I think is interesting is that real P&E expenditures were weak in September and October and actually picked up in November and December And industrial production actually has been increasing at smaller rates It would seem to me that this is the beginning of a gradual adjustment and, therefore, the classic type of adjustment in inventories is not likely to occur Also, it looks to me as though manufacturing inventories are in fairly good shape With respect to autos, I mentioned the District [situation], but it seems to me that at the national level, auto inventories are not in that bad shape  When we put this all together, our forecast is for growth in the first half to be about 1 percent or a little less we have more of an inventory correction than in the staff's forecast, but not what I would consider to be a classic inventory correction And then, since we think that correction is likely to be completed by midyear, our forecast in the second half is for growth of a little over 3 percent, largely on the strength of that improving net export position In sum, we have annual fourth-quarter to fourth-quarter growth in GNP which is very little different from the staff forecast But we do have a pattern of a little more first-half weakness and second-half strength   '89 slows down, correct?   What was the number for M2?   Fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter?   Yes, one more Part of the answer to Governor Johnson's question is the fact that you also have a pattern in income as well; and since they have opposite signs, in effect, it takes out a little of the pattern--  -30-    2/9-10/88   Mr Chairman, I would also favor alternative III I think it conveys the right message to financial markets One thing we might consider is to have the range for M3 slightly [unintel- ligible]; the elasticities are such that you probably will get stronger growth of M3 than M2 With regard to the base question, I would be opposed to the suggestions of Governors Angell and Heller and instead I would prefer the Kohn cone   Two different ways   The Money Market Services range is $11 to $16 billion in the survey they do   Mr Chairman--   Is it time for comments? I don't have any questions   Mr Chairman, our analysis and that in the Greenbook suggest to me that policy should not be eased beyond the actions taken two weeks ago The sharp slowdown during this half of the year is related to the inventory buildup and should be corrected by midyear A further rate decline wouldn't have much effect on this correction, and it actually would primarily impact the second half of the year when the economy is really expected to bounce back Moreover, if I accepted the much smaller inventory pattern of the staff's forecast and the statement I guess that you made yesterday that the inventory correction could be even less than that expected by the Board's staff, it would seem to me that any further easing at this point could be something of a mistake Also--   Excuse me?   Perhaps Also, a growth rate of 2 percent or slightly higher in 1988 as a whole is acceptable, in my view, given the rapid growth of the economy last year and also given that the economy has entered the range of full employment Therefore, I'd favor alternative B Of course, if greater weakness did begin to show  -54-    2/9-10/88  up in the statistics, we could always make a change toward an easier policy before the next regular meeting  SPEAKER(?) Maybe not   $250 million   Right I was in favor of alternative B in the short term; and then for the long term, 4-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent, which is, I think, alternative III   What was his long-term?   What about long term?   I have one question about that If you had the 4 to 8 percent range for M2 and 5 to 8 percent for M3--we really don't want to make a distinction between the two in terms of uncertainties The 4 to 8 percent is fine; I like it because the midpoint is 6 percent But in talking this out, given the uncertainties, I'm not that confident about implying that you have greater certainty about M3 than M2 That's the only problem I see having two different ranges   No, I think you'd go the other way   But I think there's enough uncertainty--   Bob, there's enough uncertainty associated with the relationship that one can be comfortable with the 6-1/2 percent   I share that [view]   I think that's right; how do you do it then?   Of recent days  -70-    2/9-10/88   Right   There was the additional problem, too, of knowing what rate to aim at That isn't obvious There was a reluctance, I think, in that period, to move the rate sufficiently And secondly, there was some considerable uncertainty about what would be the appropriate rate if one had the will   I wouldn't change the current operating procedures either I think the experience with fed funds targeting was not very good and it seems to me that, for the time being, we ought to stick with these procedures Hopefully, some time in the future we'll be able to move more in a direction of using aggregates I don't want more meetings   That represented a significant downward revision from January   Mr Chairman, the Twelfth District economy continues to exhibit strength and we see few signs of weakness A particularly encouraging sign is the apparent broadening of the expansion throughout the region States that have had weak or negative growth because of problems in agriculture, mining, and energy are now growing Manufacturing is enjoying strong growth, especially in export- and resource-related areas In our view, this expansion does not appear to be threatened by excessive inventories Our sources generally indicate inventories are at or below desired levels It appears as though retailers followed a more cautious inventory- stocking policy following the stock market decline in October  Looking at the national economy, our forecast is for less growth in 1988 than in the Greenbook and about the same growth in 1989 Differences in our forecast center around the size of inventory adjustments and the amount of improvement in net exports But, it seems to me that the important point is that both forecasts indicate reasonably strong growth this year and next I feel that both our inflation forecast and that of the Greenbook are very distressing, especially for 1989 It seems to me that the prospect of compensation per hour rising and approaching 5 percent in 1989 is intolerable, if indeed, our objective is to move gradually to price stability   I've seen some sensitivity tests for and if you have interest rates go up a full percentage point, it would accelerate their losses substantially   All right   Mr Chairman, it seems to me that two significant developments have occurred since our last meeting that have a bearing on this policy discussion First, economic activity is stronger, and prospects are that growth will be more robust between now and the end of 1989 than was anticipated in mid-February Second, since the growth is occurring with the economy operating in an area close to full employment, the prospects for inflation have worsened Most disturbing to me is the possibility that increases in labor costs will be rising at more rapid rates Such a development would be a major setback to our inflation--  [Secretary's note The transcript ends at this point owing to a malfunction of the recording equipment]  -54-       Mr Chairman, you asked us to comment specifically about inventories I think that there probably is some indication of accumulated inventories that are imported goods, and that's in response to higher prices With regard to other goods, my recollection of that period in the late '70s when that occurred is that that is a bit of a lagging factor What usually happens is that we get some pickup in the price indexes and that begins to fuel expectations; and we don't get the really rapid accumulation of inventories until somewhat later And if that, in fact, is correct, I think maybe waiting for that as an indicator might be a little dangerous   Is that right?   Well, I thought there was more of a delay   In any case, as I see the developments, particularly the ones we've mentioned--unemployment, capacity utilization, M2, the positioning in the aggregates--it seems to me that there is a very strong case to support Bluebook alternative C In fact, I can't imagine a more convincing case being put before us than the one that was put before us by the staff There was general agreement with the staff's forecast; some questioning about it But it seems to me that it is explicit in the staff's forecast that if we delay in taking action, we're going to pay a price later--conceivably, based upon what we know, in terms of having to move even more aggressively I know it has been mentioned that we've moved twice recently Those two moves of 1/4 of a percentage point just don't do much And I remember earlier times when, to get any significant impacts on the economy, one would have had to move a lot more than a 1/4 of a point So, my clear recommendation would be Bluebook alternative C I could see as something of a compromise that we move borrowings up maybe a $100 million now But I would hope that we would have specific plans to talk or reconvene in a couple of weeks to see what the intervening two weeks or so bring in terms of data, because I think that, unless they show weakness, we should then move again   I found both papers very interesting, but I have some analytic questions that I think are relevant, as far as whether or not the base should be considered as either a target or a constraint The work done by the Board staff suggests that the statistical properties of the monetary base are superior to those of other aggregates The work we have done suggests just the opposite As a matter of fact, the statistical properties of the base are inferior to those of M2 We have a much larger interest rate elasticity on the monetary base and our income elasticity of M2 is significantly less than that [for the base] The difference appears to be a function of the period of estimation The period of estimation in the Board's forecast goes back to the very early 1960s  -23-    5/17/88  and goes through the entire period We think that the interest rate elasticity has probably increased in recent years and on the basis of our estimates, which run from 1978 through 1987, we find that the base actually has inferior statistical properties to M2 In any case, it appears as though there are significant amounts of shifts in the statistical properties that occur and I'm not sure we've paid enough attention to those kinds of shifts They certainly could affect how reliable the monetary base could be as either a current constraint or a target in the period ahead I guess I'd say that even though there has been a lot of analytical work done, maybe we ought to do a little more   Up until the recent change in [official] rates by the Germans and also the English, hadn't the change in relative [market] rates in support to our dollar grown stronger?   I guess the point is that there is some fundamental basis for what happened to the dollar I mean it's not--   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Twelfth District economy continues to grow, but the pace of growth appears to be slowing The region does continue to benefit from increased foreign trade; and high-tech industries are facing strong demand, particularly in the aircraft area Also, wage pressure is building in such industries as forest products, aircraft, and food processing We believe that capacity constraints are becoming a concern in the fastest growing areas of the District, particularly the Pacific Northwest Business investment is high in plant and equipment, but firms are not expanding what we would consider to be aggressively, and we are noticing that delivery times are lengthening  With regard to the drought, it is not having much of an impact on the District's agricultural industry, although Idaho and Utah and also eastern Washington are threatened by drought conditions Subpar yields are expected in much of the District because of unseasonable weather, which ironically is associated with unseasonable rains But current high prices will make the farm income of the District actually rise  Turning to the national economy, if short-term interest rates move up about 100 basis points over the next year or so, we expect growth to average about 2 to 2-1/2 percent--perhaps toward the lower end of that range--over the forecast period And we also would expect that the slowing in growth would produce only a slight increase in the unemployment rate Without factoring in any implications of the drought for inflation, I believe that the labor market conditions, and also a falling dollar, will cause an acceleration of inflation to about 4-1/2 percent next year, as measured by the fixed-weight deflator And I would also associate myself with the comments of Vice Chairman Corrigan as far as the risks are concerned   The rate of growth is slowing somewhat   Well, I'd say it's fairly general We've seen some slowing in retail spending We've checked with retailers and there seems to be less spending across the board in the retail area, although concentrated I'd say in apparel and, to some extent, automobiles Even lumber, I think, is not growing as rapidly because they've hit a constraint If you look at some of these [developments], it's basically consistent with the slowing of the economy from what we can see   Yes, but taking the retailer, it's clearly demand   Two specific comments on that issue First of all, in the state of California, the minimum wage goes up tomorrow by a little more than a dollar an hour to $465 I think there's no question that that's going to have an impact I think most people are expecting that to have some impact I'm not saying a lot of people are working at that low minimum wage, but it just has a ripple effect through everything Another example I'd give is that there is a big strike in the lumber industry at the present time It actually has been expanding in terms of the number of workers involved and it does involve wages What seems to be on the table is a proposal which I think is around 4 to 5 percent over a four-year period, which would bring them up to where they were a couple of years ago--but that's sort of irrelevant from the viewpoint of what it does to inflation at the present time   I would strongly favor alternative III for 1989 and I don't have any problem with our current targets for 1988 One thing we might want to consider for 1988 is to go 4-1/2 to 7-1/2, which would narrow the M2 range to 3 points You clearly have the visibility that I think we'd be comfortable with And for M3, 5 to 8 because that looks reasonable as well And I might point out that the staff has indicated that, due to different income and interest elasticities, it makes sense to have a little higher range for M3 So, I think we could stick basically with the substance of what we have for 1988, but just narrow the range a little  -38-    6/29-30/88   Well, we would be holding to the range We'd actually be narrowing it   I wouldn't want to change the midpoint of M2   He wants coffee!   I think I would agree with Ed; I don't like the suggestion that we indicate that we might be very likely to continue the prior year's target in July I think we go through a very serious exercise here It is clear that the staff has done that and I think staff at each of our Banks has done that as well if we are going to do it in a serious way, I think we ought to pay some attention to it You know, we just don't have to do much work if what we're going to do most of the time is indicate that we are going to retain the current year's target for the next year I don't see any virtue in that I hink Congress ought to realize that we are trying to do the best we can and be aware that, at times, we may change it in one direction or another come February   I guess my preference would be for alternative "C", because I think all of the analysis we have seen over the last two days would support it very strongly As a fallback position, though, I think I could see taking it in a couple of bites I must admit that a move up to $600 million on borrowing is not quite the size of bite I had in mind; but if we were to make some move now and then agree to talk about this in a couple of weeks, I certainly could go along with that   Except you can say that money market rates have moved to the level--   I don't interpret it that way   I've got to ask a question then If we do that and we go to $600 million, is there a side constraint on that?   Is there a side constraint on that? In other words, if the fed funds rate does turn out to be 7-5/8 percent, is that a problem?   We're on a borrowing target?  -64-    6/29-30/88   Are there things to say that there has been some--?   Now you're talking about doing a little more   Mr Chairman?   Bob Parry   My understanding is that, if we stick with the $600 million borrowing target, the expectation of Peter and Don is that the funds rate is likely to decline to what we thought were the estimates consistent with that--roughly 7-1/2 percent or slightly higher If that is the case, is that the message we want to give at this point, given that we've seen funds trading at quite a higher level for a few days?   That's my concern   Right   I guess my concern is that that impression is likely to develop if funds were to move down to 7-1/2 percent or a smidgen higher    7/19/88   Ted, I have a question about your net export number With this small decline in the value of the dollar that you're assuming, wouldn't a model forecast typically give less of an improvement in net exports than what you're showing? It seems to me that for this year it's something like $47 billion, and for the next year it's $32 billion At least some of the models I've seen would suggest that with that kind of very small decline in the value of the dollar you would have a more significant slowing in the improvement in net exports than you have Was that managed to some extent or--   So at least that's one area where perhaps it could turn out that there'd be a little less pressure in terms of growth?   Okay, thank you sir   But if you didn't take that into account, it would be very misleading   Isn't the analytical issue raised here that you may be overstating inflation a little bit--that there has actually been more real growth because of declining prices, which has not been taken account of in the fixed-weight index It seems to me that may be a bigger analytical issue in this area   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Twelfth District economy continues to grow at a healthy pace, with particular strength in the coastal states, excluding Alaska This growth appears to be putting upward pressure on wages For example, in southern California, Oregon and Washington, employers are having difficulty hiring qualified workers at prevailing wages I also might say parenthetically that in California the minimum wage rose to $425 effective July 1st Inventories are satisfactory to lean throughout the District at both the manufacturer and retail levels In some industries, including paper and aluminum, low inventory levels result from strong demand combined with limited production capacity When we checked with District retailers, they indicated that the previously excessive inventories in women's apparel, which were quite a problem a couple of months ago, have been brought under control  If I may turn briefly to the national economy Even with the drought, real growth is likely to exceed the growth of potential output during the second half of this year And next year we expect growth similar to that in the Greenbook, assuming further significant tightening of monetary policy between now and mid-1989 We do have a somewhat stronger dollar and a smaller improvement in net exports, but in our forecast this is offset by stronger consumption than that which is incorporated in the Greenbook With the economy continuing to grow above or at potential over the forecast period, inflation in 1989-- measured by the fixed-weight deflator--seems certain to accelerate by the roughly 1/2 percent that is in our forecast and the Greenbook's   Do you have a significant in-migration?   We are getting record in-migration in California I think it's about 700,000 or something like that a year--it's incredible And we have similar housing problems, but I guess it's just that you can find cheaper areas Plus, there's a very large [unintelligible] That seems to keep a lid on things a bit   Bob, you made the comment that the slowdown is just what the doctor ordered Is that correct?   Domestic that we see in the forecast What is the monetary policy implication associated with that forecast?   Don, both alternatives cover a relatively short period of time Would you indicate which of the two alternatives, "B" or "C," is most consistent with the policy assumptions in the Greenbook forecast?   The quarter?   So, it's really more consistent with "B," you'd say?   It seems to me that characterizing the recent period as being a hybrid is maybe a little bit too strong, because in the last statement periods we've really hit borrowings right on the  -34-    8/16/88  head And some times and days, there may have been some attempts to resist the funds rate But if you are getting your target, then you must be pretty well content with the interest rates that are resulting from it I know there was a problem very early in July, but I don't know that it has been operating all that poorly in the last few weeks Would you agree with that Don, or not?   Yes   That's right   I can support alternative "B" considering how recently we tightened and also the short time before the next FOMC meeting However, it seems to me that further tightening will be needed soon, if it isn't needed now, and that alternative "B" can hardly be described as a policy that keeps us ahead of the curve with regard to the problems of excessive economic growth and intensified inflationary pressures Therefore, I strongly recommend the asymmetric language It would permit a tightening of policy in the intermeeting period if incoming data indicate no significant deceleration in economic activity With regard to the ordering of the phrases in the second sentence of the operational paragraph, I would not be in favor of changing the position of the monetary aggregates because I know how quickly their behavior can change and we might regret moving them up to a more prominent place this early   I have a question about your forecast of net exports There's a very substantial improvement in the net exports over the period I get the impression that if one were just to look at the model forecast, assuming a relatively moderate decline in the value of the dollar, that you wouldn't get that significant an improvement Am I correct in assuming that your forecast has a large judgmental component; and if so, is that sort of the opposite of what we saw when the dollar was going down? When the dollar was going down, the model predicted a more quick response in terms of net exports Now that the dollar has gone up, are we assuming that has a    9/20/88  delayed response as well--in terms of slowing the improvement in net exports?   So you don't know   Yes, thank you   Mr Chairman, the Twelfth District economy appears to be growing at a relatively brisk pace, and I'd say that the outlook for the District generally is favorable A very strong order book for aircraft should assure strength in the Seattle area for a couple of years That also boosts prospects in the aircraft industry in southern California Prospects for the growth of exports are reasonably bright for such things as agricultural products, specialty products, and also transportation and electronic equipment Agriculture in the west appears as though it may actually be  -13-    9/20/88  benefiting somewhat from the drought as a result of the higher prices that more than offset the effects of very mild reductions in yields in the west At this time, signs of weakness in the District are really quite spotty And they're only concentrated in a few states--Alaska, Arizona, and Utah--and a very few industries as well Residential construction is weak Dairy and livestock are rather weak as a result of the fact that they're paying higher costs for feed And aluminum and forest products are weak due to capacity constraints It's rather interesting that even where you have weakness, it's in areas that are pretty much up against capacity constraints in residential construction, for example, that's solely a result of extremely strong export demands for lumber Weakness may intensify in the District if the very recent sharp slowing in retail advertising in California-- which looks quite pervasive--is a precursor of softer retail sales  If I may turn to the national outlook, it's my view that it's premature to conclude that the recent softening of economic statistics is indicative of a trend that will persist through 1989 Rather, it seems more likely to me that if interest rates were to remain at present levels, growth of the nonfarm economy would probably exceed the growth of potential over the entire forecast period Thus, prospects for the underlying rate of inflation still are a concern, though obviously we're going to see actual inflation rates buffeted by many special factors If this expectation in our forecast is correct, then it seems to me that the process of tightening probably is not over and will have to be resumed sometime soon Thank you   If that's in the form of a motion, I certainly would second it, particularly with the asymmetric language I would point out, though, that I really do doubt that we're going to be lucky enough to get through more than a meeting or two without further  -25-    9/20/88  tightening I think there are pressures on the underlying rate of inflation that are likely to intensify And I think that some of the potentially favorable developments associated with the price of oil and the rising dollar--as far as inflation is concerned--could easily be reversed At this time, given the uncertainties, it seems to me that alternative "B" is probably the appropriate path But given my concerns, I would very much favor the asymmetric language that was incorporated in the previous directive   Third  SPEAKER(?) Third   This is Bob Parry   In light of the tight policy and also the large budget cuts, what is the anticipated growth for Mexico?   Yes   Thank you   I support the change as well If the change were announced, say, at the end of the year and the reasons explained, I don't think there would be much press pressure to it The other thing is that it probably would be wise to emphasize one of the points that Ed has made--that the FOMC is a continuing body But it does make some sense If we were starting off today having no precedent, we clearly would probably opt for something more like what you are proposing than what we have So I would support it   I have a question about the approach It's a single-equation approach, and there is an assumption therefore that money is exogenous Yet, we know that throughout this period for which you got your statistical results that at times money was endogenous--that you were reacting to what was happening to prices It seems to me that that is a point which has some bearing on the usefulness [of these results] The second point is that for some of these [periods] velocity is more stable If you look at Chart II, it looks to me that if you were at different points of history, you might have concluded as you drew a line most recently that you were going off the long-run velocity line We know that potential real GNP changes over time I don't know how much that would lead us astray, but it seems to me that assumptions about both of those being unchanged over time are potentially dangerous with respect to--   Sure    11/1/88   What about potential real GNP? That can change for other reasons, and it does change for reasons that sometimes are very difficult to anticipate   I see   The example you cited about how [the model may] be useful in the long run really depends upon the actual coefficients that are estimated In effect, that's how you determine at what rate M2 should grow to get the growth and prices that you find acceptable The only point I was trying to make--I think this is a correct statistical point--is that to the extent that money is not exogenous, those statistical results can be biased I don't know if that is a major factor I don't think you ought to assume that those coefficients are unbiased coefficients because the model starts out with an assumption of the exogeneity which is not there This may not be a big factor, but I think it is a factor   Yes   Mike, the level of nonfarm business investment in inventories has been averaging about $31, $32 billion for the last two quarters You've got quite a pickup in the fourth quarter--that means a source of strength in the fourth quarter--and then it remains at that high level throughout most of 1989 The level at around $40 billion is just a little bit high traditionally You commented that you thought inventories were lean Could you talk about that a little bit because clearly it could be a source of weakness if it doesn't contain those   Mr Chairman, growth in the Twelfth District has slowed somewhat but we think the outlook is rather optimistic The slowing really appears to reflect the tightening of labor markets and  -31-    11/1/88  the lack of unused resources rather than just weakness in demand To offset these impediments to expansion, we're beginning to see that some employment growth is shifting through areas of the District which have characteristically been weaker For example, Boeing is opening up a plant in Spokane in eastern Washington where there is a lot of labor available, and it has been traditionally weak We've seen, for example, that Carnation is going to open its largest production plant in Bakersfield As you know, Bakersfield is about 110 miles north of LA and costs are quite a bit lower there So, that does seem to be going on a bit As far as durable goods manufacturing is concerned, it remains strong because of the dominance of aircraft and electronics industries And you perhaps saw the article today in the paper about Boeing indicating the strength of their sales and profits We are also seeing the shortages that have been characteristic of the wood products and paper industries fading a bit This probably is a result of the fact that housing has weakened a bit, at least new housing And the generally slower pace of the economy may be having some impact on packaging Prospects for agriculture in the District--and I'll just underline the point that it is the single largest industry in the District--prospects there depend very importantly on rainfall this winter We have had two years of drought, but it really hasn't affected agriculture Most of our agriculture in the District, especially in California, depends on irrigation; but if we have a third straight year of drought this winter it would cause problems Also in 1988 the District continued to excel in the production of championship professional sports teams!   With regard to the national economy, I would agree that [some} slowing of economic growth may be underway After we abstract from the effects of the drought, our forecast is that growth will average about 2 percent next year with the slowing in growth centered in the areas that have been mentioned in the Greenbook forecast net exports, business spending on plant and equipment, and consumer spending on durables And although inflation certainly could be less next year, I think the underlying rate of inflation probably will not improve And it seems to me, therefore, that further tightening action may be required sometime in 1989   That seems to raise a lot of issues   Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation, particulary the asymmetric language One point I'd make is that I have a greater emphasis on hitting the $600 million borrowings target It seems to me it's not really necessary to worry about a federal  -49-    11/1/88  funds rate which differs by an 1/8th or 1/4th from what statistical relationships would seem to indicate between borrowings and the funds rate   That's after an end-of-year adjustment as well? I mean, it could even be higher in the short term?   If we want to abandon the current operating procedures it shouldn't be on the basis that you're confusing the market because I think the market has pretty well got it straight Analytically, we are on a modified or flexible federal funds rate approach, and the market knows that So, it seems to me that the discussion ought to revolve around what is the best procedure; that is, whether or not something more rigid as far as fed funds targeting is appropriate--which I wouldn't be very happy about or support--or whether it should be a reserves target But I think confusion is not the issue   I was going to say, isn't that what we did?   But, Gary, isn't that because you had a rigid fed funds target? What we now have is something that is more flexible, and it seems to have worked at least over this period   Well, you can turn that around a little You go through an intermeeting period, and if things look like they are firming up for good analytic reasons, and if you allow it to firm up a little bit, what's wrong with that? If you didn't, you'd be going back to what we had in the 1970s that Gary referred to   Ted, it seems to me that the export numbers really are quite strikingly strong--$65 billion I believe in 1989 and $56 billion in 1990 My impression is that relative to what one would get in a model forecast like the MPS, it's a very strong number; and I was just wondering what kind of things would enter your judgmental forecast to get that kind of strength, particularly given the slowdown in GNP that you're expecting among industrialized nations in 1990   Mike, would some of the more recent numbers that you've gotten in the last week or so cause you to revise up the fourth quarter at all? Retail sales and I don't know if you have the business inventory numbers or you will get that later--   Mr Chairman, the Twelfth District economy continues to report healthy economic growth with only a few signs of slowing Manufacturing activity continues strong with particular strength in aluminum production and the aerospace and aircraft industry However, we have seen some slowing in the lumber and paper industries where there has been some slowing in demand In general, real estate activity in the District is robust, but there are some notable exceptions in Alaska and Arizona where commercial real estate is particularly weak and also in Utah On balance, if we look at wage and price pressures, they clearly are upward and seem to have increased slightly in the intermeeting period An exception to this is the forest products industry where, as I mentioned, some slackening is showing up and it is having an impact on prices that is quite dramatic However, in general terms labor markets throughout the District are really quite tight And if you recall, at the last meeting I indicated there even were signs of firms that are trying to locate in areas where there is greater slack--not in the built-up areas of Seattle or San Francisco or Los Angeles  With regard to the national scene, the economy remains at a level above its long-run potential As a result, there seems to be a significant danger of more rapid inflation later in 1989 and especially in 1990 Our forecast of real growth in 1989 is not greatly different from that of the Greenbook It seems to me that the implications of both outlooks are the same and that is that no significant slack in the economy will emerge next year and that  -37-    12/13-14/88  underlying inflationary problems are going to continue to worsen If the dollar declines in value, as seems likely, that will mean that actual inflation rates will be subjected to further upward pressures as well It seems that projected economic growth and inflation in 1990 argue strongly for policy tightening through the end of next year   Of course, two-thirds expected one in 1988   Well, you mean, then reduce the borrowings?   Well, I mean, that's the implication   Mr Chairman, I think that an increase of $100 million in the borrowing is woefully inadequate It seems to me that we've spent two days talking about projections for the economy that all come up to the same conclusion; that is, that actual inflation rates stand a good chance of rising next year; that underlying inflationary pressures are building; and that the economy, if anything, has been surprising us on the upside I think a move of about 1/8 percent in the federal funds rate is just nothing at all It seems to me that a bare minimum would be alternative "C" And I would think as well that the best way to implement that would be something that would be more public in nature and would catch the  -55-    12/13-14/88  attention of those in the financial markets With regard to the point that was made several times before about risks to the financial sector, I think that history would suggest that the risks are quite different from what has been described It seems to me that the greatest risk is for us to get behind the curve, and I think we are in great danger of getting behind that curve at this point because in that event what will happen is that interest rates are going to go to even higher levels at a later point; and the burden on the financial sector would be even greater than if we were to move in what I would consider to be a convincing way at this point   I think if you had asked me what my recommendation was, I would have said something stronger than "C"   Well, "C-"   What seems appropriate to me would be $300 million or $400 million and an increase in the discount rate And I think that a bare minimum acceptable to me would be a $200 million increase today   The Bluebook alternatives are posed in terms of 8-3/8 percent as being alternative "B," is that correct?   Okay, so you're adding an 1/8 to that   Okay   I don't want to nitpick, but would you envision yourself visiting that issue two weeks from now or six weeks from now?   No, I meant this second $100 million; I'm sorry   Two weeks from today?   Two weeks from today?   On a somewhat narrower topic I agree, Mike, that the nondefense capital goods orders are really good indicators as far as capital spending is concerned But would it be better perhaps to try to take some of the lumpiness out of aircraft and parts as opposed to excluding it? Because it is an important factor with regard to capital spending I know it's very lumpy but maybe if you averaged a couple of months you'd get a better picture   So it's not a lumpiness   Most of it in the second [year]?   Mr Chairman, the Twelfth District economy remains strong For example, the District's unemployment rate is below the national average However, Arizona is slumping because of the construction downturn, which is likely to extend at least through this year In addition, there are signs of slowing during 1989 For example, labor shortages are slowing [output in] a few industries; I guess the most extreme example of that would be in aircraft manufacturing Concern about the lack of rainfall is mounting in our District, especially in California Another year of drought would really seriously hurt the District's agriculture I think we have a little different situation working in our District Last year we benefitted from the drought because we had almost all of our agriculture handled through irrigation But we have had two years of drought and a third would be quite serious because the reservoir levels are so low at the present time--and we're already halfway through our rain year--that it actually could result in reductions of water availability of 25 to 40 percent So, we're looking rather closely at the water situation, at least in the state of California  The national economy, it seems to me, continues at a level of activity above its sustainable potential I believe that the recent employment reports indicate upward pressures on wages and that the underlying inflation rate seems likely to continue to build Moreover, if there is a depreciation of the dollar this year and next, as is incorporated in the Greenbook forecast, that will add to inflationary pressures as well Our outlook for growth for the two- year period is very similar to that of the Greenbook, although we may have somewhat of a difference in the yearly pattern In any case, this growth and what I would say is a worsening inflation prospect argue strongly, in my view, for continuing our recent strategy of steadily tightening policy Thank you   Mr Chairman, at your July testimony I recall a sense of the [Congressional] Committee that they wanted us to narrow the range and also to choose the range where the midpoint was equal to our forecast How much pressure do you think there is for that and how do you personally feel [about that]?   Okay   Except last July they wanted us to add one They didn't want us to subtract one last year   I would support the 3 to 7 percent as well What would concern me about going to the lower range is if we had to raise it next year I think that could be confusing to the public and the Congress, especially since the Greenbook forecast--and our forecast as well--is that inflation rates actually could be a bit higher in 1990 So it seems to me that we would maintain an extra degree of flexibility if we were to stay with the 3 to 7 percent range and try to explain after the fact why perhaps it does end up in the lower end of that range   I think that an adjustment has been made At least in the quantitative work we did we got a faster growth of M2 just using the model I don't know the extent of it, but I think there has been an adjustment made to reflect the fact that these deposit rates, in terms of offering rates on M2 instruments, have been very sluggish I don't know if you quantified the adjustments you made but I think it was in there when you had the 3, 3-1/2--   Right   Why don't you just spend a little time talking about the potential impact of developments the savings and loan industry--   Mr Chairman, I would agree that there are substantial uncertainties associated with economic prospects But I think there is enough certainty to support alternative C I believe that the level of economic activity is in excess of the full employment [level] at the present time I think that a constant level of interest rates, even if it is for the next month or so, would assure that for an even longer period It seems to me that in that kind of environment we know that inflationary pressures are building As a result, I would say that we ought to get about our business promptly It seems to me that it also would be much more difficult to characterize monetary policy as being ahead of the curve if we were to take no action now or, for that matter, over the next month Thank you   Ted, considering the strength of the dollar in the past year and your comment that you think the dollar will remain relatively firm in the near term, why wouldn't it be reasonable to expect that any significant improvement in net exports would be delayed to the second half of the year at the earliest and most likely to 1990?   Well, you have improvement over the year going from $103 billion, which of course has been revised But the change is from $103 to $85 billion; that's not [unintelligible] $18 billion   It's still $13 billion   $98 billion to $85 billion is still $13 billion   But when--   Wouldn't typical statistical studies lead you to expect an actual deterioration?   Would you say there's perhaps a greater uncertainty in this area than in some of the other areas of GNP performance?   Thank you   Governor Seger, one other perspective that perhaps I can provide on that If you take the California market, which represents a fairly significant share--   No, I said it's a fairly significant share of the total housing market We have had increases in the prices of single- family homes that have averaged 25 to 30 percent in the Los Angeles and San Francisco markets I think there are some consumers that look at that on a total return basis and figure out that 11 percent is not such a bad deal if you can count on increases in prices of that magnitude I think that's had an impact in our state I don't know if--   Right   Well, all I know is that the average price in the two markets that constitute most of the area has gone up about 25 to 30 percent in the past year   No And one has to figure out what people are projecting   That's right   We do not'collect good data on that I don't know how much that has changed and how much of a factor that is   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Twelfth District economy continues to experience healthy growth with only a few signs of slowing Agricultural producers are enjoying high product prices and recent rains have lessened the chances of drought in the area rather substantially We also hear reports from Western department store executives that sales of soft goods have improved in recent weeks But I must admit that that may be a reflection of improved weather conditions and also the early Easter season In the few sectors that we do see slowing it appears as though supply constraints explain much of the change In Section II of the Greenbook there was a reference to the types of problems that the commercial aircraft industry is experiencing and I was thinking that it's rather amazing that Boeing has signed an agreement with Lockheed to borrow up to 670 Atlanta-based workers for as long as six months  Turning to the national economy, the level of activity as indicated in the discussion in the Greenbook remains above its noninflationary potential Strong growth in employment and tightening labor markets suggest that upward pressures on wages are likely to  -22-    3/28/89  persist At the same time, higher short-term interest rates may result in some slowing in the next few quarters But I must admit that, to me, signs of current slowing are too few to be convincing at this point Our overall outlook for the economy is really not very different from that of the Greenbook We also expect the economy to remain above full employment with continuing upward wage pressures for at least the remainder of 1989 and perhaps into 1990 However, we have less strength in our forecast originating in the net export sector, largely as a result of the strength of the dollar that we've experienced during the past year Thank you   Mr Chairman, I have a request for clarification In the Bluebook it's stated that alternative B would assume roughly a continuation of 9-3/4 percent [on the funds rate] and that money market rates might tend to decline a bit if that indeed is where we came out It seems to me in terms of maintaining the existing degree of restraint in financial markets that the market is probably thinking more about 10 percent Could I interpret support of "B" as being an operation which would cause money market rates to remain at roughly their current levels?   So that could be consistent with a slightly firmer funds rate?   Okay Well, in that case I certainly would favor alternative B and asymmetric language at the present time However, if further signs of slowing do not become more convincing in the next several weeks, I would certainly recommend that we consider moving to alternative C promptly   I'd like to ask a question about the primary dealers How many are Japanese owned?   One keeps hearing that that has changed the market somehow Is that correct or not?   Well, I guess it's just vicious rumor or whatever but one issue is that in Japan information is exchanged a lot among companies One hears that that may be an issue in the United States Is that just vicious rumor?   I have a question, Mike, that is related to your final comment In the Greenbook the comment was made that aggregate demand will still have to moderate further to relieve pressures and reverse the current upturn in inflation And as you indicated, in the Greenbook forecast you've assumed additional restraint What would be the impact of not implementing that restraint? In terms of an analytic exercise, what would it be costing us in terms of progress with regard to inflation and, for that matter, with regard to growth as well?   In 1991?   So there's really no improvement in underlying inflation through the forecast period through the end of '91 unless one gets some further restraint?   That's what I thought Thank you   Half a percent more than [unintelligible]?   Thank you, Mr Chairman Recent information from the Twelfth District suggests that the growth may be slowing Some sectors that have been contributing strength now are limited by capacity or supply constraints For example, in the forest products industry they are facing severe constraints in obtaining logs, and that has actually resulted in some shutdowns of mills In the aerospace industry you've heard a great deal about the situation among commercial aircraft producers orders continue to build but the capacity is slow to respond and, consequently, they're not getting much growth at all Other indicators throughout the District are suggesting somewhat slower growth even though capacity constraints in those areas are not a factor As an example, the recent data on employment in California indicate significantly slower job growth during the past two months In manufacturing, employment growth also has slowed Construction activity may be slowing in the District but the picture is not all that clear The weakness is principally centered in Alaska, Arizona, and Utah; we still see rather strong growth, particularly in residential construction, in Seattle, Oregon, and especially California Anecdotal evidence does suggest that there is increased caution on the part of small businesses, with many of them reporting--at least in the cases that we were told about in Oregon and California--that they are holding off expansion plans and are also in the process of trying to keep inventories at lean levels  Our outlook for the national economy is really fundamentally similar to that of the Greenbook The slowdown appears to be more convincing now than it looked when we had our last meeting It also seems as though slow growth could persist for a number of quarters I would agree, however, that the risks of recession don't seem all that great Moreover, even with the slowdown, real GNP will remain above its full employment potential with continuing upward wage pressures into next year, as was indicated by Mike Prell The pace in underlying employment costs and unit labor costs is likely to rise We do not have much evidence of increases in contract settlements in the Twelfth District but the LA school teachers went on strike on Monday That's the second largest school district, in the United States They had on the table a 21 percent three-year package and they rejected that and are on strike And everyone is beginning to speculate about what's going to happen in the aerospace industry When you're bringing people in from Atlanta and other places and  -21-    5/16/89  you've got a contract coming up there's not a lot of optimism about what that contract might result in Thank you   I would agree with your recommendation with regard to Bluebook alternative B, but I would very much favor retaining the asymmetric language for the simple reason that I think we ought to impress on the markets our longer-term resolve with regard to inflation I think symmetric language could be, and probably would be, misinterpreted I'm afraid that if we went to symmetric language they would think we have a greater tolerance of current rates of inflation than I think we really do I just don't like the message it communicates at this point   Mr Chairman?   This is Bob I wonder if Don could take a look-- I know there isn't much time--at what he may be thinking about in terms of the actual targets, leading up to our reevaluation of our targets for 1989, to give us a bit of a benchmark for making our judgments   Okay   Don, this is Bob Parry Thank you very much for doing that work One question On your assumption that M2 would end up near the bottom end of the range, what was the assumption with regard to [interest] rates for the remaining part of the year?   So, if [interest] rates were to stay where they are or even decline somewhat, money growth could be somewhat faster?   Thank you   Mr Chairman, this Bob Parry   It seems to me important that we indicate that we'd like to chart some longer-term [course] for a lower rate of inflation Quite frankly, I don't think that a small decline in interest rates such as the one that you're proposing would be at variance with that necessarily If we were to make the change that you've suggested, perhaps at some convenient opportunity you could underline the concerns that we all have about gradually reducing the rate of inflation over the longer term I think it would be a very desirable way to go   My question has to do with interest rates as well The financial projections indicate that interest rates will have changed little through 1990 Then in the Bluebook, there's reference to what the impact might be on other short-term and long- term rates I assume the projection is with regard to the funds rate If you had the funds rate in particular remaining at its current level for a couple of quarters, it seems to me that the impact on other short-term interest rates would be quite marked as opposed to the 1/4 point change referred to in the Bluebook--which is over a shorter  -11-    7/5-6/89  period I'm sure--and that there could conceivably even be some significant change in long-term rates as well Is that in the model or in your forecast? I really can't tell   Could you tell me how much?   But if you just let the model run for three quarters how much backup do you think you'd get?   Well, that's just with short-term rates The relationship between short-term [and long-term] rates is not more traditional   Okay All I'm trying to do is figure out the consequences--   --if you get this level It seems to me that in the short-term end of the market you'd have a backup of substantial proportions   But you were saying that the funds rate assumption is what?   And the dollar?   All right, fine Mr Chairman, the economy in the West currently is rather surprisingly robust Although recent monthly employment data for California suggest that the rate of growth is slowing, the California economy will remain at a strong level Employment growth in Nevada, Washington, and Oregon ranks them among the six fastest growing states in the nation Outside of Alaska and Arizona real estate markets continue strong In April, the statewide median home price in California rose above $200,000 for the first time Home prices also are rising rapidly in Washington and Oregon, but from far lower levels One curious development comes out of our regular survey of District business leaders Almost all of those surveyed indicated that they believe that the economy, in general, is slowing and will continue to slow But when we ask them about their own businesses virtually no one sees any significant slowing in their own businesses, outside the lumber industry  Despite the high level of activity on the West Coast our outlook for the national economy is really quite similar to that of the Greenbook We believe the economy appears headed for sluggish economic growth but no recession In fact, we see the possibility of some downside risks for the economy in terms of economic growth According to our analysis consumption and business-fixed investment have been growing unusually rapidly in the past two years A reversal of this pattern could mean a weaker economy than now seems likely Despite slower economic growth the economy remains above its full employment level Thus, I would agree with the Greenbook's inflation outlook, which shows relatively constant rates of inflation for 1990 Thank you, Mr Chairman  -15-    7/5-6/89   No   Mr Chairman, our analysis suggests that M2 and M3 are likely to grow in 1990 at a slightly less rapid rate--5-1/2 to 6 percent--than the Bluebook [forecast] But even that slower growth would be consistent with not changing the ranges, at least on technical grounds I do think, though, that it is important that we reduce the ranges because I think it does send a message to the public regarding our resolve gradually to lower the rate of inflation over time I think the strategy II that was outlined is the one that we ought to be pursuing over the longer term Therefore, I would support the suggestion of President Black to pursue Bluebook alternative III, which I think would still be at least within the range of what I would expect the growth of the two aggregates to be next year   June to September?   No, it's 3-3/4   Mr Chairman, I think it's appropriate for us to move very cautiously at this point It's clear that the current rates of inflation are a problem; and even more of a concern is the fact that underlying inflationary pressures are likely to remain a problem for quite a while, whether you [accept] the forecast of the Greenbook or some of the others that have been talked about around the table So, it seems to me the biggest mistake would be to move too aggressively and, therefore, I could support the proposition that you put on the table   And $550 million for "A"   What's your concern?   I'd like to address the repositioning issue It seems to me that we still ought to keep some statement about inflation up front I think we ought to remember why we moved "behavior of the monetary aggregates" to where it is We had a lot of research, conducted by the staff, that indicated that the association between the growth of money and the economy was not sufficiently predictable or stable to rely on it to a great extent for use in terms of operating in financial markets Without taking another look at whether or not the staff has changed their view on that, why should we move it up? In addition, if we do move it up to number 1, should we stop talking about the way we have been formulating our policy in terms of borrowed reserves?   I don't want to change it--not until some work is done that would support such a change I don't understand what has changed in terms of our perception about the usefulness of money as a guide to the economy since all those studies were done  -58-    7/5-6/89   Are you suggesting that we try to monitor it?   Well--   Ted, a question about net exports In Part II of the Greenbook there was an interesting discussion of the revision in the export numbers that was done for '86, '87, and '88 Analytically, how do you treat that when you're using a model or you're doing your analytic work since they haven't done a benchmark and you don't know what happened before that?   I know   So you have a whole year, too   Is there a similar problem in inventories because there were big changes there?   Could it add a little uncertainty to the forecast?   They were moved out of consumption right into exports It wasn't something that had been missed?   And formerly it was in domestic consumption?   Thank you   There were some changes, I think, in the estimates of productivity Has that led to any different views about what [potential] growth in the economy might be?   Pursuing this a little further you made the statement that the underlying rate of inflation really doesn't show any progress between now and the end of 1990 I know for the next meeting you will come out with [a forecast for] 1991 Have you taken any preliminary looks? Based upon the assumptions that you use, is there any improvement in the underlying inflation that occurs later?   By design?   That's the objective   Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman The economy in the Twelfth District continues to grow, although at a slower pace than earlier in the year Some areas are enjoying robust growth For example, the state of Washington is experiencing a sharp escalation in housing prices, booming construction, and rapid in-migration Alaska is recovering at a rate of growth in employment that is twice that expected prior to [unintelligible] growth District retailers characterize sales as satisfactory and inventories at desired levels But other areas of the District are exhibiting weaker growth Arizona remains weak, with construction slumping and defense-related manufacturing facing cutbacks A rather new development is that growth has slowed in California, with declines in manufacturing and construction employment noted in the last several months  Turning to the national economy, stronger growth now seems to be more likely than it did at our last meeting Lower interest rates and declines in food and energy prices should produce a pickup in consumption Moreover, it appears as though the downside risks to inventory accumulations have lessened because of the recent revision of national income statistics We expect the economy to remain above  -24-    8/22/89  its high employment level through 1990 Thus, similar to the Greenbook, we expect some further modest increases in wage inflation And in the absence of any policy changes, we would expect the momentum of the current inflation rate to persist into next year Thank you   I would favor "B" as well and I also would strongly favor the symmetric language It seems to me that relative to the previous meeting there are fewer downside risks than we saw at that time We have had a recent robust growth of the broad aggregates, so I think one can make the case that the risks are  -41-    8/22/89  symmetrical I certainly would not prefer asymmetric toward the side of ease   That's a double asymmetric   Well, it seems to me that we are pretty well agreed on the efforts to [discourage] intervention I would say that we only have one factor that we can [use] and that is for you to make our viewpoint known as best you can to the Administration My concern is that if we were to do something of a confrontational nature we would be forced or required to do things that we wouldn't want to do I don't understand If we were to back away, Manley, I don't know--   You said that you think the markets are anticipating further easing of some magnitude in the near term?   I bring this up because the Bluebook seemed to say the opposite--that [the market] does not now appear to be anticipating any near-term change of policy I think it has implications for what might happen to market rates relative to the choices we make So I just want to--   I'd like to ask two questions related to the near-term strength of the economy Based upon the statistics that we now have for the third quarter, do you think there is much of a chance that the actual growth rate was in the 3+ percent area? And related to that, you have a very substantial decline in nonfarm inventories Is that just what is happening as a result of aircraft? I see aircraft exports are up and are very strong   Third and fourth, [unintelligible] inventories   Thank you, Mr Chairman I think the tone of my report is probably going to be a little different from some others The economy in the West currently is expanding at a healthy pace, and growth actually appears to have strengthened a little since our last meeting Improvements in trade and service activity account for much of the recent strength we've seen Apparel sales are reported to be strong and, of course, toward the end of the quarter there were quite strong sales of autos We've seen good growth in tourism activity throughout the entire area Construction, both residential and nonresidential, and real estate activity are strong in California,  -24-    10/3/89  Nevada, Washington, Oregon, Hawaii, and much of Idaho, although some slowing in home sales recently has appeared in southern California Reports of weakness are focused, as they have been for the last several meetings, in Arizona and are associated primarily with construction The Northwest is actually booming I don't think there's any word that would be more appropriate California-style bidding wars on single-family homes have become common in the Puget Sound area Manufacturing firms throughout the Northwest plan to expand employment facilities and equipment Now, in two hours the contract at Boeing will expire; 43,000 workers in Seattle and I think 12,000 in Wichita and 1,700 in Portland are covered by that union But the chances look less than 50 percent that there will be a strike; it requires a two-thirds vote At this point, if there is not a strike, I would assume that that strength would continue for the foreseeable future   I don't know if they vote today, but the expiration of the contract occurs today at 1000   That could be, but it does require a two-thirds vote for a strike  At the national level, the economy--to us at least--appears stronger than at the time of the last meeting We've revised our estimates of third-quarter growth and now expect an increase of around 3 percent, which is somewhat different from that in the Greenbook Also, I wouldn't be surprised to see stronger growth in final demand than projected in the Greenbook, especially in 1990 Quite frankly, looking at a lot of private forecasts, I see more centered in the area of 2 to 2-1/2 percent than I do under 2 percent at this point If the growth does not slow as rapidly as projected in the Greenbook, then it seems clear that upward pressures on underlying inflation will persist   I would certainly support alternative B, but I would have a preference for symmetrical language because I think the data to date suggest that the risks are equal on the up side as well as on the down side   One [other point] I'm sure you all got this letter to respond to by the end of October or early November from Representative Neal and that kind of information might be useful I don't know what we're all going to do about that but that kind of information might be an important--   The end of October or early November is my recollection   Well, he says he'd like to make it a part of the record and he will be doing the hearings in late October or early November And we assumed that--  -45-    10/3/89  [from Los Angeles]  Sure At the present time we're still on night hours; [the earthquake] has knocked out power throughout the city We will be open for business in critical areas today We've told employees in some areas--personnel, research, auditing, etc that it is not [necessary] for them to come in But in other areas, we've asked some to come in where possible The problem in particular is that getting from the East Bay to the City is very difficult because the bridge is down and it means that people either have to come by one of the more remote bridges or by a ferry that was set up on a temporary basis   No, the San Mateo Bridge is up so that [unintelligible] are functioning well At the present time we haven't had any problems with staff All essential employees have been contacted and asked to come in when possible We also wired all Districts that we are open for the day; you should have received that wire Getting to some of the services, everything seems to be okay in securities Bank of America has a problem and will be moving their securities operation, at least part of it, to our facility [Unintelligible] of California we haven't been able to [unintelligible], and apparently there are many small banks that aren't going to open today There are a lot who could have their businesses open and we're just not aware yet of the problems of smaller institutions In the currency area we're receiving and shipping, but we're not going to be doing any processing Our decision at this point is not to do any processing until we get on regular power We just fear that we wouldn't [unintelligible] There are no ACH tapes in or out; electronic ACH is fine Very little in checks came in last night, but we do expect a heavy volume tonight The real [problem] in everything is transportation As an example, there are very limited flights at the present time In San Francisco there are some commercial cargo flights but at the present time [the airport] is not open to passenger flights The other airports are either under limited or no use at the present time, but are expected to come up shortly The wire as we speak is--if it isn't up now it will be up momentarily As far as the [unintelligible] of LA, as it turns out we recovered the data bases in LA and we were ready to take over [from there], but it wasn't necessary because we think all the processing can be handled out of San Francisco at this point Basically, it's a little early to be too optimistic but as far as our assessment of the situation at the present time, things seem to be going as smoothly as they possibly could That's it, Mr Chairman   Well, I'm either going to drive or there's a possibility that I can get a flight from Burbank to Oakland and then find a way to get over to the city We'll get there probably by noon one way or the other    10/18/89   Not all As a matter of fact, one of the critical roads leading from the Oakland Airport is the one that collapsed and killed 200 and some people   I don't think there's much of a problem [Routes] 101 and 5 are not; it's just [route] 880, which is a big road that comes up from [unintelligible] actually But I think anyone could find a way to get to San Francisco from LA or from the north   I think that's true, although the damage on the Bay Bridge is really quite small; it was only one small section at the top deck And they anticipate that they might be able to get traffic back on the bridge in a couple of days   The last word I had was that BART was running everywhere except under the Bay, but they expect that will be up and that will be most helpful   Yes   Well, I'm not aware of problems at this point I think we would have received indications of problems by this time, but we'll recheck If you hear any, Peter, let us know   Okay Well, we'll [unintelligible]   Factor income was a big--   There was such a dramatic change in [factor income] and what they based that on Why did they come up with--?   So that may be it   [Unintelligible]   No   Mike, I have a question We have had relatively strong growth in real disposable income in the past two years If you had the traditional relationship between changes in real disposable income and consumption, how much greater strength would we have in consumption in 1990 than shown in the Greenbook, particularly in the nondurables and services areas?   Well, typically the [equations] show current consumption as a function of current and lagged values of real disposable income I think the Greenbook goes into some special factors that may be causing consumption not to be responding as rapidly to changes in real disposable income So I'm asking If the relationship were traditional, how much more strength would you get?   A lot of the weakness in the economy, if you're looking at the dollar source of weakness, is focused in nondurables; that's down to 11 percent, which is very small And perhaps even more remarkable is services, which got down to 26 percent They have been down that far, but that's not typical   Thank you   There are offsets in inventory, right?   Mr Chairman, the economy in the West continues to expand at a healthy pace despite the destructions associated with the Boeing strike and the earthquake Employment in the Twelfth District grew 33 percent over the past year, which is considerably stronger than the 27 percent we experienced nationally Discussions with our directors and other business people in the area indicate that business activity remains robust But I think there's a generally shared expectation that [it will be] slowing The Boeing strike shows no sign of a settlement and is beginning to affect the Puget Sound economy which, of course, was the strongest economy in our District We estimate that personal income has been falling by about $25 to $30 million each week of the strike Even assuming some generous multipliers, I think that probably translates into less of an effect than is included in the Greenbook, but I'm really not sure about that If the strike were to continue to the third or fourth month, it is anticipated that the direct income losses would be on the order of about $60 million; but of course there would be secondary effects that would multiply that rather significantly The negative effects from the quake are likely to outweigh the positive effects during the current quarter I don't know how much rebuilding refers to the quake and how much actually applies to [hurricane] Hugo, but we feel that is offset by businesses that have slowed significantly due to actual business closures, the loss of tourists, and the interruption of normal traffic patterns The number of unemployment claims, for example, has skyrocketed in hard-hit areas such as San Francisco where they are up 60 percent If you get out to the Santa Cruz area, in one of the smaller towns there, Mutsenville, they are up 200 percent At the present time, recovery efforts are limited to utility repairs, structural inspections, and demolitions--although I know demolitions add to GNP! With a few notable exceptions--the exception being the Bay Bridge, which will be opening Friday--in general there's not much going on in terms of repair and rebuilding for the simple reason that the earth is still shifting and people are unwilling to do anything until that shifting stops And that typically [lasts for] a 3- to 6- month period  -13-    11/14/89  At the national level, we expect growth to be stronger than that in the Greenbook We feel that consumption spending should benefit from the lagged effect of the strong growth of disposable income in the past two years Moreover, strong investment in business equipment is expected to result from backlogs of orders for aircraft; also, the continued reduction in the relative price of information processing equipment should be a positive development and a source of strength for business spending for equipment In our view, if the economy expands as fast as I think it could, which is around 2 percent, then unemployment will rise only modestly and I think upward pressures on the underlying inflation rate are likely to persist through the end of next year Thank you   Mr Chairman, I support alternative B as well I have a preference for symmetric language as a result of my concerns about inflation and the inflation rate incorporated in the forecast I must admit that I'm not quite sure I fully understand the initial part of your statement about how, if we don't get help from the fiscal side, it may make it impossible I think you said to reach our objectives with regard to inflation   I would hope that one thing we can look at in this study that is being done for next month is how the burden on the  -30-    11/14/89  economy is affected by different assumptions about fiscal policy; because it's not obvious to me how the total burden on the economy changes with combinations of fiscal versus monetary policy But I know how the burden on us changes Okay?   Are we going to meet Monday afternoon?   I'd like to ask an opinion about the credibility issue If one had a Neal resolution, and in addition to that had publicly announced some kind of multiyear path on something such as either nominal GNP or money, do you think that that would have a significant impact on credibility? And, therefore, would that lead you more in the direction of faster adjustment than was incorporated in the model?   Well, first of all, the strong credibility [model] assumed that it would take 2 years before it was believed and that's a fairly long time In addition to the Neal amendment, I was thinking more in terms of setting year-to-year targets, which is one question I might ask   Right, which has to be--   But the targets don't have to be in terms of monetary aggregates They could--   Thank you   I have two comments about what Vice Chairman Corrigan said I would agree that you don't bet the farm on credibility; but it seems to me, Jerry, that you're assuming there is no improvement in credibility And I don't--   You did because you said that you thought it was a zero for the zero inflation base case, which really does assume that credibility [unintelligible] in a very standard model way I think we can expect better than that--not that we should go to the strong case, but I would expect something better than that   You wouldn't expect any?   All right Secondly, I--  MRCORRIGAN Wait a minute Did you say any credibility effects?   Beyond what is assumed by a model that uses past experience as basically conditioning expectations for the future   So, there's no value in stating your [inflation] objective or having a resolution or anything like that? No value whatsoever?   So you would assume no credibility improvement?  -19-    12/18-19/89   Well, I want to talk about one as well   Okay All I'm saying is that you're citing a limiting case where it's zero   Well then, I misunderstand how credibility is formulated in this model   Right   With regard to stating our objectives conditioned by, say, the fiscal authorities It seems to me that if we're going to do that, we would have no credibility because--   Well, we're in charge of what happens to prices   Well, I didn't understand you then   I don't deny that  -20-    12/18-19/89   The concern I have with having an inflation rate objective of, say, 1 percent, for example, is that if you do have an exogenous shock and it is fairly substantial and if these exogenous shocks over time are not random, I think you probably would look back over a period of time--say, 10 years--and find that you had an actual inflation experience that was quite different from what you wanted, which was the 1 percent It seems to me it is much safer and more difficult at least to try to maintain price level stability   Well, on the second question as to whether a specific timetable is necessary, I think we would want to get enhanced credibility and I would assume that that would be a component of it But we do [need to] set off our objectives over some time frame that people consider [relevant] I wouldn't think 10 years would be one; perhaps we would even have some pattern of achievement over, say, a 5-year period   Do you think the probability of positive energy price shocks is the same as the probability of negative price shocks?   In energy?   Mike, a question or two about Boeing We had a conversation with them in the last week that suggested that the delivery of planes in the fourth quarter was a bit stronger than we thought it would be--24 planes in the 48 days during the strike And they actually saw their inventories run down a little We do not have inventory data for their supplies The implication is that in the subsequent quarter one would not actually see a runoff of inventories but a slight accumulation of inventories and that the impact on [exports] would not be as great Now, I don't know when you checked with them--and perhaps different people give different information-- but it's sort of interesting because if these statistics are reliable, it could be that we're not going to see as much fluctuation in exports and inventories in the fourth quarter versus the first quarter   We do have a lot [of information] I don't know how good it is; that's the problem  -65-    12/18-19/89   Sure   Well, they did have the data of the 24 produced during the strike they exported 15 of them and 7 of them were 747s, which are the big ticket items So, exports seem to keep up Now, that would square with what we see in the October numbers   There was one other point they made regarding production effects that was sort of interesting They estimated that normal production would be about $20 billion at an annual rate; and they were estimating about a $9 billion rate for the fourth quarter, which would mean an $11 billion change as opposed to the $14 billion So, perhaps there's not quite as much GNP effect as you have there But, I'm sure all of this will get sorted out in the next month or so   Yes   Mr Chairman, the economy in the West remains healthy with only a few signs of slowing growth Employment gains have been less than earlier in the year but the rate of expansion has not diminished further in recent months Even manufacturing employment has risen in the past year, up 12 percent That certainly is a slower growth but it remains strong when compared to the rest of the country where manufacturing obviously has been either flat or down All nine states in the District had employment growth during the past year that exceeded or matched the average growth in the rest of the nation Even Arizona, a state that has been plagued by a lot of weakness in the construction area, has had employment growth of 29 percent, largely in services and trade employment Also, I had the opportunity very recently to have a discussion with one of the largest retailers in the District who has some stores in this local area as well He indicated to me that at least through the end of last week the Christmas season was equal to last year, which was a very good year I don't know how recent weather patterns have been affecting sales in the last couple of days, but he seems comfortable that they will be able to match what was a very good year last year Concern about the effects of defense cuts in California are a bit overblown, we're beginning to conclude California has the largest share of defense procurement expenditures but on a per capita basis it really only ranks 10th in the country, which suggests that there is more diversification than in nine other states with regard to defense expenditures Also, we observe that there are growing backlogs of orders for commercial aircraft in the state of California--either as a  -75-    12/18-19/89  result of McDonnell Douglas or secondary contractors to Boeing--and that is taking up most of the employment slack in the defense-related area So in total the employment gains there are fairly respectable With regard to Boeing, the Boeing settlement is quite complex and we've been trying to price it out The best we can conclude is that it will increase labor costs on average about 8 percent per year over the next 3 years with two-thirds of that occurring in the first year So it is a very complex and relatively expensive contract But given the demand for their product I guess that's not all that surprising  Turning to the national economy, I must admit that we have a somewhat stronger economy projected for the nation in 1990, primarily due to greater strength in PCE As a result of that, our inflation forecast is slightly higher Thank you, Mr Chairman   It got as high as 13 percent   Mr Chairman, I basically would like to associate my views with those of President Boehne Clearly, the economy has slowed substantially this quarter but there are temporary factors involved such as Boeing And it seems to me quite conceivable that over the next few quarters economic growth could turn out to be somewhat [higher] than that incorporated in the Greenbook, although clearly it would be moderate It seems to me, though, that a moderate pace of output growth is essential to lower the risk of an acceleration in underlying inflation and to begin to make some progress toward price stability Thus, I would support an unchanged policy stance at this point   I can accept asymmetric; it isn't my first choice, but I can accept it   Well, that's likely to cause problems   I would not do that   Isn't there some suggestion that the increase in long-term rates could be due to higher inflation expectations? I note that the surveys we have available now cover inflation over a shorter timeframe but are indicative perhaps of a change in thoughts about inflation In addition, some people have been concluding that the probabilities of recession are somewhat less now than they were a month or so ago All of that would be consistent with the idea that    2/6-7/90  we have upward pressure on interest rates in the long-term end of the market for domestic purposes as a reflection of changed inflationary expectations   Mr Chairman, turning first to the national economy At current levels of interest rates we would expect real GNP at slightly less than 2 percent for this year However, we do expect the composition of growth to be quite different from that in the Greenbook For example, we are forecasting stronger consumer spending as a result of past strength in disposable income Also, we are projecting a much smaller correction of nonfarm inventory investment from its fourth-quarter high However, due to a long lag in the dollar's influence on trade, we don't expect significant improvement in real net exports until 1991 With regard to inflation, we expect the GNP fixed-weight index to average between 4 and 4-1/2 percent this year Mild upward pressure on inflation should come from the price of oil, previous increases in the value of the dollar, and tight labor markets If economic growth is moderate, pressures from the labor market should begin to subside late this year But I really don't    2/6-7/90  expect to see any downward pressures on inflation--certainly on the underlying rate of inflation--until late next year  If I may turn to the District economy, the economy in the West continues to exhibit healthy growth We took a look at the Twelfth District employment growth last year and I think the numbers are really extraordinary From December 1988 until December 1989 we saw employment in the District grow 32 percent; this compared to 23 percent growth for the nation--an extremely wide difference Concern has been expressed about a collapse of California's real estate market Our admittedly not detailed analysis--but I think it has been fairly careful--indicates that those concerns probably are not warranted The housing market does not appear to be overbuilt in California From 1984 to 1988 the ratio of new residents to new home permits was about 2 in California The ratio for the nation was 11; in New England it's 08 The point is that we have had a very large increase in in-migration into the state and that has increased the demand for housing rather substantially In addition, we have not seen a significant fall-off, at least to date, in home sales They are down a bit from 1988 but not nearly as low as the average for the five years that preceded 1988 Also, there has been some decline in the state's median home price but that appears to be a change in the composition of homes sold We're seeing a lot of strength in the central valley of California and in the Riverside-San Bernardino area --where the price of housing is quite a bit less--and less strength in the more urban areas Meanwhile, the market for single-family homes in the Pacific Northwest is really booming, particularly in the Puget Sound area Bidding wars have become common and home values are increasing at a yearly rate of 20 to 25 percent in many parts of that area Thank you   What was your estimate?   Two questions referring to page 8 [in the Bluebook] The tentative range for M2 is not only consistent with the baseline throughout the entire period but it also provides the flexibility that if one wanted to be somewhat more aggressive in trying to reduce inflation it is in some respects even more consistent with that outcome as well Is that correct?   Well, the second point is that with regard to alternative III, which is the 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent range, you cite in your remarks the advantage of following the precedent of trying to reduce the [ranges for] growth of the aggregates 1/2 percentage point It looks, based upon the record, that we ought to forget about that if reducing [the ranges] 1/2 percentage point in the future is something that we probably can't live up to And perhaps we ought to recognize that as soon as possible   Thank you   Oh, sure   Even in 1990 I think we perhaps would get some advantage by publishing a 1/2 percentage point decrease But it then runs the greater risk that we're going to tell the market at the end of the year that we have missed   I would be for alternative II; it not only provides an alternative that is consistent with our baseline but it also gives us the flexibility, if we wish to exercise it, to embark on a more aggressive policy to reduce the rate of inflation I think it has a significant advantage over alternative III because I'm concerned that alternative III--though it has the advantage of maybe signaling our intentions--might set us up for failure in terms of not being able to adhere to it So, I think this alternative is just what we need to accomplish not only our objectives for 1990, but potentially it sets us on the right path for subsequent years as well   Don, I have a question about the consistency of the short- and long-term [alternatives] with regard to M2 Alternative B seems to me quite consistent with the alternative that was chosen for the long term Obviously, M2 [growth] ends up high well into the '90s On the other hand, if one were in favor of alternative III for the long term, that seems to me consistent with alternative C, and alternative C really is not consistent with the alternative that was chosen for the long term Is that correct?   Well, I agree with that But someone who was strongly in favor of alternative III probably would be more inclined to follow "C"   That's all I wanted to know Thank you   I also would support alternative "B" and symmetric language   When is the planning meeting?   Manley, were you talking about total real estate [financing] or real estate [financing] provided by commercial banks?   There has been some switching, of course, in the commercial banking industry   But there has to be a big FIRREA effect there   Ted, I have two questions You mentioned the assumption about the path of the dollar Is that the declining [unintelligible]? Could you give me some numbers? I can't remember what you were assuming before   This year   You pointed to some areas of strength that may show up in Eastern Europe other than in East Germany The second question is Isn't there another side that perhaps doesn't get as much attention, and that is that there could be some very important sources of weakness as well? One gets the impression that in places like Hungary and Czechoslovakia orders from the the Soviet Union have declined very substantially in the steel industry and other areas as well Isn't it conceivable that in 1990 growth in those areas may actually turn out to be less than was anticipated before the--   Right   It's even exaggerated in those countries because prices were being subsidized Thank you   Another point is that in the first quarter the trade-weighted dollar was down at a double-digit [rate] in spite of what happened to the yen So we have a very substantial decline in the trade-weighted--  -13-    3/27/90   But they are weighted according to the amount of trade that's done   Well, that would give more to Japan if they did it on [ancient] history because Japan had a higher weight   Well, you'd use a lesser weight for Japan   Yes   I'll tell you it's the fourth quarter of '89 If you compare that to the estimate of the first quarter of this year is it down, Ted?   17 percent on the weighted average   [Unintelligible]   Well, if you look at Germany, Ted did explain it in the sense that if there's going to be greater economic activity in eastern Germany, it's going to affect western Germany in that the return on capital is likely to rise If the real rate of return on capital in Germany rises, I would assume that investors would make portfolio shifts into--   But you never incorporated change in policy in the intermeeting period just immediately ahead, right?   Sure   Mr Chairman, the Twelfth District is also out of phase with the rest of the nation The economy remains strong, although the sources of strength have changed The growth of employment in the past year in the entire Twelfth District has been 34 percent, which is an extraordinarily large gain relative to the 2 percent for the rest of the nation Economic growth in most parts of the region remains very high As an example, over that period there are three states--Washington, Idaho, and Oregon--where growth rates of employment were 6 to 10 percent in the past year Looking at all 9 states, even Arizona, which had a very respectable 35 percent growth rate, exceeded the average in the entire District Construction employment is very strong; it was up 81 percent in the past year And manufacturing [employment] rose 9 percent in the past year, compared to a fall of 14 percent nationally There has been some shift, however, away from California to other parts of the District Employment growth in California is getting much closer to that of the rest of the nation Whereas in 1988 California accounted for 63 percent of all the employment growth in our District, last year it was only 44 percent Also, similar to Arizona, we have seen some weakening of housing prices in some California markets  -22-    3/27/90  If I may turn to the national economy As we've all discussed so far this morning, real growth, inflation, and interest pressures certainly seem to be stronger than they were at the time of the last meeting Even with some restraint from higher interest rates, which is in both the Greenbook forecast and in our own, we would expect real GNP growth of at least 2 percent this year I think some of that strength is going to come from consumption spending, reflecting the past strength in disposable income I would also anticipate that stronger foreign GNP growth will lead to greater strength in net exports than previously had seemed likely We're expecting the GNP fixed-weight index to average something very similar to that shown in the Greenbook, around 4-1/2 percent both this year and next Admittedly, part of this worsening is due to firmer oil prices and the effects of past weakness in the trade-weighted dollar Of course, if these factors were to reverse themselves, then we could get a break on the inflation front Moreover, the fact that wages have been performing well probably does limit the size of the inflation problem However, it's our view that the best way to insure that inflation begins to subside--and that certainly is not something that we see in our forecast--is to maintain moderate economic growth Thank you, Mr Chairman   Just continuing along that line a little If a significant proportion of the increase is due to increases in real rates, what would be the implication in moving the funds rate [up]? How would you see the market responding?   But that's the only rate that hasn't had an increase in real terms over this period--   Would you say the chance of such a move not affecting long-term rates or having them decline slightly is very, very remote?   Okay   Mr Chairman, I agree with you that there is some uncertainty about both the strength of the economy and also the extent of the inflation problems However, I would prefer a small move in the direction of tightness somewhere between Bluebook alternatives "B" and "C" It seems to me that if the Greenbook is correct--and certainly our work would suggest that it is--there will be a need for some fairly significant, or at least eyecatching, tightening in the second half of the year It might be easier to do some of that at the present time and have to do a little less in the second half of the year If that's not in the cards, to me a fallback position is to support asymmetric language in favor of a tighter policy That approach would ensure that policy could be tightened promptly if we had indications that indeed the economy is strengthening and if inflationary pressures look like they're even more of a concern in the seven weeks until our next meeting   Ed, are you saying that those are both valid reasons for intervention?   Implicit in your comment is that you think it's effective   Is your concern about the $20 billion a foreign exchange risk concern?  -47-    3/27/90  SPEAKER(?) It's a political concern   But it seems that we all agree with this I think the issue is How can we be effective in getting that viewpoint across--by playing the game or by picking up our mitt and going home?   But you agree that there are times when it does have an effect?   Would you sketch out what the environment will be like after that point? In other words, what would be our role when we've reached that point where we say we're not going to intervene? What influence would we have? How would that be preferable?   I don't disagree with that, but you say we will pull out at some point After we've pulled out what kind of discipline can we exert?   My point was somewhat similar to Governor Angell's The sentence on page I-3 [of the Greenbook] says "The recent data reinforced the view long embodied in the staff forecast that restoration of a disinflationary trend is unlikely at current levels of resource utilization" The implication is that if we stay where we are for a very long time, there is only a very small chance of restoring the disinflationary trend and, in fact, it might even produce an increase in inflationary pressures That's the implication   One get's the general feeling, though, that the public feels that if we were to stay where we are we would have a continuation of growth rates of around 2 percent and a gradual [reduction of inflation] What you're basically saying is that if we stay where we are, growth rates are likely to pick up and we will not be able to restore [unintelligible]   But they would not be assuming much in the way of interest rate pressures?   That's my point    5/15/90   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Twelfth District economy remains pretty strong despite slower growth in recent months Employment in the West grew 32 percent in the past year, which is somewhat slower than the kinds of growth rates in employment that we were seeing in 1989 when they averaged 41 percent All of that slowing in growth can be attributed to the state of California California's growth in recent months has been quite similar to that of the rest of the nation but the other states are doing extraordinarily well For example, if you look at the seven fastest growing states in the nation, all seven of them were in the Twelfth District The outlook for western agriculture is positive overall, although this summer's harvest is unlikely to be as profitable as those in recent years Inventories of many agricultural products are higher than they were a year ago and the acreage that has been planted in the West is high as well Even drought-affected crops such as cotton and rice are only going to be cut about 10 percent, so we'll see a large increase in output At the same time, costs for some farm inputs are up dramatically In California we're in the fourth year of drought And in California that means you irrigate in a different way Instead of using surface water, you go to well water or ground water; and that costs a lot more money and is going to cut substantially into the profits of farmers In a state like Idaho where they also use a lot  -10-    5/15/90  of irrigation, they have a shortage of water and the difficulty there is in obtaining irrigation pipe Apparently, it costs three times as much this year--if you can get it--than it did last year So, the agricultural situation really isn't that bad overall, but it's quite likely that agriculture won't be quite as prosperous financially as it was in the last year  I might note parenthetically on this issue of credit availability to farmers and to small businesses that we had two banks give us some very interesting observations, and I'd be interested if others ran into the same thing One of the large banks said that there is a substantial restriction on credit to small businesses Another banker said there were restrictions to agriculture, but he said it wasn't related at all to what has been happening with regard to regulators' views or associated types of events He said it's related to environmental concerns Banks, whenever they take over collateral when there's a default on a loan, are then responsible for the environmental consequences So his bank, for example, which is a large bank, was no longer making small business loans to any gasoline stations, dry cleaning establishments, or any farms which had in- ground gasoline or diesel tanks And any time they were doing large projects they would have to send out an environmental appraiser as well as a value appraiser He said this was having a very significant effect on lending My understanding is that apparently this is such a hot button with the industry that there are a couple of Congressmen who are now in the process of introducing legislation that will rectify this situation It's a little different wrinkle that I hadn't heard before but apparently, at least among our bankers, it's very significant  Turning to the national economy, our outlook for the year 1990 is very similar to that of the Greenbook We do part a bit in 1991, but it's a result of the difference in monetary policy assumptions We don't have the federal funds rate rising as rapidly, and we get a result which actually is quite consistent with the Greenbook's results With an increase in rates of about half of that in the Greenbook we get growth in 1991 of 2 percent and, indeed, there is no basic drop in the underlying inflation rate until 1992 Thank you   Don, if you go back to the period before the latest period, there was a sharp increase in long-term rates I know you can't answer this specifically, but in your view what explains that rise mostly? Was a change in inflationary expectations mainly what caused that? Or was it some development worldwide or here that caused the real rate to go [up]?  -25-    5/15/90   But through this period, then, if most of it was due to expectations of higher inflation, there has not been a tightening in monetary and financial conditions There was a discussion here that implied that this was a tightening and that hasn't occurred to the extent that it's--   Right Thank you   Mr Chairman, I could support your position but for somewhat different reasons It seems to me that the uncertainties about the direction of the economy are perhaps the greatest reason to support alternative B at this point I must admit that looking at the data and hearing the discussion today, I would never use the term "credit crunch" in the classic ways that I've heard that term used  -27-    5/15/90   Okay Then I would hope that we can in our separate Districts and here at the Board find a way to monitor that very closely A credit crunch has real implications   Well, we have [unintelligible] than last year If you recall at this time--   Well, it seems to me it is something that we ought to monitor very closely   I'd like to ask a question of Mike on the basic assumption that a shift in credit supply conditions has occurred Throughout the Greenbook and the Bluebook there was certainly discussion of these events Could you give me some idea as to how important those conditions are in terms of the forecast? Did they represent some percentage of GNP that did not occur as a result?   A quarter of a percent, then?   Well, I was thinking of risks of changes in supply, which could originate from both of those factors   Well, did you make any adjustments in the model to reflect the kinds of things that typically would not be captured by a model?   So, what you had in there are the typical types of changes in the supply of credit due to diminished prospects with regard to growth of income, employment, etc   Don't get me wrong; I don't think you're understating these events I just wondered how you did it, that's all I think the effects are probably on the low side of what you're saying It is difficult to know how to deal with it   I have a question about timing in terms of monetary policy reactions to a change in fiscal policy If greater fiscal tightness were imposed and one wanted, say, to keep output close to the baseline path, what do the different lag structures associated with monetary and fiscal policy tell you in terms of the timing requirements for monetary policy?   Do more   Well, it warmed Milton Friedman's heart because the permanent income hypothesis explained it pretty well   Mr Chairman, the Twelfth District economy continues to grow, but the pace of growth has slowed recently Employment grew at a 28 percent annual rate from January through May That compares favorably to the US rate of growth of employment of 18 percent, but it does represent a slowdown From May of 1989 until January of 1990 employment in the District was growing at rate of about 3-1/2 percent Conditions remain good in the trade and services sectors Retailers report healthy sales, confirming moderate employment growth in recent months In most parts of the West, home sales are still strong and median prices are rising but at a much slower rate Reports of particularly robust activity come from Seattle, Sacramento, Oregon, and parts of Utah and Idaho However, in the coastal areas of California, which are primarily Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Francisco, sales volumes and median prices have fallen from the high levels of a year ago Although sales of more affordable homes continue to be robust, construction activity has fallen from the high levels of a few months ago Nevertheless, the level of activity remains high with construction employment still registering solid gains over year-earlier levels Manufacturing activity continues mixed Production of commercial aircraft, aluminum, and some construction-related products is reported to be strong However, employment gains in commercial aircraft are limited by both capacity constraints and also by improvements in labor productivity It's interesting to note that Boeing has actually laid off some people and apparently has done that, as they explain it, as a result of increased  -12-    7/2-3/90  labor productivity High-technology-related industries are relatively flat overall with wide variations among firms and product lines And layoffs and plant closures associated with defense cutbacks continue  If I may turn to the national economy, we're in general agreement with the outlook in the Greenbook for this year, but we do have a few differences Adopting the Greenbook assumption of no change in the current level of short-term interest rates, our forecast would be about a quarter of a percentage point stronger, at least in 1990 and continuing into the first part of 1991 I'm not sure exactly what the causes of these differences are, but I have a feeling that they might be accounted for to some extent by differences in the impacts of credit availability effects Even in the absence of credit availability effects, we expect real GNP growth to be less than that of the growth of potential, putting some modest upward pressures on the unemployment rate and containing inflationary pressures, at least underlying inflationary pressures Therefore, we anticipate inflation in the GNP fixed-weight price index to average about 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent over the next 18 months, which I believe is slightly higher than that in the Greenbook Thank you   We're not supposed to adjust policy based on that, are we?   The growth rates for M2 and M3 in 1990 and 1991, particularly 1991, assume that the special factors that impacted 1990 will persist in 1991 Is that correct, particularly with regard to M3?   Mr Chairman, according to our projections, the present 3 to 7 percent range seems likely to accommodate the uncertainty about M2 over the remainder of this year, although it's likely to end up toward the bottom part of that range Therefore, I recommend that we reaffirm our M2 target for 1990 For 1991, at least based upon our projections, I would recommend a 1/2 point reduction in the M2 target, but I certainly wouldn't have any problem if we reduced it a full point to 2 to 6 percent On the basis of our projections a [reduction of] 1/2 point would accommodate the growth of M2 that we would see and put M2 exactly in the middle [of that lower range] With regard to M3, the special factors that we've seen probably will continue to depress M3 in the second half of the year And, of course, that's going to place the aggregate well below the current  -31-    7/2-3/90  range in December But I prefer to retain the present M3 range for 1990 and just explain to the [Congressional] Committee that there are some very special factors--and uncertainty as to how long they're going to last as well--that may cause it to end up below the lower end For 1991, I would suggest a reduction of 1 percentage point in the M3 range Again, that would be consistent with the forecast of M3 that we have for 1991 I must admit, though, that the uncertainties associated with M3 are so great that my confidence in that range or the range that is in the alternative in the Bluebook is not very high With regard to debt, 5 to 9 percent in 1990 and 4 to 8 percent in 1991 would be appropriate in my view   Mr Chairman, I would favor alternative "B" However, since I think there is a good chance that economic growth will be faster in the second half than in the first half, I would prefer symmetrical language   Peter, what do you think the number of primary dealers will be a year from now? What is basically happening? I assume these pressures are not likely to get any better in terms of profitability   So we may get back to that?   I have two questions Dave, at the FOMC information call Ted Truman gave us some useful rules of thumb about the effects of a change in the price of oil on real growth and also on the CPI inflation It seems to me that the effects on inflation are rather substantial; I was struck by what you show as a very sharp decline in the fixed-weight deflator for the fourth quarter from 47 to 40 percent I know the impacts on the fixed-weight deflator are different from those on the CPI But even taking that into account, it seems to me that that is a very low number Could you explain that and indicate what contribution oil is making to that number?   So, it's just across the board--smaller increases in quite a few sectors?   Yes, I heard The second point is that I was really struck by the Commerce Department revisions of compensation per manhour in the nonfarm business sector for 1989 In the period from 1984 through [the end of] your forecast the lowest compensation per manhour, excluding 1989, is 37 percent; in the forecast it's about 51 or 52 percent During the whole year [1989] the increase was in the 2 percent area It just seems very difficult to understand what happened in 1989 that would make those numbers believable   Okay   It certainly seems to be that way at this point    8/21/90 -5-   Yes   I think so Thank you   Mr Chairman, in the Twelfth District, employment growth continues to exceed that of the nation, although the rate of growth has slowed more in recent months than has been the case in the nation For example, if you go back a year ago, our growth of employment was about 1-1/2 percent more than the rest of the nation; now it's running a little under 1 percent more Following the national pattern, employment in manufacturing and construction has fallen in recent months, but it has fallen at a rate that is less than half that for the rest of the nation Growth of trade and services industry employment is below that of a year earlier, but the growth rates continue to be in the area of 3 to 4 percent, which are not bad increases Agriculture is performing well in the District as a result of high crop prices and yields and also high livestock prices  If I can turn to California, since California got some attention in the Greenbook as well, economic growth has slowed from last year's pace; there's no question about that But the state's employment is growing at a steady rate of just under 2-1/2 percent on a year-over-year basis Defense and aerospace layoffs are [slowing] and will slow economic growth But even in LA and San Francisco, where the bulk of the layoffs will take place, the loss of jobs in these sectors will be small relative to what are expected to be healthy gains in other nonmanufacturing sectors Real estate activity is slow There's no question that sales and permits are off significantly Median home prices indicate the drop in home prices but, as was indicated in the Greenbook, most of the decline reflects a shift in the composition of sales to lower priced areas, particularly Sacramento, Riverside, and places like that, and also to smaller homes  Turning to the national economy, although the risk of recession certainly is real, the upward revisions in retail sales for May and June, the June drop in the inventory/sales ratio, and the favorable report on June net exports are certainly encouraging It appears as though, with a better balance between inventories and sales, positive real growth in the second half is quite likely Although the Greenbook's oil price assumptions are reasonable, I believe that the effect on inflation in the second half of the year will be larger than that indicated in the Greenbook In addition, the impact of higher oil prices in stimulating business investment could turn out to be a bit greater than implied in the Greenbook forecast Finally, although a future drop in oil prices is assumed and certainly would help to moderate inflation, I don't think we should forget the effects of the dollar depreciation, which has been quite substantial The latter, plus continued upward pressure on wages, should prevent a significant decline in inflation next year Thank you   I'd like to ask a question about what you referred to as the "felicitous" outcome involving an unchanged [nominal] income path after the shock which, of course, leads to an [un]changed interest rate path and M2 path To me that has critical implications for the policy decision we make here What bothers me a little is that it seems to me a bit counter-intuitive; also, I know a couple of models at least where there are different results It would seem more likely, with an oil shock of the magnitude we're talking about, that in the first year we probably are going to see more of the impact on higher prices than on the real side That would suggest that in order to get the same path for nominal income growth we would need higher interest rates and somewhat slower growth of M2 And if indeed the same nominal income path is what we want now, this is a very critical difference I don't know how much effort was spent in trying to verify this or to look at it in different ways, but assuming an unchanged nominal path is what we want, it's critical which interest rate path is consistent   Yes   Well, we had price controls   It seems to me that we made one major judgment that interest rates should be the same or lower, but I have a feeling that we shouldn't take too much confidence in that result It seems to me quite likely that if we make that judgment then we're probably, in effect, going to see higher nominal income and it's probably going to be primarily as a result of greater inflation I think the risk is there and it's a significant risk   Right   Oh, that's true   But it may cast it in a somewhat more [unintelligible] way if indeed the underlying relationships are different than as portrayed by that model But you're right It depends on what you want to set as your objective   Mr Chairman, in light of the uncertainties and concerns that you mentioned, I certainly would be supportive of Bluebook alternative B In terms of my own viewpoint, though, my concerns about higher inflation are equal to my concerns about recession Consequently, if I had my druthers, I'd prefer symmetric language as well   Mr Chairman, this is Bob Parry In the Twelfth District, there really hasn't been any significant change in views since the meeting There is a lot of uncertainty, primarily associated with developments in the Middle East, but basically I wouldn't say that there is any substantive change I would also say, on a national basis, that the data we've seen since the last FOMC meeting would not suggest any greater need to make a change than was apparent at that time And I would support your viewpoint that a change in policy is not required at this point    9/7/90   This is Bob Parry I wonder if at that meeting we could have an update of the forecast by the staff, because in addition to looking at these individual statistics it's probably even more important that we make the policy move on how we see the future It would be very interesting, I think, to get an update on their projections   In which direction? [LAUGHTER]   Mr Chairman, this is Bob Parry One question I have--perhaps this should be directed to Don--is If we were to ease very modestly, what would be the expectation of the effects on nominal growth in '91 if we wanted it focused on [unintelligible] What might happen to nominal growth if we kept the interest rate constant? That probably would result in nominal growth being higher as a result of the oil shock, and the Board staff's expectation was that nominal growth would remain unchanged If interest rates go down, it seems to me we are probably talking about higher nominal growth, which is going to result primarily in higher inflation I wonder what Don's view is on this   Mr Chairman, this is Bob Parry We've seen some signs of weak economic activity in recent weeks; we recently had a breakfast meeting where that was communicated But at this point I'd like to be associated with Bob Black, Roger Guffey, and others who suggest that perhaps we ought to not take this step to ease at the present time   But if it were explained that there would be greater fluctuations in the funds rate, do you think that's something they could live with?    10/2/90   It will?   I'd like to pursue a little more your views on the consequences of passage of the budget compromise If the compromise is passed and signed, you feel that that probably would produce a rally in the long-term end of the market? Is that correct?   That, and you said the consequence, if we then followed that with an easing move, would be that long-term rates would probably [unintelligible] and not move up Is that what you're thinking?   But it would make your job easier to use a range?   You mentioned the conservative inventory policy here, but basically it isn't much of a cycle in inventories Do you feel very confident about that? Typically, one expects some buildup of excess inventories, which are subsequently run off, and then some increased production as the economy picks up We go through these cycles in real GNP But in truth, these inventories are really pretty [consistently] at very low levels; that may be a potential source for some greater cyclicality than was in the forecast   Okay   Mr Chairman, at present it's really not clear what impact the developments in the Middle East are having on the Twelfth District economy On the one hand, there are anecdotal reports that do suggest a considerably less optimistic attitude by business leaders in the District, and we've also seen some slowing in retail sales We do a survey of business leaders asking them whether they expect recession in the next 12 months, and in the most recent survey 40 percent of the survey respondents said they do expect a recession That represents a change from only 4 percent several weeks ago That to us was a rather significant change While the attitudes of most of these respondents have changed considerably, when we then asked them whether they actually had made changes in their business plans, we found that a number are taking an increasingly cautious attitude toward investment and operating costs, but the vast majority really have not changed their plans at this point When we talk to retailers, we find that quite a few have experienced either slower sales or actual decreases in sales of nondurable goods in August and early September These are not published data; these are just reports from individuals At the same time, however, the recent published data don't show very much in the way of weakness Employment, for example, showed some improvement in July and August over what was a bit of a sluggish performance in the second quarter Employment levels in August were 32 percent higher than a year ago That compares to 16 percent for the rest of the nation, so it's a very strong performance  As for real estate, although this number has a little problem with it, real estate loans--single-family and home equity loans--have  -19-    10/2/90  continued to expand at a rate of 227 percent in the past year If you look at the monthly seasonally adjusted increases in the past seven months, they have ranged between 13 percent and 45 percent I must admit that some of that is due to the bank restructurings, because S&Ls are becoming a less significant factor, particularly in the state of California and also in Arizona But even stripping that out, there is underlying strength in real estate loans in single- family and home equity loans in the Twelfth District  If I can turn to the national outlook for the moment, the basic path of the Greenbook forecast certainly seems plausible to us We expect one or two extremely weak--and I guess they could be negative--quarters We would say that is primarily resulting from the oil shock We then would expect that to be followed by a pickup of growth in the first half of next year I think one of the primary sources of strength is going to be in the net export area, resulting from the 15 percent decline in the trade-weighted value of the dollar in the past year We also expect, using the Greenbook's assumptions with regard to oil prices later on in the period, that consumer spending should pick up in 1991 Inflation certainly is going to be higher next year--probably somewhat over 5 percent, as indicated in the Greenbook Inflation will be fueled not only by higher oil prices, but we ought to keep in mind also the impact of the decline in the value of the dollar, and more importantly, underlying wage pressures The unemployment rate at its current level suggests that, even without the oil shock, the economy would have been straining at its capacity to produce in the months ahead and that that would have been a further impetus to strong underlying price pressures   Don, the three alternatives you talked about are different from what was in the Bluebook, right?  -38-    10/2/90   Is there no analytic support at all--something that might suggest that the inflation problem is severe and should be dealt with?   Yes   That doesn't sound very economic   And this is primarily in response to the credit conditions?   Because there's more weakness than that imparted by the supply shock? If, as I thought was stated, most of the weakness was a result of this supply shock, there's nothing we can do about that really   Well, one can do something about the inflation to some extent   That's right  -46-    10/2/90   I guess I see the tradeoffs perhaps somewhat differently You are computing the Greenbook's forecast of what is likely to happen to the oil price but the Greenbook's forecast of interest rates is constant If you had interest rates declining--   Mr Chairman, the price level consequences of the oil shock are my greatest concern, and I would hope that we would take actions to make sure that those price level consequences don't get embedded in underlying inflation And I think the inflationary pressures were significant even before the oil shock It seems to me that the best way to deal with this situation would be to have an unchanged funds rate So, I would support that alternative, whatever it is--"B," or "B-A", or whatever   We could discuss it over breakfast  SPEAKER(?) We'll be here at breakfast   What is the nature of that problem?   Right   Mr Chairman, since you characterized the sentence as an anachronism, why don't we choose the environmentally sensitive solution and eliminate it?   I don't think so either   The Twelfth District accounts for just under 30 percent of US oil production Higher oil prices have stimulated very little additional production in Alaska and California due to uncertainty about how long prices will remain high and also due to problems associated with environmental restrictions Even at current levels, however, higher prices are yielding a windfall of revenues for Alaska's state government and also are stimulating the Alaska economy in a significant way  Home sales have declined sharply and median home prices have declined moderately during the past year in California markets The southern California real estate market is particularly weak; sales activity is down in the previously hot Seattle and Sacramento markets and price increases there are moderating Concerns about overbuilding in nonresidential markets, particularly in southern California, are widespread; and recent declines in rents and leasing concessions are consistent with these concerns After adjusting for the normal relationship between bank lending and economic activity, lending by large banks in the Twelfth District has not been unusually low  Turning to the national outlook, the basic scenario of the Greenbook forecast certainly seems plausible However, real growth may be a little stronger and inflation somewhat higher than in the Greenbook, especially if interest rates follow a lower path than that assumed in the Greenbook We expect negative net real growth in the current quarter and probably also in the first quarter of next year related largely to the effect of oil prices As the effects of higher oil prices begin to dissipate when oil prices decline, however, the economy should pick up by next spring Although consumption spending will continue to be weak for a while, I would agree with the Greenbook that net exports will contribute over 1 percentage point to the growth of GNP next year and help to prevent a serious downturn The underlying rate of inflation is not likely to rise significantly next year, but I expect that the lower value of the dollar will be a factor contributing over 1 percentage point to the inflation in GNP prices next year and even more to consumer prices Thank you, Mr Chairman   I would support it as well   I'm just wondering if the funds rate is going to come down without a change in the discount rate How do you think the participants in the market would view that? Would that confuse them or would that be a non-event?    12/18/90   Would it affect your operations at all?   Easier or more difficult?   Ted, I'd like to follow up a bit on your comments about net exports The decline in GNP for the fourth quarter that the staff has in the Greenbook is about $32 - $33 billion and the improvement in net exports is about $30 billion That improvement has to look highly unlikely, given the October number You usually don't have reversals, though this could be something of an aberration   If the improvement were on the order of maybe half of what was forecast here, we could be talking about a decline of 1 or 2 percent more at an annual rate than the forecast   Right   But you said PCE in October, right?   Mr Chairman, the economy in the Twelfth District continues to be slow overall, with mixed pockets of activity across the region The California economy, which accounts for about two- thirds of the District's employment, has slowed along with the nation If we look at employment, what has happened since August is that employment is actually down slightly and our year-over-year employment growth remains about 1/2 point above the national average Not surprisingly, the slowdown has been most pronounced in trade, construction, and manufacturing, with year-over-year declines in construction and manufacturing that are not that different from the rest of the nation In the near term we expect that the state will continue to move along with the national pattern If you look at the remainder of the District, however, there are some rather interesting developments There are some effects of the national slowdown, but the District's manufacturing employment outside of California is actually at the same level as a year earlier and construction and trade employment are up 43 and 36 percent, respectively Residential real estate sales volumes are certainly down in California, Hawaii, and Washington but up in a fairly sizable way-- believe it or not--in Arizona, Utah, Idaho, and Nevada Home prices continue to rise except in Seattle and the coastal California areas, which, of course, do represent a very substantial part of the District The agricultural outlook, which is very important to us because in some measures it is the single largest industry in the District, is quite bright The USDA points to particularly strong production and export performance for the region's fruits, vegetables, and other specialty crops  If I may turn very briefly to the national outlook In the current quarter we see real GNP declining at a rate of about 4 to 5 percent, which is a bit stronger falloff than projected in the Greenbook I must admit that I can't point to any particular quantifiable factor that would be causing that degree of weakness It's obvious, for example, that the oil shock is not enough to produce that kind of a falloff Our best guess is that we'll see a small rate of decline in the first quarter, similar to that in the Greenbook, followed by a pickup in the second half of the year much along the same lines as in the Greenbook, including improved exports It does appear to us that the underlying inflation rate may have peaked and that with the unemployment rate on the rise we're likely to see some moderate progress in that area over the next year or so Our projections for inflation, however, are somewhat higher than those in the Greenbook Thank you   [Unintelligible], I guess mainly because the Greenbook is a bit more optimistic than I would be I would like to make two points, though It seems to me that the process that we've been going through in recent months does suggest that there is a high likelihood that we will overshoot at some point I feel as though we have to have a view of the future that we have some confidence in We realize that there are rather substantial lags in terms of when these policy changes will have an effect And if we don't do that, and we react primarily to conditions as we see them appear in the statistics, I think that there is a high likelihood we will overshoot Secondly, if that does occur and maybe even if it doesn't--and this is a point that you certainly alluded to--I think we need to be prepared to reverse our actions at some point rather promptly   I want to think about it   Do these developments suggest that the level of reserves that banks are required to hold is very close to what they would hold if there were no required reserves?   Isn't that sort of surprising? One would have thought that with a 12 percent requirement on transactions balances that would have [meant] much more [reserves] than a bank--   It is surprising that just that one change in reserve requirements, which didn't look like it was that much in terms of billions, just moved to the margin--   It's a fifty percent change   We need another commission   First, I'd like to say that the presentation was very useful--particularly the last exercise, which was quite helpful I'd like to press a bit more on this issue of the credit crunch I think I understand how you characterized its impact but I wonder if you would do it somewhat differently If you were to look at the causes of recession, such as higher oil prices, war, consumer confidence, or--as some outside this room might say--monetary policy, etc, where would you in an ordinal sense put the credit crunch? How would you characterize it--as small, as the top cause, or as the bottom one?   Some rather to these other--   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Twelfth District economy continues to blend recessionary problems in California with robust growth in the rest of the region The California economy continues to experience weakness similar to that of the rest of the  -20-    2/5-6/91  nation, although some data indicate that conditions may be improving Employment in January registered a 11 percent decline from a year earlier, with weakness reported in durable goods manufacturing, construction, and retail Agriculture has suffered at least $1 billion in crop losses because of the freeze and it looks as though there could be significantly greater damage if the water cuts actually take effect as a result of the very serious drought The remainder of the District states continue to report relatively strong growth Outside California, employment in the past year has grown 33 percent Individual state growth rates range from a low of 23 percent in Hawaii to 6 percent in Nevada But Hawaii is a very interesting situation They're not growing because they don't have a growing labor force; they have an unemployment rate of only 28 percent Despite relatively sluggish retail sales, trade employment still has grown 32 percent in the rest of the District And employment in services has grown a solid 5 percent  I have two interesting vignettes about the effect of the war on the economy, who is a very large retailer with stores predominantly in the West but also on the East Coast He said that they didn't have the best Christmas but that sales really started to pick up right after Christmas and then just went down the tank on the 16th of January I called him last Friday and he said that sales have started to come back a bit, so apparently there must have been a very quick reaction, probably because people were watching their televisions   The other vignette is from He said that the Prime Minister of Japan made a speech about the inappropriateness of people vacationing if they are draft age males; it wouldn't look good to the rest of the world And in the week after the speech there were 2,000 cancellations [by Japanese tourists] of reservations in Hawaii, each one of whom typically goes for 4 or 5 days and spends $500 per person as opposed to $125 spent by US tourists I just thought those stories were rather interesting  If I can turn to the national outlook, we are expecting a short recession and a moderately strong recovery, assuming that the war in the Gulf is over by spring and oil prices remain low Our forecast, as it turns out, is very similar to that of the Greenbook And we do expect the inflation rate to come down to about 4 percent or a little lower both this year and next However, I'd like to add that to prevent a subsequent rise in inflation, it seems that we're going to have to respond to the economic recovery by tightening policy in a timely fashion, which of course is assumed in the Greenbook forecast, just as we've recently eased policy to prevent a deep recession   Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation of alternative B since it appears that the economy will be recovering at a satisfactory rate 6 to 9 months from now, especially in light of the policy moves that were taken recently However, I do have a strong preference for a policy directive that is symmetrical If new developments in the next several weeks suggest greater weakness, I believe there should be a full discussion of the implications of those developments for the outlook 6 to 9 months from now before policy is changed It seems to me that that kind of discussion runs the greatest chance of avoiding the error of going too far in the direction of ease in response to weakness in the statistics that are conveying information about the performance of the economy in the recent past   So, what is your view?   I would agree with Governors Angell and LaWare; in fact, I'm a little concerned that recent trends in economic activity may be a bad basis for current policy   Given the current operating procedures, this recommendation of enhanced consultation makes a lot of sense If we were to do that, I think some of the concerns that several of us felt would be much allayed   Mr Chairman, the Twelfth District economy has shown some signs of strengthening in recent months The California economy, which contracted in terms of employment between July and December, is showing some positive signs Although the California unemployment rate rose markedly in February, that largely reflected a sharp increase in the labor force Payroll employment growth actually was up strongly in January and flat in February Moreover, anecdotal evidence suggests that the residential real estate market is beginning to recover in the coastal California cities And recent rains have raised reservoir levels to a point where some of the more drastic rationing plans are now being softened The rest of the District appears to have avoided any significant downturn All Twelfth District states have higher employment growth rates than the national average and most did not experience much of the slowdown [seen  -26-    3/26/91  elsewhere] following the onset of the Persian Gulf crisis Annualized payroll employment growth rates between July and January outside of California ranged from 2 percent in Arizona to 6-1/2 percent in Nevada Increased real estate activity is also reported in Seattle Other real estate markets, which were not as adversely impacted last fall, remain stable The relative strength in the West is reflected in its commercial bank lending Although loan growth has slowed, loan volumes continue to rise Total loans at the District's largest banks rose 7 percent in February over a year ago compared to only 12 percent for the rest of the nation District bank real estate lending accounted for much of the fast growth, increasing 104 percent over the level a year earlier Admittedly, some of this was a result of changing shares as the commercial banks successfully competed against the savings and loans in the District  Turning to the national outlook, we expect a short recession and moderate recovery especially now that the war in the Gulf is over and oil prices have remained low Specifically, we anticipate an economy much like the Greenbook forecast with output declining at a rate of about 2 to 3 percent in the current quarter and recovery, we would expect, before midyear The sectors that have contributed most to the fall-off in final sales, namely consumer spending and also residential investment, should contribute the most to the recovery in final sales Retail sales and housing starts reports for February and the upsurge in consumer confidence in early March are certainly consistent with this kind of outlook Because the recovery in our view is likely to be moderate by historical standards, we expect the unemployment rate to stay in the 6-1/2 to 7 percent range this year and then to decline gradually in 1992 Temporary slack in the economy should produce a moderate decline in the inflation rate between this year and next, as in the Greenbook forecast But we also expect that an increase in the fed funds rate will be required later this year to keep inflation on a flat to declining path Thank you   Mr Chairman, I could support your recommendation of alternative B, no change in policy, since it certainly appears that the economy will be recovering at a satisfactory pace several months from now, especially in light of our recent policy moves I also have a preference for a policy directive that is symmetrical Before any further policy action is taken, consideration of the inflationary implications of such a policy seems necessary I think the persisting high long-term interest rates are indicative of the market's concerns about inflationary pressures in the future as well as its perceptions of the strength of the economy Given that a near-term turnaround in the economy is being widely forecast, such precaution appears especially warranted at this time Also, forecasts of a turnaround would seem to be more credible now that war-related uncertainties have been substantially reduced So, I would support alternative B and symmetric language   This is Bob Parry in San Francisco I don't think that in the last couple of weeks I've detected much variation from the general pattern that we have had in the West, which would seem to suggest that things are just going along at a fairly modest pace I think it's a bit early to expect much of an effect in the published statistics When we talk to our directors we still get a fairly mixed bag--I'd say somewhat [along the lines] of what Bob said   Anyone else?  SEVERAL Yes, we can hear    4/12/91   We had some indication of a pickup in the retail area but not much pickup in the residential housing area [On balance,] it's hard to say My preference would be to stay where we are, although I really wouldn't raise serious objections to this move   Yes I said that my preference probably would be not to do anything and to wait and see how things develop But I would not raise serious objections to the proposal of the Chairman   Will you send out a press release to the Reserve Banks?   Are you surprised by the narrowing of quality spreads at the long-term end of the market? What do you think explains most of that narrowing, particularly that involving less than investment grade securities?   One of the reasons for weakness in the second quarter is the pickup in nonfarm inventory liquidation If you look at what we know in terms of sales and industrial production, which is admittedly very sketchy, do you think it's possible or would you say more likely now that we could actually see the pattern that seemed to be developing in the first quarter continuing in the second? That is, could actual inventory liquidation turn out to be less in the second quarter than in the first?   But GNP has been strong   Again, is that relative to the GNP decline?   Mr Chairman, the Twelfth District employment statistics have become a bit weaker since our last meeting, although the District as a whole continues to outperform the rest of the nation In March only the state of Arizona reported a month-to-month gain in employment in our District However, the declines in the District's other states follow several months of relatively robust employment growth Employment levels still are between 16 and 48 percent higher than they were a year ago in District states other than California And that would compare, I think, to a fall of about 12 percent in the rest of the nation California's economy has slowed with the nation Since last July employment has fallen nearly every month; in April the state posted its first year-over-year decline in the level of employment which was down 04 of a percent Durable goods employment continues to fall, led by declines in aerospace and electronics I think some of our losses were gains in the Atlanta District Construction employment has fallen to a level about 8 percent less than it was a year ago but, interestingly, real estate sales and prices have picked up As a matter of fact, the median price of residential real estate in California is now above its previous peak  The effects of California's economic slowdown, combined with growing structural problems in the state's budget, have resulted in a projected $126 billion deficit by the end of the next fiscal year Tax receipts have been low for rather obvious reasons weak sales, weak consumer spending, and also unexpectedly low corporate and bank profits At the same time, case loads in the health area, welfare, and especially at prisons have risen sharply, and mandatory cost-of- living adjustments have further increased required expenditures At the same time Governor Wilson has proposed [reducing] the deficit through a 15 cent sales tax increase--the tax right now is 6 percent or higher based upon some local initiatives--elimination of all COLAs on programs, and shifting some state services to the counties, although no one can figure out where the counties are going to get the money to finance this Where this will all end up is difficult to say because the governor is adamant about not changing income taxes  As far as the national outlook is concerned, our view is not very different from that of the Greenbook We have slightly slower economic growth and a bit less inflation We expect the economy to be roughly flat in the current quarter and then we think real growth probably will average somewhere in the 3 to 3-1/2 percent range in the second half, which is a little weaker actually than the Greenbook Next year, we look for growth to slow a bit to 2-1/2 to 3 percent It's clear that the main sources of expansion should be the easing of monetary policy, which President Black referred to, a gradual improvement in consumer and business confidence, and a pickup in inventory investment It also seems quite obvious that the recent rise in the dollar and slower economic growth abroad are going to limit the contribution to growth that will be coming from the foreign sector In view of the slack in the economy and also the lower oil    5/14/91  prices and the higher dollar, we would expect inflation as measured by the CPI to decline next year to about the 3 to 3-1/2 percent range   Sam, has the market become aware of that swap?   And you think an interpretation would be that this is just something routine or--?   Even after taking into account the strength of economic statistics in the month of May, were you surprised by the amount of the increase in bond yields, especially since there were some indications that financial markets were feeling a little better-- or at least it seemed that way--about inflation?   Are they expecting strong real demands for credit?   Mike, the chart that you had on state and local governments was a rather dramatic chart We're beginning to see a lot of efforts on the part of state and local governments to deal with these'problems, and the dollars that we're talking about are not insignificant For example, California very recently passed a series of laws that are going to have an impact of $157 billion; and New York has a sizable one as well Typically, we don't spend much time taking these kinds of influences into account, but are we missing something here--especially when we have new developments like this? Is there something that we should be doing to look a little more deeply as to what the potential micro impacts might be?   There is a tax side as well    7/2-3/91   One of the things that is most troubling about the California situation is that basically it isn't a cyclical problem; it clearly is a problem that is structural in nature And that's why I think the limitations on the growth of spending and to some extent also the taxes are likely to be permanent as opposed to something to deal with the short-run problems   Using the average for the past may be a little bit of a difficulty [unintelligible] There are [recovery periods]--I think after the '80 and '69-'70 recessions--with increases in the first year that were actually smaller than what you're forecasting So, there are some precedents; both [of those recoveries] were moderate   '69-70?   Do you see faster money growth?    7/2-3/91   Right   Right   My recollection of our discussion of the natural rate of unemployment in March was that it was about 5 percent   But then you said you used the MPS model for taking this out And the MPS model has what--62 or 6 percent?   Oh, I see So you made a judgmental assessment Okay   Mr Chairman   After a relatively strong performance during much of the national recession, more recently the Twelfth District's economy has actually weakened Total District employment fell on a month-to-month basis in February, March, April, and May The February and March declines were due to weaknesses only in California; but employment losses elsewhere in the District account for the April and May declines However, I should point out that total District employment still remains 04 of a percent above the May 1990 level, with California the only District state to lose employment over the year District residential property sales picked up this spring; in May, we saw the fourth consecutive month of increased sales activity and increased median home prices in California However, it appears  -13-    7/2-3/91  as though construction activity has not rebounded yet Boeing recently announced a major expansion of its Puget Sound area facilities Facilities will be built or expanded at about 25 sites in the area and the construction cost is estimated at almost $3 billion over the next two years Most of the facilities will support production of Boeing's commercial aircraft, including the 737, the 767, and the new 777  Turning to the national outlook, our view is not really much different from that presented in the Greenbook In the near term, we expect the main sources of recovery to be increases in personal consumption spending and also a short-lived inventory swing Next year consumption will continue to support GNP in our forecast and there should be something of a turnaround in business equipment spending Like the Greenbook, we expect a decline in inflation over the next year and a half Indeed, it seems to us that there is a fair chance that CPI inflation could be brought down in 1992 to as low as the 3 percent that Bob Black mentioned Much of this improvement clearly reflects the existence of considerable slack in the economy However, a good part also stems from the recent appreciation of the dollar and, therefore, may not be of a permanent nature Thank you   Don, a very key assumption in the alternatives is what happens to the shift in the demand for money Clearly, we had a substantial shift in 1990 and we're making some assumptions about further shifts If one were to see a return to more normal relationships, then clearly we'd have a much different outcome with regard to what the target ranges should be Is there some additional information you could give us about the degree of confidence associated with those particular assumptions?   I guess I'd make a comment Those alternative strategies to me seem very useful, but in going to the alternatives that you then show it's useful also to think that one could justify perhaps following one strategy in the next year or so, given the uncertainty associated with that period, and still go to perhaps an even more aggressive strategy in subsequent years to achieve--   Well, one nice thing is that, given the preliminary nature of these deliberations, we will have six months more to observe what is happening to velocity relative to what one would expect before [we set the final ranges in] February   Well, Mr Chairman, according to our projections as well as those in the Bluebook, it is likely that M2 and M3 will end up well within the range this year unless the outcome for economic activity and inflation [differs markedly from our expectations] Thus, maybe we should retain the ranges that we currently have for this year For 1992, I can see compelling reasons in support of either retaining this year's ranges or lowering at least M2's range by 1/2 percentage point In support of lowering the ranges, price stability over time does require further reductions in the range of M2, as you noted Also, a reduction could send a clearer message to financial markets concerning our goal for reducing the ranges and it could have salutary effects on inflation expectations On the other hand, a reasonable outcome for the economy next year, including further progress against inflation, seems to require an M2 growth above the midpoint of this year's range Moreover, there is considerable uncertainty, as we've talked about this morning, about the trend of velocity over the next 18 months It could return to slower growth rates more quickly than is being assumed in our forecast Finally, staying with the same range for M2 for two years was agreed to in 1989 and also in 1990, without I believe sacrificing the pursuit of price [stability] I believe in view of the preliminary nature of our July deliberations for 1992 I would favor alternative II, which basically repeats the same ranges for next year as we have for the current year   Are we talking about the language of the [directive] now?   I was wondering what contribution this phrase "contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions" made That seems to me a bit of fluff maybe I think we took some of that out of the shorter-term language in the operational paragraph It seems to me that we could excise that as well The recommendation that Don made was to take out "a resumption of" and I suggest that we take out what follows--that is, "and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions"--because I don't know what it means It seems to me that it would be better if we said "will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output"   That's even more reason!   Yes "The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output"   Mr Chairman, I would agree with your recommendation of alternative B--that we stay with existing policy However, based on the performance of the economy in the early stages of past recoveries, I really wouldn't be very surprised to see new information coming in that will indicate that perhaps the recovery is a bit more robust than we're currently anticipating If that were the case, then I think promptly reacting to such information probably would have beneficial effects on long-term financial markets and, moreover, probably could avoid the need for a more vigorous policy action in the future Therefore, I would prefer an asymmetrical policy directive to reflect the possible need to tighten over the intermeeting period   This is Bob Parry You talked about bank credit growth Some numbers I've seen with regard to insurance companies suggest that they're providing credit at a weak rate as well Do you have any information on other sectors and what is happening in them?   Thank you  MR ANGELL Mike, do you have a preliminary view on how you see the rate of inflation in the second half of 1991 as compared to before? Does this reassessed picture also give you a view of some improvement?   Thank you   Mr Chairman, this is Bob Parry I'd like to admit that what I've been hearing from business people throughout the Twelfth District has taken on a somewhat more gloomy tone The one thing that I'm not sure I fully understand is whether this is an unusual reaction, if indeed we are at the trough of the cycle I'm not sure that in the past business people really have been very good forecasters of a turnaround The other point I'd make is that as far as the banks in our District are concerned, particularly the large ones, the thing that continually is cited is that, as I'm sure you know, they had some very disappointing results as far as their profits are concerned in the last quarter And many of them are talking about the pressures they've received from the regulatory side; and they appear to be sitting on their hands in terms of what they think is likely to happen with regard to business over the next three to six months I don't know to what extent that translates into their decreased appetite for attracting liabilities I know Don indicated that there's no explanation by region or size of banks, but I've not seen them quite this pessimistic throughout this entire cycle    8/5/91   Peter, has the equality of the discount rate and the federal funds rate presented any special problems or opportunities in terms of the conduct of operations by the Desk?   Would you expect that to be a serious difficulty in terms of complicating operations?   Yes   The suggestion of introducing greater funds rate volatility under existing operating procedures is not something that I find very attractive And re-establishing an inflexible borrowing reserve target I don't find appealing at all But it seems to me a couple of the things in the papers are really quite [helpful] There are some interesting points conveyed in the examples in Dave Lindsey's memo with regard to a greater role for deviations of M2 in affecting our policy in the intermeeting period I also found Al Broaddus's arguments interesting And in the past we've gotten some [worthwhile] suggestions from Tom Melzer We've done some work looking at Bennett McCallum's monetary base procedures, which are linked to nominal income targeting, and they seem to provide some [promising] procedures as well It seems to me that there are enough things of some interest here that maybe we ought to heighten our look at possibilities Perhaps the System Research Advisory Committee could look at some of these possibilities or we could even have some studies done by the FOMC itself There are some things here that could be useful What    8/20/91  we're trying to do is to find an approach that is better than the current procedure, not one that is necessarily perfect in an absolute sense So, I think these papers are very useful   I guess I'm not as enthusiastic about that suggestion It seems to me that an approach that would solve our problems and in addition enable us to highlight things that we think are important when important events occur is what Don indicated in 4b on page 3 and a slight variation of 4c on page 4 That does involve repeating the long-term objectives, but it states them there and then just indicates the kinds of things we want to put in at a meeting that are of particular importance If we don't go through each meeting ordering the four or five elements, this just focuses on things that at that particular meeting were important To me this has the flexibility and also the emphasis on the longer term, and I think it's very constructive and preferable to what we have   The assumption made in the forecast with regard to the dollar is that it remains constant Is that an exogenous determination? And if it is, what, for example, would the MPS model give for the dollar and what would be its implications?   Thank you, Mr Chairman Following weak activity in recent months, the Twelfth District economy shows few signs of recovery at the present time California's economy, which contracted somewhat less than the nation's throughout most of the recession, remains sluggish Payroll employment has been flat since March; manufacturing and construction employment continue to contract and cutbacks planned for state and local government sectors are expected to weaken employment further I might also add that we're likely to see greater weakness in the aerospace industry primarily located in southern California as well If you look outside California, the conditions are really quite mixed States such as Washington, Oregon, and Nevada have experienced employment declines in recent months and that's a bit of a change from what their experience had been a few months ago Also, as in California, the weakness in their employment has been primarily in construction and manufacturing Three states-- Idaho, Utah, and Arizona--remain relatively strong, with rather impressive increases in employment Nonresidential construction is obviously quite weak; residential real estate construction is showing some signs of recovery Sales activity and median prices are above their year-ago levels in California and in the West in general Permits for new construction are up as are housing starts, at least for the month of June This renewed activity, however, has yet to be reflected in increased construction employment, and we do have quite a few builders reporting difficulty in [obtaining] financing I might note that the banks in general seem to be talking much more about difficulties they are having with the examination process and the impact that is likely to have on their lending decisions I might also point out that it seems to me reasonable to assume--and this was alluded to in the Bluebook--that given some of the major mergers    8/20/91  throughout the country and particularly the one in our District, it's likely that the enthusiasm with which these banks approach new and existing business in the six-month period when they're putting together their mergers will be considerably less  If I can turn to the national outlook, our forecast is not greatly different from that in the Greenbook, if one assumes that the value of the dollar remains constant I think that is a critical assumption In the near term I would assume that the main sources of the strength in the economy would be household outlays on such things as durable goods and also housing Next year perhaps we can look forward to something of a turnaround in business spending for equipment Obviously in this forecast, as has been mentioned by many others and certainly by Mike Prell, there are both downside and upside risks Clearly, the recent slowdown in M2 and concerns about financial fragility do raise the prospect and the risk that the recovery could turn out to be less than that in the Greenbook But I also have to take into account the chance of a more typical post- recession pickup in expenditures It wouldn't be the first time that we've been surprised by the strength of the recovery While I'm optimistic about inflation and I think it will decline over the next year and a half, the recent behavior of wage costs is certainly a concern And those concerns were adequately expressed in the Greenbook I might note in closing that we do have a model forecast where the dollar is treated endogenously In light of what has happened in the last 48 hours, the discussion of a lower dollar doesn't seem as relevant But that forecast includes the possibility of the dollar declining between now and the end of next year at a rate of about 15 percent The impact on real growth in 1992 is very substantial; it adds more than a percent to growth and adds about 03 of a percent to inflation I have to admit that I am more comfortable with the assumption of a constant dollar, but most of the models I've looked at have a tendency to cause the dollar to decline somewhat   Mr Chairman, I would agree with your recommendation on alternative B It does seem clear that the economy is likely to undergo a moderate recovery and that--also similar to the Greenbook forecast--we'll see modest gains with regard to inflation However, I do feel that there are risks on both sides of the forecast and I'm not so sure that they're all that unbalanced So, if I had a preference, it would be for symmetric language   II   I have two questions One is on nonresidential construction of structures There has been a very protracted and also sharp fall-off for 13 quarters Is that almost unique in terms of cyclical history?   The duration clearly is; is it the biggest drop?   I would assume that after that process is completed some of the major excesses that occurred prior to that would pretty well be offset Let me ask a question on inventories Clearly, the pattern for the next couple of quarters is going to be dramatically impacted by what happens in that area What you had for the third quarter is the continuation of a very conservative inventory policy We have July numbers; we have production and sales numbers for August Are they basically consistent with a nonfarm inventory liquidation of that magnitude, which is really still very substantial?   We have them They have that in them?   Sure   Thank you   Mr Chairman, the Twelfth Federal Reserve District economy is producing mixed signals at the present time Several sectors are reporting continued declines For example, unlike the recovery occurring elsewhere in the nation, the District's manufacturing sector continues to contract California has been particularly hard hit, having lost 38,000 aerospace jobs since January of last year Banks are reporting loan levels that have fallen faster than in the nation as a whole; total loans are down 36 percent from the level a year ago Retail sales are reported to be sluggish throughout most of the District, although in the states of Arizona and Idaho there is the report of strength Construction and real estate activity are weak, with continued job losses in July reported in the District; and nonresidential construction activity remains weak, particularly in California Residential sales, after rebounding in the spring, have declined for three consecutive months  There are other indicators, however, that are turning positive Total employment in the District rose in July for the first time in six months The July increase occurred in all District states except Alaska, and it left the District's employment approximately 02 percentage points over what it was a year earlier Trade employment rose for the first time in six months while service jobs were added at a solid 47 percent annualized rate between June and July  If I can turn to the national outlook, we expect to see a modest recovery over the next six quarters, and I'd say it's roughly at the same pace as that in the Greenbook, assuming that the value of the dollar is constant In the near term we expect that the main sources of growth will be in household outlays on durables and housing plus a switch from inventory liquidation to inventory accumulation And then next year we would anticipate a turnaround of business equipment spending We are optimistic that a moderate recovery would be consistent with moderate declines in both the inflation rate and the unemployment rate in the period We also believe that there is a chance that the dollar may drop as much as 10 percent over the next year and a half as long-term interest rates fall and also as the US demand for imports grows If that were to happen, that path of the dollar would add approximately 1/2 point to the growth rate of GNP  -11-    10/1/91  next year but also would add 1/2 point to the inflation rate by early 1993 Thank you   That they're weak and probably have come down  -20-    10/1/91   I think the weakness in prices and its continuation are broadly consistent with the forecast If you had these prices bottoming out now and presumably moving up in the next quarter or so, maybe you would have your [projected] decline in nonresidential construction and maybe within that the commercial [sector] coming to an end But to the extent that that forecast is  -21-    10/1/91  correct, I would anticipate considerable weakness in prices in the months and quarters ahead   The forecast of M2 is adjusted; how are the errors treated?   In other words, using the model, we would have gotten numbers significantly higher than in the Bluebook?   Yes   Okay, so in effect you're saying--  MR, KOHN The growth rates we'd be seeing would be more like 6 percent than 3 percent   Do the errors deteriorate or are you basically--?   Okay   Mr Chairman, as you indicated, the economy does appear to be recovering from the recession; at the current level of the funds rate, the forecast for moderate growth along with some gains against inflation certainly seems reasonable I also think that the downside risk in the outlook has been addressed by the recent decline in interest rates Consequently, I would certainly support the idea that we leave policy unchanged at this time, and I must admit a slight preference myself for a symmetric policy here   This is Bob Parry in San Francisco I share Ed Boehne's concerns about the immediate prospects for the economy Clearly, in our District we would have to say that [economic conditions] have deteriorated since the last FOMC meeting We've had recent meetings with our directors and also the Small Business and Agricultural Advisory Committee and they have been as pessimistic in    10/30/91  their reports as I've seen But at this point I'm a little leery about saying how much this is going to cross over into 1992 I think we could really benefit from an in-person discussion of the prospects for the economy as seen by the Board's staff and also the views of each of the presidents in that regard Although there is a strong case for doing something, I hope we will not over-react at the present time I would be almost indifferent between doing two things To wait until Tuesday to have a very complete discussion of the situation and then consider the possibility of perhaps [moving down] 50 basis points on both the funds rate and the discount rate; or even to make a small move of 25 basis points on the funds rate today, which may be constructive as another alternative The bond markets have been acting very strangely for the last week or so, and I think such a move could provide us with some interesting information Another thing we have to keep in mind is the Treasury refunding next week; we have to decide carefully what we're going to do in light of that as well   Looking at the forecast once we get beyond the next two quarters, short rates certainly would be considered acceptable, I think It seems to me that one of the things that has changed rather dramatically is the thinking with regard to inventory investment I wonder if you could comment on how you reached these conclusions because, clearly, if you had some of the previous thoughts about inventories, you probably would have shown a bit more strength   Did you suggest that there would be a possibility of that third-quarter number being revised?   I would assume that they would have incorporated fairly fully what happened in the auto industry in September I think auto inventories were very high in August; I had assumed they'd be down somewhat in September   Yes   But wouldn't they have taken that into [account]?   Thank you   Mr Chairman, economic conditions in the Twelfth District reflect widespread weakness Recent employment data for the western states have been disappointing Total employment fell at an annual rate of 1-1/2 percent in September California continues to show particular weakness Employment in California fell at an annual rate of 4-1/4 percent in September and at a 1-1/2 percent rate in October I might note parenthetically that this issue about the reliability of the payroll series is a very controversial one in California The Department of Finance is estimating that the peak-to- trough decline in employment in California is in excess of 300,000 as opposed to the published data of 100,000 So, it's a very hot issue; and politically it's quite an issue because tax revenues are coming in at a very low level and seem to be more consistent with the more pessimistic outlook that we have for employment Even in states where growth has been robust in the recent past--particularly I'd cite Idaho and Utah--employment has shown lower growth or even declines in recent months Weakness is also widespread across sectors of the western economy as well as in states Manufacturing and construction continue to lose jobs in the District In addition, the growth in the services sector, which has been the region's primary source of strength in recent months, has slowed to a crawl  Anecdotal information also suggests deterioration, as pessimism about poor economic conditions has spread from California to most other parts of the District We conduct a business sentiment survey which, among other things, asks whether or not a recession is anticipated during the next year The last time we conducted it before this most recent period, 7 percent said they thought there would be a recession in the next year; that has risen to 17 percent  If I can turn to the national outlook, the data that we've all seen since the last meeting have certainly led us to revise down significantly our forecast for real GNP for this quarter and the next Our forecast for growth in the fourth quarter is that it will be slower than in the third quarter, although we do not have a double-dip recession and we don't think that is likely Like the Greenbook, we expect growth to rebound to a much more satisfactory rate throughout most of 1992, and the major sources of strength are the interest- sensitive sectors of the economy and inventories as well As far as inflation is concerned, I'd have to say that the news on that front is somewhat encouraging The low fixed-weight GNP price index in the third quarter and the moderation of the employment cost index, especially wages, are encouraging Overall, our expectation is that    11/5/91  there will be some reduction of inflation in 1992 compared to this year, which is a bit of a difference from the Greenbook Thank you, Mr Chairman   In the commercial real estate area there is   And I think if you were to focus on southern California, particularly Los Angeles, there's quite a serious problem Vacancy rates are quite high and they're going to rise over the next year because there is an awful lot of building that will be coming on line in the next 12 months Another area is Orange County, which is suffering as well Those two areas are significant enough to make the general picture of the state with regard to commercial real estate look quite negative When you look at some other areas, such as San Francisco, it's not nearly as bad They put a moratorium on building, which has kept building at very moderate levels for the last several years; so I don't see that [area] as a problem The other point is that the [situation in] residential real estate is quite different from the commercial Residential, at least in terms of prices, has held up quite well, although clearly the sales of new houses are weak It's a problem   Mr Chairman, it's pretty clear that the recent data have intensified doubts about the whole process of the recovery; that's clear to all of us At the same time, we seem to be making some progress with regard to inflation Under these circumstances, I too would favor the middle course, which I would define as a 25 basis point cut in the funds rate I really would not favor the 50 basis point decline It seems to me that gradualism has served us quite well Of course, we reduced the funds rate 1/4 point last week and I think another 25 basis point, presumably on Friday, would be appropriate If we wish to ring the "gong," it's very easy to do that, of course And I guess in some respects I would be in favor of that It seems to me that if the move of 25 basis points that we're talking about were combined with a move on the discount rate, that probably would accomplish a great deal as well Finally, in terms of the language, I would favor asymmetric language on the down side   Yes   Well, maybe Peter ought to address that issue   Yes   Yes   You mean you can't make a recommendation on the discount rate independent of that?   Yes, but you--   Is that a one-day meeting?   Mr Chairman, this is Bob Parry Statistics in the Twelfth District would indicate that things are basically [moving] sideways But in discussions with the Beigebook participants, it is very negative As a matter of fact, the Beigebook for our District is probably as negative as we've ever seen it I don't know if this is [unintelligible] here or what it is, but there's no question that you can't find them And confidence [has deteriorated] in almost any of the states that encompass the Twelfth District   I would support it as well I think it's good to have the distinction between long-run objectives and attention to the shorter-term developments in the economic, financial, and monetary areas in the same basic sentence And I think it's an improvement over what we had   In the key assumptions section, you discussed fiscal policy and indicated that action was likely but that the impact was likely to be quite small in terms of affecting the economy in '92 or '93 I wondered if you could give us some views about what some of the most likely possibilities are This is more a question for Don Winn, I guess   It seems to me that a lot of them, in the effort to try to maintain the integrity of the budget agreement, end up almost with no effect   Thank you   Mr Chairman, business sentiment and confidence and general economic conditions in the Twelfth District have deteriorated since our last meeting Confidence of District business leaders and expectations of retail sales have weakened The comments we receive from our directors and Beigebook contacts are now almost uniformly negative with the only exceptions being those from Utah and Idaho, where conditions are really quite good Department store and auto sales in early December are reported to be extremely weak throughout the District Employment conditions in California and the State of Washington have worsened while remaining the same in other District states--that is, relatively strong with the exception of Arizona After leveling this summer, payroll employment in California has fallen for three consecutive months And employment in the State of Washington has declined in 7 of the past 8 months, with job losses centered in construction and also in trade Manufacturing employment    12/17/91  in the State of Washington remains stable and that's largely a result of the strength of Boeing Conditions in most other District states are relatively stronger In October, employment expanded at annual rates ranging from 16 percent in Hawaii to 13 percent in Alaska, with most states growing in the 7 to 9 percent range Employment in Arizona, however, declined for the second consecutive month  As I'm sure you know, agriculture has become the largest industry in California and it's very important in the District as well We seem to have a series of problems that affect agriculture, such as drought and those kinds of things The new one, of course, is the white fly infestation, which is devastating the Imperial Valley What we now see is of such a magnitude that it actually had a significant impact on the CPI in November So, we're not sure what other natural disasters can befall us, but there probably are one or two more that we could experience  Turning to the national outlook, data since our last meeting have certainly led us to revise down significantly our forecast for real GNP in this quarter and the next Like the Greenbook, we expect the economy to be roughly flat in the current quarter For the first quarter of next year we do have a slight positive; but since the uncertainty is so high I certainly wouldn't argue strongly with the small decline incorporated in the Greenbook In the quarters that follow we have growth rebounding to around 3 percent, with the major source of strength being spending for inventories and also some strength in the interest-sensitive sectors of the economy It seems to us that the outlook for inflation is clearly encouraging It certainly was good to see the lower PPI and CPI figures for November as well as the moderation in unit labor costs Overall, we expect a reduction of inflation in 1992 compared with the average of this year   They really don't have many ways of dealing with it Apparently, the chemicals don't work very effectively, so what they're looking for are some natural predators I think they have found some small [unintelligible] or something like that that is a natural predator But the infestation is spreading; it has already gone into Arizona and is moving a little farther north in California, but it won't get too far north because of the cold But the Imperial Valley, which has mainly truck types of crops--lettuce, tomatoes, strawberries, and things like that--really has been devastated The white flies have wiped out over 70 percent of the honeydew crop, for example   I don't know I'll get the technical description later   Mr Chairman, I could accept "B" asymmetric I would hope that [if and] when the rate is moved that it would be accompanied by a change in the discount rate and that we would find some opportunity to emphasize or highlight our longer-term objective In addition, I'd emphasize the point that we've made around this table that it's important for us to be willing to reverse direction when circumstances dictate And I would like very much to disagree with Tom Melzer, if I am understanding him correctly I don't want to join this dialogue that monetary policy can't do any more I think that's wrong There may be an issue of whether we should do any more, and that's certainly a legitimate question I hope we never join the group that says that we're pushing on a string and can't do any more   I think you said "We can't do any more" Maybe I didn't hear what you said What did you say?   Oh, I thought you said we couldn't   With regard to the increase in long-term rates, all of the factors you cited are domestic in nature Did market participants ever refer to any international considerations that might have been placing some upward pressure on rates?   Okay   One of the characteristics of the forecast is that the interest sensitivity of real spending is different than I think traditional elasticities are Could you indicate how much of a difference there is and whether you assume that the historical difference between those elasticities has disappeared over the period? It seems to be a big factor in the forecast, for example in components such as commercial office space   On the issue of elasticities, my recollection is that the growth of imports is a little slower than one normally would expect, particularly in 1993 Is that correct that the income elasticities have been lower?   That's an interesting development   Thank you   I'd be happy to, Mr Chairman Economic weakness persists in the Twelfth District economy, unfortunately led by a worsening California economy California continues to report declining employment in nearly all sectors Weakness is most pronounced in construction and also in manufacturing In 1991 construction employment fell in excess of 7 percent, and we actually had accelerating declines in the fourth quarter Manufacturing showed a similar pattern, with employment declines of about 44 percent in 1991 I also have to point out that additional defense cuts are expected in 1992 Retail trade activity is also off sharply Searching for a positive sign in the California economy, I was able to come up with one, and that is in real estate activity, at least residential, where median house prices actually have not fallen and resale activity has risen in several major markets Even in Los Angeles, looking at year-over-year comparisons for single-family houses, the prices seem to be very similar to what they were a year ago Throughout the rest of the District conditions are clearly mixed Two of the largest of the remaining states, Arizona and Washington, are showing weakness The state of Washington, which has had quite a few years of uninterrupted prosperity, actually showed a loss of employment in 1991 And Arizona has shown considerable  -10-    2/4-5/92  weakness in the last four months Other states--Alaska, Hawaii, and Oregon--are relatively sluggish The only two states in our District that have shown strong growth are Idaho and Utah; of course, both of them are quite small in terms of the number of residents  Turning to the national outlook, we expect the economy to expand only slightly in the current quarter, which would mean we might see some further declines in the near term In the quarters to follow, growth is expected to rise at around a 3 percent rate Our major sources of strength come from inventories in the interest- sensitive sectors of the economy, although we would certainly subscribe to the Greenbook's expectations with regard to reduced interest sensitivity in most sectors I do feel, however, that there is a rather large band of uncertainty encompassing both sides of this forecast Nevertheless, the outlook for inflation continues to be encouraging And consistent with a downward trend in underlying inflation, we expect to see a reduction in most major inflation measures this year compared to 1991 Thank you   I have a question of clarification It seems to me that the initial starting point is an important issue and that it  -35-    2/4-5/92  ought to be based upon some concept of a steady state velocity Did you choose the fourth quarter of '90 with the thought in mind that we were in effect in a period when we were at a steady state velocity? Is that why you chose it?   I'm not sure how to accomplish this, but it would seem to me that if one does see value in P*, which of course uses steady state velocity as an important component, one would want to figure some way to get a greater symmetry between the two procedures   [What about] questions of Don?   Don, the Bluebook indicates that the growth of M2 would be 3-1/2 percent, assuming that there is a downward shift in the demand for money of similar magnitude to that experienced in 1991 If there were not such a downward shift and we had a continuation of the experience of 1991, what would be the model's forecast of M2 growth?   Now, the tough question At the beginning of 1991 you had some feelings about the probabilities of these forces continuing in 1991 You obviously in this Bluebook have some convictions about that as well How strong are they this time? Governor Mullins indicated he thought that these effects may not be as strong as you think they are   Right   This 3-1/2 percent certainly would be something that one could use to support a recommendation of alternative II, if one had considerable certainty To the extent that one moved more toward the kinds of comments that Governor Mullins made, one would tend to look more favorably on alternative I or even conceivably alternative III   The trouble is that when we're wrong we are sometimes reluctant to make the change in that new year to compensate for that wrong   We came in with less [growth] in nominal terms than was expected We saw real growth that was significantly less than forecast in July, but there's probably not going to be much discussion about that history and its implications for what we might want to do in 1992   No, I'm not--   But again Does it affect how we construct targets for 1992?   In the Bluebook the implications were that we had to reduce interest rates by a fair amount--did you say 3/4 of a percentage point?--to achieve that So, that is the issue [unintelligible] discussion that [unintelligible] relying on what happened last year   That's real substance!   Basically, I agree with what Bob Forrestal said If you just took the staff forecast of M2 and M3, you could make an analytic case for reducing the ranges, particularly for M3 But I don't think that would be a very wise development at this time So, my preference would be to leave the money and debt ranges at the tentative levels that we set in July I must admit that I would be  -43-    2/4-5/92  interested in talking about this subject of the tunnels again in July, particularly after we've had an opportunity to look at some of the more technical issues like the base, etc But at present I prefer to stick with the cone   In your statement about the ultimate objective of price stability or something close to it, would it be well to underline the fact that in subsequent years this would most likely require further declines in our targets?   I'm thinking of a conditioning for what might become--   Mr Chairman, I wanted to ask you a question Do you think that there is in the market and the Congress a tradeoff between what we do and their enthusiasm for fiscal policy?   If rates were cut 50 basis points, would it alter the dialogue, the momentum, etc?   Mr Chairman, given the prospect of a moderate upturn at least incorporated in most of our expectations, I would prefer alternative B I do think, though, that the uncertainties are as you indicated, and that would lead me to be very supportive of asymmetry to provide for significant further ease Two points with regard to that It would be my view that if we were to ease, it probably should be of some significance because public visibility for the event would probably be desirable; secondly, my own feeling is that it probably would be desirable for that ease to come sooner rather than later   Mike, this is Bob Parry It appears as though the economic [progress] among major industrial nations has deteriorated a little Have you changed the assumptions you have made about economic growth in the industrialized nations?   Mr Chairman, this is Bob Parry in San Francisco It appears as though there really hasn't been any significant change in the economic situation in the Twelfth District California remains as weak as I indicated at our last FOMC meeting and some of the other states such as Idaho and Utah continue to do very well The only thing I would note as a change is that there are some differences in tone; the tone is somewhat more optimistic We clearly have a much better housing situation, and it appears as though sentiment has improved somewhat But I would characterize the changes at this point as being quite minor   Peter, you made reference to the strong demands for credit as playing a role in terms of what has happened to interest rates But the debt aggregates seem to suggest, when you look at what actually has been new debt, that there really hasn't [been much]; it has been quite weak I guess most of it is mainly [unintelligible] Is that really much of a factor?   But when it comes to the debt aggregate it just doesn't show up as being very strong; it's very weak   Ted, two characteristics of the usual forecast are what was mentioned the downward trajectory for long-term rates and also a flat dollar What are the interest rate developments internationally that are assisting in bringing this about? For example, in our model we almost have to constrain it from pushing the value of the dollar down in that kind of environment   Japan?   Would more conventional linkages among rates produce a decline in the value of the dollar when one uses the model?   They produce an unchanged dollar?   The Prell factor! Thank you   Thank you Mr Chairman, the Western economy appears to us to be moving sideways, although I must admit there are a few encouraging signs that have emerged since the last meeting We do a survey of business leaders and ask them their views about future developments One of the questions that we ask them is whether they expect any declines in output in the next two to four quarters In January, more than 30 percent indicated that they did In the most recent survey, that number was a little over 10 percent We also have seen a bit of a change in the residential real estate market In California, for example, the number of existing homes sold has risen in each of the last four months, and the gain that we saw in February was the sharpest month-to-month gain in five years Moreover, retail sales don't seem to be deteriorating the way they were One major retailer on the West Coast indicated that in the month of February his sales were up 8 percent from the year-ago period and another major California retailer indicated that sales were about 10 percent above year-earlier levels One recognizes that there were some special factors, including the extra day in February and also the war-related weakness that occurred the year before  I'm sure you've heard about or are familiar with the benchmark revisions going on with regard to employment data On a negative note, the California benchmark revisions for employment are expected to show a falloff of 4 percent since July of 1990, which is more than double the decline that we've been working with in the preliminary data  If I can turn briefly to the national outlook, it certainly seems clear to everyone that final sales have picked up rather significantly in the first quarter As a result of these developments, it would seem to me that the risks to the outlook are more symmetrical than they were at the time of our last meeting when the downside risks seemed to dominate Our forecast is very similar to that of the Greenbook Both forecasts include a downward path for long-term interest rates, which to me seems consistent with the fundamentals of a moderate expansion Such an outcome for rates, however, as we've mentioned a couple of times, does not accord with market expectations My own view is that if we do get those kinds of rates, it's conceivable at least that we'll see the dollar decline rather than remain flat Finally, it would seem to me, given the current low level of economic activity and also the prospect of a modest expansion, that the Greenbook's basic outlook for a gradual downward trend in underlying inflation certainly makes a lot of sense Thank you  -12-    3/31/92   Mr Chairman, the Greenbook forecast certainly is more optimistic now than it was at the time of our meeting in February In addition, it seems to me that the recent data suggest that the risks are more evenly balanced than they were, far more than appeared in February That leads me to have a preference for alternative B and a slight preference for a symmetric directive I must admit, though, that I do fear the possibility that we'll see a situation similar to what we had last year And I certainly don't take much comfort from what we just heard about the aggregates So, I would not object to asymmetry   Mike, you went through some of the risks to the forecast It seems to me that there are some areas where the economy could turn out somewhat better Some of the work we've done suggests that perhaps we could get greater strength in the residential sector It's conceivable that the dollar may end up being somewhat weaker than was estimated in the forecast and then net exports would continue to be somewhat better as well And the equipment area could be stronger And finally, inventories--though they are not likely to get back to a traditional relationship--could perhaps not change as much as seems to be implied in the forecast When you look at the risks, do you see a real symmetry of risks in this forecast or do you think there might be a predominance of risks on one side or the other? What strikes me now as opposed to the [forecast at the time of the] prior FOMC meeting is that, at least in terms of visibility, there seem to be some upside risks that weren't there before   Although rates have come down   So, you would say the risks still are relatively balanced?   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Twelfth District economy is experiencing varied signals, with weakness in California offset by modest growth in other District states In California, there is some improvement in the north, with continued problems in the southern part of the state I guess that latter comment is something of an understatement The five-county Los Angeles area accounts for 50 percent of state employment and it also accounts for 80 percent of the 550,000 jobs in the state that were lost between May 1990 and March 1992 So, it's clear that not only is there weakness in the state but it is highly concentrated in the southern part of the state The riots in Los Angeles are estimated to have cost $1 billion in total property damage and to have resulted in additional job losses of around 25,000 Now, I have seen estimates as high as 40,000, and that may be referring to a peak that endured for just the number of days immediately following the riots But the number that we're going with is 25,000; and expectations are that in a number of weeks that could fall below 10,000 as some buildings are repaired and some stores are restocked, because some stores were just looted and not seriously damaged There is also obviously further concern about the effects of the riots on tourism and firm location decisions And while I'm still talking about Los Angeles, I don't think I can give you any of those glimmers of hope with regard to commercial real estate Last year 9 million square feet of office space was added in the Los Angeles area It caused vacancy rates to shoot up quite a bit; it depressed lease rates and property values; and projects under way indicate that the problem is going to get somewhat worse before it gets better So, I have not been able to pick up any improvements, at least in the Los Angeles area I would agree with what Jerry Jordan says in terms of some other areas in the District We even picked up a few optimistic comments coming from some people in the state of Washington where there also was a fairly serious condition of over-building as well  For the state [of California] as a whole, indicators of economic activity are mixed Existing home sales reports indicate a modest rebound; payroll employment rose in April; and it appears as though agricultural conditions are improving However, manufacturing employment continues to contract And while construction employment has risen for two consecutive months, nonresidential construction awards and residential permits are below their year-earlier levels  There is a very big issue that you may begin to read a bit more about in the month ahead Reflecting recent economic weakness, the state faces a severe shortfall of $10 to $12 billion through the end of the next fiscal year Not surprisingly, revenues have fallen substantially below projections The law in California requires that they enter the new fiscal year with tax and spending plans to produce a balanced budget And this is before July 1st There obviously are some things that they can do that are of a rather tricky nature, but in large part they have to find $10 to $12 billion of reduced spending or higher taxes And that's not exactly the Keynesian approach to dealing with California's problems  -14-    5/19/92  Outside of California, District states have performed relatively well over the recession, and they continue to show modest growth Construction activity is rising in several District states as are home sales Cutbacks continue to be reported, unfortunately, in aerospace, with job losses of 6,500 projected for Boeing this year I should point out that Boeing employs over 100,000 in the Seattle area In addition, Boeing continues to have a large backlog of orders and actually has a very strong long-run forecast with growing demand from the Pacific and Asian region Contacts that we have in nondefense manufacturing report a modest rebound, with lumber and wood products manufacturing currently bottoming out, and that was a considerable source of weakness in the past year  If I may turn briefly to the national scene, incoming data since our last meeting seem to add to confidence that a moderate recovery is under way Indeed, as I [noted] in my discussion with Mike, it's not difficult to come up with an outlook that is a bit stronger than is indicated in the Greenbook For example, our analysis points to somewhat greater strength in inventory investment, residential construction, and net exports And we end up with a growth rate over the next year and a half of a little over 3 percent compared to the Greenbook expectation of 2-3/4 percent I agree with the Greenbook that inflation is on a very slow downward trend, but I fear that such slow progress will make others question the resolve of the Fed to deal with inflation longer term It seems to me that we might be at a point soon where we'll have to be more forthcoming about our inflation objectives And probably we can't do that until 1993 Thank you, Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman, I would strongly support your recommendation It seems to me quite likely that the economy could be growing at a rate of 3 percent over the next six quarters At the same time, all of our forecasts are showing that inflation is not going to show significant improvement In that kind of environment and with those kinds of prospects, I think it would be very desirable not to change policy and also to have a symmetrical directive I might also point out that if we get a very significant upward revision of those first-quarter data and the next thing that hits the financial market is the fact that we had an asymmetric toward ease directive, I don't think that would be received very favorably in the financial markets at all So, I believe the case for a symmetric directive is quite strong Thank you   Related to that, do you have more conventional assumptions about income elasticities of demand for imports?   Mr Chairman, uncertainty about the direction of the Twelfth District economy has increased since the last meeting It  -11-    6/30-7/1/92  has become clear that many of the District's states that previously had posted solid employment gains have weakened in 1992 The District as a whole has posted employment gains of only 01 percent between December 1991 and May of this year All states except Oregon and Utah have registered either little increase or actual declines in employment since December Since the beginning of the year California's employment has stopped declining However, employment is 15 percent below the level of a year ago and downside risks clearly remain Northern California is following the national pattern, but southern California is exhibiting further weakness Manufacturing continues to report job losses, and more declines in aerospace are expected in the Los Angeles area Moreover, addressing the state budget deficit is likely to weaken the state's economy further Current estimates suggest that the state has close to an $81 billion deficit Cuts of that magnitude would reduce next year's nominal state and local spending below that of the fiscal year just ending Failure to accomplish cuts by tomorrow will force the state to issue scrip Negotiations have been deadlocked, particularly on cuts in education spending, which also is likely to see nominal spending below the current level  Finally, the agricultural sector is facing hard times Drought conditions prevail in Idaho, Utah, and eastern Oregon, leading to low yields and some acreage reductions as well as herd reductions in the cattle industry While drought conditions are not as severe this year in California, prices for many commodities, including vegetables, cotton, and citrus, are down sharply from a year ago, leading to low profitably and some losses  Turning to the national economy, I believe that a moderate expansion will continue throughout the remainder of this year and in 1993 Although consumption data for May were disappointing and I'd say somewhat worrisome, they were not too surprising in view of the very rapid growth in consumer spending that we saw in the first quarter Overall, I wouldn't be surprised to see somewhat faster growth this year than is projected in the Greenbook, but the difference certainly is well within the normal range of error I also would agree with the Greenbook that underlying inflation is on a very gradual downward trend However, it is surprising that we have not seen a more rapid decline in inflation, given the slow growth over the past three years And I believe it is possible that the Greenbook may be a little on the pessimistic side Perhaps a more explicit statement of our inflation goal and our plans to achieve it might dispel questions about our resolve and lead to improvement in inflation expectations Thank you   The staff projections are certainly very important in terms of which of these alternatives should be selected Typically in the past I think the way you have handled projections was that you took the difference between the actual and the forecast and had that difference decay over the forecast period as an error Judging from the discussion, I take it you're assuming that the error persists at the same level Or do you have a different rate of decay? How did you get such a low number?   So there's a different structure?   He's 1000 percent behind you!   Mr Chairman, I certainly would support your recommendation for 1992, particularly with the explanation of the uncertainties I really do think there is a far better alternative for 1993 It seems to me that if we were to reduce the range by 1/2 percentage point, there are some things we could say that would make a great deal of sense First of all, we could indicate that the uncertainties are likely to persist, and I'm sure we feel that way The staff projections would be more consistent with that range than the current range And most importantly, it would be consistent with our view that over the long term we have this objective of price stability I don't see anything to lose That doesn't mean that we're changing it and the uncertainties have disappeared What it means is that we believe that at some point in the reasonable future those uncertainties are likely to disappear But there is no reason [not] to take small steps in that direction As a matter of fact, I think there will be a large group in financial markets and other places who would misinterpret the meaning of our staying with the existing targets for two years And I don't see what we give up at all by just reducing the range 1/2 percentage point It's consistent with the long term; it's consistent with the projections; and it's  -48-    6/30-7/1/92  consistent with the idea that the uncertainties are temporary I see no problem   Implicit in your statement is that you would expect that uncertainty to continue through 1993?  -53-    6/30-7/1/92   Do you have a guess?   Mr Chairman, I originally came with an expectation of recommending no change and a symmetric directive, but it became clear to me in the discussion yesterday that the weakness was not in the Twelfth District, so I certainly could accept your recommendation   President Forrestal covered it   Mr Chairman, economic conditions in the West appear to have deteriorated further since our last meeting Employment fell in June in all Twelfth District states except Utah The number of jobs fell especially sharply in the state of California, at an annualized rate of 54 percent And California employment remained weak in July, rising only slightly California's budget problems are going to be yet another source of weakness in this troubled area The implementation of the new budget--whenever it comes--will have a much greater negative impact than the stalemate itself Most of the $8 billion plus budget shortfall will be resolved through cuts in spending by state and local governments and schools, which will further weaken the state economy Now, in addition to the $8 billion plus [shortfall], we have a $2 billion carryover from the prior year which is why in Part II of the Greenbook there is a reference to about $11 billion But there's another interesting point to be made, and that is that the estimate of the deficit for the current fiscal year is based upon a forecast that is old They are going to be making a new forecast in a week or so and that's likely to show an even larger budget problem--probably $2 billion above the current estimate of the problem for this fiscal year There is a tremendous incentive for agreement in the next week so they don't have to deal with the $2 billion problem that at this point is unofficial Lawmakers from both parties are strenuously opposed to increasing state taxes, although fees at the state's universities have been raised substantially and some tax increases by local governments are possible as well  Turning to the national economy, we continue to forecast a moderate expansion with most of the strength coming from sectors that are sensitive to interest rates and also to exchange rates Our projection is somewhat stronger than that in the Greenbook, largely as a result of more inventory investment and also somewhat slower growth in imports With activity continuing to fall below the economy's capacity, we expect further downward pressure on the inflation rate In our opinion consumer price inflation is likely to fall from 3 percent this year to around 2-1/2 percent next year While this scenario seems like a reasonable one, there clearly are downside risks to the real economy As has been noted, the expected moderate expansion has seemed likely for a year now and has so far failed to materialize Thank you   Well, the problem now is that quite a few of the large financial institutions are unwilling to accept them Consequently that means that some people who are receiving vouchers in effect have to stick them in the top drawer until they can be cashed in after a budget agreement or they can be given to an institution that will accept them or be returned to the state For example, some businesses--I don't think this is very widespread--that receive money from the state because they sell things to the state are making their sales tax payments with these vouchers   Well, it depends on what the market is at that point If they are just giving them the face value, then the state would in effect be picking up the 5 percent return   I'm not sure where exactly they are!   Oh, they would And the market, if you were to buy them, would reflect that   Well, the budget agreement presumably raises funds to meet all expenditures, including expenditures now being made   The only thing that's not in the budget as a revenue source I assume--and maybe it's being built in--is the accrued interest as these are held over a period of time So, I think the money is there; there may be some timing differences I don't see a problem unless I'm missing something   "B" asymmetric   How effective have the Germans been in sterilizing? I think short-term rates have come down a fair amount, which would suggest that they have [not completed the sterilization]   Thank you   Wells Fargo had a problem too   Mike, relative to previous forecasts, this forecast seems to get started a bit later and when we get to the faster growth it's not quite as strong, at least in 1993, as it was before Would you characterize this as an indication of greater uncertainty on your part as to the strength of the economy, both short and long term?   I would ask Ted a question as well The import numbers are really quite strong; I guess that's attributed to computers If one looks at the normal relationship between an economy exhibiting the characteristics that we currently see, isn't this really an extraordinary increase in imports given what we see for [unintelligible]?   Doing too well?   Do people in the industry feel as though this is going to continue for some period?   They're not making the distinction of whether it's a US purchase or a German purchase   Mr Chairman, economic weakness persists in most of the Twelfth District and it may have intensified since our last meeting District-wide employment fell in August at a 46 percent annual rate, led by weakness in construction and manufacturing Job losses have been most severe in California, where employment fell at a  -19-    10/6/92  62 percent annual rate in August and at a 21 percent rate in September, bringing employment in the state of California to a new cyclical low Other District states also are beginning to show some signs of weakness Previously robust growth in Idaho and Utah has [waned], with employment declining on balance since February Cutbacks in aerospace production are affecting Washington, and the lumber and wood products business is contracting in Oregon in large part due to environmental restrictions Both business contacts and statistical indicators of District activity give little evidence of renewed economic growth The outlook for California is of particular concern Already announced cutbacks in aerospace, defense, and state and local government, together with an overhang in commercial real estate, suggest weakness could persist well into 1993  Turning to the national economy, our forecast is quite similar to that of the Greenbook I would characterize our forecast as one in which the pickup in the economy, instead of being just around the corner, appears to be just around the corner and well down the block In addition, once economic activity gets to that point it doesn't seem to be quite as robust as we had it before That development produces greater uncertainty at least on my part That combined with what appear to be better inflation rates in the offing suggests that a policy move at this time would be appropriate   Mr Chairman, I'd like to set aside for the moment the issues of financial instability and what could happen in foreign exchange markets and the issues associated with being close to the election But it seems to me that in many ways this has been a very different meeting from those we've had in the past In the past, we've seen a forecast where the economy looked as though it was going to pick up almost imminently and that the rate of growth would be something on the order of acceptable There were certainly concerns about whether or not that would be realized That generally would result in our having asymmetric language and then when we saw some statistics come out that confirmed or heightened those uncertainties, we would ease I think this is a unique meeting This is a meeting where the Greenbook has come up with a forecast that is much more negative; it shows that the pickup is coming considerably later and that when the economy does expand it's going to be less strong Based on the discussion, I counted approximately 11 who seemed to be in substantial agreement with that and who voiced concern about the direction of the economy That is far more powerful to me as [an indication of] what we should do on policy--the work has been done collectively by all of us and our staffs and in the Greenbook--than what developments might occur in the next two to three weeks Consequently, I would recommend that we reduce rates--my proposal would be 25 basis points in terms of the funds rate--and that we have asymmetric language   Mr Chairman, conditions in the Twelfth District are little changed from our last meeting, with continued weakness in California offsetting modest growth in the other District states District-wide employment in September fell at a 11 percent annual rate, led by weakness in California California employment by itself fell at a 38 percent annual rate in September and 21 percent in October; that brings the state's employment to a new cyclical low I might also point out that there's a consensus among forecasters that the actual level of employment is 100,000 less than is being reported in the survey Last year there was a similar view that employment was being exaggerated, and revised figures certainly confirmed that  Outside of California, District employment expanded at a 33 percent annual rate in September The contacts we have in Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon and Utah report fairly favorable conditions But California is weak; in Washington conditions are flat due to production cutbacks in aerospace; and Hawaii is affected by slumping tourism The weakness that we're seeing in California certainly is a concern Already announced cutbacks in aerospace, defense, and state and local governments, together with an overhang in commercial real estate, have led forecasters to project that we're going to see continued job losses in the state of California through the end of 1993 This weak projected economic performance threatens California with yet another state budget shortfall of at least $4 billion through the end of the next fiscal year, which is 1993-94 Reflecting this ongoing weakness, lending continued to decline in October at large District banks Commercial, consumer, and real estate loan volumes are down from their year-earlier levels  Turning to the national economy, our outlook is similar to that of the Greenbook if we assume no change in monetary policy through the end of that period The modest 2-1/4 percent growth that we anticipate, again assuming no further easing, is down 1/2 percent from what we expected at the time of the October meeting That's mainly a result of the higher value of the dollar and prospects for slower economic growth abroad Consistent with sluggish growth in output, we expect to see only small declines in the unemployment rate over the next year or so and thus continued downward pressure on underlying inflation Our view is that the CPI will come in at around 2-3/4 percent in '93 and a bit lower than that in '94 Thank you   What precisely do we owe the Banking Committee?   But didn't you tell them that?   Okay   With regard to the long-run target ranges, I thought in July that it would be best to lower the [M2] range and I feel that way this time as well It seems to me that the additional information we got from the study suggests that a cut in the range would be appropriate And the staff projection of 2 percent certainly would support that as well So, to me it would make some sense to cut it, and I don't see any harm in doing it now I disagree with something a few people have said, particularly what Governor Angell said if I interpreted him correctly, that we could get some additional benefit as far as inflationary expectations are concerned by taking action now I would say that would only happen if we didn't explain that it was based on technical adjustments If we did say it was based on technical adjustments and people believed that, then we would not get any impact on inflationary expectations So, my counsel would be to change it and not say a heck of a lot about it if we really want to get some effect as far as inflationary expectations are concerned   On the short-term policy, this has been another very interesting meeting We've seen a dramatic change; there are many more people who now see a pickup or at least somewhat improved prospects in their Districts Another thing I find very interesting is that very few people said they have changed their nationwide forecast In fact, many went on to say that things have picked up but that their forecast is very similar to that in the Greenbook, with the notable exception, I think, of the Chairman who seemed to imply that he was a little more optimistic based upon his fiscal assumptions If the forecast that most people agree upon is that of the Greenbook or close to it, which is not very much different in terms of real growth from what it was the last time and has been characterized in the past as being sluggish, perhaps too sluggish, what has changed? Unless we're going to make policy decisions on the basis of what happened to the economy in the last three or four weeks--if we're going to look instead at the longer term--what has changed? If nothing has changed, it seems to me that the case some of us made for a slight easing at the previous meeting is just as strong today as it was before   We really have two requests from Mr Gonzalez, isn't that correct? The one that came to you mentioned the memoranda of discussion and videotaping The one that came to the presidents was a bit different I interpreted the question that came to the presidents, although Mr Gonzalez used the word "minutes," as referring to the record of policy actions Is it possible that we presidents could answer that question--and maybe we should even have the presidents provide a group answer--and not even refer to memoranda of discussion or videotaping? What could be given up in terms of the record of policy actions is that conceivably it could be provided sooner than 6 to 8 weeks--maybe a month or whatever time it takes for drafting and reviewing and revising those minutes Would that buy us anything? Would he find that acceptable?   And there have been periods when it has been misinterpreted   That's what they would try   The presidents are coming in for dinner Sunday night   Yes, we are   Mr Chairman, economic conditions in most states of the Twelfth District are improving, but deterioration continues in California In District states outside of California, employment grew at an annual rate of 3-1/2 percent in October, and employment in these states is now roughly 09 of a percent higher than it was a year ago Employment growth is consistent with anecdotal reports of strong retail sales and renewed consumer confidence in much of the West However, contacts in the state of Washington report widespread concern about the area's future due largely to Boeing's announcements of cancellations and delays of aircraft orders and resulting layoffs Despite these concerns, many contacts report that current business conditions in the state of Washington are actually quite good, and employment in Washington actually picked up smartly in both September and October In contrast, there is no sign of improvement in California, a point that I'm sure you've read about in several articles so far this week Employment continued to decline in November, bringing the decline to 155,000 jobs or 1-1/4 percent, compared with a small rise in the national economy Defense cutbacks and commercial real estate problems will continue to be a drag on southern California's economy for some time, and budget problems will  -11-    12/22/92  lead to cutbacks in levels of state and local government spending throughout the state  Turning to the national economy, recent economic data actually have been encouraging It's possible that a moderate expansion may finally have taken hold Although we are not quite as optimistic as the Greenbook concerning economic growth next year, we have raised our forecast moderately to about 2-1/2 percent in 1993, assuming no change in policy Most of the pickup is likely to come from interest-sensitive sectors consumer durables, housing, and business equipment Consistent with this moderate growth, the unemployment rate is likely to decline only moderately over the next couple of years and we would expect the CPI inflation to come in somewhat lower than that forecast by the Greenbook Thank you   Yes, I just want to comment on something Tom Melzer mentioned about regional disparities I mentioned in my report on California the decline of about 155,000 [jobs] in the last six months If we back out California from the statistics, we get almost a completely different picture of what is happening We see an employment picture in terms of nonfarm employment where the rest of the country is up 300,000 in the last six months That's not robust but it is increasing If we back out California from the civilian employment numbers, we get an unemployment rate of 68 percent, and we would have started from the same point   We are not secedingyet! What I'm suggesting is that a majority of people in the country are experiencing something very significantly different from what a group of people in one state, or maybe even half a state, are   There's a significant difference 80 percent of the loss of employment is in southern California They have about 60 percent of the jobs Parts of northern California--for example, the Silicon Valley--show some strength Intel has added 1600 jobs in the last year We now talk about the United States as being the leader in    12/22/92  d-ram chips at this point Biotech is doing quite well So, there are signs of relatively robust activity in the north, although I don't think they approach what we are seeing in the Dallas District or the Atlanta District It's very concentrated Although it's dangerous to take an area out and set it aside, as I said, the national figures in some respects don't give a good indication of what is happening to the overwhelming majority of people   Jerry, in the discussion about nominal income targeting it's clear to me that there are some problems associated with it But what is perhaps more relevant is whether the problems associated with nominal income targeting are greater or lesser than those associated with interest rate targeting I'm afraid a lot of the academic literature would suggest that we probably would reduce the chance of making the kinds of mistakes that we make with interest rate targeting if we followed a nominal income target   It depends on how flexible our policy rule is, I suspect It doesn't have to be [inflexible] We can take into account special effects There are supply-side shocks that we may want to accommodate and some that we don't   Mr Chairman, recent developments suggest that a moderate expansion is underway, and we are seeing numbers in the inflation area that certainly are encouraging That would lead me to recommend alternative B Also, since the economy is picking up, I believe we probably should give somewhat less weight to the risk of stagnant real economic activity and more weight to the possibility that it may accelerate more sharply, and that would lead me to a symmetric directive at this point So, I would favor "B" symmetric   Not to beat a dead horse, Mr Chairman, but if we send those in and different views come forward, even if they are modestly different, will we not also be adding fuel to the fire in the sense of generating letters that say So-and-so thinks that's a good idea and so-and-so thinks this is a good idea Now explain to me why you have these differences among you given these other views?   Okay, thank you   I agree Okay   Mike, you indicated that the difference between the Blue Chip forecast and the staff forecast of real growth and what has happened to the unemployment rate probably is not a sufficient explanation of the difference in the forecasts with regard to prices That difference is rather large Is there any way to know, for example, if they are making different assumptions about food and energy prices that would explain the difference or if they have a different Phillips curve?   Did you say that their forecasts involve a fairly significant increase in nominal interest rates at the short end, in which case they're probably assuming the same real short-term interest rates as in your forecast?   [They are] much more pessimistic   Mr Chairman, the Twelfth District economy remains mixed, but unfortunately there are new signs of weakness in several states California's employment fell about 18 percent in 1992 and the pace of decline has not slackened in recent months Moreover, the California recession is no longer just a southern California phenomenon Early last year we saw about 80 percent of the job losses coming from southern California, which is far in excess of that area's relative contribution to employment More recently, about 60 percent of the job losses are coming from southern California Other areas such as the Bay Area, the Central Valley, and other parts of California are also reporting losses that are not all that different from that of southern California in percentage terms  Concern also is rising in Washington state where Boeing cutbacks are threatening to choke off that state's recovery I would point out that actual employment has been rising rather robustly in recent months in the state of Washington, but Boeing as I'm sure you've all seen--it was actually commented on in the Greenbook--has announced significant cutbacks in planned production beginning in the second half of this year The specific layoff figures are not yet available but analysts in the region clearly are concerned and are talking about the multiplier effects of any further job cuts Hawaii's economy may be facing a recession this year Weak tourism from the mainland, particularly California, is a concern and has been a problem But a new and larger concern is that rising job insecurity in Japan, which is a very big source of money for Hawaii, could eventually cut into the Japanese visitor count Lending activity remains very weak in the District, with loans outstanding at large banks in December falling 81 percent below the year-ago level  There are some bright spots in the region, however; we've found one or two! The drought conditions eased dramatically in California and the Pacific northwest At the present time, water officials are reluctant to declare an end to the drought, but estimates of available supplies have increased sharply Christmas sales were not too bad As a matter of fact, even in southern  -13-    2/2-3/93  California Christmas sales were stronger than had been anticipated A very large retailer in our District indicated that sales continued to be good in January and that January may turn out to be the best month they've had for the past year Utah and Idaho continue to report strong economic conditions, while Alaska, Arizona, and Oregon are reporting moderate growth  Turning to the national economy, the data released since the last meeting have been encouraging; they certainly suggest that the economy is in a sustained moderate expansion Our forecasts, if you assume no change in monetary or fiscal policy, are very similar to those in the Greenbook We project somewhat stronger growth in investment and less consumption than the Greenbook With real GDP growing below potential we expect the downward trend in inflation to continue; our forecast for the CPI, for example, is that it will average around 2-1/2 percent this year Thank you   Five minutes, okay   Don, I know that table on page 8 is based upon the new Feinman/Porter model, but there's one thing I would just ask your opinion about Do you find it rather hard to believe that 1/4 or 1/8 point variations in the funds rate are likely to produce such differences in the levels of real output and prices?  -32-    2/2-3/93 -33-   Okay   Mr Chairman, I would support the recommendation as you have made it It seems to me it would be desirable to make 3 points in the testimony The first is the one you emphasized, that this is a technical adjustment designed to accommodate a decline in money demand and, therefore, it wouldn't be expected to produce lower growth in 1993 The other thing that might be worth noting is that the adjustment is really consistent with our prior inflation goals and doesn't represent any attempt on our part to increase the pace of disinflation And, finally, we all have been talking about the uncertainties associated with this whole exercise, and I think it may be well just to confront very directly the possibility that M2 and M3 could undershoot even this adjusted target; I'd make that point clear   I would agree with "B" symmetric   I thought of the same thing   I think this is a good effort and certainly covers some of the drawbacks of these different alternatives I came pretty much to the same conclusion That "E" seems to be the one with the fewest downside risks One thing I was thinking about, though, is  -62-    2/2-3/93  that it would to me be [ideal] if our actions could be expressed in terms of the effects on reserve pressures first If we then wanted to be specific about the funds rate, that's fine But there may be some time in the future when we'll be focusing on something other than the funds rate and that will then enable us to move quickly into substituting any discussion about the funds rate with maybe an aggregate or something like that We do, of course, in the directive now start out by talking about reserve pressures and I think that communicates something standing by itself and obviously can be supplemented by [comments on the] funds rate or whatever   I think the change is a good one I wonder about the executive summary The draft that I read seemed good to me I have no problems with it But I can envision times when there would be an awful lot of disagreement about what should have priority, etc Did you discuss whether or not this would be a very difficult process?   I have a question about some of the reasons why long-term rates in particular responded so strongly in this period There are a number of candidates for why that might have occurred The one that you referred to was that it appears as though the markets buy the idea that there will be future deficit reduction, and I think studies of forward rates would suggest that There are other possibilities as well Most of the people who have looked at the Clinton program contend that it's going to produce weakness over the next several years, and that could be a factor Thirdly, the interest rate developments--maybe not the declines that have occurred already in foreign markets but expectations of further declines there--could be a factor as well Is there any discussion in the markets on the importance of these or is it just focusing on the one you mentioned, which is the increased chance of future reductions in the deficit?   Or short-term weakness in the economy   If the prospect of short-term weakness were a substantial explanation?   I think 1-year forward rates are a quirk because if you looked at 1-year forward rates 3 years out last year, they were coming down At the same time the [1-year forward] rates at 10- and 30-year [horizons] were basically flat So that would be in accord with the idea that it is reflecting more short-term weakness What has happened in the last several months is that we've seen a reduction in those 1-year forward rates at all the maturities, which would be more consistent with a change in views about inflation   I assume that the forecast of the rate of inflation is basically from a Phillips curve framework One question I have is this To the extent that there's a real output surprise-- that is, a growth in real output that exceeds expectations--is there any attempt to incorporate the possibility that this could change expectations about inflation independently of traditional [unintelligible]?   As they did in the last six months   Mr Chairman, widely varied economic conditions continue in the Twelfth District Job growth in the District states over the year ending in January ranged from among the strongest in the nation--about 3-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent in states such as Idaho, Utah, and Nevada--to among the weakest, which was a negative 14 percent in California, second only to Connecticut The recent benchmarking of employment data increased our measure of 1992 job growth in Arizona, Idaho, and Washington However, California data were revised only for 1992, with revisions for prior years expected in June This creates considerable uncertainty about California economic statistics in recent years We understand that the data for prior years are likely to be revised down significantly to correct for an overcount that occurred prior to January 1991 The revision likely will reduce our estimate of job losses in California during the recent business cycle The official figure now, with this break in the series, is about an 800,000 loss since the peak of employment That will probably be cut to somewhere closer to 500,000  The cutbacks in defense spending and aerospace continue to receive an awful lot of attention in the District In California proposed military base closings threaten a net loss of 32,000 military jobs Civilian job losses on those bases probably will be greater than 32,000; in addition there is some multiplier associated with it Most of these losses as it turns out will be in the San Francisco Bay area and not in southern California I also heard that the morning papers suggest that [McClellan] Air Force Base, which is a big one, and the Monterey Presidio, which is not so big, both were taken off the list by Defense Secretary Aspin about a week ago They are now thought to be somewhat more iffy but they could be closed as well In Washington, Boeing has confirmed that it intends to eliminate 15,000 jobs in the state during 1993 and an additional 4,000 jobs in 1994 This would bring the total reduction of employment to about 25 percent from its 1989 peak, so that is a significant development for that area of the District Although the company remains bullish regarding long- term demands for aircraft, recent airline weakness and cancellations of orders further threaten the company's short-run outlook I'm sure you all saw that there was a big cancellation or at least a postponement by United at the same time they decided to continue to take delivery of the Airbus  Turning to the national economy, it seems to us that recent data continue to suggest that the economy is in a sustained, though moderate, expansion Assuming no change in monetary policy, our forecast of growth over the next two years is almost the same as the Greenbook, with the main impetus to growth coming from the interest- rate-sensitive sectors of the economy We do project somewhat stronger growth in investment and a little less consumption than the Greenbook Obviously, the effects of the Clinton economic program are uncertain; however, the program effect to us at least appears to be a slight positive for real GDP growth in '93 and a small negative in '94 In any case, the effects of the program are likely to be less than that of traditional forecast errors Despite the recent spurt in consumer prices, the outlook for inflation in our view is reasonably  -16-    3/23/93  favorable with real GDP remaining below potential And with relatively moderate growth rates, we expect the downward trend in inflation to continue even with the passage of the BTU tax Specifically, in our forecast inflation in the CPI is expected to drop from 3 percent in 1992 to about 2-1/2 percent by the end of 1994, which isn't all that different from the Greenbook Thank you   I could support that recommendation both for staying with alternative B and for symmetry for the reasons that you suggested, including the fact that we really don't know at this time whether the signs of inflation that we have are of a temporary nature or are more likely to be sustained I do have a comment and then a question The comment is that even with symmetry, we certainly have the capability of taking action in the period between now and the next meeting The asymmetry would be mainly a communicating device which, of course, is communicated the Friday after the next meeting So, if we have some concerns about what we should be doing [in the period ahead], I'm not so sure that acceptance of symmetry limits our field of action Therefore, I can very easily--   Yes, but it seems to me that the symmetry does give flexibility I have one question, though For a long time we've talked about the advantages of being ahead of the curve and I think we complimented ourselves on doing that and talked about how that has served us very, very well As I listen to this I get the impression that we may be rethinking that view and going in the other direction I just wondered what you thought about that   But not too far ahead of the curve   You indicated that the market reaction to the shortening of the maturity of the debt was muted Was there much discussion as to the motives for shortening? Has it been received well by the market? I know there wasn't much of a move in rates   Short term   Mike, when I look at the forecast of quarterly growth rates for gross domestic product and inflation and compare it to the previous forecast, I see a couple tenths weaker growth rate throughout the entire period and a couple tenths higher inflation It almost seems that a supply shock of some sort would produce this because typically a model is constructed so that if the economy runs into a slow period [the model] will pull it back--in effect make up for that [slowing] within a relatively short period But when there is a supply shock, that's not necessarily the case What, in effect, did you have in mind that caused it?   I can see that [you have made an adjustment], but do you have any particular feeling as to why that tradeoff may have changed?   Right   We would really have to have a convoluted impact on inflationary expectations to get the kind of effects that you have with the weather   Mr Chairman, economic conditions continue to vary in the Twelfth District In California some evidence has accumulated that the economy actually may have hit bottom in recent months We have seen, for example, that payroll employment is a little higher than it was in December; and taxable sales also appear to have bottomed out with increases experienced in the fourth quarter of 1992 and the first quarter of 1993 Nevertheless, we are faced with significant further defense cuts, state and local fiscal problems, and lingering weakness in commercial real estate that make it unlikely that the California economy is going to grow at any time in the next year The Seattle area, which until recently was expanding briskly, has stagnated in recent months I must admit that recent new orders for Boeing aircraft are encouraging The economies of most other areas of the District continue to flourish Utah, Nevada, Alaska, and Oregon are ranked in the top ten states in terms of employment growth between December 1992 and March 1993 And even the eastern Washington economy continues to be strong Throughout the West, and this is similar to what Tom Hoenig picked up, many business leaders have noted to us that uncertainty about federal fiscal policy, particularly tax policy, is delaying investments and other major business decisions  On the issue of inflation, in general report little price pressure, but there was one anecdote that I thought was rather interesting  and he reported that they periodically conduct a price survey of packaged and canned goods Now, this doesn't get into the problem with fresh fruits and vegetables At the wholesale level, the latest survey revealed more widespread increases in the prices they pay for these goods than they had ever experienced before The interesting thing is that he went on to say that he doubts that they will be able to pass those price increases along It remains to be seen whether they will or not  Turning to the national scene, it appears at least to me that the changes in the Greenbook forecast since the last FOMC meeting are large and, I'd have to say, quite disturbing Real GDP seems to be on a decidedly lower path and inflation on a discouragingly faster track Our own forecast is also more pessimistic in the short run, but by 1994 we have stronger growth than we had before and an unchanged rate of inflation The change to our forecast reflects the defeat of the Clinton stimulus package, general concern about the extent of higher taxes, and slower-than-expected growth in the first quarter as well as the unexpected buildup of inventories The change to the Greenbook forecast would appear to result from more permanent influences in  -18-    5/18/93  addition to the factors that I noted It would seem, if the Greenbook forecast proves to be correct--and that certainly is a possibility-- that the policy tradeoffs are likely to be far less attractive than I'd earlier thought   In alternative C you state that you think the impact of higher rates would cause the prime rate to go up by 1/2 percentage point How strong are your convictions in light of this historically large spread between the cost of funds and the prime and also the very weak demand for bank credit?   I guess I'm persuaded by the arguments for asymmetry It seems to me that if what we want to do is to deal with inflationary expectations, then the most effective way to do it--in terms of when we change the rate--is to do it by vote to show the full Committee's participation in that decision I'd say it would be even better at a meeting, either this one or the next one, but certainly by telephone if not that   Are they going to an end-of-week collection anyway, independent of our prodding? Don't they now have end-of-month data?   But that's not a daily average?   And they plan to do it now, so that would be some improvement   Well, in addition to that, we don't exactly have the strongest case that could be made for a need for it! As the study indicated, [M2+] really does have some significant limitations   Mike, I have two questions The first is on the measurement problems issue I wonder if you could talk about that just a little I know there's a discussion in Part II of the Greenbook and I'm not sure exactly how this problem originates Is each of the series seasonally adjusted except those series where there apparently is not a statistically significant seasonal adjustment factor? And then is it added and the combined unadjusted apparently has a seasonal factor?   So, at the end is there a seasonal adjustment of the entire series?   Okay So, it's almost like a deflator that they see when they publish that There is a number which is called the index [unintelligible] implicit  MESSRS KOHN and PRELL The weighted average   The weighted average, okay   Yes   My other question is In Part I of the Greenbook, and you also referred to it here, you have a table on the relationship between tax increases and expenditure cuts, and for 1994  -15-    7/6-7/93  it's rather interesting Will it be possible at some time in the future to get that out through the entire program? It would be rather interesting--   It's very interesting because now we see in the newspapers that Boskin has the ratio at 9 to 1 and somebody else in the Administration is saying it's 1 to 1   Oh, I know that   Right   I think in assessing the program you have the right data   Thank you, Mr Chairman New data paint a weaker picture in the 12th District than I reported at the May meeting Employment revisions and subsequent monthly releases show a continued deterioration in employment in California Rather than flattening in early 1993, the new payroll data show a continuous rate of decline Preliminary numbers for June show employment down 16 percent from a year ago and falling at a 2 percent annualized rate between May and June Only services have actually shown gains in employment in the last year The household survey, which had shown a stronger employment picture, reported a decline of 187,000 jobs in California between May and June, bringing the level of employment in that survey slightly below that of a year earlier and raising the unemployment rate to 91 percent Now, economic conditions elsewhere in the District are somewhat better But even there conditions appear a little less positive than they did at the time of our last meeting Outside of California employment is up 17 percent from a year ago, with employment growth exceeding 3 percent in three of our states Idaho, Nevada, and Utah However, all states except Hawaii and Utah reported month-to-month declines in employment between April and May Also, our Beigebook respondents have become increasingly cautious and pessimistic about the national outlook Moreover, our contacts in the District report that investments in business expansion are being slowed by uncertainty attributed to tax, health care, and trade policies  The state and local governments are facing rather substantial fiscal problems in the coastal states California just put in place a few days ago a budget that closed a $93 billion shortfall The agreement, however, created significant problems for local governments by shifting $26 billion of property taxes away from them They obviously are going to have to make adjustments in their budgets, which will have a significant negative impact at least for the current year in many counties and local areas Oregon is facing the possibility of a 20 percent cut in state expenditures because of lost property taxes or tax revenues due to Measure 5 And Washington, which closed a $18 billion shortfall earlier this year through a broadening of the sales tax base and cutting expenditures, is facing a ballot measure in November that would reverse the tax increase In summary, for the District the news is not particularly pleasant  If I can turn to the national scene, our forecast is very similar to that of the Greenbook We do have a second-quarter growth rate of around 2 percent Clearly, the more recent statistics with regard to inflation are more optimistic, but I would say that the inflation outlook is still very uncertain We really only have had one month's data that suggest improvement And I must admit that the measures of the degree of slack in the economy are clearly uncertain; some of that was referred to in the discussion by Mike Prell All of this would suggest to me that we have to continue to focus on the inflation numbers over the next several months because it's really too early to see what the trend is likely to be   You stated that you'd be emphasizing the technical nature of the adjustments if we adopted alternative II Would there also be an attempt to talk a little about the longer term and the fact that these ranges could well be consistent with longer- term expectations or do you think that would be premature?   Except that if one talks about the long term, that certainly wouldn't indicate that one thinks there is a short-term applicability And if we are, in effect, unwilling to talk about the long term and we think this is a problem that is going to persist forever, why are we doing what we're doing?   It may be constructive then to say By the way,  this range is probably pretty much consistent with that and reasonable price stability as well   If we were to lower the range and if your testimony could refer to the staff's expectation of an increase in velocity and in addition an implied increase in velocity from the economic projections, it seems to me it would go a long way in answering Governor Lindsey's concerns   If you were to note that the staff is expecting an increase in velocity and at the same time that our projections seem to imply an increase in velocity as well, that would go a long way toward alleviating the concerns that Governor Lindsey has that we in effect have a lower nominal GDP target [when] we don't have a lower GDP target   Mr Chairman, I would support your recommendation I think a case could be made for symmetry but, given where we are today and also given my own utility function with regard to inflation, I would just as soon [retain] the asymmetry  -68-    7/6-7/93   I have two questions This prohibition of 7 days before and 7 days after a meeting is something that Joe Coyne has repeated quite often in the 7 years I've been here But there are a number of people who obviously disregard this completely Very often when I get back the next day I'll see three or four people have given a speech the day after [the FOMC meeting] I assume they think for some reason that that [prohibition] is a mistake If that's the case, I'd like to hear what their objections are It may be legitimate that we shouldn't have it I frankly think it has been a wise thing, but there obviously are some people who feel as though we should not have such a prohibition because they violate it all the time So, if they violate it all the time, I assume they would not be unhappy talking about why   I'm not talking about talking to the press I'm saying that speeches are scheduled; they get on the wires, etc Yet, I thought there was a consensus that we would not give speeches dealing with the economy 7 days before and 7 days after [an FOMC meeting] Obviously, some people don't know that or, knowing it, don't think it should be respected It would be interesting to know what it is   Well, I can go back and look at--   Okay   I had a second question I'm not sure I fully understand the point made about talking about the economy in such a way that has policy implications If one has concerns about inflation, for example, are you saying that that view should never be articulated in public?   Thank you Mike, there was an appendix in Part II of the Greenbook on the Budget Reconciliation Act that I think was very informative and interesting It would seem as though the one- for-one in terms of tax increases and spending cuts looks fairly legitimate there I also got the impression that perhaps it was not quite as backloaded in terms of expenditure cuts as originally had been the case Are there any defining issues in terms of spending cuts that are making it less than the pure number? Are they of any significance, because I know that was a major criticism earlier in the process? And I wonder if you could just comment on how this has all changed because I know the last Greenbook had a ratio of 8 to 1 for 1994 in terms of tax increases versus expenditure cuts And, of course, Boskin had that article in the Wall Street Journal that had a 9 to 1 ratio for the entire period It seems as though there have been some very dramatic changes   In some past times there have been fee increases that were counted as expenditure cuts; is there much of that?   Thank you, Mr Chairman Economic activity in much of the Twelfth District clearly remains weaker than that for the nation as a whole District employment fell at a 2 percent annual rate in June, marking the fourth consecutive monthly decline The fall in employment was due largely to job losses in California and Washington California has now completed three years of recession; between July 1990 and July 1993 the state lost 560,000 jobs, with 180,000 of those jobs lost during the last year However, the July employment report was somewhat more encouraging We did see an increase in California of 34,000 as far as payroll employment is concerned But half of this increase was due to a rise in state and local government employment that is linked to unusual seasonal factors Civilian employment also increased during July However, there was a very large surge in the labor force and it caused the unemployment rate to rise from 91 to 98 percent Despite the July report, already announced layoffs and reports from contacts suggest continued weakness in several sectors of the California economy We believe that the state will bump along the bottom and remain a drag on District growth for the foreseeable future  Conditions in the state of Washington are also of concern, particularly in the Puget Sound area Recent employment reports for the state have been disappointing; for June employment in the state actually fell at an annualized rate of 57 percent Significant losses were seen in manufacturing, construction, and trade In aerospace, employment has fallen 74 percent over the past year, largely as a result of cutbacks by Boeing In addition, recent reports suggest that Boeing may cut its production more than called for by currently published plans  Conditions in the rest of the District are mixed, with robust conditions in the inter-mountain states and flat or sluggish conditions elsewhere A depressed visitor industry has stalled the Hawaiian economy In contrast, the Nevada boom continues Three major hotel projects will add 10,000 rooms in Las Vegas this coming winter to the existing stock of 76,000 rooms Construction jobs in Nevada are up 20 percent over the past year  Turning to the national economy, although one could certainly quibble with specific numbers in the Greenbook forecast, I think the basic message of moderate growth is certainly the most likely outcome over the next year and a half I'd have to admit, though, that I'm a bit more optimistic about inflation than is the Greenbook We have had three consecutive months of very low inflation, which is consistent with the view that a good part of the inflation scare that we had earlier this year was an aberration And given the current slack in labor markets and also the prospects for continued moderate economic growth, it seems to me that inflation could come in a bit lower than is shown in the Greenbook Thank you, Mr Chairman    8/17/93   That shouldn't be hard!   Coming back to Bob's question--   Okay   Mr Chairman, I think the risks to the forecast in the intermeeting period are clearly balanced so, therefore, I would prefer a move toward symmetry I do think it is important that that not be misinterpreted, and I would assume that we certainly can make that point clear in the minutes   There is a rather slow decline in the unemployment rate in the Greenbook forecast and there's no decline from where we are now   And you had included an upward revision of the growth in trend productivity and higher potential output as well If one looks at the growth rates, the real growth rates appear to be roughly equal to or in some cases below the growth rate of potential Why is there such small progress made in the inflation area? I think you mentioned health care, gasoline taxes, etc, but it seems to me as though it's surprisingly small progress  -8-    9/23/93   Thank you   Mr Chairman, economic activity in the Twelfth District is still weak, and it's not a surprise to indicate that that is due largely to poor conditions in California We saw employment down in August; since the peak of employment in July of 1990 there have been 588,000 jobs lost in the state It's also interesting to note that if one were to back the state out of the national figures we'd probably have an unemployment rate of about 63 or 64 percent as opposed to the 67 percent Residential construction activity shows no signs of picking up in the state and this, of course, is despite the low interest rates and also reduced home prices The number of housing permits is down 13 percent from a year ago and stands at about a third of the level that was reached in 1989 On the commercial side, the only thing I could say that would be of a positive nature is that property values have fallen so low that we seem to see some serious buyers in the markets Actually, there are some transactions taking place If you looked at the situation a year ago there was virtually no activity Reflecting California's economic troubles, net migration to other states rose to 150,000 in fiscal 1993 In contrast, the number of legal foreign immigrants to California rose 23 percent in 1992 to a record 237,500 Now, the official estimate is that illegal immigrants are 100,000; I think that's really low So, in spite of the moves to other states, the state's population is growing very rapidly  Conditions are much better in other parts of the [District] In fact, we have two states that are among the top five in the nation in terms of growth rates, Utah and Nevada Homebuilding activity is very strong The number of housing permits during the three-month period that ended in July was up 22 percent in Idaho and 35 percent in Utah Home prices are rising dramatically From 1990 they're up 27 percent in Boise, up 18 percent in Salt Lake City, up 16 percent in Las Vegas, and up 13 percent in Reno Manufacturing growth is also strong and outpacing the national average in many of these states We've seen 43 percent growth in manufacturing in Idaho, 34 percent in Nevada, and 17 percent in Utah  If I can turn for a moment to the national economy While I agree with the Greenbook pattern of modestly accelerating growth and decelerating inflation, I'd have to say I'm a bit more optimistic about the magnitudes in 1994 We're expecting that real growth will be up a bit more--not quite half a percent--with somewhat less inflation On the price side, while some factors--certainly one-time factors--are going to have the effect of tending to raise the CPI a bit in 1994, our estimates are that we're going to see some greater improvement in the CPI than is indicated in the Greenbook   Agree   Don, this is Bob Parry Do they still [plan] to have those other panels follow us?   Well, that's an all-day affair for them   I don't know if you really want specific guidance from them   This is Bob Parry I have a point of clarification Do we still have concern about being able to three years, or whatever it is, without specific legislation that?  stick to granting   I'm afraid that if we offer up something too quickly here, we may find that we have every intention of having a three-year tripwire but it may end up that it's much, much shorter   This is Bob Parry I think what Tom has proposed makes a great deal of sense I might just mention that in my testimony, which I sent yesterday to Chairman Gonzalez, I looked a little more favorably on the possibility of non-verbatim minutes after  -15-    10/15/93  a long delay--of five years I say in my testimony But I basically think that what Tom has outlined is a very good approach   This is Bob Parry There's something that Si brought up that bothers me a great deal In answering question two, what is a part of my testimony is what I clearly thought I knew at the time [I prepared my written statement] And if I were to sit in front of that Committee on Tuesday and read the answer that I had there, I'm now troubled by that because it is not complete   Well, I said I don't take notes I said that my research director takes handwritten notes and I get briefed--there's a briefing document prepared for me, etc But there's something that I now know that I learned in the last hour that is very significant  -17-    10/15/93  And quite frankly I'd like to ask Virgil what to do on this It seems to me that we're in a little different position And if I'm correct on that, maybe the first person who testifies ought to say something about it   Oh, he is going to do that?   In terms of the past meetings, it seemed to me that what you were [expressing] as something of a preference is alternative three Is that correct?   Okay And would you explain why you prefer that over alternative one?   May I ask a second question? I assume in terms of the future meetings that whatever alternative we come up with would apply equally to the conference calls?   But it seems to me that there wouldn't be much problem leaning over to the side of greater exposure of [the contents of] these conference calls I don't see any [resulting] damage; even if we were getting updates on issues, it probably would be something that would be in the spirit of greater openness And I can't see any damage that would result from that   Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman Somewhat along the lines of Jerry Jordan's comments, I believe that we have a rather significant obligation to current and past members of the Committee And that leads me in terms of the past meetings to Memoranda of Discussion and a five-year lag However, I certainly wouldn't be against lightly edited transcripts; I just have a preference for the Memoranda knowing full well that they would be quite expensive to  -31-    11/16/93  provide But I think we do have a special obligation to people who didn't realize that this would ever see the light of day even in a lightly edited fashion In terms of how that would be constructed, I think it's only practical that the Secretariat staff have an overwhelming share of the responsibility but I would hope that in some instances where there might be a need they could consult with participants who are currently in the Federal Reserve System if there is a real question as to what was meant by a particular comment  With regard to future meetings, I must admit that I found the enhanced minutes to be quite interesting One of the things it clearly does is give accountability, and I thought accountability was the major issue The other thing I like about it is that it seems to me a pretty low-cost way to deal with this accountability issue This is [an option] I hadn't thought about much until I got Don's memo; I had a short discussion with him [after] that and I find it attractive If that were rejected, my second alternative is the Memorandum of Discussion and my preference would be for a five-year lag if that were the case   Could I ask a question?   In terms of your preference for the enhanced minutes you stressed non-attribution   What about the wrinkle that Don put on it that at the end, I presume, there would be some accountability in terms of the decision that is made so that--   Well, I guess you had some discussions with people and Congressmen--   Oh, from the Board's current minutes I see   I guess my first is the Memorandum of Discussion and my second is lightly edited   Ten and five   Enhanced minutes first and MOD second   How did enhanced come out?   Two current and two enhanced?   On the vote   Shouldn't our agreement to release these lightly edited transcripts with a five-year delay buy us some votes in the Committee anyway?   I would think that that would be significant and that the chances of Chairman Gonzalez getting his way with his own Committee would not seem that high   Mike, one characteristic of some of the recent Greenbook forecasts has been a relatively lean inventory picture, particularly business inventories; and I think there were even discussions about just-in-time inventories, etc It seems as though things have changed dramatically in this current forecast in that there is anywhere from $10 to $20 billion a quarter more in nonfarm inventories I wondered what has changed your thoughts?   But the '94 number is probably about twice what it was before?  -68-    11/16/93   Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman States in the Twelfth District are moving along two distinct and divergent paths The California economy continues to weaken according to most statistics that we see Employment has fallen 51 percent or by 642,000 in the state since July of 1990 In the last 12 months it has fallen 13 percent In fact, if we look at California's employment losses and what they do to the national totals, actually instead of the 16 percent increase, employment in the nation outside of California has really risen 2 percent, which is a fairly significant difference California's unemployment rate is 98 percent in October The volume of loans at large banks in California continues to decline although at a somewhat diminishing rate And loan growth in the rest of the Twelfth District is positive [Hawaii is reporting] weakness as a result of the problems in California and Japan The rest of the District's states are reporting relatively strong economic conditions Utah remains the fastest growing state in the nation and Nevada is reporting robust growth Three major projects will have added 10,000 new hotel rooms by year-end in Las Vegas, and contacts report that the major hotels are 100 percent booked for weekends through April of 1994 Arizona and Oregon are reporting solid year-over-year employment gains in September of 16 and 19 percent, respectively And anecdotal reports suggest even more strength since September Contacts report a shortage of construction workers in Phoenix while Tucson is experiencing a building boom with rapidly appreciating home prices I should note that there are some companies moving into the Tucson area like Hughes Aircraft Similarly, a contact in Portland reports that three major new office buildings are being planned and it seems very likely that at least two of those will be constructed Finally, while western Washington's economy has slowed because of all the cutbacks at Boeing, which you've heard an awful lot about, the eastern part of the state is reporting a boom  If I can turn just for a moment to the national economy, we basically agree with the Greenbook's outlook for moderate growth in real GDP over the next two years as tighter fiscal policy is counterbalanced by relatively low real interest rates However, I am a bit surprised that the Greenbook shows such a small decline in inflation next year and the year after Given the expectation that output will grow only modestly over the next two years and that the unemployment rate is likely to remain at roughly the present level, based upon past relationships it wouldn't be surprising in my view to see labor market slack of this size reduce the CPI inflation to a lower number than that included in the Greenbook   "B" symmetric   The question I have is that it seems to me that in terms of the price distortion effects of inflation, there are pretty strong results The effect of that on productivity, etc, doesn't show up too strongly Is that correct?   But aren't there strong theoretical and analytical reasons to think that there would be a negative effect? The fact that the quantitative results are not always very strong to me focuses too much on the data, which can be affected by so many things I would say that if you can establish something theoretically or analytically--and I think that's been done--it's very, very [probable] So I would say that in some respects your results are much stronger than you've portrayed   And analytically from that conclusion [inflation leads to] a lot of problems in terms of productivity and probably also growth    12/21/93   But I think their work indicated that at moderate rates of inflation the price distortions are statistically significant   Mike, in the 1992 GDP revisions some of the discrepancy that we thought we saw initially between hours worked and output was removed and, of course, GDP was increased very substantially In the first half of 1993 there were some of the same phenomena in the numbers but [that could change in] the revision as well If one had sort of a pro forma revision, making it similar to what occurred in 1992, what are the implications for the amount of slack that we would have at this point? Or how would you [view that]? Toward the end of your presentation you mentioned a few concerns and cautionary measures [unintelligible]--   Thank you, Mr Chairman My report from the Twelfth District economy is more optimistic, although the changes for California are small and mixed In October employment in the District states outside of California showed considerable strength, with employment increasing 40,000 Annualized economic employment growth rates for the month ranged from 2-1/2 to 4 percent for most of the states; and Idaho and Nevada, which have been incredibly strong, actually recorded double-digit rates of expansion One thing that was a bit of a surprise in the last month or two is what's happening in the state of Washington Washington's employment growth outpaced that in most other District states, expanding at 8 percent in October following the 6 percent growth in September And while eastern Washington continues to reflect what I think can be correctly characterized as boom conditions associated with those in the inter- mountain states, contacts also report that business activity in western Washington is stronger However, cutbacks in aerospace, of course, remain a drag on that region's performance California's economy remains weak although current conditions are more mixed than they have been in recent months November payroll employment was little changed from the recession low reached in October Moreover, job losses have continued in such areas as construction and manufacturing On a more positive note, reports from contacts in California are no longer uniformly negative Retail sales are improving some, and there certainly are good conditions in some sectors such as motion pictures, entertainment, and also agriculture Within the state, economic conditions are clearly weakest in southern California, especially the Los Angeles area Layoffs continue in aerospace and defense, and construction remains quite depressed Real estate values appear to be continuing to slide in that area Conditions are relatively stronger in the huge agricultural area of the Central Valley and also in northern California, despite falling employment in the Bay area  Turning to the national economy, at this point we think that the most likely outlook for growth is roughly that which is incorporated in the Greenbook It seems to us that following what is    12/21/93  going to be clearly a very strong fourth quarter we will see a reduction in growth rates along the line of what is indicated in the Greenbook I would say that based upon [the Board staff's] forecast and ours it wouldn't be surprising to see labor market slack and a reduced core rate of inflation below that incorporated in the Greenbook However, at the same time I think there is a reasonable chance that growth in inflation will turn out to be stronger than projected, along the line Al was talking about New orders and production have picked up in areas besides autos, and we think GDP for 1993 may be revised up to some extent, providing more momentum for growth next year As a result, it's possible that the gap between potential and actual GDP may be diminishing at a faster rate than is anticipated in both forecasts Thank you   Mr Chairman, I think it is quite likely that after the current quarter we will see more moderate growth next year and, therefore, I could support alternative B It's a little hard for  -33-    12/21/93  me to reach the conclusion that the risks are symmetrical, which leads me into the direction of thinking that there is a case for asymmetry toward restraint But I could easily buy the symmetry if I also would get what Ed Boehne offered   Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation I do have two questions If we were to deny access, how likely in your mind is it that Chairman Gonzalez would try to get his Committee to  -48-    12/21/93  issue a subpoena? And secondly, how likely is it that he'd be successful since this isn't a monetary policy issue and is probably viewed by a lot of people in the House as something where we sort of got together to develop tactics for testifying?   Is the fact that we're going to take up this other issue at the next meeting going to affect the starting or ending time? How long will it continue?   You were talking about the influence of the length of the workweek on the growth in employment I have a recollection that when I read Part II of the Greenbook, it said that the workweek in manufacturing had reached a post-World-War-II high of 417 hours Is it conceivable that the length of the workweek may actually fall--so that we might get an even stronger rate of employment growth? It seems as though as an extreme point we might just envision that employers, though they have been very reluctant to hire workers, may do so if they believe that economic growth is going to continue, and they may actually try to shorten the workweek   It's rather impressive when the length of the workweek is at a postwar peak   Mr Chairman, while economic activity is healthy in most of the Twelfth District, weakness in California persists Payroll employment, usually what we consider to be the most reliable short-term indicator of economic activity for a state, continues to decline However, there is a growing body of evidence that suggests the California economy is finally bottoming out Following earlier losses, real retail sales have stabilized during the past year or so and construction employment seems to have bottomed out as well We're also starting to see some encouraging signs in the housing sector, although it's still too early in our view to tell whether this is the beginning of a true housing recovery For example, the number of home sales has been rising for the past several months and there was a surge in sales in the month of December The number of home permits also has risen in the last two months, although it is still very low by historical standards However, when we looked at what other forecasters are saying about the California economy, no one expects any significant improvement during the near term Most forecasters expect the California economy to be flat during the first half of this year with only very minimal growth during the second half of the year  Preliminary damage estimates from the earthquake put the property losses at $15 to $30 billion, depending on who is making the estimates This makes it one of the worst US natural disasters on record Still, the quake probably will not change significantly the overall pace of economic activity in the Los Angeles area In the San Francisco area after the Loma Prieta Earthquake, earthquake-related reductions in business activity were largely offset by demolition, construction, and engineering activity associated with rebuilding President Clinton has asked Congress to authorize $95 billion for earthquake relief and the California government ultimately will contribute to the rebuilding efforts as well It's a little difficult to estimate how much money will be coming from the state, but the experience we had with the 71 Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989 suggests that it will cost the state between $1 and $2 billion  -16-    2/3-4/94  If I can now turn to the national economy, the strong growth in the second half of last year certainly, as we all know, has narrowed the gap between actual and potential GDP and has brought unemployment down close to most estimates of the natural rate We're basically in agreement with the Greenbook forecast for real GDP growth in the neighborhood of 3 percent for 1994 which, of course, would narrow the gap further I was struck when Mike Prell referred to the stubbornness of wage inflation in Chart 8 Growth in the employment cost index as was indicated by that chart has been stuck at 3-1/2 percent for quite a while At current interest rates, it seems as though we would not be able to expect any further progress in bringing inflation down in 1994 and clearly not in 1995   I would very much support issuing a statement I think it's very important that the statement exactly coincide with our taking action in the market and not be either before or after taking action I also feel that we ought to have a discussion as quickly as is feasible about the desirability of similar statements in the future because I think some of us believe there is some advantage to doing it on a continued basis Perhaps we could deal with this issue explicitly in the not-too-distant future along with the other issues that you mentioned   Yes, but I really think that there is an urgency   A point of clarification related to what Ed Boehne said It seems to me that it would be beneficial if your statement were made on behalf of the FOMC Is that what you were thinking? It didn't sound that way to me   You don't?   That's right   Another word for "minimal"   Nobody would want that!   Mr Chairman, I too would favor tightening at this point for the reasons that have been mentioned I might note  -51-    2/3-4/94  that I found your discussion of inventories quite interesting Yesterday, I characterized our forecast as being very similar to that of the Greenbook One difference is that we have somewhat greater strength in the early part of the period largely as a result of much higher nonfarm inventories than assumed in the Greenbook forecast With regard to the amount of our move, I do favor 50 basis points I think it's the appropriate move for some of the reasons that have been mentioned I'm not in favor of 25 basis points But if one wanted 25 basis points, communicating as best we can that other increases are coming, I think that would drive one to asymmetry It seems to me that 25 basis points and symmetry just doesn't represent what most of us think   Mr Chairman, you certainly made your points very strongly and they are points that one wants to take into account I think the concern of some who are favoring 50 basis points may be related to the long time between now and the next meeting Is it possible, as something of a compromise, that we could have an agreement to have a telephone meeting at some intermediate point between the two meetings to see if things have changed to any extent? We certainly would have the benefit of seeing the market reaction to this 25 basis point move In addition to that, we'd have some more information on the economy, particularly the inventory side, and maybe we could discuss these developments again   Upon what evidence?   Mr Chairman, I think our current ranges are consistent with our longer-term objectives and I would not be for changing them In addition, I would not favor using the 1995 projections   Mr Chairman, this is Bob Parry My view is that one certainly could justify an additional move But quite frankly, whether it's right now or in a couple of weeks is not particularly important in my view I worry a bit about how much of the increase in long-term rates is an increase in real rates or a change in inflationary expectations I wonder what you or Dave Lindsey might think about this I'm a little concerned, at least based upon some of the things I read, that perhaps an element in the increase in rates is a function of people's assessment that the inflationary prospects longer term are not as positive as they were perhaps a month or several months ago   Thank you   Well, I must admit that I can support the recommendation What concerns me most, however, is its potential use, a concern related to Jerry's I recall the paragraph in the Maroni memo referring to the fact that in 1988 the swap line was used for window-dressing operations to enhance the announcement of the country's reserves scheduled to be made by the Director General of the Bank of Mexico on August 4 and the President of Mexico on September 1 I think of swap lines as being used to deal with disorderly markets I think someone who wants to could make a case that perhaps they were being used for political purposes The kindest light one could put on it is that they were used to prevent the occurrence of disorderly markets, a view with which I'm uncomfortable as well It's not so much the authority that bothers me; it's the potential in my view for misuse of the Mexican swap   Hasn't there been a tradition to use swaps to deal with disorderly markets or do we also use them to prevent disorderly markets?   But these Mexican swap lines were used in 1976, 1982, and 1988 as well The political aspect seems apparent   I certainly would not favor disengagement and I don't have problems with the numbers that are being proposed Is it feasible to have an agreement among the Treasury, Mexico, and us--and for that matter others with whom we have swap arrangements--that the swaps would be used to deal with disorderly markets? I would feel much more comfortable    3/22/94   That's helpful to me   Yes, point of clarification You are quite correct that it's sometimes difficult to define what is a disorderly market, and everybody would agree that we should give the authorities the judgment on that issue But the issue is whether the authorities should attempt to prevent what might turn out to be a disorderly market versus dealing with a disorderly market   I hope so   This is out of order!   I'd like to ask a question about unemployment that I don't think is related to that excellent memo that deals with some of the problems with the new series It may be a bit related to your answer to Jerry Looking at the unemployment rate and the amount of slack implied in labor markets, it looks as though you have either a new Okun's Law relationship relative to your previous forecasts or some kind of an intercept change that resulted from observing where the first quarter's unemployment rate is Real growth, if you compare the two forecasts, is less than it was in the prior forecast and the unemployment rate is also a fair amount less Is that just an intercept change or some conclusion that Okun's Law is operating in a different way?   And when you do that, does that raise any questions or issues about one's view of NAIRU?  -17-    3/22/94   Well, to the extent that the NAIRU doesn't change, it clearly has significant implications   Thank you   Mr Chairman, information we received about the Twelfth District's economy since the last meeting suggests that the economy has strengthened, although I would point out that California's economy continues to lag The District outside of California is experiencing very strong growth District employment growth outside of California was 41 percent between January 1993 and January 1994 Nevada, Utah, Idaho, and Arizona all ranked in the top five states in employment growth during the last year, and strength in these states is widespread and is absent only from the mining industry Construction is very strong outside of California, with double-digit construction employment growth in most states Moreover, strong permits and nonresidential awards suggest that activity will continue in the months ahead  California continues to show mixed signals Payroll employment declined again in February Employment is off about 12 percent in the past year and since July of 1990 it is down 644,000 But it appears that real estate conditions are improving somewhat Residential sales in California were up 20 percent in January from the level of a year ago, which could have something to do with weather Contacts also report more multiple offers for housing in many parts of the state And the commercial real estate picture is improving, with stabilizing rents and slight declines in vacancy rates reported There are a few prominent forecasters that people follow for California One is UCLA and the other one is Salomon Brothers Both of them recently have revised upward their forecasts for the state, predicting that economic recovery will begin in the second half of the year primarily as a result of the improved picture with regard to real estate and also the infusion of earthquake relief funds  Turning to the national economy, I agree with the Greenbook forecast as far as GDP is concerned, with it averaging approximately 2-1/2 percent over this year and next It's worth emphasizing, of course, that this forecast assumes a rise in short-term rates from current levels The strong growth that we saw in the last half of the year has all but eliminated the gap between actual and potential GDP, as mentioned by Mike Prell, and has brought unemployment close to most estimates of the natural rate The further growth projected for this year would seem very likely to eliminate any gap that might remain  It seems, as Ed Boehne and others said, that there are few downside risks to this forecast and conceivably there could be some upside risks The Greenbook and the financial markets presume a significant increase in short-term interest rates this year but, even if these come about, I wouldn't expect to see any further progress in  -25-    3/22/94  bringing inflation down Therefore, my expectation for CPI inflation over the forecast period is very similar to the Greenbook average of approximately 3 percent   Mr Chairman, I think that robust growth in real GDP in recent quarters has sharply diminished the slack in both labor and product markets And if growth does not slow as much as anticipated, we could be facing significant upward pressures on inflation Despite the action taken at the last meeting, the real federal funds rate still appears to be, in my view, unsustainably low I think those who favor moving toward a neutral policy stance should therefore support a significant increase in the federal funds rate Even if a neutral stance were to require a real funds rate of only 1 percent, we would still need a large increase in the nominal rate to reach that level Those who favor such things as nominal income targeting rules should also support a significant increase in the federal funds rate We have looked at various nominal income rules, and they suggest that we fell behind the curve at the last meeting and that we now need a large increase to catch up And finally, financial markets appear in my view to be expecting significant increases in interest rates over the next six months Thus, I feel that a 50 basis point increase is needed An increase of 25 basis points would probably not be sufficient to prevent an increase in inflation and certainly would not be sufficient to make further progress in reducing inflation Therefore, my first preference would be Bluebook alternative C However, since I believe that whether we do things today or a couple of weeks later doesn't make all that much difference in terms of impact on the economy, I certainly could accept 25 basis points today if we had asymmetric language to the up side and at least the possibility that a move could come prior to the next meeting   The same thing could happen with the term "reserve restraint" In saying a slight change, the "slight" may equivocate--   I would favor the announcement   Mr Chairman, this is Bob Parry I support the action as well   Mr Chairman, this is Bob Parry   I basically agree with your position It seems to me that we're in rough agreement about where we want to be by midyear If we move today, we would have the benefit of an additional month's information before our next meeting, and we could have a complete discussion then I have the feeling that there's going to be a strong argument at that meeting for another move, perhaps an even larger move And at that time, it would seem that there would be a sufficient difference between the funds rate and the discount rate to support strongly the idea of moving the discount rate   Mike, I have a question about the inflation numbers Last year at this time we had an unpleasant inflation surprise This year it seems, if you look at the year-over-year comparisons at least, that the consumer inflation numbers are coming in somewhat below the forecast Part of that is probably due to recent changes in the seasonal factors for the CPI, but that probably is not a complete explanation; I don't think it is Is there some perspective as far as that development is concerned that ought to be brought into this discussion? I know you cited the 6-month inflation rates and they don't look quite as favorable   Did you say that the very latest data are in accord with expectations?   Well, the thing I'm thinking about is that the 24 percent change in the total CPI over the past 12 months and the 27 or 28 percent change in the core rate over the same period are a little better than expectations   Okay   Thank you, Mr Chairman Part of the Twelfth District continues to show very strong growth Outside of California, the growth of employment between March 1993 and March 1994 was 33 percent And over that period three states--Nevada, Idaho, and Utah-- ranked first, second, and third in the nation in terms of job growth, and Arizona ranked seventh In the Pacific Northwest, we see economic growth that is best characterized as being pretty solid, but at a less spectacular pace than in the other states that I mentioned I might note that I had an opportunity to meet with the head of a major construction company based in Oregon; he's been in the business for 30 years and he said this is the strongest period that he has ever seen His biggest client is Intel, and they have a huge project going on in Albuquerque, another one likely to start soon in Arizona, and another one in Oregon itself One of the interesting things is that these projects are not all for the Pentium chip As a matter of fact, they're building plants for the next generation--which are still in the design phase But in any case, these are major projects  Hawaii's economy remains weak and the job losses continue in that state On a mildly positive note, though, the visitor count seems to be up from what it was a year ago California appears to have hit the bottom of its long down cycle, but the current pace of activity seems to be improving very slowly If you look at the California employment data--and they seem to be revised very frequently--they show a trough in December but job growth between December and April is up only 1/2 percent at an annual rate Other broad-based measures such as state tax revenues, retail sales, and personal income show basically no trend I'd say the only area in California where there are convincing signs of significant improvement is real estate and other construction Existing home sales, housing permits, and nonresidential construction awards all improved very significantly during the last two quarters compared with the same levels in early 1993  -15-    5/17/94  Turning to the national economy, our policy assumptions are very similar to those in the Greenbook, and we come to similar conclusions about what is likely to happen in the economy However, we do seem to have a somewhat different view on the responsiveness of the economy to interest rates In our model, that responsiveness appears to be a little larger Consequently we have a little weaker economy in the second half of this year, and next year we have a little stronger growth because we have long-term rates coming down a bit more than in the Greenbook With regard to inflation, with the small amount of unused capacity in the economy, we do not see the prospect for improvement in inflation from this point on, and we certainly don't rule out the possibility that the inflation numbers could begin to look even worse in 1995 Thank you   I, too, would support a 50 basis point move and I prefer a symmetric directive I must admit I'm not convinced at this point that our gradual approach was the wrong one, and it still may serve us well in the future But I do think 50 basis points is appropriate at this time The other point I'd like to make is that I hope any public statement we make doesn't convey either the impression that we are likely to do anything in the near term or that we are likely to rest on our oars for a while I think that--   Good   A question for Mike and one for Ted Mike, regarding the growth of potential output, when you look at labor force growth, is there no longer a decline in hours worked?   Yes  -13-    7/5-6/94   So, it's not a major factor in the calculation of potential output growth?   Ted, this isn't directly affecting the United States all that much, but I refer to your table on Chart 7 with regard to China One of the issues, of course, for those who follow China is whether or not they are going to be successful in dealing with their economic overheating problem I am trying to figure out from your forecast whether they in fact will succeed in controlling it It looks to me as though they have not had great success thus far   It would be interesting, maybe not so much for this Committee, to look at the implications   Right Thank you   Mr Chairman, the economy in the Twelfth District is continuing the trends noted in the last few meetings with weakness persisting in California and Hawaii and strength elsewhere The situation in California has changed very little Employment growth has been weak through May, rising at an average annual rate of about 04 percent since employment hit its trough in December Most forecasters expect this very weak recovery to continue, with service employment gains slightly outpacing losses in the manufacturing area through the remainder of 1994  Turning to the rest of the District, conditions range from good to very good Washington and Alaska have reported employment gains of 16 and 24 percent respectively over the last year Moreover, Boeing's announced layoffs are nearing completion, which will help the Seattle economy since a major negative for a long period will no longer be present However, Alaska is facing an uncertain future largely because of a long-term decline in oil production The rest of the District is very strong Nevada, Utah, and Idaho are the three fastest growing states in the nation in terms of employment Arizona and Oregon also report rapid employment growth Construction remains at a high level in these states, although activity has leveled off a bit in both Idaho and Nevada  -22-    7/5-6/94  Turning to the national economy, my outlook differs somewhat from that of the Greenbook in a couple of respects First, I would not be surprised to see the economy slow somewhat more in the latter half of this year than shown in the Greenbook forecast as a result of the tightening moves that have been made so far I would then expect a little more strength than the Greenbook implies for 1995, although the outcome clearly depends on future policy actions Second, I have been impressed pleasantly by recent inflation results and certainly impressed by recent data on employee compensation costs Even after considering the lower dollar and higher oil prices, I think it's possible that CPI inflation will come in at or even a little below 3 percent for the next year and a half I do, however, think that most if not all of the slack in the economy probably has been used up and that the longer-term inflation outlook is a significant concern Thank you, Mr Chairman   Yes, I have a somewhat different question I want to ask about an earlier comment that you made that you had a preference for not changing the ranges except for perhaps the debt range in 1995 I think we're all well aware of the problems in terms of the significance of the growth in the aggregates But as I read the Bluebook, I certainly associated alternative I with the baseline forecast, which I feel is an unacceptable outcome as one goes out to the next millennium Would you talk very briefly about whether you think, if we were to leave the targets alone, that we would be constraining ourselves to follow the baseline? Or would you say that those targets are sufficiently broad and the uncertainties sufficiently great that we could still be confident that we could follow a path where inflation would get no higher and would begin to come down?   Just a follow-up question It seems to me that in your testimony you could make the point that you just made about M2 and M3, saying that, if velocity returns to normal, those ranges would be consistent with our long-term objectives with regard to inflation You could then make a similar argument with regard to debt, indicating that the change in the range was being made to make it consistent with our long-term objectives for inflation I would certainly find that  -46-    7/5-6/94  preferable to saying the range is being changed for technical reasons because we expect debt growth to come in lower I think there is a critical difference in the two interpretations   On the aggregates, I would leave the M2 and M3 targets at their current ranges for all the reasons that have been mentioned I do have a preference for lowering the debt range in 1995, since I think there is a good reason in that we believe it is more consistent with the other ranges we have set I also don't think it would result in an excessive focus by the markets if it's clearly understood why the change was made On the Riegle request, I don't have strong views, but on balance I think that releasing our 1996 forecasts probably would not cause problems or create misinformation   Yes, the next sentence--   Mr Chairman, I would support alternative B because I think the extent and duration of the moderating growth are uncertain at this point I do think, though, that we may receive information in the next several weeks that will indicate more clearly whether this moderating is going to continue, or if we are going to follow a path that is more closely aligned with that of the Greenbook  From my viewpoint if there ever was a good time for asymmetry, this is it I also feel that having a conference call perhaps toward the end of the month is a good idea It would give us an opportunity to review some of the statistics that are coming out, but in addition it would be an opportunity for you to share with us some of your own views about the testimony, which will have been completed as well   Right As far as an announcement is concerned, I think one is probably necessary following this meeting It seems to me that to announce the fact that the meeting is over is subtle enough that I am sure markets could deal with that!  Finally, unless I am missing something, the discussion about waiting until a bad CPI number comes out is one I am very troubled by It seems to me that we spent the last six months telling people that  -73-    7/5-6/94  we can't wait for bad inflation news before we act, that it takes 12 to 18 months for policy to have an impact on inflation The tactic of waiting until a bad number comes out, for whatever purpose, is just an incorrect approach In fact, such a number probably would be one I would want to react to least Thank you   Mike, this is Bob Parry There was a short discussion in the last Greenbook about the possible benchmark revisions and what they might imply for 1993--that is, what the implications are for slack, etc Is there anything more that you know about this benchmark revision at this point?   Thank you   Why do you ask?   That's interesting; I didn't hear anything about it   Mike, in the Greenbook forecast inventory investment comes down to more traditional levels And I think as a result the inventory/sales ratios, if I remember them from Part II of the Greenbook, also come down Would you comment on the risks to the assumptions about inventory investment because it seems to me possible at least that we could see more inventory building in the forecast period than is incorporated in what may be a conservative forecast   Mr Chairman, trends in the Twelfth District economy are little changed since our last meeting Employment has grown 1 percent during the past year with strong gains in many parts of the region offset by flat conditions in California Idaho, Nevada, and Utah remain the three fastest growing states in the nation in terms of employment Moreover, Arizona and the Pacific Northwest states are reporting year-over-year employment gains ranging from 2 to 4 percent  -10-    8/16/94  Unfortunately, California's economy still shows few signs of growth Employment in the state has risen only 1 percent on an annualized basis since December, and July's level was off 5 percent from a year earlier Moreover, the change from a declining economy in 1993 to a flat economy in 1994 has followed a pattern that does not suggest an imminent rebound The flattening is due more to a cessation of large employment losses in areas such as construction, wholesale trade, and local government rather than to rising strength in other industries In fact, there is only one sector, business services, that has shown consistent growth Meanwhile, defense- related industries, banking, and communications continue to experience substantial job losses  As I'm sure you know, we are at the current time suffering from many fires throughout the District It's a little early to estimate what the impacts are likely to be I don't think there will be major impacts in dollar terms, but we are just entering the fire season, so it is something to keep a watch on  Turning to the national economy, our outlook differs somewhat from the Greenbook for the latter half of this year We actually have a little more of a slowdown than was incorporated in the Greenbook for the second half because of the effects of the tightening moves so far, and also as a result of a decline in the amount of inventory investment However at present levels of short-term interest rates, we clearly would see a strong bounceback in real GDP growth next year  Even with slower growth in the near term, I have significant concerns about the longer-term inflation outlook Although estimates of slack are subject, as we all know, to considerable uncertainty, it seems likely that most if not all of the unused capacity in labor and product markets has been used up That point certainly was emphasized in the Greenbook Given the present stance of policy, we are running a substantial risk that the future trend of inflation will be in an upward direction Inflation accelerates in 1995 in the Blue Chip consensus and in both the structural and vector auto-regressive models used by our staff In our structural model, a significant rise in the funds rate in 1996 is required through the nominal income policy rule that is built into our structural model Thank you   I also enthusiastically support the complete package As I indicated in my earlier go-around comments, I think the chances of inflation accelerating significantly next year and beyond are great if we do not move   With regard to your answer to Al Broaddus, are there more comprehensive changes in processes that would be desirable than are proposed here? If so, what stands in the way of implementing them?   In the intermeeting period there has been a lot of discussion of the exact wording of the announcement that we made in August Do you think that that has had any impact either on Desk operations or in markets in general?   I'd like to ask a question about imports In the forecast for the third and fourth quarters the growth rates of imports are the lowest we've seen since, I think, about 1991 Clearly, the direction of effects from exchange rates is supportive of this, but it seems as though it's a rather unrealistic slowing given the strength of final demand in this country   So they showed up in inventories?   I see   Mr Chairman, a number of signals suggest that economic conditions in the Twelfth District are improving The current data indicate that the number of payroll jobs in the District rose 12 percent over the 12 months through August, the strongest annual growth that we have seen since 1990 Moreover, payroll employment data for a number of states are expected to be revised up substantially when the 1994 state benchmarks are released next March We already know that there will be large upward revisions in California, Arizona, and Washington, and several other western states may see substantial revisions as well I should note that systematic revisions in the state data do not necessarily mean that national payroll series also will be revised up, since the national figures already include bias adjustments that generally are not used in compiling the individual state data Utah, Nevada, and Idaho had the nation's fastest growth in payroll employment during the past 12  -14-    9/27/94  months In Oregon, Washington, and Arizona, the pace of growth is less robust but appears to be picking up  In California, it now looks as though the economy bottomed out and remained essentially flat roughly from early through mid-1993 At the last couple of FOMC meetings, we pointed to the bottom as being at the end of 1993, but these revisions in payroll data have changed that picture somewhat However, the subsequent recovery that we have seen has been slow, sporadic, and uneven across sectors While retail sales jumped 24 percent in the first quarter of this year, they fell back 6 percent in the second quarter The unemployment rate remained stuck around 9 percent, just a little less than the present rate Aerospace manufacturing continues to shed jobs at a double-digit annual rate  Turning to the national economy, real GDP growth appears to have slowed somewhat from the robust pace in the first half of this year However, growth is likely to average slightly above its potential rate in this half of the year Moreover, at present levels of short-term interest rates, I would expect to see a modest increase in the pace of the expansion in 1995, putting growth a bit above the potential rate in that year also Labor and product markets currently appear to be tight This impression was reinforced by the sizable increase in capacity utilization rates in the most recent release While estimates of what constitutes full utilization in product or labor markets are inherently uncertain, it seems safe to say that without a further increase in short-term rates such as that contained in the Greenbook, there is a significant risk that inflation will be on an upward trend in the next few years Thank you   Mr Chairman, it seems obvious that since our last meeting, pressures on capacity in product and labor markets have grown as have prospects for higher inflation in the future Thus, it seems to me that we should raise the funds rate again fairly soon I don't think we have to do it today, but I certainly would prefer an asymmetric directive tilted toward raising the rate if incoming data imply greater pressures for future inflation Thus, I would accept your recommendation   Mike, in your verbal presentation and also in the Greenbook you twice referred to more lenient lending terms by banks as a factor in the strength of the economy I want to make sure I understand the point Are you saying that banks are more lenient than one typically would see at this stage of the cycle, or is this just what we typically see? My own discussions with bankers suggest that they are not doing anything unique for this cycle As a matter of fact, I think that in some respects they are a little more cautious Are you seeing something exogenous to what our experience has been in the past at this stage of the cycle? If so, how important is it?   A little later?    11/15/94   Right   I guess I'm a little surprised that in the past we have seen a tightening of terms in the first year of rising interest rates I would have thought that it would have come later   I don't think there is any doubt about that I really wonder if that's unique   Mr Chairman, the economic recovery in California appears to be taking hold while conditions in the rest of the District generally remain strong Abstracting from month-to-month volatility, the California unemployment rate has fallen about 1 percentage point since the first quarter of the year, although it remains about 2 percentage points above the national rate In the rest of the District, state employment growth has outpaced the national rate in Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, and Utah Contacts in District states other than California and Hawaii generally indicate that regional wages are accelerating Labor markets are regarded as especially tight for construction workers, computer programmers, as well as banking and retail sales personnel Consumer prices have been fairly weak in California in large part because of weak housing prices More recently, housing sales in the state have picked up noticeably, and many of our contacts expect a pickup in housing cost inflation  Turning to the national economy, real GDP growth has continued to be surprisingly strong, showing no signs so far of falling below the potential rate of growth As a result, as already has been mentioned, tight labor and product markets have become noticeably tighter since our last meeting Moreover, at present levels of interest rates, I would expect to see further robust economic growth and declines in the unemployment rate in the remainder of this year and in 1995 Under these circumstances, it has become increasingly clear that inflation would be on an upward trajectory in the years ahead without a substantially tighter stance of policy   Mr Chairman, since our last meeting, the economy certainly has shown considerable momentum and labor and product markets now appear to be extremely tight I feel that if we don't act strongly, it seems likely that the economy will substantially overshoot its potential and that inflation will take on a rising trend It seems clear that interest rates need to be raised considerably above current levels, and therefore I support your recommendation of a 75 basis point increase in the federal funds rate Moreover, I would not be surprised if a further tightening in policy is necessary in December Therefore, my preference would be for asymmetric language toward tightening in the directive I would not want the press release to imply that there would be a pause in further action While I am at it, since I am making suggestions, I would find any mention of the dollar as a rationale for the change a mistake   There may be times when what you want to do for monetary policy purposes is consistent with what the Treasury wants to do to affect the exchange rate I have difficulty relating that to what Governor Lindsey said It sounds like he wanted a tool for all time for you to put in the closet, and I don't understand that This Committee will have a view about what is appropriate monetary policy It may be that today it would be consistent with what the Treasury may want to do, and that's good for today   Right   So the trip factor would be a request for intervention When we have asymmetry, what we are assuming is that we or the Chairman will be looking at a set of data that will lead him perhaps to request a rate increase Are you saying that there is one development we are going to focus on and that is a request from the Treasury to intervene?   Mike, you talked about the inflation forecast and indicated that you made, in effect, an intercept adjustment in the forecast to carry forward the favorable experience that we seem to have had in 1994 Would you talk further about why we have had that favorable experience and why it might continue? We may be seeing actual growth in excess of potential As we get closer to capacity isn't there a risk that we will have seen a delay in the typical Phillips curve relationship? If it were to reassert itself in 1995, might inflation turn out to be a fair amount higher than you indicated in the forecast?   Mr Chairman, the Twelfth District's economy is growing solidly Outside of California, the pace of growth is moderating in some of the intermountain states, although Oregon's economy seems to be accelerating Economic indicators for California show continued improvement, aside from the financial problems in Orange County  The current estimate of the Orange County investment pool's losses is $2 billion, but the ultimate loss probably is going to be slightly higher That $2 billion is equivalent to around 2-1/2 percent of Orange County's $75 billion personal income or around 3 percent of total state income However, the comparison with a single year's personal income overstates the economic impact of the financial losses, since a large proportion of the funds was earmarked for capital expenditures that are spread over several years Since more than 97 percent of the funds in the pool were invested by government entities within Orange County, most of the economic effect will be felt in Orange County itself, which accounts for roughly 10 percent of California's economy The county and other participating governments appear to have been largely successful so far in finding ways to meet immediate cash needs There is still a great deal of uncertainty about how the effects will be distributed among the affected jurisdictions However, it is clear that these local government entities will cut spending substantially Orange County already has postponed some large capital projects and put a freeze on hiring and all nonessential spending A number of other jurisdictions are making similar moves  One of the immediate effects has been to raise the cost of borrowing for Orange County governments and for the State of California As was discussed earlier, credit spreads rose on municipal securities all over the country after Orange County filed for bankruptcy These spreads generally have fallen back to the levels that prevailed before the problems in Orange County became public The exception seems to be the State of California Credit spreads on state issues rose more than on most other tax-free bonds Subsequently, spreads have come down only a little from their post- bankruptcy peaks, and they remain higher than they were before the bankruptcy This might reflect market speculation that the state government, which already is financially weak, eventually will be asked to bear some of the cost In this regard, I should point out that in contrast to California State bonds, the credit spreads for actively traded city and county issues within California look about like those for municipals in the rest of the country  -12-    12/20/94  Exposure of Twelfth District banks to Orange County has been and continues to be minimal Loans and direct holdings of Orange County debt by banks are small, and the same goes for exposures under letters of credit However, a few banks face some indirect exposure through sponsorship of mutual funds with Orange County holdings Sponsors of some affected mutual funds, notably the money market funds, bought the funds' holdings of Orange County debt to prevent their funds from realizing the full losses In other words, they wanted to make sure they didn't "break the buck" on the money funds In general, the market seems to have differentiated among various mutual funds according to the extent of their Orange County exposure We also learned that one of the banks that has a tax-exempt money market fund, instead of buying the Orange County paper at par as was done by a few other banks, issued a letter of credit for the Orange County debt, which of course increased its price and reduced the problem  I'd like to turn to the national economy now and hopefully I will remain on the right side of the fence as well, but I certainly don't want to be on top of the fence [Laughter] The national economy continues to exhibit surprisingly strong growth in employment, output, and spending Indeed, the evidence suggests that the current pace of real economic activity has not been diminished very much by the tighter stance of monetary policy this year, or at least that any policy effects have been more than offset by other factors Simulations of our own structural model, which has a monetary policy response similar to models such as DRI's and Ray Fair's, suggest that the tightening so far this year has reduced the growth rate of GDP by about 1/2 percentage point in 1994 The tightening also is projected to reduce GDP growth by a full percentage point in 1995, and another 1/2 percentage point in 1996 Long bonds have moved up more quickly than they often do in response to a policy tightening; there were charts in Part II of the Greenbook that illustrated this This early increase has probably accelerated the effects of policy, so a greater proportion of the effects of the monetary restraint than suggested above may already have been achieved I might note parenthetically that this has a rather interesting implication for the MPS model where one-half of the effect is in the third year That is very different from any other model The more conventional models are showing a faster effect  Even assuming that monetary policy tightens further, as in the Greenbook, our structural model sees a substantial risk that inflation in 1995 and 1996 will be somewhat above its current pace   Mr Chairman, in my view the economy has picked up more momentum since our last meeting, and the degree of tightness in labor and product markets has risen even further Our analysis agrees with the Greenbook that further tightening is needed in order to prevent an increase in the inflation trend Therefore, I would prefer a 50 basis point increase in the funds rate Frankly, I don't see the problems of Orange County as a reason to hesitate in doing what is best at this point for the national economy Financial futures markets expect a 50 basis point increase in the funds rate by early January Thus, I doubt that a policy move at this time would cause much disruption However, I can support your recommendation since I interpret your comments as indicating that a change in policy is quite likely by roughly the middle of January If the tone of the economic data does not change, I am concerned that further delay beyond that point would lead to a deterioration of inflationary expectations   This is Bob Parry Two questions The first one is whether Canada is doing anything more on this Secondly, the amounts I think you said were 6 to 9, right? We'd be going from $6 billion to $9 billion?   If we are looking for the symbolic effects, why wasn't a number like 10 chosen in which case, we'd have 10 here and 5 in Europe? I'm just curious   Thank you I think I understand it better now   Okay, thank you   With regard to announcements, I think it is clear that we ought to continue the present procedure What I would be a little concerned about would be too much detail in the explanation I think we have been pretty well served by the practice of explaining the reasoning but keeping it quite short I don't see much advantage in providing a detailed statement There would be the issue of whether we would get a consensus on it as well   As a point of clarification, what did the subcommittee conclude with regard to this point?   I basically agree with what President Forrestal said I would stress, though, that if we do have the tapes subpoenaed we fully intend to stop taping at that point   That is not done during the meeting   I used to be very supportive of such statements, but in light of all the changes that we have made that are clearly in the direction of openness, I do not see a necessity for it any longer   Would you explain what the blackout period is?   Monetary policy?   Isn't there another element to the blackout in February and July?   Yes, the blackout covers the period between the meeting and the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony   Mr Chairman, I think that the recommendations outlined by Al would be very useful It would be useful, I think, for us to communicate to the public as a goal some idea of a predictable average level of inflation I also believe we could deal with short- run cyclical issues even within the context that Al suggested I would also say that as one looks at what is in the Greenbook and the Bluebook, it is clear that we have a rather difficult period ahead of us, and that suggests to me that it would be nice to have some consensus about these issues within the Committee, regardless of whether we go to the public Quite frankly, I am not sure how we would approach these issues that are covered in the Greenbook and the Bluebook over the longer term without some operating consensus   Mike, the estimated equilibrium real interest rate is mentioned in the Bluebook in the section where there is a discussion of the simulations of the FTS model A very interesting result is that, if the greater fiscal restraint were put into effect, the equilibrium real interest rate would decline by 1-1/2 percentage points I found that very interesting, and I assume it was a result of some simulations of alternative scenarios Could you describe the process by which you get this estimate? I would really be interested in what your estimate of the level would be if there were no fiscal restraint   That is exogenous?   I understand   Well, as I said, the fairly significant decline in the equilibrium real interest rate is a very interesting result   Mr Chairman, growth in the Twelfth District economy is gathering momentum Employment growth has picked up and the unemployment rate has continued to fall, in large part due to improvement in California Within the state, economic conditions have improved in both northern and southern California Recovery in our District should stay on track, although several recent developments will likely damp overall growth and have more pronounced effects on some regions In California, for example, floods are affecting some communities quite a bit, but without having much effect on the state economy overall In Orange County, the losses in the county's investment pool have been marked down to about $17 billion Also, spreads between rates on California State debt and other tax-free debt have narrowed some  The earthquake in Japan also is reverberating in California, holding down shipments between the damaged port of Kobe and major West Coast ports such as Oakland, which counts on Kobe for about 9 percent of its business High-valued shipments between Oakland and Japan reportedly are going through ports other than Kobe, but the increased transport costs are limiting shipments of lower-valued products such as animal feed  The devaluation of the peso could hit states like Arizona and California harder than most other states But assuming that the currency situation stabilizes, we do not expect this to prevent further economic growth Still, some businesses in southern California are greatly concerned about the situation in Mexico An area of particular concern is San Diego where the unemployment rate has not improved as much as has been the case in Los Angeles and where retail sales recently have weakened as a result of the crisis in Mexico  Turning to the national economy, it is clear that employment, output, and spending all exhibited surprisingly strong growth last year As a result, the economy now has attained levels of labor and capacity utilization that are inconsistent with steady inflation, to say nothing of progress toward lower inflation In our outlook, nothing suggests that the monetary tightening of last year will slow the pace of real economic activity sufficiently over the forecast horizon to produce any slack in the economy This point is also amply demonstrated by the Greenbook forecast With no further tightening, there likely will be a deterioration in the inflationary environment in 1995 and 1996 as well as beyond the forecast horizon Thank you, Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman, I think there is urgency in the need to tighten policy for many of the reasons that have been mentioned here Clearly, the analysis in the Greenbook and our analysis in San Francisco support the need to tighten policy Therefore, I would favor a 50 basis point increase Quite frankly, the work we do--and I think it is implicit in the Greenbook as well-- suggests that additional tightening probably will be needed in the future Consequently, I would prefer asymmetric language, but I certainly could live with symmetry   What is the size of the ESF?   Can you say how it is broken down?   Thank you   This is a question for either Peter or Ted In terms of causes of the weakness in the dollar, you referred to the change in expectations about future US fiscal deficits One way to look at the effect of deficits is that if monetary policy has an inflation objective, the impact of greater deficits is to increase the real rate of interest Very often that would lead to a higher value of the dollar In fact, there are many macro models that have that type of linkage For you to get a lower value of the dollar, I think  -11-    3/28/95  there has to be an assumption that the debt would be monetized My question is, of these two types of influences on the dollar, what roles do you think they play over the longer term and what role have they played in the most recent period?   I guess the point I want to make is that it keys off what monetary policy--   Mike, in terms of the growth rates for the baseline forecast of real GDP, it looks like almost a perfect soft landing in some respects But as one focuses more on what the economy looks like in 1996, it seems to me that there are some very troubling aspects, particularly if one considers what a simulation for 1997 might produce For example, we see that at the end of the year the unemployment rate is below conventional estimates of the natural rate That suggests to me that if we were to simulate through 1997 we probably would have higher inflation Therefore, the conclusion is that on the baseline forecast we not only are making no progress toward reducing inflation, we actually are going to see a period of three years in which inflation at best would stay about flat, but in terms of models most likely would worsen Is that a correct assumption?   Thank you   The point I wanted to make was that clearly your projection does not show any improvement on inflation; we are not making progress   Yes   Mr Chairman, growth in the Twelfth District economy as a whole remains moderately strong The District's unemployment rate has dropped 1-1/2 percentage points in the past 12 months The intermountain states have experienced very rapid growth, although we have seen some moderation recently In California, the modest recovery may gain some momentum this year Revised payroll employment data for California show that the recovery so far has been characterized by a rebound in construction, recent strength in non- aerospace manufacturing, and continued growth in services Payroll employment in southern California now is growing at the fastest pace among the regions in California after falling at the fastest rate during the recession  While overall conditions remain strong in the District, several special factors will damp growth in some areas In California, the estimated damage from March rains and floods is expected to reach $2 billion, including $400 million in crop losses The recent storms also will depress state employment, construction activity, and retail sales Recent developments in Mexico likely are beginning to restrain growth in California and Arizona Arizona's dependence on trade with Mexico is about three times the national average, while California's dependence is about 1-1/2 times the nation's To date, the anecdotal evidence confirms initial estimates that developments in Mexico will reduce growth in US real GDP by a few tenths of a percentage point in 1995--Ted indicated roughly a third of a percent in his forecast--which implies a moderate-sized shock to both California and Arizona However, I must admit there is concern that a severe recession in Mexico could bring about more substantial effects on these states, particularly as one gets closer and closer to the Mexican border In Washington State, the widely publicized cutbacks at Boeing will hold down employment in the near term However, it appears to us that these cutbacks are more indicative of a restructuring effort than of a downturn in the longer- run outlook for aircraft production in the state of Washington  If I may turn briefly to the national economy, the broad contour of our forecast is similar to that of the Greenbook, although we seem to have differences that are very similar to those mentioned by President Minehan Throughout this year, the economy most likely will remain above levels of labor and capacity utilization that are consistent with steady inflation, despite a slowing of growth in real GDP Thus, we anticipate that inflation will increase a bit this year and next Of course, there is always considerable uncertainty in such  -22-    3/28/95  forecasts and this is a particularly important consideration at this early stage of a slowdown in growth that now appears to be under way I find it interesting that several of the spending equations in our model are predicting levels that are below the actual data in the fourth quarter, suggesting that there may be some downside risks to the real side of the forecast Moreover, I guess we have all noted that forecasts from a model often underpredict the amplitude of cyclical movements in the economy Thank you, Mr Chairman   Don, in your discussion of symmetry and asymmetry, you indicated that if the Committee were to favor asymmetry to the up side, it might be as a result of its concern about the path that inflation is expected to take over the longer term In your discussion of symmetry, you talked about the Committee maybe concluding that the risks are roughly balanced I assume that this primarily means risks in terms of economic growth What do you think the Committee would be communicating in terms of its views about inflation if it were to favor a symmetric directive?   Thank you   Mr Chairman, because I find the path for inflation in the baseline forecast unacceptable, my first preference would be for a small increase in rates However, I could support alternative B because of the significant uncertainties that we see in the very short-term prospects for the economy I also would strongly favor asymmetry toward tightening, given the expected unsatisfactory path for inflation for the next several years if the baseline policy assumptions are accepted   Ted, your forecast for Japan indicates a fairly respectable pickup in 1995 and 1996, and I saw that the consensus of about 15 international forecasters is very close to your forecast I was wondering how important fiscal stimulus was in that forecast We have had instances in the last couple of years where the degree of    5/23/95  fiscal stimulus in Japan has been a disappointment I wondered if you would comment in general about that projected pickup   Does your forecast have an explicit assumption about trade relations with the United States?   Mr Chairman, growth in the Twelfth District economy still has considerable momentum, although the pace of expansion has slowed recently Household job growth in the first quarter was fast enough to bring the District's unemployment rate down about 1/4 percentage point since the end of last year However, growth in District payroll employment slowed about 1 percentage point in the first quarter relative to the 1994 pace In California, the moderate recovery has continued and the state and local government fiscal climate has improved a bit, although one gets a different impression from recent articles in the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times Payroll employment growth through April of this year continued at near last year's pace  Orange County is reported to have moved closer to reaching an agreement with bondholders to reschedule about $1 billion in short- term debt that begins to come due in early July Some bondholders have been lobbying the state government to help the county honor its obligations as originally scheduled Thus far, the state government has distanced itself from Orange County's woes, actually leaving it to the county's residents to finance eventual debt repayment The spread between California state government bond yields and other similarly rated municipal bond yields has remained well below the peak attained when the Orange County crisis first erupted California's own fiscal situation, we believe, has improved noticeably, although a substantial amount of the debt that accumulated during the recession remains to be worked off The earlier California deficits were financed largely by a run-up in loans to the general fund of about $6 billion More recently, state government revenues have firmed with the pickup in economic activity, creating moderate budget surpluses and allowing a payback of about $1 billion of these loans  Turning to the national economy, our forecast is about the same as the Greenbook forecast We certainly agree that output is going to be weak in the near term as businesses work off excess inventories While there is some uncertainty about how sharp this correction might be, we do not expect it to be prolonged In particular, we expect final sales to keep growing at or even somewhat above the growth rate of potential output through next year We  -17-    5/23/95  expect CPI inflation to stay slightly above 3 percent over the period as the beneficial effects of the recent slowdown in wage inflation are offset by inflationary pressures from the dollar and the rising prices of intermediate goods Thank you   Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation I agree that in the short term the risks seem reasonably well balanced, although I share the same views as President Minehan about emphasizing the possibility that inflation may be a little higher than our forecast in the shorter term I would suggest, however, that if we in fact are somewhat agreed about the direction that we would like to see the rate of inflation go in the longer term, it will make us rather cautious in moving toward lower rates   Mike, I have a question, not specifically about something that came up in the Chart Show but about a paragraph that jumped out at me in the Bluebook, and I thought you might want to comment on it There is a reference to a change in the NAIRU; it is now 59 percent in terms of your analysis My recollection is that the very thick study that was done several years ago came up with a number of 61 percent Would you explain what elements have changed to produce this? Obviously, longer term, it does have policy significance Secondly, there is a footnote indicating that there are no adjustments for demographics I think Kansas City found out how interesting it is to talk publicly about such demographics estimates! They clearly are relevant in terms of estimating what the NAIRU is likely to be in the future Are we going to get another thick study about this or a little more detail about how this change was made?   A thin one would be even better! [Laughter]   Thank you   Mr Chairman, most of the recent slowing in the Twelfth District economy has been in fast growing states, including Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, and Oregon California has experienced less of a slowdown than other states and continues to expand at a moderate pace, but from depressed levels Several large local governments within the state of California need to establish a path to longer-term solvency Los Angeles County recently proposed to curtail expenditures severely  Orange County is working to avert a short-term liquidity crisis, but it is having difficulty resolving its insolvency Because Orange County voters rejected a proposed sales tax increase, additional measures such as cuts in county spending will be required These recent developments have had surprisingly little impact on other municipal issuers in California However, a persistent premium on California state debt suggests that the market expects the county's problems eventually to revert in part to the state  Turning to the national economy, I am somewhat more pessimistic about the second quarter than the Greenbook Our monthly indicators model suggests that real GDP declined at a rate between 1 and 2 percent in the second quarter It appears that a good deal of this weakness reflects a small drop in final sales While the economy is flirting with recession, it seems more likely that real GDP and final sales will increase somewhat in the third quarter and grow moderately over the next year and a half Our staff has used our structural model to try to make sense of the unexpected surge in growth last year, which has been followed by surprising weakness recently They found that in the latter half of 1994 household spending came in well above levels predicted by historical relationships with income, interest rates, and other variables  -15-    7/5-6/95  Developments in the second quarter seem to bring these relationships back more into line so that the recent declines may have been in effect a payback for earlier strength in household spending One partial explanation could be that consumers accelerated purchases to lock in interest rates in a period of rising rates There certainly were anecdotal reports of this happening in the housing market in 1994  Finally, I might note that we have raised our inflation forecast a bit for 1995, based on developments so far this year, but we have marked it down a little for 1996 in view of the excess capacity that is likely to develop later this year and the recent deceleration in unit labor costs Overall, the longer-term inflation outlook seems to have improved in our view since we met in May Thank you, Mr Chairman   Is this the first month that Chrysler had the new minivans?      7/5-6/95   It seems to me that we are still in a position where we don't have a great deal of confidence about the relationship between the growth of the aggregates and the growth of the economy    7/5-6/95  In the past, I think we have acted in a way, as Cathy indicated, where we have used the ranges to convey a message, and I think we probably are most comfortable in continuing to do that at the present time We would be able in my view to increase, as Don explained, the range for M3 and still be consistent with our longer-term objectives  One point I would make, Don, about your comment to Governor Yellen is that I don't think there is a consistent basis for the members' forecasts That needs to be kept in mind If we were to go around the table, I think people would give different responses about what their forecasts assume, and I am not sure that all make explicit policy assumptions There also is a difference between what they think is going to happen and what they think should happen We are not given consistent statements about what we are supposed to assume in doing this exercise So, I think we have to be a little careful about what those forecasts in fact are   Mr Chairman, I have a great deal of sympathy for what President Broaddus said, and I think we ought to give serious consideration to it With regard to the upcoming Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, I favor setting monetary targets that are likely to be consistent with policy goals in the long run The current range for M2 would be consistent with low inflation in the long run if growth in M2 velocity returns to its historical zero level On the other hand, if growth in M3 velocity returns to its historical average of roughly minus 1 percent, the current M3 range would have to be revised upward Since there is some evidence that M3 velocity is reverting toward its historical norm, I favor Bluebook alternative II for 1995, which in fact does raise the range for M3, and alternative I for 1996, which preserves those ranges into 1996   No, you didn't I get the impression that people have at times forecast what is going to happen as opposed to what they would like to see happen I could be very wrong on that   Mr Chairman, I basically agree with many of the comments that Bob Forrestal made If I were certain of our forecast and that in the Greenbook, I would probably favor leaving policy unchanged at present However, as we all know, forecasts are often wrong and they often underpredict the size of cyclical swings in the economy Therefore, I support a 25 or a 50 basis point cut in the funds rate I would have some preference for the latter with  -62-    7/5-6/95  symmetric language as insurance against a more prolonged decline in real GDP than I think is most likely I want to emphasize, however, that we should be prepared to reverse course and raise rates if circumstances change and growth looks as though it will exceed the growth rate of potential output In fact, I don't think we should cut rates now unless we are prepared to raise them again fairly soon, should that become necessary   Dave, I would like to ask two questions about labor force developments As I am sure you know, in the last year or so there has been a lot of volatility in participation rates and in particular a very sharp decline in May and a further decline in June I wonder if the staff has had any thoughts about what is going on in terms of this volatility of participation rates Secondly, is it possible that there is somewhat greater elasticity in the participation rate such that the current 57 percent unemployment rate    8/22/95  may be giving us misleading information about the degree of tightness in labor markets?   Thank you   Didn't the previous Greenbook mention a switch from basing productivity on income to basing it on expenditures as a more realistic way to assess productivity because of the increase in    8/22/95  the statistical discrepancy? Doing that will reduce the growth of productivity   Hasn't it gotten wider in recent quarters?   That's a factor that is going to work in the same direction as the chain-weighted index   Mr Chairman, economic growth in the Twelfth District accelerated a bit in early summer after slowing earlier this year A pickup in California is evident from strengthening retail sales, faster job growth, and a falling unemployment rate Employment gains have been particularly large among California's manufacturers of semiconductors and other electronic components Growth in high- technology industries also is spurring employment gains in the Pacific Northwest In Oregon, much of the strength is also at manufacturers of electronic components and other electronic equipment In the state of Washington, employment in the software industry continues to expand rapidly from a high level Farther inland in the District, economic activity in states such as Nevada and Utah is growing fast and construction continues to boom Excluding these fast growing intermountain states, the District construction sector had weakened in early 1995, but more recently employment growth and residential permit activity have picked up  Turning to the outlook for the national economy, I guess I have a pretty rosy scenario in mind, which is probably a good reason for suspicion Although real GDP growth virtually halted in the second quarter, I believe its composition bodes well for the future The modest sustained rate of increase in final sales was encouraging In addition, it seems clear that firms made progress in working off the inventory overhang that had built up in the first quarter This development in combination with continued modest growth in final sales sets the stage for resumption of real GDP growth in coming quarters, perhaps to the 2 to 2-1/2 percent range    8/22/95  Finally, the recent slowdown in real GDP growth should help nip in the bud any potential surge in inflation It should help eliminate excess demands in labor and product markets that otherwise might have boosted inflation next year In addition, our model suggests that the so-called speed effects on inflation of swings in the economy will restrain inflation, perhaps by 1/2 percent in 1996 Overall, I would expect to see CPI inflation come in at around 2-3/4 percent next year   That's too high  -34-    8/22/95   He's talking about the two nominal effective yield curves?   The same   Mike, you referred to what is happening to labor costs If you look at what models seem to tell you about what is happening there, in the last three quarters, at least in terms of the model that we look at, inflation in the employment cost index has been lower than predicted by 3/4 percentage point My impression is that that may be related to developments in medical costs, and it is possible that the effect will be of short duration When you look out over the next two years, what assumptions do you make about what will happen to the ECI? Have we seen an intercept change or are we going to see an error decay? What assumptions have you made?   So, the inflation assumptions, which are really quite reasonably optimistic, presume that things are moving back to normal   Thank you   Mr Chairman, economic growth in the Twelfth District picked up this summer The annual rate of job growth in California has accelerated by about 1 percentage point--from less than 1 percent this spring to about 2 percent currently The early 1995 declines in manufacturing employment have been reversed and locally oriented sectors such as retail trade have shown increases Also, retail sales have been running well above a year earlier Elsewhere in the West, some of the most rapidly growing states in the nation have resumed their quick pace of expansion In Utah, manufacturing jobs expanded rapidly this summer, and construction employment surged in both Oregon and Nevada In contrast, payroll jobs continued to decline in Hawaii Other District state economies are slowing but appear resilient In Washington State, fast growing industries like software development, most notably of course Microsoft, are offsetting the effects of the large job losses at Boeing In Idaho, the rural areas dependent on agriculture or forest products are weak, but high- tech manufacturing such as that at Micron Technology has been holding up growth in the Boise area The previously rapid growth in Arizona's manufacturing economy was stymied earlier this year by the drop back in exports to Mexico, but the overall Arizona economy continues to expand  Turning to the national outlook, real GDP growth has picked up to a moderate pace in the current quarter, following the inventory correction in the second quarter Our forecast shows GDP growth of 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent through the end of next year as inventory investment stops declining and housing picks up briskly A downside risk to the forecast, one very similar to that mentioned by Mike Prell, is that equilibrium real interest rates may be shifting down in response to prospects for lower federal deficits, making our current policy stance tighter than it would otherwise be Recent inflation news also has been favorable and market inflation expectations seem to have come down a bit For the future, the speed effects from the slowdown in the economy in the first half of this year should restrain inflation late this year and in 1996 As we have discussed, labor costs have come in below expectations But before euphoria sets in, I don't anticipate any progress unfortunately this year and next in reducing inflation below last year's rate Despite favorable inflation numbers, both CPI and PPI inflation so far this year are above last year's rates The unemployment and capacity utilization rates indicate that it is unlikely that there currently is any excess capacity pushing down on inflation Overall, under the assumption of a roughly constant federal funds rate, our forecast shows CPI  -15-    9/26/95  inflation at 3 percent or slightly less in 1995, 1996, and 1997-- somewhat above last year's 26 percent rate Thank you, Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation for Bluebook alternative B I think we have pretty solid evidence that the economy is growing at a faster rate than in the second quarter,and it looks as though the economy is going to continue to grow at an acceptable rate in the future as well Although we have seen a modest fall in inflation and a modest increase in the real funds rate, I don't think there is much evidence that inflation will be on a declining path Therefore, I would be reluctant to cut the funds rate at this time   Mr Chairman, I believe that the Mack bill has much to recommend it The bill would clarify our goals and place the primary emphasis on price stability I also like the fact that it requires a numerical goal, which would add to the public's understanding of monetary policy and hopefully enhance our credibility over time At the same time, the bill gives us the freedom to define the numerical inflation goal and the timeframe for achieving it Finally, I like the fact that the bill removes the requirement that we establish and report on ranges for the monetary aggregates, which have become only a minor part of our deliberations Overall, I think the Mack bill would be a big improvement on Humphrey-Hawkins   Have you had any input from the Administration recently?   Mike, in Part II of the Greenbook, there is a reference to the prospect that manufacturing capacity growth is going to be revised up in light of some surveys in 1993 and 1994 and also  -13-    11/15/95  the new investment that has occurred in 1995 I wonder how much of an effect these pending revisions will have in terms of the staff's assessment of price pressures in various product markets and also what impact it might have on either the level or growth of potential?   Isn't it mainly computers?   Mr Chairman, economic growth in the Twelfth Federal Reserve District has accelerated through September Recent California employment growth has been significantly faster than for the United States as a whole Very rapid growth has continued in Utah and Oregon Although Nevada and Arizona show signs of cooling, they are growing very rapidly Idaho and Washington also are growing more rapidly than the United States as a whole, but with some areas of weakness The limited information that we have on activity in October suggests less robust economic expansion The official California employment and unemployment figures for October suggest some slowing, although other state data indicate that the recovery is still on track Boeing's 23,000 machinists located in the state of Washington are continuing a strike that was begun in early October; the strike is likely to pull down overall economic activity in that state in the fourth quarter I might note parenthetically, as you may have seen, that Boeing received an incredibly large order from Singapore Airlines for their new 777 In California, there is an ongoing debate over creation of higher paying jobs versus lower paying jobs during the state's prolonged recession During this period, the shift from  -22-    11/15/95  higher to lower wage industries has been more rapid in California than in the nation as a whole due primarily to large reductions in defense- related employment More recently, we believe that this trend has been reversed, due largely to job creation in high-tech-related sectors since those sectors have been growing very rapidly in the last year or so  Turning to the national outlook, our forecast shows real GDP growth averaging about 2-1/2 percent or somewhat more through the end of next year In our view this would leave the economy with some resource constraints in labor and product markets even if the NAIRU has fallen a bit Recent inflation news, as we all know, has been favorable Although I hope it continues in this vein, it seems to me there are some reasons to worry about whether that will happen First, there will be upward pressure on inflation to the extent that the economy is pressing on full employment Second, I believe there are reasons to be skeptical of arguments that the moderation in employment cost inflation over the past year will be a major factor holding down price inflation for long As was mentioned by Mike, most of the slowdown in the employment cost index since 1993 has been in benefits, especially health care costs This has caused employment costs to decelerate since mid-1994 However, in the long run this should affect only the level of benefit costs with presumably no permanent effect on compensation inflation Second, research at our Bank and in the academic literature--and I would cite here work done by Robert Gordon and also Yash Mehra from the Richmond Bank--questions the direction of causation between wages and prices We don't talk about that very much This work suggests that more often than not, these two variables are brought into alignment by wages adjusting to prices rather than the other way around So, despite the favorable CPI numbers in recent months, the unusual decline of labor cost inflation relative to price inflation during the past year or more could be resolved in large part by somewhat faster wage inflation in the future In this regard, I found the Greenbook projection of rising labor costs in 1996 and 1997 certainly plausible Taking these factors into account, I end up concluding, as did Tom Hoenig, that I don't see us making any progress in 1996 and 1997 in reducing inflation below this year's rate Under the assumption of a roughly constant funds rate, our forecast shows the CPI at around 3 percent in 1996 and 1997, a little above this year's 2-3/4 percent rate Thank you   Couldn't that announcement in itself have the impact of slowing down progress in resolving the budget problem?   John's choice of 5 for each coefficient is convenient pedagogically Have you ever looked at estimating it? The two coefficients are quite different if you use estimates As you can see, they produce much higher federal funds rates I think in the most recent period the coefficient on the income variable is closer to 8 and the coefficient on the price variable is about 3   Yes  -43-    11/15/95   It's a closer representation of what the Fed actually did than just the selection of the 5 and 5   Okay   The other thing that's interesting is that the constant is about 27 as opposed to 20 and, of course, that's the real rate   Mr Chairman, I agree with your recommendation and I also would prefer symmetry It seems to me that we have had a modest temporary increase in the real funds rate, but I think we ought to be willing to accept that Our forecast and that in the Greenbook expect some pickup in inflation That suggests that the increase in real rates is temporary, and until we see that that is an incorrect forecast, I can't see a good reason to move today So, my preference clearly would be to leave the nominal federal funds rate constant at this point   Mr Chairman, economic growth in the Twelfth District slowed this fall California lost a considerable number of government jobs in October and November, particularly at the local government level This job loss apparently boosted the state unemployment rate However, private-sector growth appeared to have substantial momentum in the state Economic activity in the State of Washington paused during the Boeing strike Retailers there worried  -12-    12/19/95  about slow holiday sales, as about 1 percent of the state's workforce missed paychecks from Boeing during the strike However, under the new contract returning workers are getting a big Christmas present, a 10 percent lump sum payment that will make up the income lost earlier Elsewhere, labor markets remain tight in much of the District Employment growth slowed but generally continued to outpace the nation In fact, in terms of employment growth over the past year, the District now has three of the four fastest growing states in the nation Nevada and Utah are number one and number two, and Oregon has moved up to number four I should also note that the Arizona economy continues to expand rapidly despite the adverse effects of the situation in Mexico So far this year, exports to Mexico from Arizona and California have fallen 8 percent, a bit less sharply than overall US exports to Mexico Apparently, Arizona and California are providing a lot of the components and materials to Mexican maquiladora plants whose production has been increased  Turning to the national economy, despite sluggish growth during the current quarter, our model forecast calls for real growth at a rate between 2-3/4 and 3 percent over 1996, which is somewhat higher than the Greenbook Our structural model predicts that inflation will remain close to 3 percent over the next year or so but will eventually go up because the economy is operating at a high level The acceleration in inflation occurs despite the fact that the policy rule in our model acts to restrict the growth of nominal GDP by raising the funds rate by a small amount late next year and follows through with further increases throughout the forecast However, I expect that the economy will turn out somewhat weaker than the model is predicting Surveys suggest that inflation expectations of both long and short horizons have come down about 20 to 30 basis points over the last quarter, and perhaps around 50 basis points since the beginning of this year I believe that the behavior of financial markets is consistent with this evidence If inflation expectations have indeed come down this much, the implication is that the real funds rate has gone up As a consequence, policy may be somewhat more restrictive than in our forecast since the model we use is based on backward-looking expectations Thus, both real output growth and inflation could come in somewhat lower than in our forecast Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman Don, I would like to focus on the middle column of your bottom chart Would you speak specifically as to what this column means to you in the current situation? When I look at the Philadelphia survey of inflationary expectations, it seems to me that the first thing to make assumptions about is how much of the drop is permanent If I wanted to keep the real rate constant and thought it was all permanent, I would probably need to reduce the rate by 50 basis points If I wanted to take more of a Brainard approach and not go the full distance, the rate reduction might be a quarter What does it mean to you?   Mr Chairman, I don't believe that a rising real funds rate is warranted at this time Also, our nominal income targeting rule that we follow calls for a cut in the funds rate of about 25 basis points Therefore, I favor your recommendation and also the symmetric language you proposed At least in terms of the work that my staff has done, it is quite possible that we may have to reverse that reduction sometime in 1996 if we maintain our longer-term price stability objective As I think I indicated in July, clearly a move down at this time should be accompanied by the recognition that it may have to be followed by a move in the other direction at some later time   Mike, I have a question about the weakness in the economy that we are experiencing at the present time If I look at the quarterly projections in the Greenbook, it would appear that the weakness in the current quarter is temporary and is related to some extent to the weather If you were to characterize the future quarters through the end of 1997, the period would actually show above-trend growth on average Do you think that is a good characterization of the forecast?  -5-    1/30-31/96   That's fine   The baseline policy assumptions keep the economy roughly at trend?   Thank you   Mr Chairman, economic growth in the Twelfth District has been exceeding that of the nation in recent months The western states of Arizona, Nevada, Utah, and Oregon continue to be among the fastest growing in the nation Labor demand and the consumer sector have remained buoyant in these areas Oregon's tax receipts grew fast enough in the last fiscal year for the state to issue a partial rebate in November, boosting holiday season retail sales California had been holding down the District's overall performance, but its economy is now expanding faster than the rest of the United States according to data from the state Even in Washington State, where many were worried about disruptions from the Boeing strike until it ended in mid-November, anecdotal reports suggest strong subsequent retail activity Of course, District retailers did not have to contend with the paralyzing storms that locked up other areas of the country, and the December federal  -12-    1/30-31/96  government shutdown noticeably hurt retailers in only a few of the most tourist-dependent areas  Our District also seems to be relatively well positioned to weather sluggish demand growth in the European economies Twelfth District states export more to newly industrialized Asian countries and Japan than to Europe We are also producing a lot of high technology equipment for which export demand has been strong These factors helped District exports to increase faster than total US exports last year, excluding a decline in aircraft exports from Washington State  Turning to the national economy, based upon recent anecdotal and financial data and the recently available monthly indicators, I think we can place a low probability on the economy going into a slump in 1996 Moreover, because of long lags, the inflation outlook this year--and I would say even next year--is barely affected by uncertainties about economic activity I remain skeptical that the recent dropoff in inflation will be maintained The unemployment rate remains somewhat below, and certainly is not significantly above, most estimates of the natural rate In addition, the recent beneficial effects of lower health care costs on overall inflation are likely to dissipate in the future As a result, I concur with the Greenbook in expecting CPI inflation this year to be at or somewhat above last year's rate Thank you, Mr Chairman   A question about velocity What do you think the market would assume about our confidence in our forecasts of velocity if we were to raise the targets?   Thank you! Mr Chairman, I would support Alternative I because I think the considerations you described that motivated our July discussion continue to apply today It seems to me that we can't forecast velocity reliably Therefore, I think it would not be advisable to move the ranges annually based on current  -32-    1/30-31/96  forecasts Moreover, raising the ranges at this time in the cycle would, in my view, put greater focus on the aggregates, and I am still not confident that increased focus on the aggregates is warranted Thank you   Mr Chairman, I certainly support the Mack Bill I think it may increase our credibility, and frankly I think it may have some impact on what we do around this table In the meantime, having something like the wording that President Broaddus suggested might be useful One never knows It might even reduce the probability that we would ease at a time when we as a group expect the economy to grow at a rate in excess of that of potential   Don, your memo about the NBER conference in January referred to the Feldstein paper as indicating that they had identified at least some benefits of going from something like 4 percent inflation to 2 percent inflation I have not read the paper Could you comment on whether you find that aspect of it compelling?  -47-    1/30-31/96   Don, you referred to the bond market vigilantes who try to correctly anticipate the Committee's actions One thing they have been able to do is to derive indicators like the Taylor rule that seems to approximate our actions If we follow an opportunistic strategy, doesn't it imply a much more complicated mathematical expression of our policy processes with lots of nonlinearities? It seems to me that inevitably there would be a loss of understanding on the part of the market about how we react to things   If I could just have a follow-up question I assume that under both strategies you have a linear Phillips curve, and therefore the output loss is the same under each What is different is the time period, or point in history, in which you incur the output loss   Some people may have gotten the impression that one strategy is less painful than the other The pain is equal; the question is when you actually sustain it Is that correct?   That is what we talked about earlier   Mr Chairman, I would not favor reducing the federal funds rate I would refer to President Boehne's comment about our deeds speaking more loudly than our words If you look at the members' economic projections for 1996, we are saying in effect that we are at potential The midpoint of the central tendency of the Committee members' forecasts indicates that the economy is going to grow 21 percent in 1996 The CPI appears to have increased 27 percent in 1995, and the central tendency of the members' forecasts has a midpoint of 28 percent The unemployment rate is equal to or slightly below the natural rate and is expected to be there at the end of the year It seems to me that the Committee's forecasts speak very loudly and are in conflict with reducing rates at this time I realize that we are in a period where it appears that the economy has some weaknesses The staff forecast calls for 08 percent GDP growth in the current quarter The question is whether or not that slower rate will be temporary If it's temporary, then policy ought not be changed We can't make that determination right now We are disadvantaged by a whole host of things including a lack of data and insufficient time to model the new information I see no reason to change now It would seem to be the prudent thing, in fact the opportune thing, to wait a few weeks before we make a judgment   How about the forecasts of the FOMC members?   So one can accept the forecast, but it's an insurance policy?   Why does it have to be at 215 pm?   Mike, you talked a little about PCs, and the Greenbook indicated that in recent history we have all underestimated the amount of investment in that area I also saw The Wall Street Journal article on Monday Is your reasoning as to why such investment is going to be weaker in the future similar to that in the article, or are there different reasons that lead you to that conclusion?   Yes   Thank you   Mr Chairman, economic growth in the Twelfth District has picked up after a brief lull at the end of last year Over the past 12 months, growth in the District has been substantially more rapid than in the nation according to recently revised employment figures The increased pace of activity largely reflects a pickup in    3/26/96  California, where job growth also has exceeded the national figure over the past year It is encouraging that as the economy in California has improved, job growth has become more broadly based During the early stages of the state's recovery, job growth was concentrated in several sectors that were growing even more rapidly nationwide, such as business services During 1995, these sectors continued to grow rapidly but accounted for a smaller share of state job growth Several key durable manufacturing sectors, primarily electronics, outstripped the rest of the country  In the rest of the District, employment has been very robust in Nevada, Utah, Oregon, and Arizona, which continue to be among the five fastest growing states Washington's economy slowed over the past year, but the state's outlook for the rest of 1996 appears stronger in part because of increased orders at Boeing District employment has been particularly strong in the services, trade, and construction sectors Manufacturing employment in the District has expanded by just over 1 percent over the past 12 months This compares favorably, of course, with declining manufacturing employment at the national level However, declining semiconductor demand may slow District manufacturing growth in the near term  Turning to the national economy, as Mike Prell stated, the substantial amount of economic news released since our last meeting has taken us on a bit of a roller coaster ride Nonetheless, it probably has had little net effect on the outlook for this year Assuming a constant funds rate at the current level, I would expect to see real GDP growth perhaps slightly above its 2 percent potential rate in 1996 Of course, the GM strike will have some near-term effect on GDP volatility What I find most striking about the current situation is the consistency of many inflation indicators They all seem to be pointing toward core CPI inflation remaining around 3 percent, roughly the same rate as in the past 3 years For example, both the unemployment and the capacity utilization rates are near common estimates of their natural rates Also, the employment cost index rose by nearly 3 percent in 1995; this would be consistent with about the same increase in the CPI if experience over the past 15 years is a guide Finally, inflation expectations as measured by Ed Boehne's survey are around 3 percent This isn't surprising given the inflation indicators I have mentioned as well as experience with inflation in recent years So, if we maintain the current stance of policy, it appears that conditions in the economy are likely to maintain roughly the status quo when it comes to inflation over the next two years Moreover, if we do end up seeing a change in inflation, it is more likely to be on the up side since measures of unemployment and unused capacity appear to be slightly on the low side of their natural rates Thank you   They are setting up, but it will take a few more minutes   Mr Chairman, much of the evidence that we have received since the last meeting suggests that economic activity has strengthened, as the gains in February have more than made up for the weakness in January Even with the GM strike this month, it now appears that there will be a marked pickup in real growth in the current quarter as a whole At the present time, there appears to be little upward or downward pressure on inflation, although I do think that the inflation risks are on the up side Accordingly, I would agree with your recommendation that we make no change in policy at this time It seems to me that further easing would be inappropriate, given the increasing strength of the economy and the risks that this could lead to higher inflation in the future It would also seem prudent to me to wait for more information before we decide on our next action If economic activity continues to pick up, it might soon be appropriate to increase the funds rate Thank you   Mike, the core rate of inflation in the forecast increases 1/2 percentage point between the first quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of next year If one were to assume an unchanged policy and to extrapolate that out into 1998, what do you think would happen to core inflation in 1998?   You have a fairly large increase forecast for 1996 and 1997    5/21/96   Mr Chairman, our monthly indicators model suggests that economic growth in the current quarter should be close to that in the first We believe that this relatively high growth rate is temporary because it reflects the building of inventories by business firms Thus, we see the economy slowing toward its long-run growth trend of 2 percent in the second half of the year, assuming that interest rates remain near current levels We expect 2 percent growth in 1997 as well, which is just slightly below the Greenbook forecast  Such a forecast is not as attractive as it might appear at first glance The problem is that with the economy operating around full employment, it will be difficult to make any progress in getting the inflation rate down In fact, our structural model suggests that there will be a small amount of upward pressure on inflation over this period, and of course that is what the Greenbook says as well I find this forecast alarming and would like to be in a situation where the inflation rate is projected to come down gradually  Moreover, it seems to me that the downside risks we were worried about earlier in the year have dissipated and that the risks are largely on the upside now Economic growth could easily come in above our forecast For instance, our structural model predicts a slowdown in the second half of the year, in part because of the recent rise in long-term interest rates However, given that the market's expectation of future economic activity is embedded in long rates, it may be more appropriate to treat the recent rise in rates as an indication of a future robust economy Since we are already operating at a high level of resource utilization, growth above trend even for a few quarters could present an upside inflation risk  Turning to the region, economic expansion in the Twelfth District is continuing at the solid pace that was established in 1995, which remains more rapid than that for the rest of the nation California is making a significant contribution to District expansion While current employment statistics indicate that annualized job growth in California during the first four months of 1996 was below the 1995 pace, the recent statistics are likely to be revised upward Other recent indicators such as a declining unemployment rate, substantial gains in state tax revenues, and reduced outmigration suggest greater underlying strength in the state economy  -8-    5/21/96  After a relatively slow 1995, the Washington State economy expanded sharply in February and March, with noticeable job gains in all major sectors Rapid expansion continues in Nevada, Utah, Oregon, and Arizona, with Arizona accelerating since November after slowing in the middle of 1995 Alaska and Hawaii remain somewhat weak, however  Expansion in District employment continues to be particularly strong in the construction, services, and trade sectors The growth of construction and real estate loans has been strong in the District, and planned construction remains high in several states Growth in the District's boom states is still being spurred by expansion in manufacturing employment, and with a shift to higher-paid jobs, average manufacturing wages have risen substantially in several states Consistent with the recent slowdown in the semiconductor industry, employment growth in the District computer and electronics sector slowed in the first quarter However, our industry contacts believe that the semiconductor industry is experiencing only a temporary glut and that the computer industry will undergo rapid expansion in the remainder of 1996, although at a somewhat less robust pace than in 1995 Thank you, Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman, as it turns out I want to talk about insurance policies as well I believe that it would be wise to tighten policy at this time We cut the rate in January because an apparent moderation in growth was reducing inflationary pressures and because we wanted insurance against the risk that the economy might weaken further Since then, the growth picture of the economy has brightened considerably Growth in the first half of the year now appears to be exceeding the trend rate Since the need to guard against a slow economy has evaporated, it makes sense to undo the January reduction in the funds rate Indeed, it seems to me that the risk we now need to insure against is an increase in inflation This view is supported by the forecasts of both our staff at the San Francisco Fed and the Greenbook At a minimum, it is safe to say that there is little reason to expect inflation to show a downward trajectory at current levels of interest rates  In my view, these two considerations support a 50 basis point increase in the funds rate However, given that an increase in the rate would represent a change in the direction of policy and would be a big surprise to the market, it would seem prudent to me to go for a 25 basis point increase at this meeting Thank you   But how are the numbers characterized in the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony? My recollection is that they are characterized as what the FOMC expects to happen   I don't have any disagreement with what Don is recommending, and I think it can be done in terms of what one sets as a policy objective for a year like 1998 We use policy rules at the San Francisco Bank We have some idea about what we think price stability means, and I think we would be able to do what Don is proposing quite easily In a way it does put the cart before the horse because the real discussion is about what we as a Committee mean by price stability and over what timeframe we should seek to achieve it Since we haven't been able to talk about that for 10 or 11 years, [Laughter] if Don's proposal gets us closer to it, I am all for it   I hope that we can have two discussions I would set aside the question of strategy and discuss it sometime later because I think the two different approaches to strategy raise a lot of other issues So, confining the discussion to our goals and objectives and the time period for achieving them would be very useful   Mike, when I compare the current forecast to the May forecast, there appears to be virtually no change in the economy- wide measures I guess an exception is the CPI in 1996 Yet, as I  -6-    7/2-3/96  read the Greenbook, and the same impression came through in your presentation today, you seem to have shifted your assessment of the risks significantly to the up side What is your rationale for shifting the risks without having an impact on the expected values in the forecast? In fact, I think I have asked this question about risks many times in the past, and as I recall I have gotten only one answer, namely, that the risks were symmetric   Thank you   Mr Chairman, recent economic growth has accelerated in California and to some extent in the remainder of the District Job growth has remained strong in Oregon and has picked up further from already high rates in Nevada, Utah, and Idaho, leaving those four states the fastest growing in the nation In several District states, job gains have been tilted toward higher-paying industries, and labor markets are tight enough to place substantial pressures on wages For example, over the past 12 months average manufacturing wages have increased about 6 percent in Idaho and about 10 percent in Nevada The stronger economic growth in California is evident in a wide variety of statistics The unemployment rate is falling, and employment gains, income tax withholding, and consumer spending are picking up Business firm formation and small business loan demand also have taken off, and even real estate values in the state's long depressed housing market are moving up, at least in the northern part of the state Residential building has not yet responded to this pickup in profitability, so looking ahead we can see a further boost to growth in California from its construction sector  For the national economy, the news since we met in May has caused us to revise up our forecast for the second quarter and for the year as a whole A combination of stronger-than-expected demand in the first and second quarters and lean inventories in the first quarter have led us to raise our forecast for real GDP growth in 1996 to 29 percent from the 23 percent figure we had in May We expect a slowing in the expansion next year to about 1-3/4 percent as a result of higher interest rates and more moderate growth in spending stemming from the accumulation of larger stocks of consumer durables, housing, and plant and equipment  The forecast I have just given you is even stronger than it may appear to be because it incorporates a significant rise in the federal funds rate by early 1997 Although I do expect some slowing in growth next year, it would not be enough to prevent the economy from stretching beyond the full utilization of its resources As a consequence, even with the tighter policy I have assumed, I believe that we face the substantial risk that underlying inflation, abstracting from oil prices and the like, is set on a gradual upward trend I find this prospect alarming, and I certainly would like to see the inflation rate trending down  So as not to confuse Mike Prell, I would like to note that the Humphrey-Hawkins forecast I sent last week assumed an even higher federal funds rate and showed a lower real GDP growth rate for 1997 than the forecast I have just discussed I believe that such a policy  -17-    7/2-3/96  would be an appropriate response to the inflationary threat we are likely to face   That is not what I am forecasting, right   Mr Chairman, is there a way to focus on what was agreed to between them as an interim step? It looked as though both had the same view about the desirability of not allowing inflation to go higher There also was a very explicit agreement that inflation should begin to move lower, and I think I heard Janet say something like a full percentage point lower   Why not set that out as an objective, and then we can have another meeting when we reach it [Laughter]   That would mean more progress than we have made in 11 years   That's progress; now we have to talk about when and how   It seems to me that when Janet and Al were talking, they had implicit in their minds something like a CPI or core CPI They were able to generate some consensus or agreement about the desirability of reducing the rate of CPI inflation from its current level of about 3 percent down to 2 percent That is the critical point If one wants to focus on a different index, let the staff make a suggestion and maybe we will start out with an inflation rate of, say, 2 percent and go down to 1 percent I do not think that is the critical issue I think the critical issue is --   Hold the line and come down one percentage point That is the critical issue   I don't know   Okay   No, you miss the point   I think you have missed the point They were not talking about that   That's fine Then we will start with 2 percent inflation and go to 1 percent   So, you did not agree with the consensus that they reached?   I want to ask a question about the simulations in Bluebook Charts 2 and 3 They have interest rate implications that can affect the growth of the aggregates over the long term PCE inflation has averaged about 2-1/2 percent in the last two years, and it was as low as 21 percent in the last four quarters The simulations you ran allowed the PCE to get up to 3 percent Is that consistent with holding the line on inflation in an opportunistic approach? It seems to me that if you were assuming an opportunistic approach, you would have taken something like 2-1/2 percent or 21 percent and your decision rule would have been to keep it at that level Your assumption does not seem consistent with being either deliberate or opportunistic   It really gives one the impression that holding the line on inflation is a relatively painless process when in fact holding the line on inflation truly may be very painful   Thank you   Mr Chairman, I certainly support your recommendation for the reasons you stated and those that were mentioned by others However, I would like to make an additional point I think we ought to keep in mind that the projections that we have here are staff projections based upon the staff's baseline economic forecast Quite frankly, I think that it is not the best forecast for the next two years As the next two years unfold, I would expect to see a rise in interest rates and in that event the growth of the aggregates is likely to be less So, I think the idea that higher ranges are more consistent with everyone's forecast is a mistake in the first place   Mr Chairman, news on the economy since our last meeting has strengthened my view that it would be wise to raise the federal funds rate at this time We cut the funds rate in January because an apparent moderation in growth was reducing inflationary pressures and because we wanted to guard against the risk that the expansion might weaken even further Since then, the economy has surprised us with its strength Growth in the first half of this year appears to have exceeded the trend rate by quite a bit Indeed, my concern now has shifted to the substantial risk of rising inflation In that situation, whether one is an opportunist or of the deliberate persuasion, strong action is called for In my view, these considerations support a 50 basis point increase in the federal funds rate However, given that an increase would represent a change in the direction of policy and would be a surprise to the market, it may be prudent to limit ourselves to 25 basis points at this meeting and an asymmetric directive  Mr Chairman, I also would like to comment on your presentation, which I found very interesting It highlighted many of the uncertainties about the analytical framework that we are using to deal with policy issues I also thought that the emphasis on the PCE chain-weighted index was quite instructive I would recommend that we put on for a day a principled opportunist's hat and suggest to the Board staff, and perhaps also to our own staffs at the Banks, that they look at what would be involved to keep the PCE chain-weighted index, maybe not at the 21 percent that it has averaged over the last year, but I would be willing to say at 2-1/2 percent That would be consistent in my view with containing inflation It might be very interesting to see what the policy implications of that would be   It is not belts and suspenders One is a belt and the other is a raincoat [Laughter]   I think the history of the swap arrangements since the early 1980s indicates that there is no need for them Somewhat in answer to Governor Rivlin's concerns, it would seem to me that there may be political reasons for wanting to substitute something, but I think history has indicated that when it comes to the economic and financial considerations, a substitute mechanism really is not required In addition, the more recent experience that we have had, I think, is another item on the side of the ledger in support of the view that we do not need this type of arrangement So, without getting into what one perhaps should substitute or just add to it, I don't see where the case is at all strong that we need our swap lines   Do we need the swaps to do that?   Mike, revisions in the Greenbook forecasts prepared for recent meetings have been quite small But I think they have been in the direction of raising the rate of inflation and to some extent, I guess, the level of real GDP In light of that, could you comment on the likelihood that the slowdown during the forecast period will be enough to relieve inflationary pressures?   The change in the forecast in the last couple of meetings and some of the comments in Part I of the Greenbook, which I must admit I found striking, seem to suggest that you see the prospects of a more favorable outcome as probably lower now than you did at the time of the previous meeting or the meeting before that   I see Thank you   Mr Chairman, economic growth is strong in the Twelfth District In California, job growth picked up noticeably in the second quarter, and the unemployment rate fell about 1/2 percentage point In July, the California unemployment rate edged down further, and payroll jobs continued to expand at about the  -16-    8/20/96  second-quarter pace Economic activity in the State of Washington also is picking up as aircraft production rebounds and the software business continues to be good Job growth has continued to be strongest in Nevada, Utah, and Idaho In the second quarter, employment growth in these three states was about 7 percent at an annual rate, twice as fast as the accelerated 3-1/2 percent second- quarter pace for the nation Employment growth in Oregon and Arizona has continued in the 3 to 4 percent range, and we even have seen some improvement in our laggard state, Hawaii, where economic conditions were deteriorating until recently  For the national economy, the recent news is consistent with our forecast of a moderate slowdown in real output and employment during the second half of this year Thereafter, we expect real growth to stabilize at around 2 percent in 1997, although our projection is predicated on a slight tightening of policy over the forecast horizon However, the recent news is also consistent with our general assessment that the economy faces an acceleration of wage and price pressures We have reached levels of labor and capacity utilization that are inconsistent with steady inflation Indeed, we anticipate an acceleration of inflation in 1997 on the order of 1/4 to 1/2 percentage point in a wide variety of price and compensation measures Thank you   Mr Chairman, although the pace of economic activity seems to be slowing as expected, my best estimate is that the level of activity will remain somewhat above its long-run potential The economy's capacity and the effects of worker insecurity on wage pressures, of course, are subject to uncertainty In my opinion and that of the Greenbook, we face rising inflation The inflation increases projected by the staffs at our Bank and the Board imply that the current level of short-term rates will cause inflation to accelerate through the forecast horizon and beyond I am persuaded by this year's pickup in labor costs and the projected increase in all of the inflation indexes in the Greenbook Therefore, I believe it is prudent to raise the funds rate by at least 25 basis points   I would like to move! [Laughter]   Mike, the information coming from the employment data may be somewhat clearer than you have suggested in the sense that, while admittedly the unemployment rate number is questionable and the labor force has been very volatile with large declines, the nonfarm payroll message is very consistently strong and seems fairly reliable In addition, I have a feeling that we are going to have upward revisions in that area We have had such revisions in the last couple of years because the survey does not take into account, as well as it should, hiring by new businesses There was a big upward adjustment when the last revision was made, and I would expect to see another So, although I agree with your point about the ambiguity surrounding many of the numbers that have come out in recent weeks, when it comes to the production side, particularly employment, it seems to me that we do have very consistent strength    9/24/96   Mr Chairman, strong economic growth is continuing in the Twelfth District, although with some slowing in July from the very brisk second-quarter pace The California economy has performed very well in recent months, with annualized payroll employment growth averaging 34 percent during May through August Although Los Angeles county continues to be somewhat weak, other parts of southern California are gaining jobs and residents, with many of these coming from Los Angeles county The Washington State economy has accelerated further in recent months, spurred by rapid manufacturing job growth associated primarily with the resurgence at Boeing Payroll employment growth in most of the other District states is very strong, ranging from about 4 to 7 percent at an annual rate Slight recent slowing is reflected in decelerated manufacturing employment growth in the District boom states of Nevada, Utah, Oregon, Arizona, and Idaho The only exceptions to strong growth are Alaska  -12-    9/24/96  and Hawaii Alaska's growth has been slow in 1996, and Hawaii has actually lost jobs in recent months There are signs of increasing growth in average wages in several parts of the District The increases have been large and accelerating in Nevada and Utah, which one would expect, and they have occurred in the construction and trade sectors in addition to manufacturing Wage increases in other states mostly have been moderate There are signs of a slight pickup in California, although from relatively low rates  Turning to the national economy, production-side data, particularly employment as we discussed, have been quite strong lately On their own, they portray a robust economy However, on the spending side, consumption and retail sales have not been doing as well When this information is incorporated into the recently revised nonstructural model that we now use in San Francisco to forecast current quarter output growth, it produces a growth rate of 2 percent in the third quarter Combining this forecast with that from our structural model, we expect output growth in the 2 to 2-1/2 percent range in the second half of this year as well as in the first half of next year This forecast assumes that the recent slowdown in consumption spending is temporary If consumption spending fails to pick up, obviously output growth will be slower  To my mind, however, the growth forecast is simply icing on a cake that already has greater wage and price inflation baked in Even if growth comes in, say, 1/2 percentage point less in the second half of this year, we will still be left with a quite low unemployment rate of probably less than 5-1/2 percent Based on this, we anticipate an acceleration of inflation on the order of 1/4 to 1/2 percentage point in a wide variety of price and compensation measures during 1997  I realize that there is some uncertainty associated with this forecast For instance, the coefficients of the underlying Phillips curve are associated with sizable standard errors However, as far as I know, the Phillips curve is still the best model available to forecast inflation and our analysis suggests that the Phillips curve is basically on track With unemployment clearly below the natural rate, wages are accelerating and price pressures are building   This is going to be a little more difficult given what the Vice Chairman just said, but I would like to indicate that I think there are a number of different arguments that can be put  -32-    9/24/96  forward to make the case for raising rates, and I am going to argue in favor of doing that  My first and foremost concern involves the level of resource utilization in the economy The economy has been operating at a level somewhat above its long-term potential for some time now While I expect growth to slow, and I certainly indicated that is our forecast, I do not think that the slowdown will lead to a reduction in the gap between actual and potential output Indeed, the gap could well grow larger over the next few quarters At a minimum, it is safe to say that I do not see any reduction in inflationary pressures in the near term At this time, inflationary pressures are being masked by certain favorable developments, most notably the marked slowdown in the growth rate of health care costs In my view, we should be using this opportunity to lock in lower rates of inflation instead of using it to put off needed action on interest rates  Finally, we have talked at times about the level of the real funds rate While this rate does not appear to be low by historical standards, the data suggest that we are in a period of relatively high investment demand and perhaps a supply-driven expansion that implies higher equilibrium real interest rates In view of these considerations, I believe it would be prudent to raise interest rates 25 basis points at this meeting This may not be the last increase we will need unless the economy slows down more than I anticipate Thank you   Mike, one interesting aspect of the forecast is the strength of consumption PCE goes up 27 percent in 1997 I assume that one of the reasons is the strong growth of income--you have a strong 27 percent increase in real disposable income A bit of a puzzle to me is why there is such a difference between the growth of real disposable income and that of real GDP The 05 percent difference is greater than anything we have seen in the 1990s, and I do not know how far back one would have to go to see that kind of difference in the growth of those two measures   They push up real disposable income?   So maybe what one is using for the deflator shows up in disposable income versus GDP?   Okay   Mr Chairman, the Twelfth District economy expanded briskly in the first half of 1996, and it remained on track during the third quarter Growth in total payroll employment slowed only slightly between the second and third quarters, from 36 to 33 percent at an annual rate The District's performance this year is attributable largely to a strengthening in the State of California For example, growth in construction employment in that state has accelerated substantially since the first quarter The overall expansion has been stronger in northern California than in other parts of the state The northern region has benefitted from low    11/13/96  unemployment and a substantial recovery in housing values, factors that gradually are spreading to southern California The Washington State economy continues to benefit from stepped up production at Boeing Twelve-month gains in total employment in the state have increased from 1 percent at the start of the year to 31 percent in September Increased demand for manufactured products related to aircraft production also spilled over to Oregon and added to a third- quarter surge there The intermountain states--Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, and Utah--continued to post large year-over-year employment gains About the only weak part of the District is Hawaii, which showed a decline in jobs during the third quarter  Turning to the national economy, data released since we met in September caused us to lower our projections for near-term real GDP and, to a lesser extent, inflation in 1997 We now expect real GDP growth to fall below its 2 percent trend this quarter, in part because inventory investment should drop off following its strong increase in the third quarter At the same time, inflation in the ECI and the GDP-based price measures all came in below expectations Over a longer horizon, underlying inflation has shown a slight downward trend according to most measures despite the low unemployment rate  We have updated some earlier work that looked at conventional inflation equations incorporating historical relations among unemployment, inflation, and other variables These equations over- predicted inflation by a wide margin in the third quarter, and this noticeably intensified the more moderate pattern of overprediction that we have seen for some time As a result, we have lowered our forecast for CPI inflation in 1997 to just under 3 percent, in effect putting somewhat less weight on upward pressure from labor markets However, I still consider the risks for inflation to be on the up side because it is quite possible that the historical relationship with labor market conditions will begin to reassert itself Thank you   Mr Chairman, formulating policy under present circumstances obviously requires finding the right balance between likely future outcomes in the economy and recent developments Labor market conditions, as you have indicated, appear to be on the tight side Even if the natural rate of unemployment has decreased a bit, that tightness would suggest a moderate uptrend for inflation in the future And as I said earlier, we could see a substantial rise in inflation if the normal historical relationship between unemployment and inflation were to reassert itself These considerations make it likely that we will need to tighten policy in the future However, recent inflationary developments have been surprisingly favorable, and economic growth slowed in the third quarter and may slow further this quarter These developments suggest that it might be prudent to wait a while to see how things unfold before tightening policy On balance, therefore, I would prefer to leave the federal funds rate unchanged for the time being, and I support your recommendation for alternative "B" and asymmetric language  -33-    11/13/96   Mike, I have two questions The first deals with the PCE in the fourth quarter Based upon the data that we have, which of course include the PCE for October, retail sales for October and November, and what we are hearing about retail sales for the Christmas season, do you feel that this is consistent with a PCE growth rate in excess of 3 percent in the fourth quarter?   The second question relates to what I heard you say about the distribution around GDP numbers for the fourth quarter Based on the data you have seen, particularly the more recent data, would you, if you were to give us a new estimate, revise that estimate as well?   But probably up?   Thank you   Mr Chairman, relatively fast economic growth continued in the Twelfth District in recent months, making this a very good year in the West Almost 1/3 of the jobs added across the 50 states over the last year have been in the Twelfth District states As a matter of fact, the percentage growth in employment in our District states has been twice that of the other states In terms of year-over-year employment growth, the District's inter-mountain states of Nevada, Utah, Arizona, and Idaho have been the four fastest growing states in the country The 12-month pace of job gains in the inter- mountain West exceeded 4-1/2 percent Although employment growth has slowed a bit in recent months, it has maintained a healthy pace The  -11-    12/17/96  Pacific Northwest is the next fastest growing region in the country After the four inter-mountain states, Washington and Oregon rank fifth and sixth in terms of the underlying pace of job growth, which has been about 4 percent Employment growth recently picked up to this fast pace in Washington largely owing to the rebound at Boeing, although companies such as Microsoft are contributing as well  The sizable California economy is growing faster than the national pace, with employment in the state recently growing at a rate of about 3 percent Not all sectors have shared equally in the long- delayed California recovery, but we now see a pickup in some of the lagging sectors The state government budget situation finally has improved enough to allow the hiring of many needed public school teachers, and much additional hiring is expected next year In the residential real estate sector, sales, prices, and new construction were weak throughout the first half of the '90s but began to increase in 1996 in some areas of the state As a matter of fact, the Silicon Valley area surrounding San Jose is actually booming  Turning to the national economy, if the current stance of policy were maintained, I would envision the economy for 1997 as a whole growing at its trend rate as a result of several roughly offsetting positive and negative factors On the positive side, it does seem that exports should be boosted by the healthy growth of our trading partners, and spending on computers and related products most likely will continue to grow rapidly On the negative side, it appears that strong increases in consumer spending on real assets like housing and durables to satisfy pent-up demands has largely run its course Of course, fiscal policy will continue to be on the restrictive side With the economy slowing in the current quarter and then advancing at around its trend rate next year, we have scaled back our estimate of the level of resource utilization for 1997 Of course, judging resource utilization is particularly difficult right now, especially in labor markets My best estimate is that there probably will still be a slight degree of excess demand in the economy next year, which suggests that there will be only a very gradual upward trend in underlying inflation Our forecast shows core CPI rising from under 2-3/4 percent this year to close to 3 percent in 1998 In the longer-term context, our model simulations suggest that it actually would take a slight tightening of the stance of policy next year to make the inflation rate settle in at around 3 percent in future years However, it appears unlikely that a downward tilt to inflation, which I think would be desirable, would be forthcoming unless policy were tightened more substantially next year Thank you   Mr Chairman, our forecast suggests that it may be necessary sometime next year to tighten the stance of policy to impart some downward momentum to the underlying rate of inflation However, there would seem to be little or no reason to take action now At our Bank, we consult two monetary policy rules as a starting point for thinking about the appropriate stance of policy an estimated version of Taylor's rule and a nominal income growth rate rule Even if we assume a 2 percent target for core CPI inflation, both rules suggest that the funds rate should be left at about 5-1/4 percent at the present time, although when applied to our forecast they do suggest higher rates will be needed in the future In addition, it appears to us at least that there is considerable uncertainty at this time about the prospective strength of economic activity Therefore, I support the Bluebook alternative B, with a 5-1/4 percent funds rate and asymmetric language on the side of tightening   Mike, I had a question that is somewhat similar in terms of the  implications of the fourth-quarter number for, say, 1997 At the end of the fourth quarter, the  GDP gap was obviously a couple of tenths higher Are you saying that if you were to revise the  Greenbook forecast that the degree of resource utilization by the end of, say, 1997, would be  roughly what it is in the current forecast or that the gap would be larger roughly by an amount  equal to the difference between the fourth-quarter Greenbook forecast and the advance estimate  for the fourth quarter? I am not quite sure of the answer   Thank you, Mr Chairman Strong growth has continued in the  Twelfth District in recent months and the base of the expansion is broadening The recent trend  of growth has been robust in California despite some lack of cooperation from Mother Nature  Severe flooding in northern California destroyed a large number of homes and disrupted many  businesses But the extent of the recent losses is small relative to overall state income or to the  losses from some of the other natural disasters that have shaken the state in recent years  Property damages from the Loma Prieta and Northridge earthquakes were roughly three to five  times the damages from this year's flooding I might note that the damages from our recent  flooding in California were about the same as those from last year's flooding  In our other most populous states, growth has picked up a bit lately Employment  growth in Arizona and Oregon is averaging in the 4 to 5 percent range Job growth also moved  up to about 4 percent recently in Washington, reflecting hiring by Boeing to ramp up its  production in an effort to work down its huge backlog of domestic and export orders Several  types of nonresidential building activity also have picked up recently in the District, consistent  with the national strength that we saw in this category in the fourth-quarter GDP estimates For    2/4-5/97  example, we have seen a large recent pickup in office construction activity as the fundamentals  in that market have improved considerably in some of the District's fastest growing metropolitan  areas Office vacancy rates are particularly low in Seattle and in the San Francisco Bay Area  Turning to the national economy, the stronger-than-expected real GDP growth late last  year was related to an apparently temporary jump in exports That suggests that we should see  much more moderate growth this quarter Nonetheless, last quarter's surge still means that the  economy is operating at a higher level than seemed likely last month This puts additional  upward pressure on inflation The recent rise in the dollar and in long-term interest rates may  slow the economy's growth rate later this year However, we still would expect real GDP to rise  at or slightly above its trend growth rate this year if the funds rate were to remain at its present  level  With regard to inflation, we expect the CPI to rise by a bit under 3 percent this year  For the longer term, however, I continue to see a significant risk of an increase in underlying  inflation over the years ahead While judging resource utilization is difficult, the unemployment  and the capacity utilization rates taken together suggest that excess demand pressures are  building in the economy Even with a healthy dose of skepticism about estimates of resource  utilization, it appears unlikely that containing inflation, let alone reducing it which I certainly  would prefer, will be forthcoming without a tighter monetary policy in the future Thank you   I think that the Bluebook with these alternatives was very helpful this  time Certainly, it provided a great deal of information about some of the issues that were raised  in previous meetings and that we clearly are interested in Don, there is one thing that I wanted  to ask about chart 2 In calculating the real rate of interest, you used the PCE excluding energy  I know you cannot be completely comfortable with that measure because of the kind of real rates  that it produces, particularly at the present time The surveys, of course, indicate expectations of  about 3 percent inflation one year ahead Do you have any comments about some alternative  price measure that would be a better approach to real rates than this PCE measure? I ask because  I think that measure is very misleading?    2/4-5/97   Okay   I certainly support the recommendation for Bluebook alternative I and  basically for the reasons that have been mentioned It seems to me, and I would emphasize this,  that raising the ranges would cause unwarranted focus on the aggregates I am not confident at  this point that velocity is sufficiently stable to warrant a change in the ranges I also worry about  the possibility that an increase would be misinterpreted in terms of our resolve to achieve price  stability So, I strongly favor alternative I   Don, if I were to paraphrase one of the first sentences in your briefing,  it would say that the present stance of policy is too easy to contain inflation With that as a  background, I would like you to explain to me what opportunism calls for at this point  [Laughter] It seems to me that if your assertion is true and given the way opportunism was  explained to me earlier, under conditions where we see inflation as likely to rise, we would take  action I am a little confused Have we modified the definition of opportunism?   So, pursuing the current policy would require me as an opportunist to  say that I just do not buy the forecast?   There certainly is a danger in doing that   Thank you   Mr Chairman, the recent surge in economic activity has raised the  level of output, which already appeared to be above its long-run potential This has intensified  my concerns about the outlook for rising inflationary pressures, and I think it has provided a  stronger case for tightening policy Moreover, the two monetary policy rules we consult at our  Bank--one is an estimated version of Taylor's rule and the second is the nominal income growth  rate rule--both suggest the need for an increase in the funds rate this quarter Even if we accept a  3 percent target for core CPI, which I think is too high, these rules suggest that the funds rate  should be raised by 25 basis points or a bit more this quarter Of course, an inflation target of 2  percent, which I think is more appropriate, would involve stronger action In my view, it is time  to take an initial modest step in tightening policy, and therefore I would prefer a 25 basis point  increase in the funds rate to 5-1/2 percent   Mike, I was a little uncertain as to the wealth effects on consumer  spending in the Greenbook forecast I had the impression that there certainly was an impact  from higher equity prices in particular, but in the Monday staff briefing to the Board, you  seemed to be saying that there was not much of an effect Would you go into that a little,  please?   Thank you   I think it was useful to get those alternatives, but which of the  alternatives do you think would be most closely aligned with an opportunistic approach?   Mr Chairman, strong growth has continued in the Twelfth District  in recent months following large gains last year Although severe winter weather slightly  disrupted economic activity in January, we have seen indications of a large bounceback since  then In 1996, District payrolls expanded by about 3-1/2 percent Employment growth in  the fastest growing states--Nevada, Arizona, and Utah--currently is averaging between 4-1/2  and 7-1/2 percent I might note parenthetically that Utah is perhaps the state with the tightest  labor conditions in the entire nation; its unemployment rate is 32 percent I would also note  that if one wants to find slack labor conditions, I would like to recommend Alaska and  Hawaii, which were 49th and 50th in terms of employment growth, and you could also  choose a broad spectrum of weather as well [Laughter]  Revised data indicate that California's recovery accelerated throughout 1996  California payroll employment grew by 3 percent last year, well above the 23 percent rate  recorded in 1995 The rate of growth picked up in most areas of California last year, and  although severe winter weather held down employment in January, the February numbers  showed another large job gain The fastest growing sectors in California are high-tech  manufacturing, business services, and engineering management services, although other  sectors such as construction, trade, and real estate are growing steadily    3/25/97  Turning to the national economy, the concerns I had in February about the  inflation outlook have been intensified by recent developments Real GDP growth appears to  have turned in another strong performance this quarter following a rapid advance in the  fourth quarter The economy's surge in recent quarters means that it is operating at a  noticeably higher level than seemed likely only a few months ago While judging resource  utilization is difficult, the unemployment and the capacity utilization rates as well as  estimates of the GDP gap taken together suggest that excess demand pressures most likely  are building in the economy A number of factors, including the high dollar and tight fiscal  policy, seem likely to slow growth later this year However, I do not think the basic problem  of excess demand for resources is likely to be solved anytime soon with an unchanged funds  rate Therefore, I see a significant risk of an increase in underlying inflation in the years  ahead I emphasize the word "risk" because we have not actually seen signs of rising  inflation in the data This fact obviously raises uncertainty about the future For example, it  is difficult to judge the magnitude of possible roles for enhanced productivity and for  changes in the labor market in holding down inflation However, given the long lags in  monetary policy, we are left, I believe, with little choice but to use forecasts in gauging  policy My best judgment at this point is that even with the measurement improvements  being introduced by the BLS, the core CPI would still show a modest upward trend this year  and next if monetary policy remains unchanged Our forecast shows core CPI inflation of  around 2-3/4 percent in 1997 and 3 percent in 1998 compared to just 2-1/2 percent last year  I do not think we should risk an upward trend in inflation because, if it becomes established,  it would be costly to turn around Thank you   Mr Chairman, I should mention that the estimated Taylor Rule,  which we use as a policy reaction function in our forecasting model and which I think is  preferable to the original Taylor formulation, suggests a gradual rise in the funds rate totaling  about 100 basis points, with the increases beginning in the second quarter and continuing  through the end of this year The degree of tightening is very similar to the one assumed in  the tighter policy simulation in the Greenbook According to our analysis, a path like this for  the funds rate appears necessary just to hold the line at around 3 percent on core CPI  inflation It certainly is time to take an initial step in tightening policy While I think the  case for a 50 basis point increase is stronger than you do, Mr Chairman, I would support a  25 basis point increase to 5-1/2 percent I also would strongly prefer to have language in the  directive that is asymmetric toward further tightening since I think that course of action is  likely to be appropriate in the future It seems to me that there was very little, if any,  discussion around the table that would be consistent with a symmetric directive Thank you   Throughout this period, wasn't there evidence of a reduced appetite  for US securities by Japanese investors and some speculation that the Ministry of Finance  actually had played a role in this reduced appetite?   There will be data on that?   From the Republic of Texas [Laughter]   Mr Chairman, strong economic growth has continued in the  Twelfth Federal Reserve District in recent months, although the pace has slowed slightly in  some of the fastest growing states During the first quarter of 1997, District jobs expanded  by 3-1/2 percent at an annual rate In the fastest growing states--Nevada, Arizona, Utah, and  Oregon--growth is averaging between 3-1/2 and 7 percent With the exception of Alaska and  Hawaii, employment growth in the other District states is running at or above 3 percent  Construction and services continue to be the fastest growing sectors in the District economy,  but manufacturing is becoming a key contributor to the growth in District employment  Manufacturing employment grew by 3 percent at an annual rate during the first quarter, as  rapid expansion in high-tech and aircraft production was boosted by growth in food  processing and textile industries  Accompanying strong employment growth has been a recent surge in the District's  labor force In most states, labor force growth has been broad-based In California, however,  our estimates are that perhaps one-half of the new labor market entrants have transitioned  from welfare to work and are competing for a narrow range of low-skilled jobs Of the total  number of US welfare recipients who must leave the rolls before July of this year, over 38  percent are in California If all of these individuals move into the labor force, labor force  participation in California will increase by 1/2 percentage point  Despite rapid labor force growth, strong employment demand is creating tight  labor market conditions in several parts of the District The District-wide unemployment rate  has fallen by 1/2 percentage point over the past quarter, and in several areas in the District    5/20/97  competition for employees is so fierce that employers are holding job fairs and offering  finder's fees and signing bonuses to recruit new hires  Turning to the national economy, the risk that inflationary pressures are building  seems to me to have increased since our March meeting The economy's rapid growth in  recent quarters means that it is now operating at a noticeably higher level according to both  the unemployment rate and the estimated GDP gap The unemployment rate is now clearly  in the inflation danger zone even when we take into account the rather large standard errors  that characterize estimates of NAIRU, and the excess of real GDP over its potential level rose  to about 1-3/4 percent in the first quarter according to our estimate In addition, the  industrial capacity utilization rate is somewhat above the level at which inflation typically  has accelerated in the past  With these indicators presenting a fairly uniform picture of excessive pressure on  resources, I believe there is good reason to be worried about the trend of inflation in the  future Given this situation, the key question is whether real GDP is likely to slow enough  and for a long enough period of time to eliminate inflationary pressures Like the  Greenbook, our forecast for the current quarter shows a rather sharp slowing of growth; our  estimate is 2 percent for the current quarter It certainly would not be surprising to see such a  pause in activity following the torrid pace of the first quarter Looking to the second half of  the year, we expect growth to come in at around the trend rate of 2 percent This would still  leave the unemployment rate at just under 5 percent at the end of 1997  The bottom line is that it is unlikely that the basic problem of pressure on  resources would be solved anytime soon with an unchanged funds rate My best judgment at  this point is that underlying inflation would show a modest upward trend this year and next if    5/20/97  monetary policy remained unchanged Of course, when we look at the CPI, a good deal of  the upward trend would be obscured by the higher dollar and lower price of oil, not to  mention the methodological changes being introduced by the BLS As always, of course, we  should acknowledge that this forecast of rising underlying inflation could turn out to be  wrong for a number of reasons For example, it is difficult to judge the magnitude of  possible roles for enhanced productivity or changes in the labor market in holding down  inflation However, I believe that even with a slowdown in growth in the current quarter, the  risk of rising inflation in the future has increased to a serious level   Mr Chairman, for me the policy choice comes down to assessing  alternative risks It appears to me that the risk associated with raising the funds rate is  smaller than the risk of not raising it If we tighten policy and that action turns out to have  been unnecessary, we would slow the expansion a bit, but there would be relatively little risk  of a prolonged period of weakness If we do not raise the funds rate and the inflation rate  begins to show a clear upward trend, the long lags in policy mean that we could end up with  a problem on our hands  On the basis of these considerations, I would prefer to raise the funds rate by 25  basis points at this meeting However, since I do not see a possible pickup in inflation as  imminent, I am willing, somewhat reluctantly, to support a policy of no change in the funds  rate for the time being and asymmetric language even though I believe we are running the  risk of a larger rate increase later  Finally, I very much look forward to our next meeting and the opportunity for us  to reconsider our decision not to change the rate   With regard to the table in the middle of chart 5 showing output gaps,  could you give me the memo item for the United States, Mike? I assume it would be about 10    7/1-2/97  percent above potential for the fourth quarter of 1996 What was the fourth quarter of 1998 in  the Greenbook?   21 percent and 10 percent roughly for the fourth quarter 1996?   Okay With regard to my other question, it is obvious that what is  happening at Boeing has a big impact on BFI and also on the export number Are there any  limits on their ability to produce?   Of BFI?   Thank you   Mr Chairman, Twelfth District economic growth has been vigorous  thus far in 1997 Payroll employment expanded by 3 percent at an annual rate during the first  four months of the year and probably in May as well That rate is only slightly below last year's  pace The durable goods manufacturing sector has performed particularly well, as strong  demand has continued for high-tech products and for materials related to aircraft production  California's economy is fully on track, with the state currently ranking seventh  nationally in its pace of payroll job creation Los Angeles is now sharing fully in the state's  economic success Employment growth in LA County has accelerated substantially this year,  and the county's unemployment rate has declined about 1-1/2 percentage points over the past 12  months to 68 percent  Five other District states are ranked among the top seven nationally in their yearly  rates of payroll job creation After accelerating substantially last year, the Washington State  economy has settled into a solid growth path Although economic expansions in the fast growth  intermountain states and Oregon have slowed only slightly in 1997, those states remain on strong  growth paths with stable or declining unemployment rates Even Hawaii has shown signs this  year of reversing its several-year pattern of employment declines    7/1-2/97  Sustained and rapid expansion has caused rising inflation in many areas of the District  In the San Francisco Bay area, sharp acceleration in prices of services led to rising consumer  price inflation in 1996 and early 1997 Inflation in other strong growth areas of the District also  increased in 1996 and is likely to rise further this year  Turning to the national economy, recent data have confirmed that growth in economic  activity has slowed markedly, probably to a rate around 2 percent in the second quarter, which is  a little lower than the Greenbook projection Although our forecast shows growth picking up in  the second half of this year, it drops back to a more sustainable pace in 1998 I think there are a  number of factors restraining prospective growth, but the economy's rapid expansion over the  past year or so has left it operating at a noticeably higher level according to our traditional  measures of capacity such as the rate of unemployment, rates of capacity utilization, and the  GDP gap  These indicators provide good reasons to be concerned about the future trend of  inflation, and the lags in policy mean that we must be forward-looking In this regard, I am  concerned about the indications of excess demand for resources This situation raises two key  questions that are very difficult to resolve First, are our estimates of capacity accurate, and  second, given those capacity estimates, is the economy's growth likely to slow enough and for a  long enough period of time to eliminate any inflationary pressure that may exist? In balancing  these uncertainties, my best judgment is that underlying inflation will show an upward trend  For the GDP price index, our forecast indicates an increase of around 2-1/4 percent this year and  2-3/4 percent in 1998 Thank you   I don't have any questions either, just some comments I, too, think  this is a very good study, and it clearly is based on some first-rate empirical work I like the use    7/1-2/97  of the model-based simulations to illustrate the tradeoffs facing policy At least to me, these  simulations suggest that a flexible approach to pursuing price stability would not generate  excessive variability in output But more importantly, I believe that this study contains other  useful insights as well For one thing, it gives us a working definition of price stability  Measured in terms of the broad indices at least, a value of around 1 percent seems reasonable  Since inflation as measured by the broad indices is still rising at a rate of 2 to 2-1/2 percent, we  clearly are not at price stability, and this, of course, is a fact that is brought out in the Bluebook  as well Moreover, the study shows that it does not seem to matter which index we choose  Focusing on one broad price index rather than another is unlikely to make a significant  difference in the longer-term success of our policies, and I think the focus on the longer term is  appropriate Finally and perhaps most importantly, I would like the Committee to focus more  clearly on the pursuit of price stability, which will require that we address some of the other  issues raised in this study and also the list of issues that were in Dave Stockton's cover memo  Thank you   I have a feeling that Dave Stockton would not want to do that study  again! [Laughter]   Also with reference to Exhibit 3, it seems to me that developments in  the last couple of years clearly are encouraging If we focus on the bottom panel of the exhibit,  it also seems clear that velocity is continuing to change In particular, if one had run that  regression to include the forecast period, it would have produced a different velocity So, this  exhibit seems encouraging to me, but it also illustrates that it would be a mistake to assume that  velocity is now stable   Mr Chairman, I agree with your suggestion and support alternative I  It seems to me that M2 velocity is coming closer to stabilizing, but I don't think we have enough  evidence yet to put more weight on the aggregates at this time   I found the simulations on chart 4 of the Bluebook extremely  interesting I would like to ask a question about the opportunistic approach to monetary policy in  that chart I am sure that in a situation where you have an adverse supply shock or a positive  demand shock that causes a rise in the forecast of inflation, there is a very aggressive reaction in  terms of the opportunistic rule If one were to adjust that reaction to reflect more realistically  that policymakers might not have a symmetric objective function in terms of their willingness to    7/1-2/97  raise or lower interest rates, it seems to me that we could conceivably see the opportunism line  on the chart reach the long-run inflation objective even beyond the year 2030 When it looks as  though the model is forecasting increasing interest rates, I think it is almost human nature to  begin to question the forecast That may apply to all the policy strategy alternatives, but I think  it is more explicit in the opportunistic alternative   That's right   I see   Me, too   I think it could take us many hours of discussion to decide whether or  not we ought to include a reference to symmetry in the directive But I don't understand why it  would take us four hours to make the words clear We are merely saying it in English   I like the changes When we change the federal funds rate, we now  announce that following the meeting So, including the rate in the directive does not seem to me  to be much of a change I also like the clarity of the alternative wording suggested for symmetry  and asymmetry The only reservation I would have is that I think Jerry Jordan has raised an  interesting point    7/1-2/97   Mr Chairman, although a clear implication of both our forecast and  that of the Greenbook is that we will have to tighten policy soon, I am willing to support  Bluebook alternative B and asymmetric language   Ted, have you had any discussions either with the Peoples Bank of China  or the Hong Kong Monetary Authority about the political commitment to peg the Hong Kong  dollar? It would seem to me that there would be a lot of vulnerability associated with making any  change very soon   Mike, I wanted to ask you a question about inflation forecasts that in the  view of some have become particularly unreliable recently We did an exercise--an out-of-sample  forecast--that looked at the inflation forecast in our model As one would have expected, it turned  out that we were overestimating inflation, but the overestimate did not exceed the 90 percent    8/19/97  confidence level If we look back to, say, 1994-95 the errors actually were greater then and in the  other direction There were times, one in particular, when the 90 percent confidence level was  exceeded in the sense that inflation was so much understated My question is whether you  conclude in terms of your model that that relationship has broken down, or do you find in a  statistical sense that you cannot state that conclusion? We feel we cannot   It strikes me as interesting that if we wanted to make a point that we are  in some new era, we would not use these equations to support that conclusion   Mr Chairman, the Twelfth District's rapid economic expansion has  actually gained momentum in recent months Payroll employment grew by 32 percent at an annual  rate in the second quarter Growth in durable manufacturing employment accelerated between the  first and second quarters as Boeing's expansion combined with the continued strength in high-tech  industries and a recent resurgence in wood products industries Construction employment growth  also accelerated in the second quarter Districtwide, this sector expanded nearly 9 percent on an  annual basis during the first half of the year I might note parenthetically that in the last year  construction increased 92 percent in California, generating more than 46,000 jobs, and 149  percent in Nevada Normally, I would say that a percentage increase that large is unsustainable, but  when I discuss the Nevada economy, I do not use the word "unsustainable"  The second-quarter acceleration was evident in most District states Payroll employment  in each of the District's growth leaders--Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Washington, and Oregon--grew by  4 percent or more at an annual pace Furthermore, the unemployment rate has fallen this year in all  District states except Hawaii, and labor markets in virtually all major urban areas are extremely  tight  The impressive turnaround in California's economy has continued this year; payroll  employment grew nearly 3 percent at an annual rate during the first seven months of the year  Although the pace slowed in recent months, the state's unemployment rate continued to fall Other    8/19/97  California economic data also point to a continued rapid expansion Unexpectedly strong growth in  state income tax receipts recently led to a substantial upward revision in state government revenues  Also, the recovery in residential real estate markets has spread to most areas of the state, and  housing prices statewide are back on the rise  Turning to the national economy, recent data suggest that over the next year or so, real GDP  is likely to grow at a rate close to the 2-1/4 percent pace now reported for the second quarter Like  the Greenbook, I think underlying demand may be somewhat stronger than this in the near term,  but firms are likely to satisfy part of the demand out of inventories While the economy is not  likely to grow much faster than its trend rate over this period, conventional measures, as we all  know, suggest that it is already operating at relatively high levels of resource utilization Thus,  there is still a risk that inflation may trend upward in the future Of course, recent data on wages  and prices have been highly favorable and now actually show a modest downward trend While  part of this can be explained by factors such as the higher dollar, part remains unexplained by  conventional relationships Is inflation being held down by temporary factors such as unusually  small increases in benefit costs or higher worker insecurity or is the change of a more permanent  nature because it reflects developments such as an increase in trend productivity? Taking these  factors into account, my best judgment is that, while remaining low, underlying inflation is likely to  pick up a little over the next six quarters For instance, our forecast shows measures of core  inflation going up between 1/4 to 1/2 percentage point between this year and next Finally, I would  classify myself as an old paradigm, newly found optimist [Laughter]   I agree as well   Mike, the ECI forecast in the Greenbook has an increase of just a couple  of tenths over the forecast period There is reference in the Greenbook to the fact that the  increasing role of bonuses and other incentive payments may be having some influence in  moderating measured increases in employment costs You mentioned in your oral presentation that  medical premiums may be rising significantly We, too, hear a lot about the possibility that  medical premiums will be going up considerably in 1998 It seems to me that in your ECI forecast  there is almost an implicit flat-to-down path for wage and salary increases Do you think the risks  are fairly symmetrical in that forecast? Are there factors that I am not taking into account that  could moderate the increase in medical premiums? The latter seems likely to be very large   Thank you   Mr Chairman, economic growth has continued to display strength in the  Twelfth District in recent months Payroll employment grew by almost 3 percent at an annual rate  this summer The number of jobs expanded briskly in the construction, real estate, and local  government sectors in the District states that have fast-growing populations Total manufacturing  payrolls were boosted by the pickup in Washington State where we see a lot of growth in aerospace  employment This, of course, is the effect of Boeing's increased production as well as the effect of  that production on supplying industries However, aside from the aerospace industry, growth in  District manufacturing employment has slowed a bit recently Job gains have been most rapid in  Washington and Nevada where payrolls are expanding at about a 6 percent annual rate For  example, the competition for skilled workers has stiffened in the Seattle area where Boeing,  Microsoft, and other high-tech employers are expanding rapidly In the Las Vegas area,  construction of resort and other commercial projects continues to boom The pace of expansion in  California has remained strong in recent months, but it no longer appears to be accelerating  Payroll employment growth slowed to about a 2 percent average annual pace this summer, and that  is down from a 3 percent gain in the preceding 12 months    9/30/97  The national economy has continued to yield good news, as we have all seen Economic  activity appears to have turned in another strong performance in the third quarter and inflation has  fallen further Looking forward, I think there are a number of reasons to expect aggregate demand  to slow in the quarters ahead Inventories appear to be a bit on the high side as do stocks of most  other types of real assets held by businesses and households At its present level, the dollar is a  restraining influence, and fiscal policy certainly remains somewhat restrictive As a result, we  expect to see a slowdown in nominal GDP growth from 5-1/4 percent this year to about 4 percent in  1998, with real GDP expanding by about 2 percent next year However, I think there is upside risk  to the outcome for next year, given that the economy has surprised us on the strong side over the  past year or so and the possibility that a significant positive supply shock is affecting the economy  With regard to inflation, the roughly 2 percent increase in the GDP price index that I  expect for 1998 represents a relatively small rise over the 1-3/4 percent increase anticipated for this  year Of course, conventional measures of resource utilization suggest upward pressure on  inflation It is difficult, however, to know how much weight to put on these indicators While there  are reasons to be concerned about their reliability at present, it is too soon to tell if their historical  relationships with inflation have broken down Our analysis suggests that inflation forecasts in the  past two years based upon these relationships are within normal statistical bounds Even if we do  get some upward pressure on inflation from high resource utilization, there are other factors in our  forecast for 1998 that tend to restrain inflation at least temporarily These include negative speed  effects from the slowing growth of the economy and the high level of the dollar Thank you   Mr Chairman, given uncertainties about the magnitude of a possible  supply shock, I am somewhat more comfortable with data and forecasts of nominal GDP growth  than with forecasts of the split between real GDP growth and inflation Nominal GDP has grown  moderately over the past year and is projected to slow in both our forecast and the Greenbook I  think there is a reasonable chance that nominal GDP growth will slow, and such an outcome would  make it unlikely that a significant inflation problem would develop Therefore, I am willing to  leave the funds rate unchanged for now, and I can support Bluebook alternative B with asymmetric  language to the upside I do believe, however, that a strong case can be made to take out a small    9/30/97  insurance policy against the likelihood of higher future inflation, but delaying such a decision until,  for example, November is not likely to be the difference between success and failure   Peter, we do not have primary regulatory responsibility for the parents  of some of the primary dealers Do we have a dialogue with the primary dealers about century  date change compliance and is it an issue?   Also, there is the issue of foreign banks, which I think has become  more of an issue in recent months   Right   Would it be appropriate to have a discussion with the primary dealers  regarding their handling of century date compliance just as we would with banking institutions?   Okay   In the Greenbook forecast, the funds rate is kept constant through this  quarter and then begins to move up, rising 75 basis points by the middle of next year Was there  any thought as to how sensitive the forecast might be to this assumption, in view of recent  developments in Asia? In particular, if this path were embarked upon somewhat sooner than is  assumed in the Greenbook forecast, would you modify the response of the economy in light of  the possibility that it might generate some financial consequences that are not incorporated in the  forecast?   Mr Chairman, labor markets have remained quite tight in the Twelfth  Federal Reserve District in recent months, as employment growth has proceeded at a strong but  moderating pace The District unemployment rate fell about 1/2 percentage point in the first half  of the year and remained at this low level through September With the notable exception of  California, unemployment rates in most District states now are at lows not seen in several  decades Although California's unemployment rate is still high relative to those in other states, it  has been falling sharply and labor markets in some of the major metropolitan areas are very tight  Unemployment rates have fallen to new lows in San Diego and the San Francisco Bay area  Labor market conditions also have improved noticeably in the Los Angeles area, which until    11/12/97 46  recently had been experiencing a strong out-migration of people who lacked good job  opportunities there  For the District as a whole, although third-quarter employment growth was strong, the  rate of increase was about 1 percentage point lower than the very rapid pace in the first half of  1997 This includes California and Washington where the slowdown follows a pickup in growth  earlier in the year Moderation in growth rates in the intermountain states of Arizona, Nevada,  and Utah appears to be related to a slowing in population growth This is partly a result of fewer  new residents relocating from California Job growth has tapered off this year in the  population-oriented sectors of the economy such as residential construction and state and local  government  Recent data show that the national economy continues to perform well, with robust  output growth accompanied by low inflation Traditional models still predict that the economy  will grow at around a 2 percent rate next year, with the slowing based on factors such as high  stocks of real assets, the dollar's appreciation over the last year, and the relatively high level of  real interest rates The latter have been nudged up a little by recent declines in expected  inflation I agree that the turmoil in East Asia may contribute a bit to the growth slowdown, but I  think the contribution is unlikely to be large However, I believe there is plenty of room for  skepticism about whether a slowdown as big as that predicted by traditional models will occur,  especially when one takes into account the inability of these models to predict the robust  performance of the economy over the past year and a half It is possible that we are experiencing  the effects of a positive supply shock, which means that the uncertainty extends to predicting  inflation as well The recent moderation in inflation certainly is consistent with a positive supply    11/12/97 47  shock, and some market-based indicators provide room for optimism For example, the rate  spread between nominal and inflation-indexed bonds has now fallen below 2-1/2 percentage  points; we talked about that a little earlier But I believe recent data provide reason for concern  as well For instance, the unemployment rate has fallen even further below most estimates of the  natural rate This leads me to expect higher inflation, and both ECI and hourly earnings data  show that wages are beginning to move up somewhat In balancing these considerations, I  would expect the core CPI to rise about 2-1/2 percent in 1998 compared to about 2-1/4 percent  this year Thank you   Mr Chairman, some indicators show that the economy is experiencing  a positive supply shock For instance, despite the robust growth in real GDP, nominal GDP  growth since early 1996 has not been that much higher than its average since the end of the last  recession At the same time, other indicators such as the unemployment rate suggest that we  have overshot potential and risk a sustained increase in inflation I believe one way to balance    11/12/97 100  these conflicting signals is to look at the recommendation from a policy rule that takes into  account both risks in inflation and output behavior Our version of the estimated Taylor Rule  suggests that tightening policy by roughly 50 basis points by next quarter would be appropriate  Ordinarily, this would make me vote for an increase in rates as a form of insurance against rising  inflation, and it is very tempting to take that position today However, given the recent  instability in financial markets, I would be willing to wait a while before raising interest rates  Consequently, I support alternative "B" with asymmetry   A question about Yamaichi It was closed on the 23rd of November,  and I guess they ceased being a primary dealer on December 4th Could you talk a little about  what our financial relationships with them were just before the 23rd and then between the 23rd  and the 4th?   Yes   Ted, I have a question about China and Hong Kong In early 1994,  China abolished its official foreign exchange rate, and I guess that produced a depreciation of  about 40 percent in their currency That obviously had an adverse impact on the relative  competitive position of Southeast Asian countries The real appreciation of the Southeast Asian  and Chinese currencies since early 1994 and the problems in their banking systems led last  summer to depreciation of their currencies and related capital outflows We now have China's  relative position very adversely affected by foreign exchange developments What adjustment is  likely to occur in China and Hong Kong? China's currency is not convertible but I guess there  could be capital flight out of Hong Kong In fact, we could get a depreciation of both currencies  It seems to me there is the possibility of a rather significant adjustment in these areas, and we do  not seem to be focusing on that   It seems to me that, without getting into specific probabilities, if one  were constructing another worse case, Brazil would be an interesting dimension to add to it   Okay, thank you   Mr Chairman, the pace of economic growth in the Twelfth Federal  Reserve District remained solid in recent months, although down slightly from its trend during  the first half of the year Despite the slowdown, economic activity is expanding more rapidly in  most District states than in the nation as a whole Employment growth in the District continues  to outpace growth in the labor force, pushing unemployment rates down and creating very tight  labor markets, particularly in urban areas The District-wide unemployment rate fell nearly 1  percentage point over the last twelve months  The generally positive outlook in the District is tempered by reports of tight labor  markets, shipping bottlenecks, and recent problems in East Asia In several areas in the District,    12/16/97 24  competition for employees has become so fierce that employers reportedly are converting  temporary part-time jobs to permanent full-time jobs in an effort to attract workers Shipping  bottlenecks associated with the Union Pacific rail scheduling problems reportedly have caused  delays in deliveries of both final and intermediate goods, with the most affected sector  apparently being agriculture  Initial reports from District states indicate that recent developments in East Asia have  reduced the demand for exports of some commodities, primarily raw and processed agricultural  goods and lumber and wood products At this early stage, other vulnerable industries such as  high-tech equipment reportedly have not been greatly affected, although we recently heard that  Microsoft is talking about some weakness as a result of problems in Asia Data on merchandise  exports indicate that in percentage terms the Twelfth District exports about twice as much of its  estimated gross product to East Asia as does the United States as a whole Thus, the effects of  recent developments in East Asia on economic growth likely will be larger in the Twelfth  District than in the nation  Turning to the national economy, the data certainly indicate that real GDP growth  remains robust in the current quarter and that inflation continues subdued But traditional macro  models strongly suggest that growth will slow next year We expect real GDP growth of just  above 2 percent in 1998 Our pure model forecast actually showed a more pronounced  slowdown than this, but we boosted it a bit to reflect the effect of a possible favorable  productivity shock Just to mention very briefly a couple of the factors behind the projected  slowdown First, the dollar's appreciation over the last year and the projected slowing in foreign  demand in 1998 certainly should reduce demand for US products Of course, both of these    12/16/97 25  factors are being reinforced by recent developments in Asia In addition, real short-term interest  rates appear to have been nudged up by recent declines in expected inflation I must add,  however, that there is plenty of room for skepticism about whether a slowdown this big will  actually occur next year Traditional models have been incorrectly predicting slower growth for  the past year and a half As I mentioned, it is quite possible that economic activity is being  boosted to some extent by a positive productivity shock, but it is certainly too soon to tell how  much of an effect this factor may be having or how long it may last  With regard to inflation, we have reduced our forecast since the November meeting  Certainly, the continued appreciation of the dollar will help to hold down prices Secondly, the  results of the last Philadelphia Fed survey of inflation expectations were impressive The sizable  drop in long-term expectations provides an important confirmation of the evidence that we have  seen from the inflation-indexed Treasury bond market And third, recent productivity data have  been encouraging, and it may be reasonable to build in a modest reduction in future inflation  from faster productivity gains There is, of course, one major factor that goes in the opposite  direction The unemployment rate has continued to fall and is now well below the natural rate  Given all these considerations, we expect that price inflation will hold steady in 1998  and 1999 at about this year's rate At our last meeting, it seemed more likely that there would  be some upward tilt to inflation I must add, however, that the risk to this forecast may be  skewed to the upside If economic activity does not slow as much as we expect, labor markets  could tighten further and add upward pressure on inflation Thank you   Mr Chairman, in view of the situation in Asia, I certainly would  recommend against a change in rates at the present time So, I would support alternative B I  have a slight preference at this point for asymmetry because I do not think the distribution of  likely outcomes with regard to inflation is unbiased In my view, it is biased toward higher  inflation, but in the short run--at least in the very short run--it may be less biased than it was in  the past Therefore, I would not object to symmetry   That is a new policy?   Mike, I have a question about the ECI forecast I understand your  point about the fourth quarter of last year If we look at the trend of the ECI in your  forecast from the second quarter of last year to the first quarter of 1999, it seems unlikely  to me that we are going to continue to experience such a favorable trend First, it seems    2/3-4/98  to me that increases in medical costs are likely to be accelerating, and if that occurs your  forecast would imply slower increases in the wage and salary component of the ECI  Secondly, I think that bonuses and commissions, which clearly played a major role in  boosting the ECI in the fourth quarter of last year, may continue to play such a role in the  current quarter and maybe beyond That seems likely for real estate commissions in  particular I do not know how the BLS handles the seasonal adjustment of bonuses,  which sometimes are paid at the beginning of the year for tax reasons as opposed to the  end of the year I also think that inflation expectations could be a major factor, but how  those are actually formulated may be more complex because we anticipate improvement  in the core CPI due to technical factors To the extent that people are looking at what is  happening to actual prices, those factors may not be seen So, I guess I end up thinking  that this is one area where I have the greatest uncertainty   Mr Chairman, economic growth in the Twelfth District picked up  in recent months The pickup was broad-based and it occurred in most areas of the  District Payrolls expanded most quickly in the states of Utah, Nevada, and Arizona,  where employment growth accelerated to annual rates of 46, 66, and 95 percent  respectively in recent months Employment growth in California and Washington also  accelerated, rising above a 3 percent annual average pace during the last months of 1997  With the exceptions of Idaho, Alaska, and Hawaii, employment growth in the District  states was running above the national pace Employment growth in the District also  continues to outpace growth in the region's labor force, pushing unemployment rates  down and creating very tight labor markets, particularly in urban areas The District-wide  unemployment rate fell to 53 percent in November, a full percentage point lower than a  year earlier and the lowest it has been since March of 1990 In the District's fastest  growing states, unemployment rates have fallen to between 28 and 39 percent  Construction and services are the fastest growing sectors in the District but manufacturing  continues to be a key contributor to District employment Manufacturing employment  posted strong gains in recent months, spurred by rapid growth in high-tech and aircraft  production  The generally positive outlook in the District is tempered by reports of tight labor  conditions and uncertainties regarding developments in East Asia In several areas in the  District, employee shortages have begun to hamper plans to expand production Initial  reports from District states indicate that recent developments in East Asia have reduced    2/3-4/98  the demand for exports of some commodities, primarily raw and processed agricultural  goods and lumber and wood products At this early stage, other vulnerable industries,  such as high-tech equipment, reportedly have not been greatly affected  Developments in East Asia also are having some effect on business loan  conditions in the District In recent months, East Asian-owned branches and agencies,  which account for 20 percent of total business loans in the District, have tended to tighten  credit standards and terms on business loans, in part due to concerns about the capital  positions of their parents Reports also indicate that some commercial banks in the  District have tightened standards for nonbank affiliates and subsidiaries of East Asian  commercial firms That does not apply to Japanese firms Finally, reports indicate some  increase in credit demand by Japanese firms, in part because their other credit sources  have become less attractive or less available  Turning to the national outlook, there have been few surprises with regard to the  overall US economy since we met in December As expected, economic activity was  robust last quarter and inflation remains subdued Our outlook for 1998 is much the same  as it was in December We continue to think that at the current funds rate, growth in real  GDP is likely to slow to about 2 percent this year and price inflation is unlikely to change  much despite a pickup in wage inflation in our forecast However, it is obvious that there  is plenty of uncertainty in the outlook Traditional models have been incorrectly  predicting slower real GDP growth for the past year and a half Thus far, however, the  upside surprises have not been associated with rising price inflation It is likely that  economic activity is being boosted and inflation is being held back to some extent by a  positive productivity shock, but we do not know how much of an effect this factor will    2/3-4/98  have or how long it may last I would feel better about the long-run prospects for the  economy if economic activity were currently slowing to a rate that appeared to be  sustainable in the long run Given that we have yet to see such a slowdown, the risk to  my forecast would appear to be skewed to the upside for both output and inflation   Mr Chairman, I basically agree with the points made by Governor  Meyer and would favor alternative I It seems to me that the reasons for not changing the  ranges that we have cited in the past, some of which Governor Meyer mentioned, are  applicable today Eventually, it will make some sense to go to what is shown as  alternative III, but in view of the fact that debt is projected to increase at a faster rate in  1998 than it did in 1997, I don't think this is the best time to make that change   Mr Chairman, I certainly support the recommendation for leaving  the funds rate unchanged But I must admit that I am still impressed by the fact that we  do not see any signs whatsoever of a slowdown in the domestic expansion This  combined with the fact that we have such tight labor markets suggests to me that  asymmetry in the direction of higher rates is the proper position   Mike, I have two questions that are somewhat related The Greenbook  stresses that labor markets are very tight and that the tightness could lead to increases in real  compensation But increases in real wages in the Greenbook forecast actually decline in 1999  For example, the ECI decelerates by 5 percentage point relative to the CPI In fact, real wage  inflation may even be going down more than that if one believes that wage earners bargain in  terms of what they see on Main Street rather than what they read in the newspaper about the CPI,  which, of course, is affected by the technical adjustments Could you comment on why real  wages are decelerating in the forecast where you have the economy operating at such a high level  and with such little slack?    3/31/98   Related to a point that you made in your comments about the anecdotal  data pertaining to inflation and how they might be at variance with some of the published  statistics, might that be related to the fact that the anecdotal data reflect what people see? The  CPI certainly includes the effect of technical adjustments Might this discrepancy actually  increase over time because, as you show in the Greenbook, the technical adjustment to the core  CPI is probably going to be on the order of 6 percent in 1999? Of course, people do not see  that; they only read about it   They never see it except when they read about it   Thank you   Mr Chairman, Twelfth District economic growth accelerated in 1997,  led by a surging California economy We believe that the District economy entered 1998 with  considerable momentum Recently revised figures show that growth in California payroll  employment jumped to 38 percent in 1997, about a percentage point greater than in 1996 and  also a percentage point greater than the increase for the nation as a whole The pickup occurred  in most major sectors, but not surprisingly it was largest in the construction industry where  employment grew by over 11 percent Furthermore, we see that all areas of the State of  California shared in that surge The most pronounced acceleration occurred in Southern  California, led by San Diego and several counties that surround Los Angeles County Although  demographic factors held growth in Los Angeles below that of the rest of the state, the Los  Angeles economy did pick up substantially in 1997 Employment grew at a solid rate,  unemployment declined by nearly 1-1/2 percentage points, and the housing market improved  considerably  For the state as a whole in 1998, a weather-related pause in January employment  growth was followed by strong expansion in February, suggesting that California remains on or  close to the path that we saw in 1997 As the California economy continues to heat up, there are  signs of a shift in economic activity away from other states in the District Employment and  construction indicators generally showed that Nevada, Arizona, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and  Idaho all expanded less rapidly in 1997 than they did in 1996 Despite the gradual cooling trend  outside of California, the District as a whole remains on a stellar growth path    3/31/98  One development that we are watching carefully is the impact of conditions in  Southeast Asia, which certainly are having a moderating effect on District export sales of various  agricultural and manufactured products But the net impact on employment growth in our region  is quite limited to date  At the national level, the economy has once again shown surprising strength Indeed,  our monthly indicators model projects first-quarter real GDP growth well above the Greenbook  estimate It is in the low 4 percent range Some of this strength may be transitory, perhaps a  result of unusually warm weather If that turns out to be the case, then the robust expansion in  the first quarter may have little implication for the longer-run outlook because it may be the  result of some borrowing from the second quarter However, we think it is more likely that the  considerable momentum of the first quarter will carry forward The latest gains in disposable  income, which should support further purchases by households, are particularly impressive in  this regard Thus, at the current funds rate and even taking into account the fallout from East  Asia and a slowdown in inventory investment, we see real GDP growth remaining near potential  throughout the remaining quarters of 1998 Given our outlook for real growth, there is little  question that labor markets will remain very tight this year There is already significant upward  pressure on wages and salaries, and we see annual compensation growth increasing several  tenths this year and again next year However, as all of us have noted, the outlook for prices is  considerably more favorable than that for wages With falling import prices, lower prices for oil  and other commodities, as well as recent productivity enhancements and additions to capacity,  core price inflation probably should come in at a rate of around 2 percent This would certainly  represent further modest progress toward our objective of price stability    3/31/98  Looking beyond this year, it is uncertain in my view whether the special factors  moderating inflation will endure and whether our recent progress toward price stability can be  maintained Thank you   Mr Chairman, I certainly support your recommendation of no change  at the present time and I very enthusiastically support the move to asymmetry It seems to me  that the discussion strongly supports such a move    3131/98  I have a question It relates to my recollection that when we talked about how we  were going to handle the public announcement of a no-change decision, we discussed the  possibility of making a statement to accompany such an announcement If one thinks that  economic developments are moving in a direction where it is likely that a change in policy would  occur--say, at the next meeting--and given that you have stressed the importance of laying a  foundation for a policy change, the adoption of asymmetry clearly could lay a foundation But  under our current procedures the asymmetry is announced two days after the next meeting, so the  public is not put on notice on a timely basis I wonder if there is some virtue to making a  statement in our announcement about the strength of the economy   Mr Chairman, I can appreciate the viewpoint that Bill McDonough  expressed, and I can understand that there may be opportunities for you to lay that foundation It  is obvious that if we do not change our current procedure, then going to asymmetry does not  accomplish what we want Asymmetry would serve to alert the public only if a decision to  change our policy were delayed beyond the next meeting   I have two questions about your forecast, one about your new estimate  of the trend growth of productivity and the other about the outlook for inventories Could you say  something about the educational and job experience composition data that were referred to in  Monday's briefing by the Board staff and also in the Greenbook? The evidence must be    5/19/98  compelling because it seems to be the basis for your revision in the trend growth in productivity or  at least in the assumption that it is now 1/4 percentage point faster   On the inventory forecast, I think a distinguishing characteristic of the  Greenbook forecast, certainly for the current quarter and the following two quarters, is what  happens to inventories Given the expectation for the second quarter, shouldn't we be seeing more  signs of the projected deceleration at this point in terms of surveys, inventory-to-sales ratios, and so  forth? We are slightly beyond the middle of May, and the kind of runoff that is part of that forecast  is, I would use the word, "huge"   Thank you   Mr Chairman, economic activity has remained strong in the Twelfth  District in recent months We have seen particularly strong job growth in Arizona and Utah where  the rate of expansion has reached 4 percent Job growth in Washington State is running above 3  percent, and the local unemployment rate is falling rapidly With a tight Seattle area labor market,  Boeing aircraft recently announced a decision to shift some if its production to southern California  But the supply of available workers in southern California is dwindling too The Los Angeles area  unemployment rate has fallen almost a full percentage point over the past year to 5-1/2 percent  For California as a whole, employment growth remained solid in the first quarter of 1998, although  not quite as robust as it was in 1997 Growth was boosted by sectors such as construction that are  benefiting from low, longer-term interest rates  We do see some slowing in some manufacturing industries in California and other  District states, with exports diminishing and import competition from Asia picking up The volume  of cargo through the District's six major seaports--and of course two of those, Los Angeles and    5/19/98  Long Beach, are huge--showed a large rise in imports and a drop in exports in the first quarter  Employment in District computer and electronics industries has been weak in recent months and  additional job cutbacks have been announced In many cases, the high-tech firms that are cutting  back have lost market share to other domestic firms and are now making competitive adjustments  to cut costs I'm sure you've seen the list of these companies National Semiconductor, Silicon  Graphics, Syntax, Netscape, Apple, etc The adjustments have proceeded quite quickly, so it is  possible that this recent period of intense, competitive adjustments among domestic firms may be  nearly complete Even with these pressures restraining manufacturing employment in our region,  the overall District manufacturing sector still managed to add jobs at about a 2 percent rate in  recent months  In the national economy, the continued combination of strong economic growth and  low inflation in the first-quarter GDP report made it more likely that economic events are being  driven by favorable aggregate supply conditions Based on that experience, I am leery about  predicting even a modest slowdown in economic activity in the immediate future However, some  slowdown does seem to be the most plausible outcome We show real GDP growth of around 2-3/4  percent in the current quarter and also in the second half of this year The economy appears to be  experiencing modest contractionary effects stemming from the problems in East Asia In addition,  employment growth in March and April taken together recently provides a bit of evidence of a  slowdown  With regard to inflation, tight labor market conditions certainly represent the main  risk of inflation problems ahead The large recent drop in the unemployment rate has intensified  this risk a bit even though the rate may bounce back somewhat in coming months Fortunately, a  number of other factors have been holding inflation down including, as we know, ample    5/19/98  manufacturing capacity, some increase in productivity over the past year, a higher dollar, lower oil  prices, and diminished inflation expectations In light of these considerations, our forecast shows  core CPI inflation holding steady at just over 2 percent this year and next However, even if there  has been a positive supply shock, I doubt that recent economic growth rates are sustainable I  remain concerned that if real GDP growth does not slow soon, the effects of tight labor markets  will begin to show through to price inflation Thank you   Mr Chairman, I think there are good reasons that one could cite to  justify raising rates today However, for goods prices at least, a number of factors are offsetting  labor market pressures In addition, I think the recent declines that we have seen in inflation    5/19/98  expectations have raised the real funds rate to what appears to be a moderately high level In light  of that, it may make sense to wait a while longer before deciding to raise the funds rate I assume  that a "no change" decision would include an asymmetric directive Thank you   I have two questions about Japan First, I know that a program has  been proposed on the fiscal side, but a lot of forecasters assume that perhaps only one-quarter or    6/30-7/1/98  one-half of that involves actual economic stimulus What assumption has been made in the  Greenbook forecast? I hope it does not incorporate the announced program in full   With no water in it! My second question is how would you assess the  extent of a credit crunch in Japan at the present time? I know there is some debate about that  because banks obviously do not have an appetite to lend At the same time, we do not see some  of the typical characteristics of a credit crunch, notably rising interest rates Do you see this  playing a major role?   I would like to make a partial response to an issue that Jerry Jordan  raised about what type of policy Japan should pursue In the area of monetary policy, I think we  cannot talk about that very effectively until we have had our discussion of the last item on  today's agenda because I think theology may be required to answer what monetary policy is  appropriate in Japan   Mr Chairman, the pace of economic growth in the Twelfth District has  remained strong in recent months, and some of the tightness in local labor and housing markets  is showing through to wages and consumer prices In Arizona, the fastest growing state in the  nation, job growth has been running at more than a 4-1/2 percent annual rate Nevada and  Washington are not far behind with recent employment growth at a rapid 4 percent pace  Growth has slowed a little in California, which has been somewhat more affected than other  states by the drop in exports to Asia and the pickup in import competition The slight slowdown  largely has been confined to the state's manufacturing sector, and overall California job growth  still has been solid, about 3 percent at an annual rate Farther west in Hawaii, recent economic  developments have been decidedly more negative as the effects of reduced Asian visitor  spending have rippled through that island economy  Although the Asian situation has had disruptive effects on real activity in the Twelfth  District, consumers have been benefiting at least temporarily from the related declines in prices    6/30-7/1/98  of imports as well as the generally low prices of commodities However, we have seen some  recent pickup in price increases for nontraded goods and services Housing markets are tight in  the District, and the regional CPI has been boosted to a noticeable extent by an acceleration in its  housing shelter component For example, CPI housing shelter costs in the San Francisco Bay  area have jumped about 7 percent relative to a year earlier, and rents also are picking up in Los  Angeles In the Pacific Northwest, where a tight labor market has led to a pickup in wage  inflation, consumer prices for services other than housing also are increasing at a fast pace  Turning to the nation, we continue to see a divergence between our structural forecast  and the economy's actual performance On the one hand, our structural model continues to  predict slower growth Real GDP is projected to grow at a 2-1/2 percent rate in the second half of  this year and a less than 2 percent rate in 1999 The huge inventory buildup in the first quarter is  responsible for much of the near-term slowing currently predicted by the model Weakness  abroad also is an important reason for the slower growth More generally, the forecast of  demand is constrained by the relatively high level of the real short-term interest rate  On the other hand, incoming data continue to show a stronger-than-expected economy  Among the prominent recent examples are the employment and industrial production reports for  May Together with a rapid expansion of liquidity, these data suggest that there may be a  substantial upside risk to the forecast that calls for a marked slowing of growth Even in our  forecast of slower growth, the low unemployment rate will continue to exert upward pressure on  wages This pressure is offset by a number of factors including an increase in trend productivity  growth, diminished inflation expectations, the higher dollar, and increased price competition  from abroad As a consequence, our forecast shows core CPI staying between 2 and 2-1/2 percent  this year and next But I remain concerned that if growth does not slow as predicted, the effects    6/30-7/1/98  of even tighter labor markets will begin to show through to higher wages and inflation  expectations and ultimately to higher price inflation Thank you   I think this is a very interesting, useful, and important study I would  agree that it involves a very difficult subject to study, and all of us probably should spend a lot    6/30-7/1/98  more time with it I think Don Kohn hit on most of the quite interesting issues that I saw in the  paper I found the one about taking more vigorous or aggressive action a fairly significant point  If we are operating under a Taylor Rule, I guess in effect what we are envisioning is that we have  higher coefficients on the two gaps that cause policy to move more aggressively It may also  cause policy to move in a more preemptive way, which we can do even under a Taylor Rule if  we have forecasting So, I think that is interesting  The other interesting point relates to what may be, at least in terms of these models,  the advantage of setting a goal that is a little above zero The simulations seem to suggest that if  we have 1 to 2 percent inflation as our goal, we would run into the zero bound constraint very  few times Again, this is in terms of the simulations in those models, but I think it's a quite  interesting result I frankly did find some of the alternative policy options interesting, in  particular the "put" option to bring long-term interest rates down; perhaps it does have some  practical relevance to real world situations  I want to make a couple of additional points, which may be related to some that Bill  Poole brought up It seems to me that a deflation with zero interest rates is somewhat similar in  effect to a break in history in the sense that we have estimated a Keynesian model over a period  of history where we really have not had this basic condition So, it may not be all that strange  that the results are not particularly satisfying, as often would be the case if we had a break in  history  It also is conceivable, although I basically buy the Keynesian approach, that we may  have regime shifts at different points In hyperinflation we may have a different regime than we  would at zero inflation Although I know you looked at some different models, they did not  seem to me to involve complete regime shifts    6/30-7/1/98  The third point is that I would like to see somebody, maybe Bill Poole, give the  monetarists' explanation I have seen an article where Friedman has offered some comments on  this issue After all, not everybody in this world believes that we should focus solely on interest  rates and therefore that central bank purchases of securities do not accomplish anything when we  are at zero interest rates They do increase the monetary base, and if one believes that quantities  are what is important, that can have an impact I would like to see other viewpoints, which we  could get in a conference I don't think it has to be a forum the Committee would necessarily  endorse, but we should try to get the views of other people who have thought long and hard  about these issues over the years This staff paper is a good work, but I think it is a good work in  a particular religion We might look at a few other religions   Mr Chairman, I agree with your comments about the ranges I, too,  would not want to choose the ranges on the basis of a projection that is consistent with a forecast  I would prefer to set them on a basis that is consistent with price stability I would suggest,  though, that that approach might strongly support the choice of alternative III because all the  ranges in that alternative, including the 1 to 5 percent range for debt, are intended to be  consistent with price stability As it turns out, the projection for debt suggests that this might be  a good time to make the change   I'm not sure I understand what you mean by "weakening of monetary  policy"    6/30-7/1/98   But if you are reducing the range, that is the opposite of weakening   Oh, I see   Yes, just the debt range No change to the other ranges   I see   Mr Chairman, for many of the reasons you mentioned, I agree with  your recommendation both with regard to the federal funds rate and the asymmetry It does  seem to me, however, that inflation is becoming a more serious problem My greatest fear is that  we may be losing the relatively painless gains in inflation we have enjoyed over the last year or  so To me that loss would be tragic I still agree, though, with your recommendation   I had a question for Don Kohn before making a comment Don, you  referred to occasions when we did not change policy but saw a possibility that we would do so in  the next week or so after the meeting depending on the incoming data How did that affect our  wording of the directive? Do you recall?   I cannot remember either Let me make a few comments There have  been some interesting points made with regard to reasons why we might not want to announce  changes in the tilt But I believe there are some advantages to making an announcement when  we change the tilt as well as when we change the funds rate itself Announcing decisions    6/30-7/1/98  concerning the tilt would in my view provide additional information to the markets that would  enable them to function more efficiently We have talked in the past about conditioning the  markets This is a very effective tool for doing that Otherwise, we sometimes have to depend  on the timing of testimony or speeches that are going to be given by the Chairman This is a  simple way to accomplish the same thing  I also think these announcements would cut down on leaks We have had problems  with leaks associated with the tilt Announcing changes in the latter would make the decisions to  change it more meaningful because in effect the tilt would become an additional instrument of  policy I see that as a good thing, not a bad thing as Governor Kelley implied There are times  when there does not seem to be agreement or a clear consensus about what a particular decision  about the tilt actually means That is obvious It seems to me that making a public  announcement would require more clarity within the Committee as to what it means, and that  could be a positive development  I also believe that on occasion the availability of an unannounced tilt has provided a  way for us to defer making tough decisions about policy actions that should be taken I do worry  a little that a policy of regular announcements could cause us not to use the tilt, but it doesn't  have to turn out that way One approach that I have been thinking about is that the  announcement could actually be the entire directive rather than just the operating paragraph, but  I haven't thought enough about that It seems to me that the full directive, while it may not be  Shakespeare, provides a little more information that would be of interest to the markets   Mr Chairman, I have two questions Ted, when I went to Asia in June  one of the comments that I heard, particularly in Korea, was that a lot of exporters were facing  tremendous difficulties in getting financing to support their businesses More recently, there have  been discussions about a shortage of shipping containers and the need actually to build them in  Asia The reason I guess is that most of the containers are in the United States at this point Do    8/18/98  you think these developments are major factors affecting Asian exports to the United States? If  these two problems were to be dealt with, would that lead to a significant increase in our imports  from Asia?   Thank you Mike, I thought the staff survey on recent trends in  compensation practices produced some interesting results, as did the related discussion of the  ECI One thing that struck me is that variable compensation practices clearly have become much    8/18/98  more significant for many firms in different industries In the past, at least when we had an  economic slowdown, sticky wages were an important automatic stabilizer Have you done any  analysis that can give us some insight into how the more flexible compensation practices will in  fact affect total compensation when the US economy goes into a slowdown and what the effects  on spending might be? I ask because it appears that we will be facing a different situation from  what we have experienced in the past   There certainly are a lot of studies that suggest that the marginal  propensity to consume would be lower if variable incomes were expected to regress to Friedman's  original permanent income levels   Thank you   Mr Chairman, the Twelfth District economy expanded at a strong pace  during the first half of 1998 Payroll employment grew by 29 percent at an annual rate,  noticeably above the pace of growth in the rest of the United States Among District states,  growth has been most rapid in Arizona, Nevada, and Washington during recent months Vigorous  construction and real estate market activity has helped to maintain the District's expansion  Construction jobs have grown at a sizzling pace in California and Nevada this year, and  construction activity remains at high levels in most parts of the District Although District growth  has outpaced the nation's this year, it has been slower than in 1997 Oregon, Utah, and Idaho  have cooled the most, and employment was flat or down slightly in the second quarter in those  states Employment growth also is moderating in California this year Among sectors, slower  growth has been most evident in durables manufacturing  This slowing is consistent with what might be expected from the restraining effects of  the East Asian financial and economic problems Data for the first five months of 1998 compared  with the same period in 1997 show that growth in total District exports has fallen essentially to  zero following substantial growth in previous years This slowdown appears to be almost entirely  attributable to East Asia For example, in the first quarter of this year, California's exports to key  East Asian countries were down about 13 percent compared to a year earlier Exports have  slowed substantially throughout the District, and Hawaii's struggling economy has been hit hard  by additional losses in their Asian tourist business this year Although these effects may grow as  the year progresses, the problems in East Asia have not derailed the District's expansion so far    8/18/98  Turning to the nation, it remains to be seen whether the long awaited slowdown will be  sustained during the second half because a good deal of the slowdown was due to temporary  factors Despite these doubts, I think that the most likely outcome is moderate growth of around 2  percent through the end of next year, with activity being restrained by problems in East Asian  economies, the high dollar, restrictive fiscal policy, and relatively high real short-term interest  rates The recent drop in our stock market adds another potentially moderating factor  The news on inflation certainly continues to be outstanding The GDP price index  came in under 1 percent for the second straight quarter and, as we all know, inflation as measured  by that index has averaged only 1 percent over the past year In our Bank forecast, the  unemployment rate does not quite reach 5 percent by the end of 1999 This low rate perpetuates  the acceleration in the ECI that we have seen over the past year However, I expect this pressure  on price inflation to be offset by diminished inflation expectations, the higher value of the dollar,  ample industrial capacity, falling commodity prices, and somewhat higher trend productivity  growth As a consequence, our forecast shows CPI inflation staying between 2 and 2-1/4 percent for  the remainder of this year and next Thank you   Mr Chairman, I also support your recommendation for "B" I agree that  the risks are greater than they were at the time of our previous meeting, and I think there has been  some shift toward the downside So, I would favor moving toward symmetry I would suggest,  though, that it is a little unfortunate that we will be releasing information on Thursday that is not  going to be consistent with this proposal I hope that we will be coming back to the discussion on  disclosure with Don Kohn at a later point   I know   Mr Chairman, this is Bob Parry I definitely support, in fact I strongly  support, your suggestion It seems to me that it makes a great deal of sense for us to move at the  upcoming meeting I see that as a fairly riskless insurance policy that we can take out In addition,  I agree that moving before the meeting would perhaps convey an undesirable sense of panic At the  same time, I am sure that there are statements that you could make in your testimony that would be  helpful leading up to the meeting So I strongly support your recommendation   I basically support what the three Presidents who preceded me said  about making a prompt announcement, and I would release the operational paragraph when we  change the tilt I have to say that I find the language in Option 2 relating to the tilt to be  somewhat preferable to that in Option 1, though both certainly are better than what we have    9/29/98  today Option 2, it seems to me, captures the essential element of asymmetry in that it refers to  the likelihood that we will move policy in one direction rather than the other, and I think that is  highly desirable What I like about Option 1 is the reference to the long-run goals So, some  combination of Options 1 and 2 would be my preference   I have a question for Peter Fisher or Don Kohn on a somewhat  different issue The spread between 10-year Treasury bonds and the inflation-indexed bond has  narrowed very significantly I think it has narrowed to a little over 1 percent That is amazing  when we consider that the spread presumably includes the effects of expected inflation and  inflation risk Is that due to a lack of liquidity in the inflation-indexed bond, and if it is, why  hasn't the market been selling the 10-year issue and buying the indexed bond in an effort to  reestablish a more sensible relationship?   That was my question!   When can we do that? After the end of the meeting? [Laughter]   I have two questions Ted, it seems to me that our international  assumptions are now fairly close to the worse case scenario that was presented to us last year in  terms of the real impact on the economy Would it make sense to think in terms of a worse case  again, and what would be its probability? Do you have any thoughts about where the risks are in  terms of such a forecast?   Sure   I have a question for Dave Stockton The assumption in the forecast is  that the saving rate remains basically constant at one half percent That seems a little surprising  given what happens to the equity market and particularly with the coefficient that you have in  terms of net worth I presume that what is happening is that the weakness in the equity market is  being offset by such things as lower interest rates, which stimulate consumption Would you  say that your forecast that the saving rate will not be moving up as a result of the assumed  decline in the stock market might be a downside risk to the outlook?   I see   Thank you   Mr Chairman, solid overall economic growth continued in the Twelfth  District in recent months, although the pace slowed from earlier in the year Between June and  August, District payrolls expanded by 23 percent at an annual rate, down from the 3 percent  pace of the first half of the year Construction and services as well as finance, insurance, and    9/29/98  real estate continued to grow rapidly in recent months However, the District's manufacturing  sector has not fared as well Reduced export demand and a more general slowdown in high-tech  manufacturing have led to a significant weakening overall in manufacturing District  manufacturing employment has contracted slightly so far this year after rising 37 percent in  1997 The deceleration in manufacturing has been concentrated in California, with  manufacturing employment falling 1/2 percent so far this year While many sectors of  California's manufacturing have slowed in 1998, producers of high-tech products have been  particularly hard hit However, employment growth in high-tech software and business services  remains strong  Turning to the nation, the outlook for economic activity has deteriorated since we met  in August largely because of a continued decline in our stock market and a worsening outlook for  growth in the rest of the world Under the assumptions of an unchanged federal funds rate and  no further change in the stock market, we have lowered our forecast for real GDP growth for the  remainder of this year and 1999 by 1/2 percentage point to only 1-1/2 percent I actually see risks  on both sides of this forecast On the upside, the economy has consistently outperformed most  forecasts for the past three years On the downside, of course, the stock market is still  overvalued according to most models In addition, it is possible that the expected economic  performance of the rest of the world could be even worse than we all have been forecasting and,  of course, we cannot rule out future shocks in financial markets Real GDP growth in the  neighborhood of our forecast, we believe, would help to ease tight labor markets, and this would  reduce the risk of higher inflation in the future Under our forecast, upward pressures from labor  markets would moderate over the next couple of years Moreover, any pressures from this  source most likely would be offset by diminished inflation expectations, the higher dollar, ample  industrial capacity, falling commodity prices, somewhat higher trend productivity growth, and    9/29/98  negative speed effects as the economy slows As a consequence, our forecast shows inflation as  measured by the core CPI falling from 2-1/4 percent this year to about 2 percent in 1999, and then  going below 2 percent in 2000 Overall, since we met in August the risks of higher inflation  have receded, while the downside risks for the real economy have increased noticeably   Mr Chairman, I support a 1/4 point reduction in the funds rate I also  think the current situation may require more than one 25 basis point cut in the funds rate in the  future, and therefore I would prefer a directive with asymmetry toward ease   Did this program produce a default of any loan?   Then how can the investments be a part of DPC [debt previously  contracted], Virgil?   Mr Chairman, this is Bob Parry   Mr Chairman, I have two questions One, we have seen some spillover  from LTCM to DE Shaw and others Bill, is there anything else related to that? Secondly, it is  my understanding that in some instances LTCM has been one to two days late on margin calls  and this, of course, would raise the possibility that somebody would take legal action against  LTCM because it was in default on a particular loan Do you have any comments on either of  these points?   I see   Thank you Do we know anything beyond either the incident involving  B&A and Shaw and what I guess has affected a couple of other banks? Is there anything else in  that area?   Thank you   That must be Boston because I can hear the Chairman here in San  Francisco   Mr Chairman, this is Bob Parry   We recently have had an advisory council meeting and a meeting of our  board of directors, and I would have to say that, as I see them, the numbers relating to the  performance of the District economy have not changed at all However, there has been a definite  increase in uncertainty and concern, particularly about financial prospects We also heard reports  that, for example, in the commercial real estate area some deals were being delayed but  eventually getting done I guess at this point I can not point to any specific changes that would  indicate that economic prospects have weakened, although with all of the concerns expressed  about financial developments, I would have to believe that there's going to be an impact on  investment decisions    10/15/98   Mr Chairman, this is Bob Parry I would not object to your  recommendation with regard to the funds rate With regard to the discount rate, we at our Bank  have been recommending to our directors that they request a reduction in the discount rate, which  as you know they have done So I could not very well object to a cut in the discount rate either    10/15/98   Mr Chairman, I prefer Option 2, and I would like to remove that third  sentence because I, too, believe it is redundant It seems to me, though, that both Options 2 and  3 are a tremendous improvement over the wording we have been using in recent years   Mr Chairman, I forgot to note that if we do eliminate that sentence,  there is in my view an advantage to referring to "the federal funds rate operating objective"  instead of just to the "federal funds rate" The former is really what we deal with   Karen, I think it was a little more than a year ago that we looked at a  worse case alternative for East Asia One of the two countries that played a role in that was  Brazil, and it is obvious from our discussion why that was the case The other one, of course,  was China It seems to me that there are interesting things going on in China about which it  might be worthwhile to update the Committee either at our next meeting or even as part of one of  the Monday morning briefings China's growth rate, at 8 percent at least by the official statistics,  is remarkably good Their external position is quite strong Yet at the same time, one does see  some financial problems with the ITICs in some of the provinces Of course, they are  experiencing actual deflation, which might suggest that the renminbi is overvalued I would find  it interesting, and perhaps some of my colleagues would as well, to know what your latest    11/17/98  thoughts are about either why they have been so successful in dealing with the problems of East  Asia or whether we, in looking at the official statistics, are being deluded by what might indeed  be the pressures in China   Of course, their approach to the problems is quite different with  exchange controls and so forth   Thank you   Mr Chairman, the Twelfth District economy has expanded at a solid  pace in recent months, although the disparity across states has increased and the pace of growth  has moderated from earlier this year Employment growth in our fastest growing states, Arizona,  Nevada, and Washington, is averaging between 3 and 5 percent on a 12-month basis It is  interesting that the State of Washington is also the state that probably is among the most  vulnerable to developments in East Asia in terms of trade Five other District states, Alaska,  Idaho, Hawaii, Oregon, and Utah, are expanding at or below the national pace of growth In  California, employment growth remains solid at 28 percent, although it is significantly slower  than the 38 percent pace of expansion in 1997  Construction and services as well as finance, insurance, and real estate have continued  to be the strongest sectors of the District economy Slower overall growth has yet to loosen    11/17/98  District labor markets significantly District unemployment in September was just 01  percentage point above the average for 1997  Returning to California, the East Asian economic slowdown has reduced employment  growth throughout the state, but its impact has varied significantly across regions Strong trade  ties to East Asia, especially in the high-tech manufacturing area, have pushed employment  growth in the San Francisco Bay area below that for the state as a whole for the first time in three  years In contrast, the more diversified southern California economy has remained relatively  immune to global economic turmoil, with little deceleration in growth from last year The  changing pattern of growth in California is helping to equalize the levels of economic activity in  the Bay Area and Southern California following the deep recession and slow recovery in the Los  Angeles/Long Beach Area  Turning to the nation, we believe the outlook for economic activity has improved  since the Committee met in September largely because of the easing of monetary policy, the  decline in the value of the dollar, and increases in US stock prices Under the assumptions of  an unchanged federal funds rate and no further changes in the stock market or the dollar, we have  raised our forecast of real GDP for 1999 by about 1/2 percent to 2 percent I see risks on both  sides of this forecast On the upside, growth in the economy has outperformed most forecasts for  the past three years, and this certainly could continue On the downside, the stock market is still  overvalued according to most models, and although US debt markets have stabilized somewhat  in recent weeks, risk spreads are still elevated, and confidence remains vulnerable There  obviously are still many risks in the international arena as well  Under our forecast, there is continuing upward pressure from tight labor markets on  wage and price inflation next year, although the magnitude of this effect diminishes over time as    11/17/98  the unemployment rate rises However, price inflation continues to benefit from low inflation  expectations, ample industrial capacity, falling commodity prices, higher trend growth in  productivity, and negative speed effects as the economy slows As a consequence, we expect  inflation in the core CPI to average 2-1/4 percent both this year and next, and that is using a  consistent definition for the CPI Overall, if we assume an unchanged monetary policy, our  projections show a constructive outlook for the economy with moderate real GDP growth and  moderate inflation as well Thank you   Mr Chairman, I would prefer to leave the funds rate unchanged at the  present time for a couple of reasons First, despite the forecast to the contrary, the economy  continued to show some strength in the third quarter, and the few available monthly data that we  have for the current quarter indicate solid growth Second, I believe that the chance of a  recession or major slowdown in the economy in the quarters ahead has been significantly  reduced by recent financial developments, including the two federal funds rate cuts I recognize  that prospects for our economy could change rather suddenly given the continuing vulnerability  of our financial markets and of many foreign economies While this could require another    11/17/98  change in policy in the near future, I would prefer to retain the 5 percent funds rate for now along  with the asymmetry toward easing   Mr Chairman, I have a comment and a question First the comment  Karen, I would like to thank you for the memo on China that was done by John Fernald It was  very responsive to the questions I raised at the last meeting and also provided a lot of good  information It explained why China has performed better over this period, particularly since  July of 1997 If any of my colleagues have not had an opportunity to read the memo, I would  highly recommend it  Second, in Part II of the Greenbook there was reference to an attempt by Boeing to  make a lot of deliveries in the month of December My recollection from the past has been that  at times that has had impacts both on production and certainly on the composition of GDP,  particularly if a lot of those deliveries were to foreign buyers Can you tell me what some of the  effects of that are likely to be and if they are included in the fourth-quarter numbers?    12/22/98   So they end up in inventory?   Right   They are one of the few companies where a change in their sales can  show up in the GDP numbers   Thank you   Mr Chairman, economic activity in the Twelfth District has expanded  at a solid pace in recent months, and our business contacts are less downbeat concerning growth  prospects than they were during the summer and early fall Total payroll employment has grown  by 26 percent at an annual rate since midyear, above the 2 percent rate of growth in the rest of  the country California's expansion remains on track, and growth in the San Francisco Bay area  picked up recently after slowing earlier in the year Growth is rapid in several other states, with  Nevada and Arizona ranked first and third in the national employment growth ranking  Construction activity in the District has been robust Construction employment has  grown rapidly all year, largely due to strong demand for new homes Although nonresidential  construction plans have fallen a bit in the District this year, conditions in commercial real estate    12/22/98 22  markets remain healthy, with low office vacancy rates in most areas of the District and only  limited effects of the year's turmoil in the market for commercial real estate finance  The ongoing slowdown in manufacturing is the weak spot in the District economy  After earlier gains that far outstripped the national pace, employment in District manufacturing  has fallen since the first quarter The role of East Asia has been critical For example, the  declines in California's exports to East Asia have worsened as the year has progressed Relative  to the same periods a year ago, California exports to East Asia in 1998 fell 127 percent in the  first quarter, 175 percent in the first half, and 206 percent in the first nine months Moreover,  the employment situation at Boeing has exerted a moderating influence on the Washington State  economy This restraint will become more pronounced as Boeing implements a 20 percent cut in  its workforce during the next two years The impact on Boeing and its suppliers in the Los  Angeles area already is evident in the loss of nearly 1,500 aircraft manufacturing jobs so far this  year  On the national front, just three months ago it appeared that the chance of a US  recession, or at least a major slowdown, was uncomfortably high This prospect, in my view,  had shrunk noticeably by our November meeting and has fallen further since then Although the  economy faces substantial risks, the most likely outcome over the next year appears favorable  Recent data on economic activity in the third and fourth quarters have continued to follow the  pattern of surprisingly strong output growth and low inflation that we've seen for about three  years  In addition to this factor, the outlook has improved since November because of our  most recent funds rate cut, the better-than-expected economic performance in the rest of the  world in the second half of this year, and the rebound in the stock market Our forecast for real    12/22/98 23  GDP growth in 1999 has been revised up by 3/4 percentage point to 2-3/4 percent under the  assumption of no further change in either the funds rate or the US stock market We expect  inflation to hold steady next year despite upward pressure from tight labor markets The familiar  list of favorable inflation factors seems likely to apply robust productivity growth, ample  industrial capacity, low commodity prices, and subdued inflation expectations Overall, we  expect inflation in the core CPI to come in at around 2-1/4 percent in 1999  Although the most likely outcome for the economy next year appears favorable, the  risks are large The potential problems stemming from fragility in many Asian and Latin  American economies as well as in international and domestic financial markets are obvious But  on the other side, the pattern of positive surprises in our economy could continue, especially in  light of the very rapid growth in money and credit this year Thank you   Mr Chairman, I believe our easing of policy and the associated stock  market rebound have significantly reduced the chance of recession or a major slowdown over the  next year or so, and for now I think we should leave the funds rate at 4-3/4 percent Although I  believe the upside risks to growth, at least in terms of the rate of growth forecast in the  Greenbook, are greater than those to the downside, I can support a symmetric directive for this  meeting Do you want comments on the options?   Okay That's all I have for now   In option 3 I would take out "in coming months" for the same reason  that President Moskow indicated I also have a preference for removing the last sentence   Mr Chairman, I think the compromise proposal you have made makes  some sense To me it is a move in the right direction As I'm sure you will recall, I have  indicated in the past that I would like to see the directive included in the statement released  immediately after each meeting But there is no question that if we do that, we cannot go back if  we find that we are not comfortable with that in practice So to me at least, this is a step in a  direction that I think many of us wish to go As you indicated, if it looks as though we might  want to go even further, we will have that alternative available at a later point So I view this as  a reasonable compromise and one that I certainly can live with   But, Al, you do think this proposal is preferable to what we do   now?    Mike, I want to ask you a question about the performance of   equity markets over the last several years Typically, one talks about that in terms of   earnings and P/E multiples Does it make sense to focus on risk premia in equity markets   and look at it from the viewpoint suggested in some of the studies by Ibbotson and   Sinquefield? Those studies indicate that over the longer term there is a significant   premium in equity markets in the sense of a greater return on equities than on risk-free   Treasuries that is mainly a reflection of the risk premium  Is there reason to think that   over this period as a result of persistent growth of earnings and volatility--perhaps almost   all in one direction--that the market’s perception of the risk in equity markets may have   changed?  If that risk premium is coming down, obviously a given trajectory of earnings     2/2-3/99 39   could have a powerful impact on the level of equity prices It’s another way of talking   about P/E multiples that has a little more analytical basis, I think    That is why it’s worth spending time talking about it    Thank you    Mr Chairman, the Twelfth District economy expanded at a strong   pace in 1998 and entered the new year with substantial momentum Initial estimates   indicate that total payroll employment in the District grew by 27 percent last year, nearly   ½ percentage point faster than the nation Following a slow third quarter, District   employment regained lost momentum during the fourth quarter, when net hiring stepped   up noticeably in the retail trade and construction sectors However, the District’s   employment growth rate in 1998 was about one point below its 1997 pace and our growth   rate advantage over the nation fell substantially The key weak spot was the durables   manufacturing sector, which was hindered by deterioration in the District’s East Asia   export performance   Among subsectors, a sharp contraction in the aircraft and parts manufacturing   sector has begun, with 3,600 jobs lost during the fourth quarter in Washington State and   another 1,800 jobs lost in Los Angeles County during the past year Manufacturers of   computers and other high-tech equipment also had to face a slowdown As a result,   employment in the San Jose metropolitan portion of the San Francisco Bay area was flat   during most of 1998   Despite the slowdown in durables manufacturing in California, wage and salary   growth in the state has been sustained by the creation of high-wage jobs in other sectors   of the California economy The largest contribution came from finance, insurance, and   real estate, which grew rapidly in 1998 Among other states, Nevada and Arizona were at   the top of the national employment growth ranking in 1998, and growth during the fourth   quarter surged in Oregon, Utah, and Idaho, where it had fallen nearly to a standstill   earlier in the year   Turning to the national economy, our outlook has changed little since the   December meeting We continue to forecast a slowdown in real GDP growth to around   2¾ percent this year and unchanged core CPI inflation of 2½ percent or slightly less both   this year and next Along with the expected slowdown in growth, we have an assumption   of an unchanged stock market price level, reflecting the random-walk nature of stock   prices In fact, the waning of the expansionary effect of past increases in stock market   prices contributes to slower consumption growth this year I suppose I should mention     2/2-3/99 46   that we forecasted a similar growth slowdown last year, along with an unchanged stock   market   It is not hard to think of developments that could alter this year’s outcome   Recent problems in Brazil serve to remind us of the potential downside risks stemming   from fragility in many Asian and Latin American countries, as well as their implications   for international and domestic financial markets   But on the other side, last Friday’s data on economic activity in the fourth quarter   followed the familiar pattern of strong output growth and low inflation It seems more   and more likely that our economy is benefiting from a more rapid expansion of potential   GDP, probably due to advances in technology In fact, our staff has looked at a   consumption-based measure of potential GDP, which has the potential to pick up shocks   to the supply side of the economy It shows a considerably faster expansion in potential   output last year than do conventional measures This factor also would help to explain   why inflation has been so well behaved in the face of strong labor markets and why the   stock market has been so strong Thank you    I agree with much of what has been said Just to add to a point   that Cathy Minehan was making This does seem to present us, as a Committee, with an   opportunity to discuss in the testimony what we think the role of the aggregates should     2/2-3/99 85   be We have spent a great deal of time over the years talking about this issue, and we end   up giving the targets more prominence than most of us think is warranted This may be   an opportunity to adopt a procedure that would more closely reflect what we in fact do   and what we believe in terms of the weight these statistics versus others should be given    Don, I have a couple of technical questions and then a comment   On page 10 of the Bluebook there is a reference that says “the real funds rate is now at its   natural rate” I am familiar with what an equilibrium real rate is; I don’t know what a   “natural” funds rate is    Turning to Chart 4, the top right-hand chart, I was a little surprised   at the difference in real funds rates in the simulations, particularly the one called “Lower   NAIRU” Why would that produce analytically such a different real equilibrium rate?   The equilibrium rate has to be there somewhere Do these converge in some year some   time out in the future at something different from 3 percent?  I’m asking because I don’t   think of the equilibrium real funds rate as being 3 percent Do you?    Or why is the nominal rate so low in that simulation?     2/2-3/99 92    I see    Interesting I have a comment about the simulations They   suggest that we are going to have to make decisions in the next year or so that indicate   whether or not we are serious about price stability Secondly, if I can go back to one of   my favorite topics, which is opportunism--clearly locking in the gains to date--there are   not many simulations where we lock them in, are there?     2/2-3/99 93    It is very troubling that PCE inflation is 2¾ percent in all of the   alternatives but one In that one it is 2 percent    Thank you    That is true You only know what you know at a given time    I don’t understand that    What about its behavior in terms of the long-run simulation on   Chart 4 of the Bluebook?    But that’s not true in terms of the long-term simulation shown on   Chart 4, which goes beyond the year 2000    Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation with regard to the   federal funds target But I share many of the concerns that have been expressed by my   colleagues, particularly President Minehan and Governor Meyer   I also believe that it is less clear, certainly less clear than at the last meeting, that   the risks to the outlook are symmetric at this point I think a case could be made for   asymmetry, but we will be getting lots of information between now and the next meeting   and perhaps we can probe that issue more deeply at our next meeting    Mike, I have a question about real wages With the forecast   that you have for the ECI and the core CPI, real wages are up about 1¼ percent in 1999   and about 1 percent in the year 2000 I know that represents a continuation of the pattern   that seems to have existed at least since 1992 in terms of the Greenbook numbers But it   seems perplexing given the fact that you have productivity, one assumes, growing at an   average rate of 19 percent and also very tight labor market conditions In such a case   one would normally expect the growth rate of real wages to be in excess of 2 percent Do   you have any ideas about what is happening and how realistic that forecast might be for   the next two years?    Mr Chairman, the pace of economic activity in the Twelfth   District has been solid in recent months and only a little slower than last year’s rapid   pace In the State of Washington, the overall job count recently increased at about a 1½   percent annual rate despite the beginning of large cutbacks in the aerospace sector   Arizona also has been able to shrug off cutbacks by major manufacturers Despite job   losses in the Phoenix area, the local unemployment rate is still below 3 percent In   California the economy also is strong outside of manufacturing A pickup in state   population is boosting activity in retail trade and the housing-related sectors such as   construction and real estate And state tax authorities report strong receipts from sales   taxes and personal income withholding in early 1999 Initial claims for unemployment   insurance have remained low in California With a relatively low rate of layoffs and   continued strength in hiring, the state unemployment rate drifted down further in the last   few months Tightness in the labor and housing markets is particularly evident in the San   Francisco Bay area, where the unemployment rate has remained below 3½ percent and   housing prices have jumped 15 percent in the past year   Turning to the national economy, developments since our last meeting have   not caused us to change the tenor of our outlook for this year We continue to think that     3/30/99 25   the most likely outcome is a slowdown in real GDP growth to around 2¾ to 3 percent,   with inflation in the GDP price index of 1 to 1½ percent The slowdown of the economy   in our forecast results in part from the waning effects of past increases in stock market   wealth I felt more confident about that assumption when we ran the model than I did   when I was putting this report together last evening after yesterday’s stock market rise!   While this appears to be a reasonable forecast, there are large uncertainties   The economy has defied expectations of a slowdown for several years, and I am more   convinced that we are seeing the effects of a favorable supply shock, perhaps related to   technological developments, that is not being picked up by standard models I believe   that recent data have reinforced this view I am referring to the evidence for the fourth   quarter of even more rapid real GDP and productivity growth and very low inflation, as   well as indications for the current quarter of very low CPI inflation in combination with   moderately strong growth I would not be at all surprised if this year’s growth once again   exceeded our forecast   On the other hand, we can’t ignore other possible developments that could   undermine economic activity this year For example, growth could be seriously reduced   if some shock were to undermine the US equity market However, neither of these   uncertainties, from a positive supply shock or a negative financial shock, would seem to   pose a great threat to inflation in 1999 Prospects for inflation next year, however, are   more uncertain and, I believe, more troubling Thank you    Mr Chairman, I basically agree with your recommendation I   am somewhat more inclined to favor the adoption of an asymmetric directive to the   upside But, quite frankly, there does not seem to be much risk in waiting to see how   events unfold between now and the next meeting    Don, are banks executing all-asset pledges?  Isn’t that a way to--   We have done that in the past     5/18/99 9    But there is a problem with the Federal Home Loan Banks    Mike, I have two questions, and the first one is on productivity as   well Estimates of the productivity trend seem to have been revised quite frequently in   the last few years To me, this suggests greater uncertainty about the productivity   forecast Wouldn’t you have to conclude that the uncertainties associated with our   forecast of real output and inflation must be greater given the uncertainties that are   associated with the productivity forecast?    The second question relates to the fact that the Y2K effect in the   Greenbook forecast appears quite large Compared with the consensus of Blue Chip   forecasters, for example, it is considerably larger  Do you want to comment a little on   what your thought process was?    Thank you    Mr Chairman, economic growth in the Twelfth District has   shown some signs of moderation, but it is still rapid In Nevada and Arizona, the pace of   job growth has slowed somewhat from last year’s very fast pace, but these states still rank   first and third in terms of employment growth over the past twelve months In the Pacific     5/18/99 28   Northwest, employment growth picked up in Oregon but cutbacks in aerospace   manufacturing jobs held down such growth in the state of Washington California’s   relatively rapid pace of job growth also moderated a bit in recent months as a contraction   of the state’s manufacturing payrolls partly offset employment gains in other sectors   Overall, California employment has grown at roughly a 2 percent rate so far this year,   which is down about 1 percentage point from last year’s pace Even so, California’s   unemployment rate of 56 percent is down significantly since the end of last year   Turning to the national scene, obviously the data have revealed a stronger- than-  expected economy once again, causing us to revise our real GDP forecast upward The   contour of the forecast has not changed very much, however We still expect the   economy to slow, only now the phrase “slowing economy” means a growth rate of about   3¼ percent for the remaining quarters of the year The GDP price index is projected to   grow at a rate of about 1 to 1½ percent over the same period However, recent forecast   errors suggest that there is considerable uncertainty associated with this outlook We are   all well aware that real output has consistently grown faster than predicted in recent   years And if we had somehow known how fast the economy would grow over this   period, we would have overpredicted inflation even more than we actually did It seems   clear that we are experiencing a positive supply shock but one whose magnitude and   duration are hard to determine The existence of a supply shock makes it hard to judge   inflationary risk by looking at real output growth, since such shocks tend to change the   output/inflation mix in the economy   A reasonable response to this uncertainty is to follow a strategy that is fairly   robust in the face of such shocks One such strategy would be to pay more attention to   the growth in nominal GDP or spending As supply shocks change output and inflation   growth in opposite directions, they will obviously have a smaller impact on nominal   GDP Keeping an eye on spending would allow us to keep inflation within reasonable   bounds, even if we are unsure about the economy’s potential growth rate Using nominal   GDP in this way--that is, as an indicator--is similar to the way that we actually employed   the monetary aggregates before velocity shifts made them hard to interpret The data   show that nominal GDP growth has averaged close to 5½ percent over the previous three   years This suggests to me that, despite the uncertainties associated with the supply     5/18/99 29   shock, the policy choices made during this period have been appropriate By allowing   growth to come in higher and prices lower than anticipated, we have in effect been   stabilizing nominal GDP to some degree In this light, however, the recent acceleration   in nominal GDP in the past two quarters causes me some concern Thank you    Mr Chairman, since we met in March we have had a number of   conflicting signals about the future course of core inflation Taken as a whole, however, I   believe there are upside risks to inflation, although they may not be sufficient to warrant   an increase in the funds rate at the present time I must admit it would not take much   more evidence of upside risk to convince me to raise the rate So, I would be enthusiastic   in supporting an announced upward tilt to the directive at this time    Peter, I have a question for you or Karen about the huge Japanese   support of the yen Has this intervention been sterilized completely or partially?  The   numbers are so large that they would have great significance for their monetary base, and   I just wondered what the policy is    That is rather interesting because, of course, we often think about   sterilization not necessarily in terms of the impact on rates but on the monetary base    Mike, I have a question about the Y2K effects The quarterly   impact of Y2K in the forecast is primarily an inventory effect One gets the impression   that there could be some effect--I don’t know the size of it--that could work in an   opposite direction in the sense that we hear of companies postponing projects Many   banks, for example, have delayed combining their data systems as they have merged, and   I imagine there probably are examples in other industries The assumption at least is that   sometime in the year 2000, though perhaps not immediately, they are going to begin   those projects--and not all of them are IT projects  Is there the potential for a significant   reverse effect that we are not taking into account?    Okay    They were on the low side in February, too, you know    Thank you, Mr Chairman The Twelfth District economy has   expanded at a solid pace in recent months, with growth accelerating from earlier in the   year District payrolls increased at an average annual rate of 3¼ percent during April and   May, as rapid growth in some states more than offset a slight slowing in others The   acceleration was dominated by California, where payrolls expanded at a 3¾ percent   average annual pace in April and May, well above the 2 percent pace of the first quarter   Payrolls also grew rapidly in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah In Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, and   Washington employment growth slowed in recent months, falling below the national pace   of growth The construction and services sectors continue to be the strongest sectors of   the District economy Employment growth in construction was particularly rapid, up by   10½ percent at an annual rate during the two months ended in May The rate in the   services sector was 5¼ percent District manufacturing payrolls have declined slowly in   1999, although employment has stabilized in recent months Increased demand for     6/29-30/99 32   computers, consumer electronics, and telecommunication products, as well as the   resurgence of many economies in Asia, are boosting sales and orders throughout the   high-tech manufacturing sector   Although improved market conditions have yet to generate significant job   growth among District high-tech manufacturers, employment levels have stabilized and   output is rising Thus far, productivity gains and increases in the average workweek have   allowed many high-tech manufacturers to meet production goals without boosting   employment However, these firms will likely need to increase employment in the near   future since they anticipate an acceleration in the growth of sales and orders and most   have absorbed what had been excess capacity in their existing employment bases   Turning to the national outlook, data since the last meeting have done little to   change our perception of the basic forces shaping the economy In our forecast, demand   is expected to remain strong in the near term, allowing real output growth to average   more than 3 percent over the remainder of this year However, recent increases in   interest rates combined with an expected flattening of the stock market should start   restraining demands toward the end of the year Consequently, we expect real output   growth to slow to about 2¾ percent next year   Recent high levels of demand have not translated into high inflation because of   the favorable developments on the supply side Consequently, core CPI stands roughly   unchanged in our forecast However, as I mentioned last time, the recent history of   forecast errors makes it hard to be very confident about any forecast of this split between   output growth and inflation Because there is no way to determine the size or persistence   of the current supply shock at this point in time, it is really hard to tell how fast the   economy can grow without inflationary pressures   Forecasts that utilize the level of the output gap can be quite misleading, as   illustrated by the staff papers distributed by Don Kohn This uncertainty suggests placing   more emphasis on nominal GDP growth, which tends to internalize offsetting movements   in inflation and output growth And its use as an indicator can be similar to the way we   used the monetary aggregates in the past In this framework, the small deceleration in   annual spending growth over the last three years to a rate around 5 percent helps me to be   more reasonably optimistic about inflation However, I am not completely comfortable     6/29-30/99 33   with recent developments, as nominal GDP has grown at a 6½ percent rate over the last   two quarters Thus, I will be watching the spending numbers carefully to determine   whether this is a one-time event or the beginning of a sustained increase in nominal   spending Thank you    I agree with your recommendation    Don, I have a question about the long-term simulations Both of   them indicate that there is a lot to do in terms of policy in the next year or two to reach   our objectives Since obviously we don’t have much detail here, I was interested in   hearing your views on the impacts of the alternative simulations relative to where we are   today on such things as the stock market, the bond market, the foreign exchange market,   and other vulnerable economies in the world It seems to me that with the kind of policy   changes indicated in either of those alternatives, but particularly in the price stability one,   those impacts could be very significant My experience would be that a long-run   simulation isn’t going to pick up much of that The other point, somewhat on the other   side, is that if we moved according to the price stability alternative, it’s conceivable that   we could see the sacrifice ratio change as well because such a move would be a very   dramatic indication of our resolve with regard to monetary policy As you put these   simulations together, did those kinds of considerations come up?    I see    Okay, thank you    Don, do you believe that the markets in the future will view a   change in symmetry as a change in policy?    Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation for a 25 basis point   increase I would favor asymmetry because I think it more correctly reflects what I     6/29-30/99 103   believe the risks are to the outlook and policy I would be against symmetry because I   fear first of all that, in itself, it doesn’t correctly reflect our assessment of the risks   Secondly, I am also concerned that it would be misinterpreted by the market Obviously   a statement accompanying symmetry could clarify things and indicate why the risks are   not really symmetrical But if we are going to go that route, even Jerry Jordan’s   recommendation becomes more attractive to me And I really begin to wonder whether   referring to symmetry accomplishes anything    I have a question about the reserve needs The Treasury balance is   expected to be twice as high as usual at year-end What are the major reasons for that?    I have another question on needs with regard to currency There is no   indication at this point, is there, that the estimates on currency needs are anything different   from what we’ve been assuming?    But I mean the amount that we’ve accumulated is also running far   ahead of normal    Exactly But I was wondering if anything has led us to revise our   estimates on that?    Okay    Mr Chairman, I don’t have any question about the need for these types   of tools But I do have a question--if we can put on our BS&R hat for just a moment--that   relates to us as a central bank If a bank or other financial institution were to engage in these   types of activities, we would be interested in whether or not they had conducted simulations   to ascertain what the impact of these activities was likely to be on that institution Then   we’d expect that to be shared with management and their board of directors, and so forth Is   that a step we should take?  And if so, should that step be taken before we approve this?  In   my experience that is something we think is very important for private institutions It seems   to me that we could have simulations showing extreme events that could have rather   important impacts on the Federal Reserve System and the financial system, and I think it is   something we ought to look at    I’m sure there are differences Does that lead you to conclude that   looking at such simulations is not appropriate?    We seem to be learning a lot    Mike, given the surprisingly strong growth of income, profits, and also   tax receipts in recent years, can we draw any inferences about what we might see with the   October benchmark revision--in particular, what it might imply for real GDP and, of course,   productivity?    Thank you    Mr Chairman, the Twelfth District economy has expanded at a solid   pace so far this year, although the disparity across states has increased District payrolls   expanded at a 24 percent rate during the first seven months of the year, down from the 31   percent pace of 1998 Employment growth rates in the fastest growing states--Arizona,   California, Nevada and Utah--averaged between 25 and 42 percent  In five other District   states--Alaska, Idaho, Hawaii, Oregon, and Washington--employment expanded at or below   the national pace Despite slower overall growth, District labor markets remain tight   Construction and services as well as transportation, communication, and public utilities have   continued to be the strongest sectors of the District’s economy   In contrast, District manufacturing payrolls have declined at a 16 percent pace this   year Employment reductions have occurred in both the durable and nondurable sectors In   the durable sector reductions have been broad-based, although employment has declined   most rapidly in the aircraft and resources-related industries In the state of Washington,   Boeing and its suppliers have cut 11,000 jobs since last December In the nondurable sector   weak demand for agricultural commodities has continued to damp employment growth in   the food-processing industry   During the past few years, prices and profits of agricultural producers in the Twelfth   District have been held down by weak export demand caused by the appreciation of the US   dollar and the economic crisis in Asia District exports of agricultural products fell by   nearly 20 percent between 1997 and 1998, and data for California suggest that agricultural   exports have continued to decline in 1999 As a result, gross sales and net farm income in   the District have fallen However, relative to other areas of the United States, District   agricultural producers are in reasonably good shape since only a small percentage of the   District’s production is in the bulk commodities experiencing the largest price declines   Turning to the national economy, from 1995 to 1998 core price inflation measures,   even on consistently measured bases, generally were trending downward This decline   probably reflected favorable supply shocks that more than outweighed strong demand   However, several special factors helped out as well Since mid-1998 this disinflation has     8/24/99 48   stalled Price inflation and survey expectations of future inflation appear to have flattened   out This halt in the progress toward our goal of price stability sounds a cautionary note in   assessing the current stance of policy This is particularly true given the context of tight   labor markets and our forecast, which predicts strong output growth through the rest of this   year and steady to slightly rising core inflation through next year Such a path does not   continue the gains that we have made toward price stability during the past few years and   may even give up some of those gains   We have examined a variety of risks to this outlook, some of which are similar to the   alternative scenarios in the Greenbook In one alternative not covered in the Greenbook, the   favorable supply conditions of the recent past are assumed to dissipate by lowering   underlying trend productivity growth for the forecast period from 2¼ to 1¼ percent In   2000, real growth slows by ½ percentage point and inflation begins to accelerate I believe   this scenario demonstrates that an unwinding of the positive productivity shock poses a risk   to our recent progress toward price stability Thank you    Mr Chairman, I’m increasingly concerned that aggregate supply may   not keep up with aggregate demand, particularly in light of a probable pickup in foreign   demand If that turns out to be the case, we risk an acceleration in inflation at a time when   I’d personally like to see further progress toward price stability I, too, would prefer to raise   the funds rate ¼ point at this meeting Although we might have to move again this year, I   would prefer a symmetric directive in part because we don’t know how fast aggregate   supply will continue to grow and also because I agree with much of what President Poole   said about the symmetry issue    Karen, the recent Greenbook forecast of real GDP for China indicates   growth of 34 percent in 1999 and 54 percent in the year 2000 Of course, those growth rates are   much below what China had experienced in the previous five years or longer Is that consistent   with a gradual, as opposed to a sharp, decline in the value of the renminbi, continued reform of   state owned enterprises, and further financial modernization?    Thank you    Mr Chairman, the Twelfth District’s expansion has gained momentum since   early in the year Following moderate growth in the first quarter, job growth picked up to a 28   percent rate during the second quarter and that pace was maintained in July and August Economic   activity has been expanding more quickly in California than in the rest of the District This has   helped California attract jobs and residents from other states and has spurred substantial gains in   construction activity Nonetheless, conditions outside of California have remained robust For   example, Nevada’s economy has picked up steam recently with gaming revenues growing at their   fastest pace since 1994   Rapid job growth has tightened District labor markets After remaining roughly constant in   1998, the District unemployment rate has fallen by ½ percentage point so far this year This is due   to improved conditions in California where the August unemployment rate of 51 percent was the   lowest recorded since 1969 Although the unemployment rate remains higher in the Twelfth   District than in the rest of the nation, labor compensation costs have risen more rapidly in the West,   with a strong upward trend evident over the past several years Moreover, tight labor markets have   prompted employers to find alternative methods for attracting and retaining workers These   methods include the provision of on-site benefits that conserve workers’ time and enable them to   spend more hours on the job     10/5/99 21   Despite strength in the economy as a whole, the District’s high-tech and aerospace   manufacturers face significant challenges California’s makers of semiconductors have begun   expanding again, but employment in that industry remains below its peak of early last year   Manufacturers of computer equipment throughout the District have continued to shed jobs in recent   months, with makers of disk drives being especially hard hit Moreover, the recent earthquake in   Taiwan interrupted that country’s extensive semiconductor and computer equipment production   and that has clouded the outlook for prices and the availability of computer components in the fall   and winter In the aerospace sector, Boeing is well on its way to its target of 53,000 job cuts by the   end of 2000, having eliminated about 35,000 since early last year Most of these cuts have been in   Washington State, but the rate of reduction picked up recently in Southern California where Boeing   is phasing out several models of aircraft that it inherited from McDonnell Douglas   In contrast to the computer hardware and aerospace sectors, computer software and service   providers have been expanding employment and output at a torrid pace That has caused total   employment growth in the Seattle area actually to pick up in spite of the cuts at Boeing It also has   kept Silicon Valley’s economy healthy despite job losses in the hardware sector As a result,   housing prices in Silicon Valley rose about 15 percent during the 12 months ending in July   Turning to the national economy, the data made available since we met in August certainly   suggest that the supply shock of recent years has not yet run its course Based on recent monthly   data, we have revised up our estimate of third-quarter real GDP growth from 3½ to 4½ percent,   similar to the projection in the Greenbook This has combined with favorable news on the core CPI   in August, which brought the most recent 12-month increase to just under 2 percent This apparent   supply shock makes forecasting especially treacherous, but our best estimate continues to show a   modest slowdown in the rate of real GDP growth next year Under the assumption of no further   change in the federal funds rate, we now project a 3 percent increase in real GDP in 2000 as   domestic demand slows in response to the recent tightening of monetary policy, combined with an   assumed flattening of the stock market’s trajectory  Growth at this pace would leave labor markets   tight next year and continue to indicate upward price pressures We are showing a 2½ percent   increase in the core CPI next year despite a slowing of GDP growth to just below trend  And with   labor markets projected to be tight through the end of 2000, more upward price pressures would be   forthcoming in 2001   Obviously, there are a number of important risks to this outlook First, the modest drop in   the dollar and a pickup in foreign growth could add significantly to inflationary pressures if they     10/5/99 22   were to gain momentum Second, the recent modest drop in equity prices reminds us that the   economy remains vulnerable to a much larger stock market correction from today’s very high   levels And finally, there is simply no way to determine the size or persistence of the current   supply shock A review of forecast errors in recent years indicates that this shock has consistently   surprised us on the positive side Although we don’t know how long the supply shock will last, I   don’t think there is reason to believe it has ended yet Its continuation, supported by recent data,   reduces the chance of an inflation problem in the foreseeable future Thank you    Mr Chairman, before this meeting I favored “B” but concluded that the time   for raising rates is probably not that far off As a result of the discussion today, I think it’s even   nearer but I still would favor alternative B   With regard to the symmetry issue, I must admit that I found the experience we   encountered--in terms of market reaction to the May press release about asymmetry--so distasteful     10/5/99 63   that it makes me want to try to use words to describe our views about the risks to the outlook   Clearly, we are not talking about a symmetrical situation So I’d like to indicate a preference to use   words to deal with this issue of risks to the outlook But if we can’t do that in an efficient way, I   certainly could buy an announcement of asymmetry    Karen, you made the point that economic prospects in the United States   are certainly affected by the improved situation in foreign countries I wonder if you would   comment briefly about how your views have changed on Japan It seems to me that the situation   there still looks quite troubling in the sense that the Greenbook projects deflation to continue   through 2000 and really through 2001 since prices are flat in 2001 The fiscal stimulus program   they are proposing is very large and it suggests that they have significant concerns about real   growth prospects in the future I just wonder how your views have changed about Japan, which   is certainly an important ingredient to the foreign GDP prospects    Thank you    Mr Chairman, the Twelfth District economic expansion continues to   outpace the average for the rest of the nation During the third quarter, employment grew at a   24 percent rate, exactly equal to the pace during the first half of the year However, growth in   most of our states, including California, has been slower this year than it was in 1998, so that the   District growth rate has been edging down toward the national average Other than Alaska and   Hawaii, District states remain strong, though I would point out that tourist spending is producing   even a further pickup in Nevada this year California has been expanding a bit more rapidly than   the remainder of the District, and the state unemployment rate has fallen just over a percentage   point since the end of last year to 48 percent in October The short-run outlook for the District   expansion remains quite favorable Housing market activity has been vigorous, although the   increases this year mostly have been in fast-growing southern California Growth has been   somewhat slower elsewhere and residential construction activity has been flat or down in several   urban areas Slower appreciation in sales prices for existing homes is evident in some areas as   well   On the upside, we are seeing renewed demand for District electronic products   Following three lean years, prices and sales of key semiconductor products have picked up this     11/16/99 24   year, and in California electronics manufacturers have gained back many of the jobs lost during   1998   Turning to the national economy, labor markets certainly have tightened a bit further   since we last met The rapid real GDP growth in the third quarter led to a further slight decline   in the unemployment rate, and our forecast for real GDP growth of about 3½ percent next year   is, of course, very similar to that of the Greenbook This suggests that labor market pressures are   unlikely to abate any time soon But while labor costs may well pick up in the future, these costs   do not appear to have been particularly burdensome to businesses in the recent past Despite   apparently tight labor markets the ECI has risen only 31 percent over the past year And while   compensation per hour has risen much faster, unit labor cost increases receded last quarter due to   strong productivity growth Moreover, rapid real GDP growth and low price inflation in the   third quarter, together with what appears to be a pickup in profits, also suggest that aggregate   supply has continued to expand at a robust pace This provides room for at least guarded   optimism about inflation   After balancing these signals, we come out with a slight upward trend for the core   CPI Our forecast shows a rise from 21 percent this year to 23 and 24 percent respectively in   the next two years Even such a slight upward trend in future price inflation is a concern As we   know, however, such an upswing has looked likely for several years but has not materialized In   deciding on policy, we will be faced again with whether to put more weight on forecasts of   problems ahead or on past results that have been quite favorable Thank you    Mr Chairman, this month we once again face the issue of how much   weight to put on a forecast of rising inflation, a forecast that so far has been on the high side   compared with the more favorable actual results When the October meeting concluded, I was   fairly confident that we would need to raise rates at this meeting However, the wage and price   inflation data in the intermeeting period have been better certainly than I expected As a result, I   would prefer to leave the funds rate unchanged at the present time and to retain a bias toward a   tighter policy But I must admit that if we do that, the strong likelihood that we will stand pat   until at least mid-January makes me anxious, since I do believe our next move will be up And   that need could be compelling before we feel comfortable in moving in the new year    I favored alternative II [Laughter]    And it was for many of the reasons that were mentioned by Larry and   Bill I saw it as the alternative that would be consistent with the fewest additional sentences of   explanation, which I viewed as a great virtue And based on our experience today, I see that as a   really big virtue for which to aim  Moreover, it seemed to me that the most important point was     11/16/99 68   that the focus clearly be on the implications for policy I think if we were somewhat more   explicit about that, over time our experience would be good in providing that information    Mike, I thought the section in the Greenbook on alternative   simulations was particularly interesting, especially the comparison between the baseline and   the flat funds rate scenario It seems to me, if one compares the effects of monetary policy   actions on inflation expectations in the economy, that there is a greater sensitivity now than   may have been the case a couple of years ago And that makes sense to me We are   basically saying that markets are learning and responding to policy actions But what is a   bit confusing is that there is also, I would assume, considerable sensitivity to developments   in equity markets as well If one looks at those two Greenbook alternatives, there is a big   impact on expectations as a result of the effect of a change in rates on equity prices Could   you talk a little about how expectations enter into the model now versus how they used to?   Is there a greater sensitivity now to policy actions?    Thank you    Mr Chairman, economic activity in the Twelfth District has   continued to expand rapidly in recent months, with the expansion broadly based across   major District states Every major sector in the District added jobs in recent months, with   construction posting some of the largest gains And manufacturing has been a new source   of job growth in recent months despite a continued loss of aerospace jobs A rebound is     12/21/99 18   particularly evident for manufacturers of high-tech equipment, who recently have benefited   from improved exports to Asian countries that had suffered recessions in the 1997-1998   period   High-tech firms have created a lot of jobs and wealth recently in the District,   especially in California This year a record-breaking amount of venture capital has been   invested in California firms, particularly those in the Bay Area that are developing Internet   applications  Proceeds from initial public offerings also have surged this year, following   moderate amounts of IPO activity in 1997 and 1998 The strong performance of technology   stocks is boosting spending not only in California but in other District states as well For   example, one of our directors reported that Californians are using their newfound riches to   bid up the price of beachfront real estate in Hawaii Analysis done by our staff suggests that   successful IPOs have made a large number of employees wealthy, at least on paper More   than 150,000 persons are employed in the roughly 300 California- headquartered firms that   have made IPOs in the last three years About 125,000 of these employees probably have   received stock or stock options as part of their compensation, giving them as a group about   15 percent ownership in their firms Given the strong stock price performance this year, the   aggregate market capitalization of these 300 firms recently jumped to about $450 billion   dollars As a result, about 125,000 Californians have seen the value of their stock or stock   options jump to an average level of more than $300,000 per employee Just as this newly   created wealth is boosting demand, especially in California, it is clear that a collapse in   market values would impose obvious downside risks   Turning to the national economy, recent data continue to show the rapid growth in   economic activity and moderate inflation that we have seen for four years now These data   serve to reinforce the impression that the supply side of the economy is expanding rapidly   Our forecast under an unchanged federal funds rate and flat stock market shows growth of   just under 3¾ percent and 3½ percent respectively over the next two years   With regard to inflation, tight labor markets are expected to impart an upward trend   to the ECI, which rises in our forecast to 4¼ percent by 2001 However, the acceleration of   productivity in recent years can be expected to counteract part of this pressure on goods   prices Moreover, corporate profit margins remain high, providing a further cushion   between wages and prices Balancing these factors, our staff forecast shows a slight upward     12/21/99 19   trend in core CPI from 21 percent this year to 23 and 24 percent in the next two years,   considerably below the forecast in the Greenbook constant funds rate scenario   There are significant risks on both sides of the forecast The evidence of a   continuing supply shock represents a downside risk for inflation This shock has proven to   be difficult to model, and inflation, once again, could come in lower than expected In   addition, the possibility of a significant stock market correction cannot by any means be   ruled out, and that also would reduce inflationary risks However, labor market tightness   could begin to show through to price inflation in a more dramatic way, as would be   expected from historical experience This risk is illustrated rather forcefully by the   Greenbook with its forecast that CPI inflation would rise to 32 percent in 2001 with no   further tightening of monetary policy   The key policy issues appear to remain the same Accelerating productivity and   actual results for inflation suggest room for guarded optimism, while labor market tightness   implies problems ahead for inflation While I am perhaps not as pessimistic as the   Greenbook, I must admit that it has shifted my focus a bit toward the inflationary risks that   we face with an unchanged federal funds rate Thank you    I favor, by a small margin, the symmetric directive as well When I   read the two, the symmetric one seems to speak a little more clearly about our thoughts and   concerns I don’t see big differences, but if I had to state a preference it would be for the   symmetric alternative    I started out at a position that was very close to Bill Poole’s, although   I indicated that I probably could live with either option I’ve moved a bit more in the   direction of Option 1 recently The advantage of Option 2, of course, is that it’s very direct   To me the disadvantage is that it may not accurately convey the probabilities of a change in   policy Clearly, we were using the tilt language in the past in a way that very often did not   lead to a change in policy after we had adopted an asymmetric directive And I even worry   about the possibility that markets may almost force us to make a move if we’ve indicated   asymmetry, as has been the case once in the recent past   With regard to Option 1, what I like about it is that it seems to capture how I’ve   interpreted symmetry in the past I concluded what I thought was appropriate with regard to   the funds rate and then considered the question of where the balance of risks, in terms of the   economic outcomes, was likely to be in the period ahead, knowing full well that things   could change very quickly So it seems to me that perhaps Option 1 would provide a little   more flexibility than Option 2     Karen, I have a question about Japan  Recently the Finance Ministry   indicated that it might be borrowing at 21 percent as opposed to issuing 10-year bonds that   would cost 16 percent  I have a few questions on this and I will try to sound objective in asking   them  First, is this an astute financial strategy or is it a                      , given all of the financing   that they have to do?  Second, is this chapter 2, so to speak, of capital injection into the banking   system, which would suggest that perhaps banks really have not turned the corner in Japan?  I   must admit that it seems really--to use a neutral term--“interesting” at a time when long-term   postal savings deposits are coming due and are being renewed at 25 percent, that the Finance   Ministry is going to borrow from banks, which is a narrow private group, at 21 percent  It   seems to me that that would cause tremendous political problems       Right     Thank you     Mr Chairman, economic activity in the Twelfth District picked up at   the end of last year, widening the gap in employment growth relative to the rest of the country   The underlying momentum is broadly based, but most notable is the strength in business services   and construction  Business services added jobs at a rapid pace both in the fourth quarter and in   the year as a whole  The fastest growing component in this sector was high-tech services  In the   state of Washington, the robust high-tech software industry registered an 11 percent increase in   jobs in 1999  In California, the high wage Internet and software service firms continue to grow   rapidly  Unpublished data indicate that in the narrow Internet service sector, average salaries are          50  approaching $100,000 a year  The intensity in the “dot-com” sector is affecting key commercial   real estate markets in the District, driving office vacancy rates down and lease rates up  In San   Jose, San Francisco, and Seattle vacancy rates are in the 3 to 5 percent range  In San Francisco,   lease rates on Class A office space increased by about 25 percent last year  The only major   markets with substantial overhang of commercial office space are in Southern California   The District's manufacturing sector reported a small increase in jobs in the fourth   quarter despite downsizing in aerospace and weakness in high-tech employment  Within high-  tech manufacturing, however, there are signs of improvement, mainly in semiconductors and   other electronic equipment  In Oregon, for example, semiconductor firms are adding jobs and   Intel plans to reopen a chip plant  These developments coincide with increases in exports of   electronics from such states as Oregon and California, with much of the increase in shipments   going to East Asia   Turning to the national economy, last Friday's GDP and inflation data certainly raised   a red flag  While it is too soon to tell if the fourth-quarter surge in GDP-based inflation   measures will persist, Friday's numbers are a serious concern  Our forecast assumes a 50 basis   point rise in the funds rate together with a flattening of stock market values and it shows real   GDP growth of 4 percent this year and 3-1/2 percent in 2001  Given that labor markets already   appear to be very tight, the obvious question for policy is whether that real GDP growth can   occur without a sustained rise in inflation  Rising productivity growth has been able to offset   any tendency for inflation to pick up steam, at least until last quarter  However, productivity   growth rates will need to rise even higher or their beneficial effects will begin to fade before too   long  While it is entirely possible that the economy has achieved a new, higher trend in   productivity growth, it is not clear how long productivity can continue to accelerate  Assuming          51  that productivity growth continues at the rapid pace of last year, our staff forecast shows an   upward trend in core CPI from just under 2 percent last year to 2-1/4 percent this year and 2-1/2   percent next year  Such a rise in inflation would be especially troublesome to me because I   would like to see it decline further below the 2 percent rate registered last year  Thank you     My question is related to much of the discussion that has been going   on  For alternative II, I think you said that the midpoint of 4 percent on M2 is consistent with a   shift in productivity and also our goal of price stability  So, potential output growth would be in   that 4 percent area and price stability would be defined as zero inflation  I guess what is          88  troubling to me is that if nominal GDP is 4 percent, that means the goal is zero on the GDP   deflator  If we went around the table, nobody would give that number     Oh, I see     Well, if that is what the group is happy with, I’m really happy       Okay     Mr Chairman, I liked what Governor Meyer said, although I must   admit I’d probably be happier with a thinner cushion than he would  That leads me to think that   a case can be made for alternative II  But I keep coming back to the idea that we really do not   have much confidence in our forecast of the aggregates and what they mean and that, therefore, it   is probably best not to draw attention to them  So, on balance, I have a slight preference for   alternative I  In either instance, however, I think we should make it clear that we are not   targeting the aggregates and that our goal is price stability, defined in the way that we talked   about earlier     Don, I’d like to hear your thoughts about how the Greenbook is   characterizing the current stance of monetary policy  In one part of the Greenbook there is a   reference to the real equilibrium funds rate as being 5 percent  I suppose that calculation   involves the PCE chain-weighted core rate less food, energy, and tobacco  Recent experience   would suggest that the inflation premium is maybe 1-1/2 percent if one’s analysis is backward-  looking and about 2 percent if it is forward-looking  That would suggest to me that the Bluebook   is saying that until the nominal funds rate reaches a level of 6-1/2 to 7 percent policy is in a   stimulative mode  Is that what the Bluebook is saying?    So with an increase of ¼ or ½ or even ¾ of a percentage point, we   would still be in a position of basically stimulating the economy and providing an environment   where inflationary pressures are likely to continue to rise?     So if we were to move cautiously, it would be very important to   communicate clearly about the work that apparently still has to be done?          110    That same communication probably would not be modified much if we   went 50 basis points?     But not a greater sense of concern than is in the analytical work that   has been presented to us     Thank you     Don, I have two comments  One, if you’re uncertain about whether the   growth is the outcome of a supply shift or a demand shift, wouldn’t a nominal income rule   dominate the Taylor rule or the inflation rule in terms of exercises like this?     My other comment follows from what the Chairman said earlier  It   seems to me that it is important to keep in mind that there are standard errors in these exercises   and they are significant  I must admit that if I didn’t think that was the case, I would have been   terrified by these outcomes  Instead, I’m only scared!     Mr Chairman, I would prefer a 50 basis point increase in the funds rate   and also a public statement that we are focusing on heightened inflation risk in the future  My   concern is that the time period between this meeting and the next meeting on March 21st is quite   long  I might suggest something that would make me more comfortable with a 25 basis point   increase and that is that we agree to assess the situation again at the end of this month  We will   have considerably more data, certainly more data about prices  We could review those data and   see if we feel at that time that a further move is appropriate  I don't see why we have to be   constrained by a fixed calendar, which in this case involves quite a long interval between   meetings  Over the 14 years I have been with the Fed, we have found telephone meetings at   times like this to be very useful  From my perspective, though it’s certainly not one shared by   everyone here, it would reduce the possibility that we will get behind the curve       Well, I think there might be a case for it this time     I certainly am in favor of the study and I think the suggestion that Tom   Hoenig made was constructive  To deal somewhat with the issue Bill Poole was raising, is it   possible to have the temporary suspension extended for a shorter period?  In other words, is this   study of sufficient importance that it ought to be done much more expeditiously and then perhaps   our decision could be reached much more quickly?              - 23 -       So move     Mike, how would you characterize the degree of monetary restraint in   the year 2000 in this forecast versus the January forecast?  I ask that because nominal rates are   about 1/2 percentage point higher in the latest forecast and inflation rates in overall price indices    like the CPI are up by almost the same amount, but the core rates are about the same as in the   previous forecast  I'm not sure, in your deliberations and the way you look at this, how you   formulate your views about real rates  And I was curious about how you see the difference in   this forecast versus the previous one       So there isn't a major change     Thank you     Mr Chairman, the Twelfth District economy entered the new year with   considerable momentum  The pace of job growth in the District has picked up in recent months,   further widening the gap in employment growth relative to the nation  The acceleration was   most pronounced in California, where payrolls expanded at a 3-1/2 percent average annual rate   in January and February, about 08 percentage point faster than the pace of growth in 1999    Employment growth in the fastest-growing states--Nevada, Arizona, Idaho, and California--  currently is averaging from 3 to over 5 percent on a 12-month basis  In other District states   employment is expanding at or below the national pace  But in all but Utah economic activity   has picked up in recent months  Robust gains in construction and services have continued to   drive the District economy  Collectively those two sectors created about 60 percent of net new   jobs added during the past twelve months  Job growth in construction has been broad-based,   boosted by strong demand for both residential and nonresidential building   In the services sector, rapid expansion among providers of Internet and software   services remains the key component of growth  But recently providers of services related to   population growth--health care is one example--and to tourism also have added jobs at a brisk              - 41 -     pace  Strong job growth over the past twelve months has further tightened District labor   markets  The District unemployment rate fell to 4-1/2 percent in January, down 06 percentage   point from the average in 1999  However, as of yet, tight labor markets have not resulted in   greater wage inflation in the District  In fact, data from the ECI point to slower wage growth in   the District in 1999 than we experienced in 1998  This pattern of declining unemployment and   slower wage growth owes in part, we believe, to three factors  First, increases in the use of   alternative and uncounted forms of employee compensation such as stock options and hiring   bonuses, and also job reclassification of workers receiving pay raises; second, a decline in wage   growth in high-tech manufacturing associated with slower employment growth in that sector; and   third, the rapid movement of less-qualified workers into existing job classifications at lower   wages   Looking forward, some of the factors tempering wage growth in 1999 may be reversed   in the coming year  For example, improved demand within District high-tech manufacturing has   begun to boost employment growth, making further decelerations in wage growth in that sector   unlikely  Also, data for California indicate that the number of potential workers is diminishing    The flow of new entrants into unemployment is slowing, and unemployment rates among   subgroups with lower-than-average skill levels are falling   Turning to the national economy, the data released during the past month showed no   slackening in domestic demand  Real final sales rose about 5 percent at an annual rate during the   second half of last year and our forecast is for much the same pace of growth during the first part   of this year  This rate of sales growth most likely is unsustainable and is especially a concern   given the current levels of resource utilization  Therefore, our forecast assumes a significant   further tightening of financial conditions over the next six months  This tightening includes a              - 42 -     rise in corporate and mortgage rates, a flattening of broad stock market valuations, and--   underpinning these developments--a gradual increase of 75 basis points in the funds rate  Such   financial restraints help to slow real GDP growth to 4 percent this year and 3-1/4 percent next   year in our forecast     Still, even with the slowing of real economic activity, our inflation projection is   disappointing  During the past few years, the core PCE price index has risen about 1-1/2 percent   each year, which is somewhat above my view of price stability  Unfortunately, our forecast   anticipates that core PCE inflation will rise to almost 2 percent by next year, giving up the gains   made toward price stability since the mid-1990s  As we all know, there are many risks to such   an inflation forecast  In particular, we are uncertain about how much and how fast energy prices   will pass through to other prices, about how much demand will increase from the economies   abroad, and about whether stock prices or productivity growth will surge or fall  However,   despite all the possible scenarios that could be constructed, the underlying tightness of labor   markets and the recent extraordinary growth in demand imply a very high risk that core inflation   will rise at a faster pace this year and next  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation with regard to the funds   rate  I also think it is important to reinforce to the public that we are focusing on the heightened   inflation risks for the future     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Vince, beginning in 1999 and   continuing through 2001 the foreign real GDP growth rates are quite strong, especially in the   industrial countries  Would you characterize this primarily as a cyclical development or is   there an indication that perhaps some of the “new economy” developments, which certainly   have affected us over the last four or five years and have produced forecasts that were   consistently too low, are at work as well?      33    Let me just add a footnote  You made the point that we see foreign   growth slowing; that happened as well in our own forecasts for the US economy  So it may   be that you would not find signs of the new economy in the macro forecast  But looking at   different sectors in the economy could result in a forecast that is more nontraditional in nature    I don't disagree with you, incidentally, about the limited importance of the new economy   element, certainly in Europe  But it is something that could become a factor at some point     Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Twelfth District economy has   continued its robust expansion so far this year  California's economy remains on a strong   growth path, spurred by unusually rapid gains in income and consumer spending  During the   first four months of this year, employment increased at a 3-1/2 percent pace, well above last   year's pace  Personal income gains were sizable last year  And data on state government   revenues suggest that income growth picked up further in the first quarter of this year    Moreover, growth in consumer spending appears to be even more rapid than income growth in   the state  Last year's growth rate in taxable sales was the largest since 1984  Demand for   housing and commercial real estate remains very strong in California as well  For example, in   the San Francisco Bay area, high-tech equity wealth has helped to push up median prices on   existing homes by 25 percent during the past year   Real estate markets in the remainder of   the District also have shown little or no signs of cooling      45  In the District manufacturing sector moderate job losses have continued this year,   but output and sales have been rising in response to improvements in export demand    Although Boeing's employment fell further in the first quarter, the pace of job losses has   slowed  And rising East Asian demand is evident in accelerated delivery schedules on some   previously delayed orders  Moreover, semiconductor manufacturers have benefited from   substantial improvement in worldwide demand  As one example, Intel and another maker of   semiconductors plan investments totaling $3 billion in additional manufacturing capacity in   Arizona  Probably the strongest source of growth in the District recently has been the   software and Internet services sector  The pace of investment in that sector likely will be   reduced by the recent sharp decline in high-tech equity valuations  However, for promising   investments the pool of available venture capital remains very large   Turning to the national economy, recent data certainly have raised a red flag about   inflation  First, although real GDP slowed in the first quarter, real spending--as measured by   real final sales--actually picked up from the very strong fourth-quarter results  Retail sales did   flatten out in April, but it's obviously too soon to conclude that consumers have downshifted   their spending  Second, the further tightening of labor markets in April is not a good sign for   inflation  And third and most importantly, the news on inflation itself has been worrisome    With inflation coming in on the high side in the first quarter, we now have had two straight   quarters with inflation rates that were above the previously established level  The core PCE   price index rose by an average of 19 percent in the past two quarters versus l3 percent over   the four quarters before that  While part of this acceleration could be caused by a one-time   passthrough of higher energy costs to core prices, it is also quite possible that we are   beginning to see a sustained upward trend        46  With regard to our own forecast, we've assumed that the funds rate will reach 6-3/4   percent by the fourth quarter of this year and that the broad stock market will remain   unchanged at recent levels  Under these assumptions we expect to see a gradual slowing in   activity, with real GDP growth averaging 46 percent in the final three quarters of this year   and 39 percent in 2001  But labor and product markets are expected to remain tight through   the end of next year and core inflation to show a gradual upward trend, despite an assumed   rapid growth rate in productivity  The core PCE price index is projected to average 21   percent this year and 22 percent in 2001  Our inflation forecast is up only slightly from   where it had been for some time  The really important new development is that we've seen a   pickup in actual inflation in the past two quarters that might be the beginning of a new trend    In any event, it is now clear that the previously established downward trend has ended at a   level above price stability  Overall, developments since our last meeting have certainly raised   my concerns about inflation significantly  Thank you        Mr Chairman, it seems clear to me that we need to tighten policy   further at this meeting, and I enthusiastically support your recommendation for a 50 basis   point increase  I also believe that the balance of risks remains weighted toward higher   inflation, and incorporating that view in the press release is for me an important part of the   recommendation as well     Dave, the Greenbook mentions that core consumer inflation will be   boosted this year by higher energy prices  I assume that next year, as energy prices come down   according to the Greenbook forecast, core consumer inflation would be reduced  Could you   give me some idea of the size or the precise effects of that on the core consumer inflation rate?       To try to understand what is happening to core inflation, I think it’s   important to make those adjustments because, when the effects of energy prices are factored in,   it looks as if we have a really significant acceleration that begins in 2001           36    That’s exactly my point  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Twelfth District economy has   continued to expand at a rapid pace  The employment growth rate of 36 percent so far this year   is above the national rate of 3 percent  Employment growth was especially rapid in April and   May, with the surge in the latter month largely due to the hiring of temporary Census workers    However, unlike the rest of the nation, the Twelfth District gained private sector jobs in May as   well            40   The California economy has been growing a bit faster than the rest of the District   and its 5 percent unemployment rate is near a 30-year low  Among the other states, Arizona   leads the nation in the percentage growth rate of jobs over the past year  The state’s   manufacturing sector has performed especially well this year, with strong job growth in high-  tech equipment manufacturing adding to the state’s ongoing aerospace expansion  More   generally, makers of semiconductors and related equipment in the District have been expanding   employment and output as demand for District exports has surged  The key exception is exports   of Boeing aircraft from the state of Washington, which fell further, though continued rapid   expansion of the computer services sector has kept growth solid in the Seattle area     In recent months tentative signs of slowing have emerged in residential real estate   markets  The pace of home sales, construction, and price appreciation has slowed in states   besides California, where demand remains very strong relative to supply and housing starts and   home prices have continued to rise rapidly  On the commercial side, conditions also have   remained quite tight in California  The most extreme example is the San Francisco Bay area    In the first quarter, the office vacancy rate was only 1 percent in San Francisco and in the   Silicon Valley, and lease rates jumped 25 percent or more in that quarter alone   Turning to the national economy, recent developments have been somewhat   encouraging  The pace of economic activity apparently slowed to a moderate, more sustainable   rate in April and May  And core inflation returned to the moderate rates that had prevailed prior   to the spike in March  It is far too early to conclude that the economy has gone into a sustained   slowdown  However, recent developments provide room for optimism that inflationary   pressures can be contained, perhaps with less monetary policy tightening than seemed likely   when we met in May           41  With regard to our forecast, we have revised down our estimate of real GDP growth   in the second quarter by a full percentage point to 3-3/4 percent  We expect real GDP to grow   4-1/4 percent this year and 3-3/4 percent next year  This deceleration is due mainly to   tightening financial conditions  We have assumed that the funds rate will be unchanged at this   meeting but will rise another 25 basis points in August, and that equity values will remain   unchanged in real terms through the end of next year  These two factors are expected to have   especially large effects on consumption and housing  Despite this slowdown, tight labor and   product markets can be expected to put upward pressures on core inflation, even after allowing   for accelerating structural productivity  Higher oil prices have boosted overall consumer   inflation so far this year and also have affected core inflation to a lesser extent  Like the   Greenbook, our forecast assumes that oil prices will decline from the third quarter of this year   through the end of 2001  If that occurs, it is likely to reduce core inflation a bit next year and   partially obscure an upward trend in the underlying rate  We expect the core PCE price index to   increase 21 and 22 percent this year and next, well above last year’s 15 percent rate  Overall,   my concerns about inflationary risks have lessened somewhat since we met in May  But I   would still say that going forward the balance of risks for inflation is pretty clearly on the up   side  Thank you     Don, I think the long-run simulations were interesting and useful and   helped us to consider some of the strategic issues we face  The longer-run simulations assume   that the value of the dollar falls rather sharply after 2001--by approximately 5 percent per year, I   think  That boosts the path of the fed funds rate that is necessary to contain inflation  We know   that projections about the value of the dollar are rather uncertain, and I was just curious about   how crucial the size and timing of the dollar’s decline is to the outcome of these simulations  It   looks as if it is a very significant factor     Thank you     Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation     Second     Karen or Dave, the new Greenbook assumptions for potential growth and   your forecast for actual GDP growth are, I believe, way above the market consensus if one looks at   the Blue Chip forecasts, for example  What do you think the chances are that the baseline forecast   may actually be accompanied by a stronger foreign demand for our capital and also a stronger   dollar?  It seems to me that that would be the most likely outcome, given these changes in the   assumptions in the Greenbook forecast  I think this is particularly important since, as your   alternative simulation indicated, that would take some of the pressures off inflation     Well, I’m not saying that their forecast is right     But when they are more convinced about the truth--which is found in the   Greenbook, of course--that would probably affect investors’ appetite for dollars     Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Overall, economic growth in the Twelfth   District picked up in recent months, though we see signs of slowing in housing construction  Also,   high and volatile electricity prices have led to some disruptions in production  For the four months   ended in July, employment in the West grew at an annual rate of 36 percent, up from the 26 percent   pace reported for the first quarter  This is not just due to strength in California, as employment in   five other states in the West is growing well above the rate for the nation  Within the region, job   growth in the Northwest is lagging the rest of the region, but it’s close to the US growth rate  With   the strong growth in the West, labor markets remain tight  The gains in jobs have been broad-based   among the service-producing sectors  While dot-coms are facing a tougher environment, available   evidence in business services points to continued strong employment growth at software and   Internet-related firms  However, signs of slowing in the single-family housing market are present in       32  much of the West  For example, single-family permits have declined this year  Moreover, outside   of California, construction employment has been relatively flat in recent months  Even in rapidly   growing Arizona, construction employment has contracted  In California, conditions in the housing   market are more complicated  Recent weakness in single-family permits has been offset by strength   in multifamily permits  There also has been substantial upward pressure on house prices in much of   the state, primarily because the supply of housing has lagged woefully behind the growth in   underlying demand for several years  Also, analysis by our staff provides support for the commonly   held view that housing prices in the San Francisco Bay area have been boosted by the substantial   increase in wealth of high-tech employees as a result of stock options  Moreover, the analysis   suggests that even with the correction in stock prices this year, those wealth effects are continuing to   boost housing demand in the region     Another notable development in the West is the hike in electricity prices  This has led to   higher direct costs to some users not shielded by rate freezes or fixed-rate contracts  Higher prices   have meant disruptions to and rescheduling of production at some firms  In the Northwest,   aluminum producers drawn to the region by the allure of low-cost hydroelectric power have   announced layoffs and shutdowns of some facilities  In California, the governor reduced the cap on   the wholesale price of electricity from $500 per megawatt hour to $250  Last week prices hit the cap   on each of the five weekdays     Turning to the national scene, the second-quarter slowdown in the growth of real private   demand, especially consumption, was encouraging  Like the Greenbook, we expect slower spending   growth to show up in the real GDP data this quarter  Our forecast is that real output will grow at a   rate of roughly 3-3/4 percent over the rest of the year and at about the same pace next year  In   making this forecast I’m aware that no slowdown is evident in investment spending  These data       33  suggest that there is a risk that output growth may not slow as much as we’re expecting  They also   suggest that productivity growth is likely to remain robust  Robust productivity growth helps keep   the roughly 5 percent ECI growth we are projecting from pushing up inflation  In particular,   incorporating the Board staff’s productivity assumptions leads us to predict slightly less inflation   than does the Greenbook for 2001  Part of the reason is that we incorporated a higher path for the   dollar than is in the Greenbook  This higher path seems appropriate to us in light of the rapid   acceleration assumed for productivity  Nevertheless, core inflation this year and next is still   expected to be higher than it was last year  And it seems to me that the balance of risks remains   tilted toward higher inflation  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I agree with your recommendation  I think this would be a   good time to leave the funds rate unchanged so that we can see how things unfold before considering   another tightening action  I also believe it is important to retain the statement adopted in June that the   balance of risks continues to be toward higher inflation     Peter, my recollection of previous interventions--let’s say going back 10 or   12 years--is that we would be approached by the Treasury which, of course, was receiving a lot of   pressure from another country, and we would act at the request of the Treasury  It sounds as if the   dynamics were a little different this time because you emphasized your discussion with the ECB and                                 discussion with the Chairman  Did you just leave out a part or was it different?      10    And that was the case this time?     That wasn’t clear to me  Thank you     So there’s an institutional change that has really produced the different   approach      Right      11    Good  I think that explains it     Mr Chairman, employment in the West continued to expand at a solid       2-3/4 percent pace in July and August  In contrast to the remainder of the District, California’s job   count has slowed somewhat in recent months  The data show weakness in business services, in part   due to layoffs at some dot-coms, although indications are that those laid off are having no trouble   finding jobs  Construction employment also has tailed off  Even so, the employment statistics may   be overstating the slowing in the State, given that growth in income tax withholding in California   has remained strong     An area of strength in the District has been high-tech activity related to semiconductor   manufacturing  The semiconductor industry has added manufacturing jobs in the District this year,      38  following two years of job cuts  And worldwide semiconductor sales are running well ahead of last   year  The pickup reflects strength in the demand for chips used in Internet-related products, hand-   held computers, and communications devices     Across the District, however, real estate activity--both commercial and residential   construction--is moderating  Office rents have leveled off in a number of cities in the region,   including Los Angeles, San Diego, Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City  In contrast, rents   continue to climb in the San Francisco Bay and the Seattle areas  Prices for wholesale electricity   remain high and volatile in the West  The California Public Utilities Commission has adopted a rate   stabilization plan for the deregulated San Diego area  However, this plan, along with the existing   rate ceilings in other parts of California where deregulation has been only partly phased in, has only   put off the decision about who will cover the billions of dollars in revenue shortfalls for companies   such as San Diego Gas and Electric, Pacific Gas and Electric, and Southern California Edison     Turning to the national economy, I find it encouraging that core inflation hasn’t   accelerated in recent months despite higher oil prices and that the pace of economic activity seems to   have moderated in the third quarter  Like the Greenbook, our real GDP forecast for that quarter   shows an increase of 3 percent, which is down about ½ percentage point from our August forecast    Obviously, it’s too early to tell if the slowdown will be sustained, but developments in financial   markets this year, with modestly lower equity values and a higher dollar in combination with our   past tightening actions, should help to contain demand  Of course, the wild card for both inflation   and economic activity is energy prices, which have defied expectations of a substantial decline for   some time now  Our longer-term forecast shows growth in real GDP slowing from 4-1/4 percent   this year to a range of 3-1/2 to 4 percent next year under the assumptions of no further change in the   funds rate and a constant value of the US dollar       39  Even with the slowdown we are expecting, labor markets will remain tight through the   end of next year, generating some upward pressure on core inflation  Higher energy prices also have   boosted our forecast of core inflation to some extent  As in the Greenbook, our forecast assumes   that energy prices will decline over the next several quarters, which works to obscure upward   pressures in our core inflation measures  We expect core PCE prices to increase about 2 percent this   year and slightly more next year  Overall inflationary risks may have lessened a bit since we met in   August as it now seems more likely that the economy really has entered a slowing phase  But to me   the balance of risks for inflation going forward still is on the up side and I don't think we should be   content with core inflation measures as high as 2 percent, especially given the likelihood that they   may be rising  Thank you     I support your recommendation       It sounds good!     Mr Chairman, I think this information is very helpful and certainly   provides a good grounding for what is to come  And I am sure that is going to be extremely   interesting and also challenging  First, I was wondering if we know anything about the lead times   we would have in terms of being able to look at the material prior to discussing it  Secondly, I      90  wondered whether time would be set aside so that we can discuss this in an environment that may be   slightly more leisurely than, say, after an FOMC meeting and before lunch     This is one of the more significant issues we will have to deal with     Of course     Most of the growth is overseas     It beats taxes     Mr Chairman, it is, but in a way we do have some time to consider the   right decision, particularly if we are willing to change the 25 percent  I agree that there is a sense of   urgency but what really comes through is the importance of the issue, I think     Dave, over the past year the core CPI is up about 2-1/2 percent and the   core PCE is up about 17 percent  Part II of the Greenbook suggests that the difference between   these two indices is almost exclusively due to the imputed prices for non-price services like bank   services  Given that, which index do you think is providing the best indication of core inflation?     On medical care, of course, businesses tell us that they have seen huge   increases over the last 12 months in terms of their costs  I’m not saying which one looks as   though it’s--      The usage has risen  But there’s no doubt that when we budget for   premium increases that we charge our employees, the increases are huge across the board     Sure     Thank you     Mr Chairman, employment in the Twelfth District has continued to   expand at a solid pace in recent months, although growth has slowed slightly from earlier in the   year  District payrolls expanded by 2-1/2 percent during the third quarter, down about 1/2   percentage point from the pace recorded in the first half of the year  The most pronounced   slowing occurred in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska, but growth also slowed in California and   Idaho  However, with the exception of Alaska, each state added jobs at a faster pace than the   nation  In the remaining District states--Arizona, Hawaii, Nevada, and Utah--growth remained   robust or actually accelerated  Overall, the Twelfth District has continued to expand more   rapidly than the rest of the nation in recent months, and as of September contained four of the               35      five fastest growing states in the nation  Solid overall job growth further reduced the District   unemployment rate to just over 4-1/2 percent in September, down about 1/4 percentage point   from August  Despite layoffs among dot-coms and in some areas of manufacturing, employers   in most District states continue to report difficulty finding qualified workers  Many District   firms are increasing investment in labor-saving technologies in response to persistently tight   labor markets, rapid employee turnover, and rising wage and benefit costs  Consistent with low   and declining unemployment, labor costs nevertheless picked up in the third quarter  Employers   in the District report that while hiring and recruitment bonuses remain prevalent, recent stock   market volatility has tempered the use of stock options by Internet-related firms   Construction and services have provided the main boost to the District economy in   recent months  Collectively these two sectors created about 65 percent of net new jobs added   during the third quarter  Job gains in construction were particularly rapid  Payrolls increased by   nearly 7 percent in the third quarter  The services sector expanded by about 4 percent at an   annual rate over the same period, as rapid growth in consumer services offset slowing in business   services   District banks have tightened credit standards and terms for business borrowers    Although overall economic growth has been solid in the District, there is more uncertainty about   the outlook and there have been problems with the quality of loans to some large borrowers  The   small business and middle market portfolios are holding up so far  However, some of the firms   are vulnerable, and credit standards also have been tightened for them  For example, small   businesses that are highly dependent on energy, especially in the San Diego area, have been hit   hard by the high cost of electricity  Also, the building of multiplex theaters has slowed and a               36      large number are expected to close, which could have ripple effects on the other tenants in the   same shopping centers   Turning to the national economy, recent developments have been encouraging and I   have become somewhat more optimistic that inflationary pressures can be contained without   additional action on our part  We have hard evidence of a slowdown in economic activity, at   least in the third quarter, and based on early readings for October the fourth quarter got off to a   moderate start as well  Importantly, productivity growth held up remarkably well in the face of   slower real GDP growth, supporting the view that the supply side of the economy is still   expanding briskly  And core inflation remained moderate in September, even after having been   boosted a bit by higher oil prices Although the case for a sustained slowdown in the economy   has been strengthened, it's still far too early to tell if demand will settle in at a low enough rate to   prevent a significant rise in inflation  And, of course, energy prices remain a wild card    Our current forecast shows real GDP growth of 3-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter    Reflecting recent developments, that figure is down about 1/2 percentage point from our forecast   in early October  We also have lowered our projection for the first half of next year by just   under 1/2 percentage point, based largely on a modest tightening of financial conditions since we   met in early October  Under the assumption of no further change in the federal funds rate, the   broad stock market, or the dollar, we expect to see real GDP increase 3-1/2 percent in 2001    This is a bit weaker than in the Greenbook forecast, but the difference may be largely accounted   for by the dollar's depreciation in that forecast  Despite the slowdown we are anticipating, labor   markets would still be fairly tight by the end of next year and could be expected to put some   upward pressure on core inflation, even assuming the favorable path for structural productivity               37      growth that is in the Greenbook  Assuming that oil prices will decline over the next several   quarters, we expect core PCE to increase by about 2 percent next year  Overall, inflationary   risks appear to be a bit lower than when we met in October, as it now seems more likely that the   economy has really entered a slowing phase while productivity growth has remained robust  But   to me, continuing tightness in labor markets leaves the balance of risks on the up side for   inflation going forward  This risk is an especially serious concern because I’d like eventually to   see inflation below recent levels  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I certainly support your recommendation for an   unchanged funds rate, and I also think it's important to retain the statement of prior   meetings that the balance of risks is toward higher inflation  I believe it is important as   well to explain this in terms of developments that have occurred since our last meeting    And in my view the statement that you read to us accomplishes that very well     Dave, in the forecast, your estimate of potential growth for the next two   years is in the low 4 percent area or something like that  We have forecast GDP growth of 2-1/2   percent, roughly, and have discussed the risk that it could be even slower than that--perhaps by a   percent or two  Should our response and thoughts about policy be different now, given that potential   is quite a bit higher than in the past?  In other words, should the prospect of 0 to 2 percent GDP   growth generate the same level of concern that we would have had maybe five years ago with a 0 to   -2 percent forecast?     But the consequences of the growth rate declining to, say, 0 to 2 percent   could be even more significant  One could get greater employment effects et cetera, and the impact   on inflation eventually could be even stronger     Mr Chairman, employment growth in the Twelfth District has continued   to moderate in recent months  District payrolls have expanded at a 2-1/4 percent pace in recent   months, somewhat below the 3 percent pace of the first half of the year  More moderate   employment growth and declines in the market values of high-tech stocks have begun to show   through to personal income and spending  Data through the third quarter indicate slower growth in   District payroll withholding and other personal income and sales tax revenues  In retail sales, data   for the holiday shopping season point to a slower pace of consumer spending in the District  During   the first 2-1/2 weeks of the shopping season, year-over-year same-store sales increased 3 percent in   the West, down from the 38 percent pace a year earlier    The dot-com shakeup continues but at a slower pace  However, the outlook for District   high-tech manufacturers also has softened recently  In the past couple of months, several high-tech      42  manufacturers in the District have announced downward revisions to earnings forecasts, sending   their stock prices lower  These revisions were based on a number of important fundamentals,   including slower growth in sales of semiconductors and computers, declines in new orders for   electronics and other electrical equipment, a pickup in order cancellations, and increased inventory   accumulation     Rising energy costs have become a major concern for many Twelfth District states  On   the producer side, record-setting prices for natural gas and electricity have pushed a number of   agricultural producers into the red and induced some manufacturers to shut down, with some opting   to sell their forward contracts on energy in the spot market  On the consumer side, as you have read   in the press, major utilities nationally have warned customers that natural gas bills could increase by   50 percent over last year's level  Pacific Gas and Electric estimates that the increase in California   will be 75 percent, due to an especially tight gas market in the West     The most pressing problem in energy markets in the past week occurred in California and   concerned the financial health of major utilities  Due to the gaping divide between wholesale and   retail electricity prices, Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison have accumulated   billions of dollars of undercharges financed largely by borrowing  Given the increasingly uncertain   outlook, the debt of both PG&E and Edison was downgraded last week  Ultimate solutions to the   problem will be political, a process that is currently evolving  Until recently, the bulk of electricity   contracts have been confined to the day ahead in spot markets  The Federal Energy Regulatory   Commission's ruling on Friday is a small positive step in that it will improve forward contracting in   the California electricity markets  The California Public Utilities Commission also has indicated that   it will at least consider some increase in retail electricity prices  However, the increase being   discussed is unlikely to provide much of a solution to the problem      43  Turning to the national economy, recent developments suggest a more pronounced near-  term slowdown than seemed likely when we met last  At the same time, the downside risk to the   outlook certainly has intensified  The recent weakness in consumer spending is especially   noteworthy and the large drop in the preliminary December Michigan index of consumer sentiment   demonstrates a risk that consumers could cut back even more sharply in the near future   We have revised down our forecast of real GDP in both the current quarter and the next   one by about one percentage point to around 2-1/2 percent  Under the assumption that the federal   funds rate, the stock market, and the dollar are all unchanged, our best guess is that growth will pick   up in the second half of next year and that real GDP would rise by just under 3 percent for the year   as a whole  This slowdown in growth from the 4 percent rate expected for this year is readily   explained by tightening financial conditions on a broad range of fronts  And this may be the   slowdown we need to contain inflationary pressures  However, even with a slowdown of this   magnitude, our forecast shows a modest increase in core PCE inflation next year to around 2 percent   from the 1-3/4 percent rate expected this year  While this prospect concerns me, I’m also concerned   that adverse expectations are posing a risk that the economy will weaken more than seems warranted   by the tightenings we've seen in the financial conditions themselves  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Mr Chairman, I can certainly accept your recommendation  When I was   thinking about that possibility at the end of last week, I was concerned that the markets might find it   a bit confusing in terms of what we are trying to communicate  Ironically, as it turns out, the article   that appeared in the Wall Street Journal may make that less of a problem  In addition, it seems to me   that our press statement should be very carefully worded because my concern is that the markets   might be a little confused about how weak we think the economy is and might raise the issue of why      76  we didn't change the funds rate today  So, how our decision is written up could be an important   element in terms of the success of your recommendation      Mr Chairman, I thought the article was abominable     Okay     Mr Chairman, this is Bob Parry  I certainly agree with your   recommendation  I think a 50 basis point cut is appropriate at this point  One question I have   relates to the discount rate  When we were discussing several months ago--I guess it has been   longer than that now--how we might administer the discount rate in the future, we talked about   the possibility that the rate would become a penalty rate  We said then that the appropriate time   for doing that would be when rates were coming down  Is it your thought that this would not be   a time to adopt that new policy with regard to the discount rate because it hasn’t been explained   sufficiently to the market?     Okay, thank you  That makes sense to me     Has Lynn changed the announcement time to one o'clock now?      So it's still 115     Let me mention one other point  Cathy, one thing I have found very   useful in terms of prepared text--and perhaps you take advantage of it as well--is to run it by   Lynn Fox      Well, that helps  That, I think, should take care of the prepared text part     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Many of the points that Michael   Moskow made are similar to those I’d like to make  I’d start by saying that the material   certainly provides a lot for us to digest and I would assume that we’re just beginning the   dialogue on a lot of these issues  Also, I feel as though we probably would benefit by   having others besides those in this room examine some of these issues  So the proposal   made by Bill Poole and variants of it are intriguing     Let me make a couple of points  These are not unique, but they do reflect   where I am at the present time on this issue  First of all, for the near term I certainly   think that reliance on Treasuries to the greatest extent possible is desirable  That leads     1/30-31/01 49  me to suggest that we ought to have a discussion of our self-imposed limits on holding   Treasuries or at least assure ourselves that the limits we have in effect at the present time   are the ones that we want to retain going forward     I also am intrigued by the idea of considering outright purchases of GNMAs,   although they certainly involve some technical complications associated with mortgage   repayments and so forth that would have to be addressed  I’m not in favor of expanding   our use of other GSE obligations  With regard to our RPs, I think there is room for   expanding the collateral we accept  I would say, though--and this is very different from   President Moskow’s view--that I’m a little concerned and would like to hear more about   using foreign collateral  That would expose us to sovereign risk and would, I assume, put   us in the delicate position of having to choose which countries to sanction, so to speak    And I’m not sure I understand how that process would be accomplished     Finally, I find the ACF proposal intriguing  I’m not sure to what extent the   ACF could be used productively, but it’s something that we ought to look at a little more   closely because there probably is a role that it could play  Thank you       Question  How will you determine which foreign securities   will be accepted as RP collateral?  What is going to be the criterion for that?     1/30-31/01 61    Similarly, what about the criteria for municipals?     Would you look at the liquidity of individual state markets?     Relative to its size?      Karen, you indicated that growth in Japan is going to remain   low; you also noted that Japan is probably going to record its fourth consecutive year of   consumer price deflation  That is such a poor outcome for Japan  Do you think this is   likely to cause them to shift in some way their political approach to economic policy?     1/30-31/01 115    Thank you     It sounded rather pessimistic!     1/30-31/01 116    Right     Mr Chairman, Twelfth District employment growth accelerated   in the fourth quarter  The 4 percent annual rate of increase in employment in December   pushed the growth of jobs since September to a bit over 3 percent  The expansion was   broad-based  Five District states reported job growth rates of 3 percent or higher for the   September-to-December period  That includes California, with a growth rate of 3-1/2   percent    One notable cloud weighing on the minds and pocketbooks of consumers and   businesses in the West is the energy situation  Natural gas prices, of course, are up for   the nation as a whole  However, California continues to pay a premium for natural gas    In the California wholesale electric market, spot prices were still over $300 per megawatt   hour last week  By comparison, the average prices for the Pennsylvania, New Jersey,   Maryland interconnection were in the $20 to $40 range  Wholesale prices have remained   high in California even though the state has stepped in as a major purchaser of power    With a large share of generation capacity off line, in order to keep the grid operating a   notable amount of electricity usage was shed through reductions in power to interruptible     1/30-31/01 127  customers in California and a very much smaller amount through rolling blackouts  The   outages represented a little less than 1 percent of overall electricity consumption in the   state for January  The disruptions likely have curtailed economic activity in California   and have hurt profits, though I think we’ll find the impact on output to be less than might   be suggested by the 1 percent share of power shed through outages   Looking toward this summer, by the end of June the state could add as much as   4 percent to generation capacity over that available last June  Under normal   circumstances, that might be enough to meet the increase in demand for electricity, which   has grown on average about 2-1/2 percent in recent years  However, conditions were   very critical last summer  Moreover, the interruptible contracts are already tapped out in   northern California and likely will be exhausted in the southern part of the state by   summer, eliminating one of the tools for managing load on the grid   Another area of uncertainty is the outlook for the supply of hydroelectric   power from the Northwest this summer  California normally imports power from that   region to meet demand during the hot summer months, but winter conditions in the   Northwest have been dry  The bottom line seems to be that come this summer, California   may not find itself in a much better position to meet the demand for electricity than it was   last year   I should mention that several legislative measures are being crafted right now   in Sacramento  These are targeted at allowing the state to procure power and allowing   the utilities to recover the net undercharges they have incurred  As currently envisioned,   this legislation would require that rate fares cover the state’s cost of purchasing   electricity, which could mean higher utility rates  The draft legislation also would allow     1/30-31/01 128  the utilities to recoup a large portion of the billions of dollars of undercharges incurred   since June of last year, and that would be expected to raise their debt ratings  While the   legislation won’t do much to change the basic supply and demand situation in the near   term, California’s efforts to secure long-term electricity contracts could help reduce the   state’s reliance on spot markets     Turning to the national economy--      Yes     No, there are two new plants     This is new capacity  In addition, some plants that are off line   will be coming back because many of them are down temporarily for repairs and related   reasons     Turning to the national economy, the pace of economic activity   appears to have slowed sharply in the current quarter, and output from the manufacturing   sector has been especially hard hit  On the demand side, declining consumer sentiment   and weakness in consumer spending, especially for durables, certainly are noteworthy    Fortunately, our action earlier this month seems to have bolstered confidence in financial   markets a bit, as risk spreads have fallen and equity values have risen  An important     1/30-31/01 129  element in these favorable reactions appears to be an expectation that we’ll take further   substantial action at this meeting and again later on    We’ve lowered our forecast of real GDP growth in the current quarter by about   1-1/4 percentage points to a rate around 1 percent, although I certainly wouldn’t rule out   the weaker scenario in the Greenbook  In our forecast we have assumed that the federal   funds rate is reduced by 50 basis points at this meeting and that the stock market and the   value of the dollar are unchanged  Under those assumptions, our best estimate is that   growth will pick up moderately through the rest of this year and average just over 2   percent for the year as a whole  Recent data on the CPI and ECI have been encouraging    Moreover, a slowdown in economic activity of the magnitude we’re projecting is capable   of providing the relief we’ve been looking for from the inflationary pressures inherent in   today’s tight labor markets  We expect core PCE prices to increase about 2 percent both   this year and next year  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I enthusiastically support your recommendation    It seems to me that the financial markets clearly are expecting a move of this magnitude   and if we were not to move along these lines, I think it could cause some problems     Some Reserve Banks are not in and it’s confusing  Is that what   you’re saying?     Not necessarily   SPEAKER(?)  It won’t be effective today in St Louis     Karen, I’d like to ask two questions about Japan  The first is,   does the change announced by Japan indicate that in terms of policy they’re embracing   some form of inflation targeting?  Secondly, about a month ago there was some   discussion, in the press at least, indicating that if Japan reverted to its previous policy of   zero interest rates, Hayami would be forced to resign  I haven’t heard anything about that   in the last few days  I wondered if you could comment on both of those elements     Right     Thank you     Mr Chairman, economic growth in the West has undergone a   notable retrenchment this year from what had been a very rapid expansion  However,   revised data now put Twelfth District job growth for last year at 3-1/2 percent, making it   the fifth consecutive year of growth at 3-plus percent  But this year, tangible signs of   slowing are evident on a number of fronts  In high-tech--beyond the direct effects of the   return to reality in the dotcom sector, which are modest--softening is apparent in   manufacturing  Across product lines we see producers cutting investment plans and   reducing jobs as they transition from their considerable optimism in the year 2000 to   weaker demand this year  The shakeout among Internet firms continues to have some   impact on commercial real estate in tech centers, though office markets are basically   sound  Residential markets are mixed, with some pickup in permits  However, price   performance outside of California and Hawaii is somewhat weaker  In coming months,   home prices likely will be affected further by the decline in stock prices and withering   options values, especially in California where exercised options accounted for about 13   percent of wage and salary income in 2000   The energy situation remains a distinct negative  For natural gas the most   extreme example of price hikes is the 150 percent increase over the past year for   customers of PG&E in northern California, more than twice the national average    Regarding electricity, milder weather has brought down wholesale electricity prices in the   West, though on-peak spot prices still are more than five times higher than on the East   Coast  In California, power outages this summer seem inevitable unless we see at least a     3/20/01 31  10 percent reduction in usage  This inevitability was dramatically illustrated by the   rolling blackouts experienced yesterday  Also, average wholesale costs in the West will   be high again this summer since a good deal of the states’ power will be bought on the   spot market to cover peak usage  However, rate payers in California continue to be   shielded from the high wholesale prices, with the State buying most of the power and   accumulating the undercharges  We estimate that a full pass-through of wholesale   electricity costs would mean another 70 percent rate hike       Yes, 70  Data on the recent performance of the national   economy have been mixed  Job growth, for instance, has held up better than we had   expected  On the other hand, the industrial sector is contracting sharply  Overall, the   recent data have been roughly offsetting, resulting in no change in our forecast that the   economy will grow at a rate of 1 to 1-1/2 percent over the first half of this year     By contrast, recent developments in the financial markets are more negative   for the longer-term outlook  The lower stock market likely signals slower growth in   spending  And the stronger dollar, which is probably a reflection of worsening   conditions in some key foreign economies, could slow our output growth  In response,   we have lowered the assumed funds rate path by 50 basis points  As a consequence, our   forecast of output growth beyond the first half of the year is just marginally lower than it   was last time  We now expect the real GDP growth rate to come in at 2-1/2 percent in the   second half of the year and almost 3-1/2 percent in 2002, as the positive effects of the   recent technology shock gradually reassert themselves       3/20/01 32  Since output growth in our forecast remains below potential throughout the   forecast horizon, labor market tightness is eliminated by late next year  That helps to   contain inflation  Core PCE inflation is projected to come in at 2 percent this year and   just a bit lower next year  Despite the assumed reduction in the funds rate, I must admit   that we still see downside risks to the economy  My concern is based in part on the   recent declines in consumer confidence surveys  Some recent work by our staff shows   that these surveys may provide useful information about contemporaneous conditions   before other data on the economy become available  This concern is reinforced by the   recent behavior of the stock market  Taken together these expectations-based indicators   suggest that many households and businesses expect to see an economy that is weaker   than in our forecast  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I support a 50 basis point cut in the funds rate   and I also support a statement that the risks remain weighted toward economic weakness    I, too, share your concern about a 75 basis point cut at this time  To me the recent data   on employment and spending do not suggest that things are as bad as the stock market, or     3/20/01 95  for that matter consumers in general, seems to think  This makes it likely that at least   part of the market’s decline represents a return to more rational stock valuations  Under   these conditions, a 75 basis point cut in the funds rate now could provide a false sense of   security to the stock market  People might be led to believe that the Fed is attempting to   validate recent historically high valuations in equity markets  Thank you     Why don't you read it?     Mr Chairman, this is Bob Parry  We had four branch meetings   last week and I must say that I detected a real change in the tone of our directors’   comments  I got the impression that they are significantly more pessimistic about what is   happening at the current time and what is likely to happen in the future  Also, I must   admit that in meeting with people on a more casual basis over the last couple of weeks,   an increased degree of pessimism seems to characterize the comments that I hear    When I look at developments in the District, it would be hard for me to say that   a fundamental change has occurred since our meeting  But there is no question that the   uncertainties have intensified  It looks as though the adjustment in the high-tech area--  and that adjustment involves plans for capital spending--is going to be greater and more   intense than many of the people in the industry thought as recently as a month or two ago  I’d also say that pessimism has been growing about the possibility, especially this     4/11/01 14   summer, of negative fallout from recent energy developments, including the bankruptcy   of PG&E  I talked with the                          yesterday and he indicated that about 11,000   to 15,000 suppliers to PG&E will now receive payments based on what the bankruptcy   court suggests  So I must admit that I certainly came to this meeting prepared to go along   with the idea of a reduction in rates  Also, if we are going to have intermeeting changes,   I found attractive some of the comments that Bob McTeer made about the timing  Thank   you    This is Bob Parry  I have a question  In light of the trade data,   what would be the best estimate now for growth in the first quarter?     Okay, thank you     Mr Chairman, I certainly support your recommendation  We   had a board meeting this past Thursday and the information we received from our   directors confirmed the view that economic conditions were weakening in the District    There was a bit of disagreement from those representing parts of the District, particularly   southern California and Arizona, where the situation is perhaps not quite as bad  But in   general I think there is concern that the statistics are not looking good and are probably   not going to look good over the next several months     Another point I’d make is that based on consensus estimates of the CPI for the   second quarter--though I know this is a slippery number--it’s quite likely that the real   funds rate is rather high now relative to where we might want it to be, given such a weak   economy  Thank you     4/18/01 6      Mr Chairman?     This is a question for Dino or for Don Kohn  As shown on page 2 of   Dino’s handout, the yields on 10-year and 30-year Treasury bonds actually hit a low point at   roughly the time of the March FOMC meeting and, of course, have moved up since then  It’s   rather interesting that since that time in March the Greenbook forecast--and also I think most   private forecasts--has become a little more pessimistic about the economy’s prospects, at least   for the shorter term  Does this mean that the movement in rates is really due to a reevaluation of   longer-run expectations for inflation?     Well, usually there are two reasons  Your answer implied one, which is   that the decline in the funds rate raises the prospects that the economy will recover  And the   other is the possibility that inflation could become more of a concern        Right     Of course, the Greenbook forecast would suggest that the price   pressures, if anything, are likely to be a little less      Thank you     Karen, I have a couple of questions about Japan  The Greenbook   projection indicates that by the end of 2002 consumer prices will have declined in Japan in each   of the preceding four years  And the quarterly table has consumer prices declining in every   quarter over the three years through 2002  What would you say are the implications of such an   outcome for the banks in Japan, given the problems they face, and for the equity markets?  Have     5/15/01     21   policies been put in place that will end this downward spiral?   If not, what do you feel the   Japanese should do?     Right     Thank you     Mr Chairman, the Twelfth District economy has slowed considerably in   recent months  District payroll employment expanded at an annual rate of less than 1 percent in   the first quarter, a significant change from the near 3 percent pace reported in the fourth quarter    Slower employment growth has boosted unemployment rates in most District states in recent   months  However, as of yet, slackening labor markets have not resulted in lower wage inflation   in the District  Data from the March ECI showed that total compensation in the West grew by 5   percent over the past four quarters, a little above the rate for the prior four quarters and well   above the rates of the other three US regions  Still, District contacts report greater ease in   finding qualified workers and a reduction in employee turnover     The District’s technology sector has continued to weaken in recent months  On top of   the ongoing shakeout among dot-com firms, nearly every major high-tech manufacturer in our   area has announced layoffs  A number of software firms have scaled back as well, especially in   their demand for contract staff and temporary workers  High-tech companies increasingly are   instituting forced furloughs and across-the-board wage reductions for remaining staff in an effort   to control costs      5/15/01     36   Because of the prominent role that high-tech firms play in many District states, slowing   in the technology sector has begun to damp expansion in other sectors of the economy  For   example, vacancies are up and lease rates are falling in a number of commercial office markets    And personal income gains have slowed noticeably  Data through the fourth quarter point to   substantial slowing in personal income tax revenues, with additional weakening expected this   year  Slower personal income growth and the decline in the stock market have begun to temper   consumer spending and state government budgets  Retail sales in the West grew by about 3   percent in nominal terms during the first quarter, well off the 8 percent pace of 2000  Home   price appreciation also has eased, with weaker price performance even in the District’s hottest   markets  And a number of state governments have announced that revenues in 2001 likely will   fall below budgeted expenditures   Turning to electricity, warm weather in California earlier this month resulted in the first   rolling blackouts of the summer season  The California Independent System Operator, which   operates the power grid for most of California, estimates that unless usage is curtailed the state   could hit peak loads that exceed forecasted supply on 34 days this summer  That estimate is   based upon assumptions that weather conditions and usage are similar to those experienced last   summer  Other states in the District expect to have ample supplies of electricity this summer    However, spillover effects from California will push up the average cost of power for consumers   in some states, especially those in the Pacific Northwest       Turning briefly to the national economy, recent developments taken as a whole have   led us to revise down our expectations for real GDP growth this year and next  Our current   forecast is for growth of less than 1 percent this quarter, followed by an increase of around 2   percent for the third quarter  If we assume a further cut in the funds rate at this meeting, our best     5/15/01     37   estimate is that economic growth will rebound to the low 3 percent range late this year and next   year  However, there are some significant downside risks  One of them relates to consumption    With consumer confidence and stock market wealth down from last year and the unemployment   rate on the rise, consumers may wish to boost their saving, which could weaken economic   activity  At the same time, business investment appears fragile and the perceived over-capacity   of high-tech capital may damp investment more than we anticipate    With respect to inflation, we expect increases in the core PCE price index of just over 2   percent this year and just under 2 percent next year, up from a 16 percent rise in 2000  That is   certainly higher than I would like  However, any remaining upward pressure from tight labor   and product markets is likely to have dissipated by sometime next year, setting the stage for an   improved inflation outlook over the longer term  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I believe that it would be prudent to cut the rate further   and I support your proposed reduction of 50 basis points  For this meeting I also prefer to retain a   balance of risks statement weighted toward economic weakness  However, I think we are getting   close to the point where we should seriously re-examine that stance  Thank you    Mr Chairman, I'd like to ask the authors to comment about the paper   that we all received by John Fernald of the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank  It seems to me that   the inclusion of adjustment costs is theoretically a justifiable inclusion  In terms of that paper, it   certainly results in a decidedly more optimistic view of structural productivity going forward  I   would like to hear your views regarding Fernald’s estimates and also their implications  I must   admit that Dan Sichel’s comment, when he indicated that in your approach you ignore the cost of   adjusting capital stock, is somewhat unsatisfying to me  I would appreciate your commenting on   the paper by Fernald    Well, when you think about how we use structural productivity growth   in terms of policy, it involves a shorter timeframe  And the assumption that I think we are   making--that the adjustment cost is zero--probably is not an optimal assumption    But that capital has been sold and purchased at a lower price and is   yielding a very good yield for those companies that bought it    Mr Chairman, the Twelfth District economy decelerated in recent   weeks, with slowing evident in most states and sectors, although the growth rate of California   exceeded by a substantial margin the growth rate of Ohio  [Laughter] Job growth in the District   in April and May averaged 07 percent at an annual rate, for a net addition of less than 30,000   jobs The slowdown has been especially pronounced in the District's technology sector, where   firms are laying off workers, writing off inventories, and delaying construction on planned   expansions Between January and May the District's technology sector has reduced employment   by nearly 20,000 net jobs  Because of the prominent role that high-tech firms play in the District,   slowing in the tech sector has had a negative effect extending well beyond that sector   Energy markets in the West have looked almost normal in recent weeks  But the   region still faces supply and demand imbalances, high prices, and unresolved financial issues    Wholesale spot electricity prices in mid-June fell below $100 per megawatt hour for the first time   in over a year, though that still left prices well above wholesale spot prices in other areas of the   country The decline in wholesale prices can be attributed to several factors  More generation   came back on line in California; the price of natural gas in the state dropped close to levels in   other markets; and the state got a temporary increase of hydropower from the Northwest as the   winter snow pack melted  Also, with the long-term electricity contract signed by the state, much   less of California's power is being bought on the spot market    Perhaps most notable is the decline in energy consumption  Electricity usage in   California has been lower in every month this year compared with last year  The state is   depending on continued conservation this summer  That is because most of the planned addition   of new capacity will come on line slowly over the next several months and the outlook for     6/26-27/01 91   imports from the Northwest is uncertain  In addition to voluntary and funded conservation   programs in California, the substantial increase in electricity rates should curtail demand  It's true   that over half of households are exempt from the recent rate increase but others are being hit with   marginal increases of 30 percent or more this year  The nonresidential rate increases will affect   nearly all businesses and are closer to 50 percent this year  While the higher rates will damp   demand, electricity prices in California are now so high that they have neutralized the benefit of   the state's temperate climate on energy expenditures  While high relative prices are never   popular, getting convergence of wholesale and retail rates may be the only hope for more order in   California's energy market  It's also important that the state repay the general fund for the money   spent by the California's Department of Water Resources and Electricity  With the $8 billion   allocated from the general fund nearly depleted and the issuance of the $125 billion in revenue   bonds delayed, the Department of Water Resources has secured $43 billion in short-term bridge   financing which they likely will draw on in July  With tax revenue growth slowing along with   the economy, the state is counting on the bond issuance to replenish its general fund   Turning to the national economy, the economic news, especially for the industrial   sector, has continued to be disappointing, even when compared with our modest expectations    We have revised down our forecast for real GDP to little growth this quarter and to around 2   percent for the second half  Despite these recent shortfalls, our best estimate continues to be that   economic growth will rebound next year, perhaps to the 3 to 3-1/2 percent range, based on the   stimulus from the substantial easing of monetary policy this year and also on the recent changes   we've seen in fiscal policy  However, as we all know, there are downside risks  First, there is the   obvious risk still in the stock market  The potential effects, I believe, are nicely illustrated in the   simulation presented in the Greenbook  Second, we could see a continuation of the pattern that     6/26-27/01 92   has persisted for some time now in which the dollar keeps rising above expectations and foreign   growth keeps weakening more than we expect  With respect to inflation, we anticipate increases   in the core PCE index of just over 2 percent this year and of just under 2 percent next year  That   is higher than I'd like to see for the long run  However, I don't think we are at the point where the   risks of economic weakness and future inflationary pressures are balanced  Thank you    Mr Chairman, I support a further cut in the funds rate to provide a bit   more insurance against additional downside surprises  Therefore, I would support your   recommendation of 25 basis points  I also support retaining the balance of risks statement   weighted toward economic weakness  You mentioned that it would be desirable to indicate in the   statement something about the amount of easing to date  It seems to me that in addition to that   we should make the point that those cuts will have a significant cumulative impact that extends   beyond the near term    Second    David, you mentioned three considerations that we might want to take   into account as we look at the forecast  The second was that the variability in aggregate supply   gets translated pretty much on a one-for-one basis into the variability in aggregate demand  I     8/21/01 12   must admit I was a little surprised by that in the sense that although current short-term prospects   for earnings and for income are likely to affect demand, I believe that permanent income also   plays some role  If that’s the case--if there are more permanent influences--in terms of aggregate   demand, wouldn’t there be less of a response than a one-for-one change?    Permanent income as well?    Thank you    Mr Chairman, the economic climate in the Twelfth District has turned   negative as the high-tech downturn has intensified and spilled over into other sectors  During the   three months ending in July, District employment contracted 03 percent at an annual rate for a   net loss of about 19,000 jobs Downsizing among technology firms was especially pronounced    Between May and July, employment at high-tech manufacturers and business service firms   combined fell by about 8 percent at an annual rate, substantially above the pace of contraction   during the first four months of the year  The intensity of the cutbacks among District technology   firms has begun to drag down employment growth in other sectors  Employment contracted in   construction and also fell in shipping, trucking, and warehousing during the three months ending   in July And job gains in retail and wholesale trade have slowed to an anemic pace  The general   impact of the technology-driven downturn is evident in the District’s high-tech centers  For   example, the San Francisco Bay area has lost almost 35,000 jobs in the past four months, as both   tech and non-tech employers have scaled back  Employment in Portland and Phoenix also has   contracted in recent months and job growth in Seattle has slowed substantially  In general, the   technology-driven downturn has dramatically altered the regional pattern of growth in the   District this year, with last year’s fast-growing areas either contracting or moving laterally     8/21/01 21   Turning to energy markets, cooler temperatures, sluggish economic activity, and   continued conservation have reduced electricity usage in California in recent weeks, easing the   demand and supply imbalance that has plagued the state for most of the year  Better market   conditions and lower natural gas prices have resulted in wholesale spot electricity prices of   around $50 per megawatt hour in mid-August, well below the $200 average recorded for May    While lower wholesale prices generally are good news for California, the declines are not likely   to reverse the trend in retail rate hikes that took effect in June  A number of factors will keep   those rates up The California Department of Water Resources, which currently is purchasing   electricity for California’s major utilities, needs the revenue to cover past costs and what have   turned out to be relatively high prices on long-term contracts  And the public utilities want   assurances that retail rates will allow them to recoup past losses in addition to covering costs   going forward Right now concern on the part of utilities over the adequacy of the current rate   structure is holding up the issuance of $125 billion in revenue bonds meant to repay the state for   the billions of dollars the Department of Water Resources has spent on electricity this year  At   this point, it looks as if the bonds will not be issued before October or even November  Given   the delay in issuance, cash flow constraints likely will lead the state to issue revenue anticipation   bonds The state controller has indicated that these bonds, which would be issued after Labor   Day, could amount to $57 billion   Turning to the national economy, the industrial output and retail sales reports for July   may raise a glimmer of hope that the economy is beginning to turn around  However, it seems   fair to say that the recent data taken together show few, if any, signs of a pickup in activity  Our   best guess is for growth of around 1 percent in the current quarter  After that, several factors   should operate at about the same time to stimulate faster growth, including the stimulus from     8/21/01 22   monetary policy and a tax cut that has turned out to be timed almost perfectly  We should have a   better idea of how much of an effect it is having on consumer spending by our next meeting  In   addition, the substantial turnaround in energy prices this year should help to promote a pickup in   activity    For next year our forecast, which like the Greenbook assumes no further change in the   funds rate, shows real GDP growth increasing to more acceptable rates of around 3 percent  Of   course, there are some notable downside risks in the economy, having to do especially with   consumer spending and developments abroad  Overall, our forecast would leave labor and   product markets about in line with their average long-run utilization levels and there would be   little upward or downward pressure on inflation next year  We are looking for inflation in the   core PCE price index of just below 2 percent both this year and next  While it’s obviously good   that we don’t appear to be facing rising inflationary pressures, I think it’s also worth noting that   the current period of slow growth could be completed without the kind of reduction in inflation   that often accompanies such periods  This outcome would be disappointing since I certainly   would like to see a further modest decline in inflation over time  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, for me the policy choice is a close call  While I can   support the proposed easing, I do think there are some reasonable arguments for leaving the   funds rate unchanged at this time  First, there appears to be a consensus--supported by our   outlook, the Greenbook, and even the lower 10 percent of the Blue Chip panel of forecasters--  that there already is enough stimulus in the pipeline to produce a significant pickup in activity in   the next year or so Second, although I certainly hope you are correct in your expectation that     8/21/01 72   the inflation figures may turn out a bit better than most forecasts indicate, there is a chance that   the current period of slow growth will end with little or no reduction in inflation  So we might   be missing a chance for a little opportunistic progress on inflation  Third, we will know quite a   bit more by our October meeting, especially about the effects of the tax rebate  So an argument   can be made that we should wait for more information  While I’m concerned about these   considerations, I do support a 25 basis point cut in the funds rate as some insurance against   additional downside surprises for economic activity  I also would prefer to retain the balance of   risks statement weighted toward economic weakness    Mr Chairman, this is Bob Parry    It seemed to me that in the days leading up to Tuesday the   economic situation was looking weaker, and the information we’ve received from the   Michigan survey would certainly suggest that as well  As a result of what has happened,   I must admit that at least over the short to intermediate term I can’t find anything that   would be of a positive nature And I can identify many potentially negative   developments, including the impacts on air travel and the airlines themselves, plans for   recreation or vacations, and things of that sort  So it seems to me that many of the risks   to economic growth that we talked about at our previous meetings have become, if   anything, more visible and concrete  That would suggest to me that a move on the funds     9/13/01 14   rate would be called for, although I’m not saying today is the day  Nevertheless, I would   favor a move soon, whenever you feel the proper day would be, and I would not favor a   25 basis point move  I think it would be appropriate to do something of a more   substantive nature, certainly something that would at least be in accord with what seems   to be reflected in the futures market  Thank you    Mr Chairman, this is Bob Parry  I enthusiastically support   your recommendation  I was wondering at what time this change would be announced    Okay Thank you    I had a question about Japan as well  When I look at the tables   in Part I of the Greenbook it seems stunning--I don’t know if that’s the right word--to see   with the addition of the forecast for 2003 what will be five years of deflation for Japan   and a pickup in economic growth that is quite modest  And, of course, we’ve seen those   projected pickups disappear in the past This certainly says something, I think, about the   effectiveness of their policy, not just in 2001 but over the next two-plus years  It surely   has some major economic implications but possibly political implications as well  I   wonder if you’d comment on that    Thank you    Mr Chairman, economic activity in the Twelfth District was   weak even before the terrorist attacks  Employment contracted in July and then was   nearly flat in August On net it fell about 1 percent at an annual rate in the two months    The main source of weakness was the high-tech sector  High-tech equipment   manufacturers have been shedding jobs all year and the pace of decline accelerated   substantially in July and August, with cuts at double-digit rates reported in California,   Arizona, and Oregon High-tech service providers also have been cutting jobs, including   the loss of over 5 percent of employment in that sector in the State of Washington during   July and August alone   The slowdown was also evident in other sectors such as construction  Vacancy   rates for office space have risen substantially in most metro areas, and home sales and   price appreciation have come down as well  The slowdown in construction activity so far   this year is most evident in the San Francisco Bay area, where the number of permits for   new homes is running 13 percent below last year’s numbers  Consumer spending and   confidence in the District, which had been holding up well in the spring and early     10/2/01 32   summer, showed signs of weakening in early September  Of course, these weaknesses   have been exacerbated in the aftermath of the attacks     The immediate economic effects of the attacks included substantial reductions   in consumer spending and some disruptions in business activity  Since then retail sales   among large discount stores have recovered, though sales at department stores have   remained depressed  As a result, for some apparel manufacturers clothing orders for   spring reportedly are running well below pre-attack expectations  By contrast,   construction activity in recent weeks has not been affected to any appreciable degree    However, the postponement or cancellation of some projects means that the pipeline is   not filling up as fast as before   The largest negative effects of the attacks have been on air travel and tourism,   as was indicated by President Moskow Due to the resulting bleak outlook, Boeing--and I   think our numbers about Boeing are similar to those presented by President Moskow--   immediately cut its estimated deliveries of commercial aircraft next year by 20 percent,   with substantial additional cuts expected in 2003  In Seattle as many as 20,000 jobs   could be lost at Boeing by the end of next year  District contacts have reported that   airline bookings have been running 50 percent or more below normal  And in cities like   San Francisco, where 85 percent of the hotel demand is derived from arrivals by air, hotel   occupancies are very low As a result, substantial layoffs are under way or planned by   airports, airlines, and firms in other segments of the travel industry  Although this has   been felt nationwide, the impact will be especially hard on some Twelfth District states   that have unusually large tourism and travel sectors, notably Nevada and Hawaii, whose   tourism sectors had already begun to struggle prior to the attacks        10/2/01 33   Let me turn to the national picture  I certainly won’t take exception to the   widely held view that the terrorist attacks probably ended any chance of avoiding   recession In this regard, a member of our staff has taken a careful look at the monthly   indicators and methods used by the NBER to date recessions He concludes that if, as   seems likely, activity falls enough in coming months for the NBER to declare a recession,   the business cycle peak could well be backdated to the first half of this year and perhaps   as early as March This date would represent a compromise among the unusually diverse   peaks in the various data series that the NBER relies upon     In any event, our forecast for the second half of this year is similar to that of   the Greenbook It shows a small decline in real GDP in the third quarter and a drop of   1/2 to 1 percent in the fourth quarter Assuming a funds rate of 2-1/2 percent, the most   likely scenario for next year seems to be a gradual pickup in growth, especially in   response to the easing of monetary policy as well as recent and expected fiscal actions    However, while growth should be more acceptable, it will likely remain well below the   potential rate for some time  The exceptionally large risks surrounding the outlook are   skewed to the weak side, especially in view of the potential hit to confidence that would   go along with likely military action and possible additional terrorism  Another risk is the   deepening stagnation of economies around the globe   We have revised down our inflation forecast by about 1/2 percent since the   August meeting, obviously in response to the greater expected slack in labor and product   markets and a lower path for oil prices, but also due to negative speed effects  Our best   estimate is for inflation of about 1-1/2 percent in the core PCE price index in 2002    Given the economic outlook as well as its downside risks, there is a strong argument for     10/2/01 34   implementing the additional cut in the funds rate that underlies our forecast and that in   the Greenbook Thank you    Don, I’d like to ask you and Dave a question about the chart   and table in the Bluebook on Chart 4 following page 10  We’ve talked a bit about the   equilibrium real rate as a way to measure the current stance of policy  If one believes that   the equilibrium real rate is within the range of the shaded areas, the range has gotten so   large that it leads one to believe, based on the Treasury inflation-indexed securities, that   our policy is incredibly expansive On the other hand, if one looks at some of the lower   estimates, particularly the one based on historical data and the staff forecast, it appears as   if we’re providing an anemic amount of stimulus  I was thinking that perhaps you have   some feelings or views about what rate within this historically wide range it might be   reasonable for us to focus on    So you think the degree of monetary ease is, pick one  huge,   moderate, or meager?    Thank you     10/2/01 81    I support your recommendation    Dave, I have a question and also a comment about the forecast  In looking   at the sources of weakness in the short term, a large portion of it comes from residential investment    It strikes me that there certainly are some positive fundamentals in this area  In September, for   example, starts continued to increase  Moreover, the financial fundamentals in housing are still quite   good and the falloff in permits was actually quite small  I can see that the negative effects of higher   unemployment rates and the impact on confidence might be playing a role, but why does that seem   to have so much of a role in the residential sector and, in my view, not much of a role in personal   consumption expenditures?  I ask because in your forecast personal consumption expenditures in the   current quarter and even in the subsequent quarter aren’t all that weak    Eight-tenths of a percentage point of the decline in real GDP this quarter is   due to residential investment, and that’s a small sector    I also have a comment about the partial expensing investment tax   incentive Given that the proposal is for a three-year period, and recognizing some of the points Al   Broaddus made--that the capacity utilization rate is so low and that the current economic situation is   so poor and likely to remain so for a while--why wouldn’t the resultant investment be back-loaded   more?  The lead times needed for much of the equipment are short  I don’t know how you made the   decision about how to spread out the investment, but as an alternative I think you clearly could have   spread it in a way that is much more back-loaded than you did    Have we gotten any greater visibility about what is likely to happen in   terms of Congressional action on this?    That incentive is for a period of months versus three years    Right    Mr Chairman, the fallout from the September 11 attacks has intensified   existing weakness in the Twelfth District economy  The high-tech sector has been struggling for the   past year and now the timeline for recovery has been pushed back by business firms in the aftermath   of the attacks The latest figures show that California’s high-tech manufacturers reduced payrolls by   more than 12,000 in the third quarter alone, which accounts for nearly half of the 29,000 jobs lost on   net in the state The impact has been especially visible in the San Francisco Bay area office market   where vacancy rates recently rose above those in Los Angeles for the first time in recent memory    And with struggling companies accounting for much of the space made available through subleases,   the full financial effect on landlords has yet to be felt       11/6/01 27   More generally, construction activity has fallen throughout the District in recent months   and a sharp drop in September may herald further weakening    It’s primarily commercial  Southern California had been the main pocket   of economic vitality in the District through August, showing substantial strength in housing demand   and population-based services like education and health  But weak September employment numbers   suggest that the slowdown may be taking hold there as well  The slowdown in southern California   will be exacerbated by the ongoing reduction in travel spending resulting from the terrorist attacks   Compared to most areas of the country, the Twelfth District is somewhat more exposed to the travel   slowdown, with states such as Hawaii and Nevada relying heavily on tourism dollars  Although   travel sectors overall are less critical to District activity than the high-tech sector, a continued   slowdown in travel activity on the order of 10 to 15 percent will reduce District growth noticeably    Some impacts of the travel slowdown already are evident, with the latest data on new   unemployment insurance claims confirming a sharp increase in District layoffs, especially in Hawaii   and Nevada, in the weeks following the attacks  And Seattle will soon feel the impact as well when   Boeing initiates production cuts and implements its planned layoffs of up to 20,000 commercial   aircraft workers there Moreover, state and local governments and their creditors are on alert in   much of the District as many areas expect significant revenue shortfalls of up to 8 percent this fiscal   year compared to pre-September 11 predictions  The negative impacts of the travel slowdown will   be offset somewhat by increased spending on military hardware in some areas, including weapons   systems manufactured in Arizona and southern California  However, the amounts spent by the   federal government are likely to represent only a partial offset, especially in the short term     11/6/01 28   Let me now turn to the macro picture  An official recession this year appears   unavoidable With the October employment report, the data in hand now have the depth and   duration to declare a recession Furthermore, given last summer’s weakness in various monthly   indicators, it seems likely that the start of the present recession will be dated back into the spring    Looking ahead, the recession in our forecast is not as deep as the Greenbook’s  But our projected   recovery next year develops more slowly than in the Greenbook forecast  Assuming a funds rate of   2-1/4 percent, we anticipate a more gradual pickup in growth, largely in response to monetary and   fiscal policy actions  This recovery primarily mirrors the unusually gradual slowdown over the past   year It took a year for real GDP to decelerate slowly from growth of about 1-1/2 percent during the   second half of last year to last quarter’s decline of 04 percent  This slow erosion of growth reflected   a long sequence of causal shocks the jump in energy prices, the slowing in demand abroad, the   bursting of the asset price bubble, the related re-evaluation of desired capital stocks, and, of course,   the events of September 11th Some recessions in the past resulted from one big shock, but this one   seems to have had many causes  The unwinding of these many shocks also will take time, and in our   forecast, recovery progresses fairly slowly     Our inflation forecast is little revised  Our best estimate is for inflation of about 1-1/2   percent in the core CPE price index in 2002  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Wow!    Mr Chairman, I agree with your preference for a 50 basis point cut in the   funds rate For me the downside risks to the outlook are sizable as illustrated by emerging data,   which keep signaling lower and lower forecasts for real GDP growth  Also, as noted in the   Bluebook and commented on by Governor Meyer and by you, a larger preemptive easing move now   may reduce the risk of being constrained later by the zero nominal interest rate bound  I think that’s   another compelling reason to do 50 basis points at this time    Or how about just the “reallocation of resources”?    “May restrain advances?”    I’d like to ask two short questions  The first one is to Dave Stockton and   perhaps Don Kohn In the Greenbook and also the Monday morning briefing there was a report about   the Michigan survey of one-year-ahead inflation expectations, indicating that it dropped to 28 percent   in September, to 1 percent in October, to 04 percent in November, and then bounced back to 16   percent in December  It seems to me that there’s some potentially very interesting information there    After all, we’re very much interested in what is happening to the real federal funds rate  I just   wondered how those data, admittedly volatile but still considerably below what we have been looking   at in the recent past, are influencing your views about the real interest rate as far as the fed funds rate   is concerned?    So, you don’t think policy is as easy as you previously thought?    I’d also like to ask Dave Howard a quick question  The revision to the   forecast for Japan is pretty stunning, particularly real growth being revised down 1/2 percent in 2002    In addition, there’s deflation in every quarter through 2003  One has to begin to wonder about the   impact of this in the financial sector  My question is  What is your current view about the   probabilities of a crisis in the financial sector in Japan in light of this possible forecast outcome for the   next two years?    Thank you     12/11/01 25     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic conditions in the Twelfth District   have been weak, but there were a few signs of improvement recently  It’s now clear that the terrorist   attacks severely damaged economic conditions in tourist-dependent areas  In October, travel-related   employment fell about 3 percent in Hawaii and Nevada  Significant losses were evident in most other   states as well and on net the District’s transportation and services sectors contracted substantially  As   a result of the shrinkage in these sectors and others, new claims for unemployment insurance surged   and unemployment rates increased noticeably in most areas  Since mid-October the surge in such   claims has receded somewhat but the levels of claims remain elevated, suggesting that unemployment   rates in these areas probably rose in November as well  The San Francisco Bay area has seen rapid job   destruction all year, especially among high-tech companies  Unemployment there has increased by   around 11,000 people per month since the first of the year and that pace doubled in October    Accordingly, the share of job losers in California’s unemployment pool has risen  And if   unemployment durations last as long as usual, we’re likely to see additional increases in the   unemployment rate in the future       12/11/01 27    On the positive side, housing markets remain healthy  A primary exception is the San   Francisco Bay area where home prices have started to decline a bit  But in most other areas, demand   for new and existing homes has been solid and the pace of residential construction remains high     Moreover, industry output and sales figures show some indication of a turnaround in high-  tech manufacturing  At this point, however, a rebound in demand for high-tech equipment that is   strong enough to get the industry back on a solid growth track does not appear imminent  And with   Boeing committed to cutting about 15,000 jobs nationwide between December 14th and January 25th--  most of them on the West Coast--the outlook for the District’s manufacturing sector more generally   remains weak in the near term    Also troubling are the District’s state and local fiscal positions, which have deteriorated   further since we last met  Most states have cut or have proposed cutting agency budgets by up to 15   percent and several have frozen hiring as well  This will put a damper on economic activity,   especially in California, where growth in state and local government jobs has been a key factor   supporting continued expansion in Southern California and the Central Valley this year     Let me turn to the national picture  The weakness in November employment put a bit of a   damper on the generally more positive tone of recent economic data  Still, there are more positive   signs that I believe are worth noting  Car and truck sales have been outstanding in October and   November  Of course, that reflects a temporary surge in response to zero interest rate financing deals    Still, I believe it is encouraging from the standpoint of consumers’ confidence in the future that so   many people are willing to undertake such commitments  The recent increase in the admittedly   volatile new orders series also is encouraging, especially since the surge was led by orders for   computers and semiconductors, sectors that had led the recession  And finally, even though third-  quarter productivity growth was revised down recently, I believe the 1-1/2 percent increase is robust     12/11/01 28    considering the decline in real output in that quarter  Relatively strong productivity growth over the   past year reinforces the view that the economy is cycling around a trend growth rate that continues to   be significantly higher than the one that prevailed before the mid-1990s     Overall, recent data seem broadly consistent with our forecast as well as the Greenbook’s   that the recession is likely to be relatively mild  And financial market developments since our   November meeting reflect greater confidence in that view  The steepening trajectory for federal funds   and Eurodollar futures rates is notable in this regard     Our forecast shows a drop in real GDP of 1-3/4 percent in the current quarter  We’re   assuming another 25 basis point cut in the funds rate at this meeting and we anticipate a rather gradual   pickup in growth in response to monetary and fiscal actions in combination with the end of the   inventory and investment cycles  The recovery in 2002 in our forecast is less pronounced than that in   the Greenbook in part because we are a bit skeptical about how quickly firms would take advantage of   the proposed partial expensing rules for investment  Of course, such legislation has to pass   Our inflation forecast is little revised, with slack in labor and product markets holding the   increase in the core PCE price index to just over 1-1/4 percent in 2002  While the recession appears   likely to be fairly mild at the present time, that outcome is quite vulnerable to the possibility of   negative shocks It’s not difficult to come up with a list of candidates  Confidence is fragile and could   be adversely affected by expected increases in unemployment, a negative turn in the war, or more   terrorist activity A large decline in equity or real estate values could deepen the recession  And given   the deadlock in Congress, it’s not clear how much additional fiscal spending or fiscal stimulus will be   forthcoming  Thus, even though it seems likely that economic growth will rebound next year without   any further policy action, a case could be made for an additional easing of policy as a bit more   insurance Thank you     12/11/01 29     Mr Chairman, it seems fairly likely to me that economic recovery would   occur next year without any further easing of monetary policy  However, that outcome is vulnerable   to a number of negative shocks that could hit the economy at any time  With inflation well in hand   and Federal Reserve credibility in good shape, I believe we have the flexibility to respond to these     12/11/01 86    risks Therefore, I strongly support your recommendation of a 25 basis point reduction in the funds   rate as some insurance against downside risks  I also prefer a balance of risk statement that   emphasizes economic weakness    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also think that these papers are excellent,   including the paper on “Lessons from Japan’s Experience”  I’d like to ask a question  Marvin,   on your quantitative policy at the zero-bound alternative, it’s interesting to me to think of it in the   context of Japan’s experience  Suppose the performance of the Japanese economy is similar to   that projected in the Greenbook—a forecast of deflation in Japan in every quarter for the next   two years As a result of all the problems that we’ve seen, people have begun to question what   the real equilibrium interest rate is in Japan at the present time and what has happened to the   trend of growth rate potential It seems to me that a quantitative policy may run into particular   problems because the real rate of return on cash—on not lending it out—is positive in a   deflationary period In contrast, there’s a lot of uncertainty, given all the travails they’ve run   into, about what the rates of return are on other assets  Could you relate this to Japan, please?    It was also the duration issue as well, I think, because before September   11 people thought that the chances of the economy turning around in the short run were greater    David, if I may ask, am I correct that the only statistic that peaked in   March was employment?    Industrial production had peaked much earlier anyway      Yes, but even with the revision the NBER dating was still valid    May I ask a question?  Dave, the GDP price index, of course, was down    What was the PCE price index?  The forecast in our projection was a little over 1 percent, but I   have a feeling it was quite different    Mr Chairman, employment in the Twelfth District continued to contract   in late November and December, as firms in nearly every sector and in most District states shed   jobs Still, signs of a turnaround are beginning to emerge, suggesting that conditions may   improve in coming months  Looking back on 2001, it’s now apparent that the attacks of   September 11 changed the character and composition of the economic downturn in the Twelfth   District Prior to the attacks, District job losses generally were limited to the manufacturing and   IT service sectors and were concentrated in IT-dependent geographic areas such as Phoenix,   Portland, and the San Francisco Bay area Following the attacks, job cuts were much more far-  reaching, with employment in states and sectors that had been holding up earlier in the year   contracting at a rapid pace Indeed, the bulk of the job cuts during the fourth quarter occurred   outside the IT industry —in sectors such as transportation, retail trade, and travel-related   services—and they were spread across District states  The attacks also accelerated and deepened   the District’s contraction, putting it on a par with the downturn in the rest of the United States    District employers shed nearly three times more jobs in the fourth quarter than they had in the   previous two quarters combined  And the Districtwide unemployment rate jumped ¾ percentage   point from September to December, the largest three-month increase since the BLS started   recording individual state data Overall, the attacks ensured that nearly every District state   would experience the national recession Many states had continued to expand well into the   summer of last year, especially those without a large IT presence  But widespread employment   losses in the District during the fourth quarter eliminated any advantages that states had   accumulated from their delayed entry into the recession             January 29-30, 2002 Page 72 of 194  That said, signs of a turnaround are visible  Orders and sales among District IT providers   have picked up, especially recently, driven by improved demand for consumer electronics,   personal computers, and certain wireless communications devices  With limited inventories on   hand, producers have increased production to meet demand  The increase in production has not   been limited to the IT sector  Data for California indicate that average hours worked per week in   the manufacturing sector as a whole rose in December, hitting the highest level since 2000    Beige Book contacts outside of California confirmed this trend, with a number indicating   increased use of overtime at their firms   Turning to the national picture, recent data have been encouraging  While not yet   conclusive, these indicators suggest that, as in the District, the national economy is in a transition   to a new expansion Important among these indicators are signs that the retrenchment in   business investment in inventories, equipment, and software may be nearing an end, with   inventories falling sharply and orders for capital goods appearing to be on the rise again  In   addition, evidence that consumers are continuing to look beyond the recession to sound   economic fundamentals also is encouraging  In particular, consumers’ willingness to buy big-  ticket items like autos and houses in the fourth quarter was impressive     We’ve revised up our near-term forecast from the one prepared in December and, like the   Greenbook and the Bluebook, we now incorporate an end to the recession in the first quarter    We expect a ¾ percent increase in the current quarter, which represents an upward revision from   the small decline we had projected in December  The projected pickup in the first quarter rests   primarily on a large swing in business spending for inventories  The recovery by the fourth   quarter of this year in our forecast is not much different from that of the Greenbook, with real   GDP rising in our projection by 2½ percent for the year  Our inflation forecast is little revised,        January 29-30, 2002 Page 73 of 194  with slack in labor and product markets holding the increase in the core PCE index to just over   1¼ percent in 2002   Although it’s likely that the recession is about over, that outcome still is vulnerable to the   possibility of well-known negative shocks largely having to do with the stock market and   consumer confidence  At the same time, there are some upside risks  For example, once a   rebound in business investment takes hold, it easily could exceed the rather moderate   acceleration in our forecast and that of the Greenbook  Overall, this seems like a good time to   leave policy unchanged for a while to see if the apparent turnaround in activity continues to   materialize  If that process were to stall, of course, we could quickly implement further rate cuts   with little loss Thank you    Yes, I have a comment more than a question  I found chart 4 in the   Bluebook on alternative strategies for monetary policy quite interesting  To me it seems to   highlight the important point that inflation has gotten low enough that the particular inflation   goal matters for near-term policy decisions  In addition, the inflation goal has become important   in the context of the discussion that we had yesterday regarding the zero bound on nominal short-  term interest rates  In my view these considerations call for some further Committee discussion   at some point, perhaps at the June meeting, about the desired steady-state rate of inflation    That’s exactly the point I was trying to make in saying that we need further   Committee discussion of this    Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation with regard to the rate, and   I certainly would defer to you and Vice Chairman McDonough in terms of the market effects of   changing the balance of risks statement However, it doesn’t appear to me that the risks are now   primarily in the direction of generating economic weakness  To me, at least, the risks actually   appear balanced    Could Virgil answer the question, Is there a step 1?  Weren’t you saying   that we’d have to release both the tally and the names of any dissenters?    Okay, so there isn’t really…    Yes    But that’s not a great deal of comfort    Well, I wish we had never started down this road as well  But I am   uncomfortable about releasing the vote tally, including the name of a dissenter, by itself  The   important information is really not found in the numerical tally but in the direction and the   rationale for any dissents Simply reporting the existence of a dissent after an FOMC meeting   without revealing its motivation could add noise to markets unless it is clarified  Even if   dissenters are identified, it seems untenable that further questions about the direction and   rationale of their dissenting vote could be left unanswered until the release of the minutes,   especially given the typical six-week lag in their release  In the interim, the pressure for   disclosure would be intense, and the possibility of erroneous speculation would be   counterproductive I also would like to know a bit more about the practices of other central        January 29-30, 2002 Page 140 of 194  banks For example, the Bank of England doesn’t release the vote tally along with the press   release announcing its decision That is made public only with the release of the minutes, which   of course occurs two weeks later    Exactly    Al, do you mean we have to release the names or release the names and   the rationale?    That’s the first time    Isn’t a lot of the debt denominated in dollars?    Right     March 19, 2002 Page 8 of 117   Mr Chairman, in spite of their shortcomings as well as their advantages, I   think that both alternatives, as well as the ACF, are probably going to have to be arrows in the   quiver for SOMA at some point  So at some time in the future, certainly after the contingency   studies are completed, I think we ought to proceed  It’s not immediately obvious to me which   option should be addressed first I would say, though, that the experience of the last year   certainly indicates to us that things can change very dramatically in terms of the fiscal position of   the US government as well as what we’re seeing with regard to currency  I don’t know how   cautious we should be I think we ought to move with good dispatch or aggressively after we’ve   dealt with the contingency issues    Thank you Karen, in Japan one hears a great deal about the amount and   speed with which manufacturing is being moved to other parts of Asia where costs are   significantly lower, particularly in the high-tech sector  Does that suggest that this outsourcing   of manufacturing in Japan will lead to a different response on the part of Japan to growth in other   parts of the world?  Will Japan perhaps not experience quite as much strength as has been the   case in the past when economic activity picked up throughout the world?    It may be that the currency would have to move more to accomplish the   same amount of stimulus    Thank you    Mr Chairman, our contacts indicate that economic conditions in the   Twelfth District are improving, although areas of weakness remain that could restrain the pace of   recovery District contacts report a pickup in economic activity over the past several weeks, and   job growth has turned positive in most states  The turnaround appears to be broad-based across   sectors but is especially solid in those industries hit hardest by the aftermath of September 11    Recent job growth has helped keep the District’s unemployment rate steady despite strong labor   force growth However, it remains a buyer’s market, with numerous job applicants to choose   from and little or no upward pressure on wage inflation     Despite broad signs of recovery throughout the District, areas of weakness do exist    Commercial construction is a prime example  Dramatic declines in the demand for office space   in 2001 left many commercial real estate markets in the District with excess supply  In some   IT-sensitive areas, vacancies more than doubled, and lease rates dropped 40 percent  Although   contacts report that conditions in commercial office markets have begun to stabilize, it’s likely to   be some time before we see any significant resumption of new commercial construction    Durable goods manufacturing is another area that may be slow to recover  The District’s durable   manufacturing sector depends heavily on exports, especially to Asia  The value of District   exports has been falling consistently since the end of 2000, with especially large declines in   exports to Japan Given the ongoing strength of the dollar and our disproportionate exposure to   some of the weakest global economies, a rapid turnaround in export demand for District   manufactured goods does not appear imminent         March 19, 2002 Page 45 of 117  The strength of the District’s recovery in coming months will depend heavily on the IT    sector Conditions in that sector have improved in recent months  For example, orders, sales,   and output among IT firms in the District have risen, and the pace of job loss in the IT sector has   eased However, we might not see significant improvement in profits and payrolls for some    time, and a lagging recovery in the IT sector could well slow the District’s return to full strength    Turning to the national picture, my interpretation of the economic news since we met in   January is broadly consistent with the consensus  The data have been decidedly on the positive   side, suggesting that the recession is over; the trough may well be dated at December or January    We’ve revised up noticeably our forecast of real GDP growth both for the current quarter and for   all of 2002 This revision includes, I might add, a steady tightening of monetary policy   beginning in the second half of this year until the funds rate in our forecast reaches 4 percent in   the second half of 2003   Our forecast looks a lot like the one in the Greenbook, with growth of real GDP of   3¼ percent in the current quarter, 3½ percent in 2002, and 4¼ percent next year  Faster growth   this year and next is accounted for mainly by a swing in business investment, both for inventories   and for equipment and software  Since we now expect current excess capacity in labor and   product markets to evaporate faster than we did before, our revised inflation forecast for 2003 is   up about ¼ percentage point, with the core PCE price index rising by just under 1½ percent    That is about the same as we expect for this year     I believe it’s too soon to begin raising the funds rate at this meeting, but we’ll probably   need to start this process before long How much and how quickly we tighten will depend   importantly on where we want inflation to end up  Typically, inflation is lower in the year after a   recession than in the year before, and that appears likely to happen this time around as well  At     March 19, 2002 Page 46 of 117  issue is whether these declines in inflation will be permanent  The latest edition of the Blue Chip   economic indicators shows a long-run ten-year consensus forecast for inflation of 2¼ percent for   the GDP price index and 2¾ percent for the CPI  So it would seem that many business   economists, at least, expect us to let inflation rise from recent levels  I’d like to see us hold the   line at around 1½ percent for the core PCE price index  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Vince, this exercise is very interesting  If you were to show me the   bottom two charts of exhibit 3, I think I would talk a long time  about the attractiveness of the   blue line, particularly relating it to some of the studies we’ve had in previous meetings about the   zero bound I’m troubled, though, that that outcome occurs by tightening policy a year from    now I’m troubled in the sense that it’s hard for me to believe, and I don’t know if I can   articulate that concern well  Could you help me understand your analysis a bit?  I ask because I   see in the forecast what I view as rather strong economic activity and, given the long lags   involved, to wait another year seems to me to be extremely dangerous, although I clearly see big   advantages to that alternative outcome      Very interesting Thank you    I also endorse both parts of your recommendation  And I think that   you’ve articulated well the kinds of challenges we’re likely to face at the next meeting  Thank   you    I think we came out at the right place in terms of the announcement and   how it would be done The only issue that I thought might at some point be worth more   discussion is when the blackout should end There’s a certain logic to having it end at the close   of the day on Thursday Having it terminate at the end of Friday means in effect that it really   ends Monday morning  It’s no big deal Sometimes it’s great to have an excuse not to accept a   speech assignment  But I think there is a logic to having it end on Thursday after the release of   the minutes    But there’s an interest arbitrage condition    Dave, in the baseline forecast you assumed that the prices of equities   would increase through the end of next year In view of the concern about corporate earnings               May 7, 2002 22 of 81  and also the fact that almost every valuation model suggests that equity markets are overvalued, I   wonder if you could elaborate a bit on the reasons why that assumption was chosen    Thank you    Mr Chairman, economic recovery is taking hold in most of the West, as   indicated by the modest increase in District employment in recent months  One lagging area is   the Pacific Northwest, reflecting that region’s dependence on high-tech manufacturing and   aerospace Consumer spending and confidence are up in the West at about the same pace as in   the nation, supporting growth in many of the service-producing sectors  This includes travel and   tourism, although that sector has not yet fully recovered from its September 11 setback   Residential real estate markets are holding up well  In California we’re hearing more   about multiple bids and selling prices above asking prices for existing homes  These high and   rising home prices combined with low new house inventories are stimulating construction,   though not to the point where we’re seeing many speculative building projects  Commercial real   estate, however, is not doing well This is especially true in San Francisco  In the city the   overall vacancy rate is approaching 20 percent  And in Silicon Gulch—the neighborhood in the   city of San Francisco that was home to the dot-com boom—the tech slump has pushed the rate to   nearly 50 percent   For businesses more generally, “caution” is the appropriate byword  With many firms   satisfied to wait awhile before making technology upgrades, the weakness in high-tech services   in California continues to be a drag on the economy  For most high-tech manufactured products,         May 7, 2002 27 of 81  demand is still off, and firms indicate that they have capacity to spare  However, we see some   signs that conditions are firming  Many businesses are removing hiring freezes  In Idaho, for   example, Micron Technology is hiring again and has rescinded earlier salary cuts  Outside the   telecom sector at least, the tendency is to postpone rather than to cancel capital investments   State and local governments continue to deal with the fallout from the recession  This is   especially true in California where the recession, along with a decline in income from stock   options and capital gains, led to substantially slower growth in personal income last year     For the national economy, our forecast reflects a set of fundamental trends that are   similar to those in the Greenbook  While real final sales will likely rise only modestly this   quarter, the growth rate picks up gradually through the end of next year, largely because of an   acceleration in business spending on equipment and software  However, inventory investment is   expected to account for less output growth next year than it did this year  As a result, in our   forecast real GDP growth averages about 4 percent in both years, even after accounting for a   substantial anticipated tightening of monetary policy over the next four quarters    We see little evidence of inflation pressures outside the energy sector, with the core PCE   price index expected to come in at 1½ percent or slightly lower both this year and next  Our   output and inflation forecasts reflect the effects of a modest upward revision in our estimate of   potential real GDP growth, which we have made in response to the surprisingly strong   performance of productivity during the recession and, of course, last quarter as well  It’s true   that a good deal of the extraordinary increase in productivity during the last two quarters is   temporary, representing a response to the uncertainties following September 11  However, it’s   also possible that some of the productivity growth is a lagged response to the huge amounts of   equipment and software investment that firms made during the late 1990s As we discussed at         May 7, 2002 28 of 81  our June 2001 meeting, it often takes time for workers and firms to make efficient use of new   investments  So it also takes time for the full effects to become evident in the productivity data    It seems likely that at least some of the recent strong productivity growth warrants a more   optimistic view of underlying productivity growth going forward  I must admit that I’ve been   surprised that financial markets have reacted so negatively to the mixed evidence contained in   recent monthly data releases and have seemed to shrug off the implications of recent evidence on   productivity   I agree with the standard list of downside risks to the outlook the stock market, the price   of oil, and corporate profits At the same time, I believe that productivity growth represents a   significant upside risk to our real GDP forecast, as illustrated by an alternative simulation in the   Greenbook That simulation shows that faster productivity growth would mean less inflation   over the next couple of years as the unemployment rate is temporarily boosted and growth in unit   labor costs is temporarily depressed  So the upside potential for real GDP growth from a   positive productivity surprise actually gives us more breathing room in deciding when to begin   raising the funds rate  Thank you    Don, I have a question about the perfect foresight policy  I think that’s a   very useful exercise, and one thing that’s interesting to me is that there is an assumption that the   value of the dollar depreciates at a rate of 3 percent per year  That certainly is reasonable, but   our experience of recent years suggests that other outcomes are possible  So I think it would be   interesting to know what the effect of different assumptions for the dollar would be  For   example, if the dollar didn’t depreciate or even appreciated at 3 percent per year, I have a feeling   that the perfect foresight policy would be very different  It probably would indicate relative to   the baseline that we would have a lot more leeway in terms of when policy would have to change   and also how rapidly rates would have to increase in the future    Well, it would be interesting to know the degree of sensitivity of that on   the perfect foresight policy discussion    Okay Thank you    I agree    Art, your point 3 suggests that the model you would want to substitute for   the Phillips curve is a quantity theory type of model  The question I have is, With such a model,   in what ways would you expect the policy process of this Committee to change?    Well, I think I know what Milton Friedman’s answer would be  But what   are you suggesting that we do?    Long term using what?    It sounds to me as though we would have a lot fewer meetings    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I certainly agree with the three factors that the   staff has pointed to as having played a significant role in restraining inflation  But I do have a   question about the weights assigned to them in terms of their relative importance  And it seems   to me that the recent experience of other developed countries might provide some interesting   information for us  I say that because in the mid- to late-1990s other countries besides the   United States also experienced the puzzling combination of low and stable inflation and   declining unemployment rates         June 25-26, 2002 33 of 179  Let me just pick two, though not arbitrarily, Britain and Canada  First of all, they both   achieved low, relatively stable inflation and low rates of unemployment, which would suggest   that perhaps there is some common explanation for countries that have experienced that    However, those two countries did not see at all the kind of productivity pickup that we’ve seen in   the United States  But in these countries and others as well there was a shift in how monetary   policy was conducted I wonder, if you were to take a more international perspective in this   study, whether it might not change your views about what the relative weights of these factors   might be in explaining what was really a global process      Thank you, Mr Chairman  The pace of economic recovery in the West   has been moderate since our last meeting, although employment growth has remained lackluster    Consumer spending continues to be the primary driver of the recovery, fueling growth in retail   trade, travel and tourism, and many service-producing industries  Heavy discounting, however,   remains a drag on profits  The ongoing resiliency of household spending is most apparent in   District housing markets  Although the pace of home-price appreciation has moderated in recent   months, home prices and home sales are increasing in a number of states, with conditions   definitely favoring sellers Residential real estate markets are especially strong in California,   where multiple bids and selling prices above asking prices are becoming commonplace  The   sustained strength in housing demand is spurring new building, especially in areas attractive to   retirees like Southern California and Arizona  The pickup in homebuilding is a welcome boost   to the construction industry, which has seen a sharp drop-off in demand for commercial   development    Signs of improvement are emerging in the District IT sector, especially for high-tech   manufacturers  New orders and sales have increased since the fourth quarter, helping many   factories draw down inventories and increase output  Increased use of existing capacity has   prompted some IT businesses to reinstate investment plans postponed in 2001  This is having a   positive effect on makers of measurement and controlling devices and other production   equipment  Semiconductor equipment manufacturers, for example, are seeing new orders   surpass sales for the first time in more than a year  The pickup in production also is boosting   work hours and salaries of IT workers Contacts report greater use of overtime and fewer forced   furloughs; and many companies are rescinding moratoriums on salary increases and incentive   pay That said, the industry outlook remains uncertain, especially concerning IT employment      June 25-26, 2002 71 of 179  Last week, a number of District companies revised downward their earnings expectations, citing   slowing demand and significant price pressure  More fundamentally, a number of high-tech   manufacturers are using the lull in activity to rethink their production strategies, sometimes   moving fabrication and support functions offshore   The reality of budget shortfalls is beginning to affect state and local government   spending Some scheduled public construction projects have been put on hold and hiring and   salary freezes for government agencies are being put in place  Most importantly, officials in   many Twelfth District states are concerned that further budget cuts will be needed, given the   slow pace of recovery   Turning to the national economy, recent economic news overall has been on the low side   of what we had expected, and we’ve reduced our second-quarter forecast of real GDP growth to   2½ percent Looking at the next year and a half, we continue to see a moderate expansion as the   most likely outcome, with the recent declines in equity prices and the dollar tending to offset   each other’s effects on aggregate demand Assuming that the funds rate begins to rise in the   fourth quarter and reaches 4 percent by the end of next year, we project real GDP growth of   about 4¼ percent in 2003 And we continue to expect inflation to remain well contained, with   the core PCE price index averaging about 1½ percent both this year and next   While our basic view of the outlook hasn’t changed, recent financial developments   highlight some risks  Growing concerns about corporate accounting and governance appear to   be adding to the already existing downward pressure on US stock markets and may be raising   borrowing costs for some firms  In addition to the risks from the stock market for consumer   spending, eroding confidence in US corporations also may be undermining business investment   by raising the cost of capital  The chances of the expansion taking off this year would be greatly     June 25-26, 2002 72 of 179  reduced if the incipient recovery in equipment and software spending were to stall  These   developments may be giving us more breathing room in deciding when to begin the process of   raising the funds rate     However, the policy implications could be the opposite if eroding confidence in US   corporations were to add to the already existing downward pressure on the dollar stemming from   a persistent current account deficit  As illustrated in an alternative simulation in the international   part of the Greenbook, we could end up with little net effect on US output together with faster   price increases, which would suggest a tighter policy  For now, however, it seems appropriate to   wait a while longer before beginning to raise the funds rate    First of all, I think the perfect foresight exercises, both in the Bluebook   and also in the memo by Bob Tetlow were very helpful  I have a couple of questions with regard   to those exercises Page 7 of the Bluebook, about the seventh or eighth line down, talks about   the objective function as minimizing the squared deviations of output from its potential  Is that   correct? I ask because I think Tetlow minimizes squared deviations of the unemployment rate   from the NAIRU and that makes a difference  In this latest recession, of course, the deviation of   output from its potential really didn’t become very great, but the deviation of the unemployment   rate relative to the NAIRU was quite large  So, is there a difference?    So did you run a different model simulation?    Oh, okay    But the relationship—I think we ought to talk about that  In other words,   you didn’t put it in the right terms  This should be—    That’s what I thought the answer was  Thank you    Right, but in the most recent period it’s different  My second point is that   you talk about the small penalty associated with changes in the funds rate  In Tetlow’s work I   thought it had almost an equal weight  And that’s pretty important in terms of the objective   function Unless you used a different penalty, I don’t see how you could characterize it as a   small penalty    So it gives a heavy weight to smoothing changes in the funds rate; that’s   the way he characterized it    You got it!    Right    It’s all relative to the other    One final question  You referred to the growth rate of potential as   3¼ percent after 2003 Tetlow used 3½ percent, and in fact it builds to above 3½ percent after   that Did you use a different simulation there?    Okay, thanks    I support it as well    Aha! Trying to pull a fast one! [Laughter]    But didn’t the turnaround occur in nonfinancial commercial paper?    David, in the Greenbook forecast the growth rate has been revised down a   full percentage point, roughly, for the second half and about 06 percentage point for next year    It seemed to me in looking at the Greenbook that a very large portion of that change was a result   of the annual revisions and the effects of those revisions on productivity and potential  Not   much of the change appeared to be due to what I guess was referred to in yesterday’s Board   briefing as the “headwinds” and some of the negatives you’ve been talking about that have   affected the economy very recently  Would you agree with that assessment, or do I have those   proportions differently parsed?    Thank you    Mr Chairman, economic activity in the West continues to expand but at a   modest pace Lackluster job growth, stock market volatility, and the daily announcements of   corporate scandals have worked to damp consumer confidence in the West in recent weeks    More-uncertain consumers appear to have reined in spending somewhat, especially on   nondiscounted products Consumers also have pulled back on investment activity, prompting   another round of layoffs at local brokerage firms  Charles Schwab, for example, recently   announced that it will lay off 1,000 more people in coming quarters, about 5 percent of its   current staff On the bright side, aggressive pricing practices have kept car sales robust, and   home sales continue to increase, although there are some signs that real estate markets are   cooling Visitor counts and travel spending also improved in the District, driven by solid   increases in domestic demand  Although job growth remained subdued in most District states,   productivity growth likely has kept output expanding  However, District growth probably is not   outpacing the rest of the nation, as we appear to have lost most of our productivity growth   advantage over the last year     The District’s high-tech sector has continued to expand recently but at a more subdued   pace than many had expected  Demand for personal computers, consumer electronics, and   telecommunications equipment has fallen in recent months, moderating the outlook among   District semiconductor makers  Intel, the District’s largest chip producer, announced plans to lay         August 13, 2002 24 of 92  off 4,000 workers, and about half of Intel’s 83,000 employees actually reside in the Twelfth   District Conditions among software makers were mixed, with Microsoft announcing plans to   expand payrolls but firms like Oracle cutting costs to maintain profitability  Overall, District   technology contacts have pushed back their time frame for full recovery in the sector  Moreover,   a number of firms are saying that things may get slightly worse before they get better  The long   downturn in the tech sector is taking a toll on a number of District investment companies  The   technology-oriented investment bank, Robertson Stevens, closed its doors last month, as you all   know, letting go more than 800 employees  Venture capital firms also are feeling the strain  We    now expect a number of these firms to merge or to go out of business by the end of this year     I’d like to comment on the West Coast port situation  There’s no doubt that any work   disruption at West Coast ports would be extremely costly  However, the threat of such an action   either by labor or by management has diminished significantly over the last several weeks    Contract negotiations resume today, and our contacts believe that both sides are eager for a   settlement  As the probability of a strike has decreased, reports we’ve received of precautionary   importing on the part of firms have subsided   Turning to the national economy, while some recent news on real activity has been on the   weak side, we have lowered our forecast for GDP growth in the second half of this year only   about ½ percentage point, not nearly as much as the reduction in the Greenbook forecast  After   the surge in the first quarter, domestic demand has held up fairly well  We believe the   11 percent increase in real GDP in the second quarter gives an overly pessimistic impression, as   several temporary factors such as a spike in imports and mild winter weather probably restrained   second-quarter growth and boosted growth in the first quarter  Furthermore, real consumer   spending and disposable income turned up strongly in June, and auto sales, of course, jumped in         August 13, 2002 25 of 92  July Both of these developments bode well for third-quarter growth  I would add that I think   the retail sales data that we have just received are certainly supportive of that as well   In addition, I’m encouraged that real capital spending on equipment and software posted   a long-awaited increase last quarter  Of course, some other recent indicators of economic   activity have fallen short of expectations, especially payroll employment, aggregate hours, and   orders for capital goods Also, the roller coaster that financial markets have been riding should   sap some strength from the economy, particularly next year, although interest rates often have   tended to follow equity prices up and down and may have partially offset the damage     On balance, we continue to see a moderate expansion as the most likely outcome  In   particular, a double-dip still seems to be only a remote possibility  We anticipate growth in the   second half of this year of almost 3½ percent  Assuming a steady funds rate, we project real   GDP growth of about 4 percent in 2003, and we continue to expect inflation to remain well   contained, with the core PCE price index increasing about 1½ percent next year  I’d also say that   significant slack in resource utilization certainly remains, especially in manufacturing  However,   the current easy stance of monetary policy appears well calibrated to provide sufficient stimulus   to ensure economic recovery  Thank you    I have a question  In the Bluebook, the Taylor rule recommendation and   the recommendation of the perfect foresight simulations are quite different Which of those two   approaches would best really model or characterize past policy?    Okay, thank you    Mr Chairman, I agree with your recommendation with regard to the funds   rate At the time of the last meeting, the risks for the economy and inflation were fairly well   balanced But it seemed to me that there was some sense in the room that it would take quite a         August 13, 2002 81 of 92  bit to induce a further easing of policy and that the bar would be lower for shifting policy into a   tightening mode This time around I think we face a more evenly balanced set of risks    Therefore, I have a preference for retaining a balanced statement of risks, and I believe that we   could communicate our current concerns through the wording of the press statement without   changing the actual balance of risks sentence    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Dave, when I read the Greenbook one of the   things that struck me was how little inflation is projected to decline over the period  I appreciate   your taking the time to explain why that is the case  But it seems to me that over a two-year   period a more conventional rule of thumb—along the lines of what would come out from a   Phillips curve analysis—would have the inflation rate going down maybe not to where Al was   talking about but close to ½ percent  The chance of that happening doesn’t seem to me to be   small  I believe that there is some significant probability that it could occur  Did you think in   terms of what the chances were that some more traditional relationships could reassert   themselves and how significant that might be?    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Twelfth District’s economic recovery   has been proceeding at a moderate pace, with perhaps a slight weakening this summer    Technology companies in the West continue to struggle with rapidly falling prices and weak   earnings Recent news from the sector indicates job reductions rather than expansions  In   California the pace of job losses among tech manufacturers slowed earlier this year but then   picked up again in July and August  And a recent drop in average hours worked in these sectors     September 24, 2002 31 of 115  confirms the weakening of labor demand  An exception in the District’s tech sector is Microsoft,   which recently announced plans to add 5,000 people to its workforce by mid-2003     More generally, total employment has been flat to down slightly in most parts of the   District in recent months  In California the unemployment rate actually fell in the last two   months, but this masks a drop in civilian employment that was, of course, more than offset by an   even larger drop in the number of job seekers  Some of the state’s job seekers may be   discouraged by rising long-term unemployment, which is a bit higher than in the rest of the   nation California also is struggling with a large state budget gap induced by a drop in revenues   that was due largely to extensive exposure of the state’s tax base to stock market fluctuations    Recently enacted spending cuts and tax increases equal nearly 1 percent of the value of total   output in the state And other budget-balancing measures shift the adjustment burden forward,   creating a likely drag on future economic growth     There is some positive news, however  Throughout the District,  household spending on   consumer durables and home purchases has been robust  After surging in the first quarter, home   sales have come down a bit but remain at high levels  And home prices have continued their   upward march to levels that are somewhat high relative to rental rates  However, the adjustment   necessary to bring prices back in line is not exceptionally large in most markets  Seattle and San   Diego are notable exceptions where home prices are significantly high relative to rental rates     The southern California economy has been the District’s most reliable source of   expansion this year, and it will soon receive an additional boost from several large Pentagon   contracts One of these will keep Boeing’s 7,000 worker facility in Long Beach open for years   to come  In Seattle, Boeing’s commercial aircraft division avoided a major strike on   September 13, when its largest union of 25,000 machinists voted to accept the contract offer         September 24, 2002 32 of 115  This improves the company’s immediate outlook, but it still faces significant challenges  The   strike was averted in part because soft demand strengthened Boeing’s bargaining position by   reducing potential strike costs And the underlying labor discontent may be a problem when   Boeing’s second largest union comes to the bargaining table on October 29  Labor unrest also   remains an issue at West Coast ports  But despite the long, bumpy negotiations and a few   limited work slowdowns in the past couple of weeks, the likelihood of a protracted slowdown or   stoppage remains low     For the national economy, our forecast for the near term and for the next year has   changed very little since the August meeting  Recent economic news has provided very mixed   signals, with spending indicators largely on the strong side while labor market indicators and   industrial output have been weak At the same time, financial markets have been volatile but   have not changed enough on balance to alter our outlook significantly   We continue to be on the optimistic side of the Greenbook with a forecast of 3¾ percent   and 3 percent growth in the current and fourth quarters of this year and 4 percent next year  An   alternative simulation in the Greenbook implies that one reason for this difference may be the   assumptions about the growth of structural productivity and potential output  We incorporate a   smooth path for structural productivity growth of just around 2½ percent for 2001 through 2003    This is well above the path in the Greenbook, which tends to vary more with the business cycle    Last year the Committee discussed the pros and cons of these alternative approaches in its first   special topic session, and I won’t get into that here  However, I do want to point out that this   issue has significant implications for the outlook at the present time   With regard to inflation, our forecast shows moderate increases of a bit over 1¼ percent   in the core PCE price index in the latter half of this year and also next year  Having expressed a        September 24, 2002 33 of 115  fairly sanguine view of the future, I have to admit to being a bit uneasy about prospects for the   economy  The reason is that most of the risks seem to be skewed to the downside  another   terrorist attack, war with Iraq, declines in house or equity values, and fragile business   confidence Based on our outlook and risk assessment, at this point I would see no reason to   change the current stance of policy  Thank you    Mr Chairman, I support both parts of your recommendation  I’m not yet   ready to lower rates, and I hope that the data we receive over the coming period will clarify the   issues we have discussed, although I doubt that they will clarify the situation greatly  My hope   also is that a decision can wait until the next meeting          No As a matter of fact, I think it’s a subset of the broader statement in   the first half of the sentence  I don’t think of it that way at all    Dave, in the near-term outlook in the Greenbook, especially through the   middle of next year, inventories are very lean  As a matter of fact, I think the inventory–sales   ratios reach historically low levels  Have you given any thought to how large and how likely the   upside risk to the forecast might be if inventories were actually larger than those assumed?        Thank you    Mr Chairman, Twelfth District economic activity has expanded further   recently, but the pace of growth is sluggish, and the District appears to be pulling down growth   in the national economy  After showing solid gains in the previous month, consumer spending   fell in September as households cut outlays on automobiles and smaller retail items as well    Home sales and construction activity have remained at high levels, but signs of cooling are         November 6, 2002 25 of 122  cropping up, including a sharp drop in the pace of existing-home sales in California during the   third quarter   Conditions in the District technology sector have weakened recently  Job cut   announcements by industry leaders HP and Sun Microsystems, and a mixed financial   performance in the sector as a whole, suggest that the industry continues to struggle  However,   there are a few bright spots  Recent strong financial performances of Microsoft and Internet-  based companies such as e-Bay, Amazon, and Yahoo indicate that the Internet and computer   services shake-out may be largely complete  This development and the focus on leading edge   manufacturing imply that the District tech sector is well positioned to participate in an eventual   recovery in demand for tech products nationwide  Boeing’s problems are likely to be longer-  term because of weak travel demand and gains in market share by Airbus  Although Boeing has   nearly achieved its originally planned cuts of about 20,000 jobs in Washington State, it recently   announced that a further weakening of expected sales will require additional job cuts next year     After a volatile and frequently bitter month at West Coast ports, longshore workers and   shipping companies found common ground last Friday, tentatively agreeing on the introduction   of productivity-enhancing technology  The logjam broke when both sides relaxed some of their   prior demands  Under the compromise, shipping companies get to invest in labor-saving cargo-  tracking technology, potentially eliminating 600 union jobs  However, they will have to retain   current workers displaced by these technologies and give the ILWU the jurisdiction over any   new jobs created by the investments  Actually, I think the number of new jobs created by these   investments is probably going to be about one-tenth of the number of jobs displaced by them    No, it has not But both sides made concessions to reach an agreement on   technology, and that has been the major stumbling block  There are other issues, but that’s the   major one  Although talks still could break down over pensions and arbitration, clearing the   technology hurdle substantially eased tensions between the two parties  That being said,   operations at West Coast ports have yet to return to normal  The pace of work remains well   below capacity at ports throughout the West  And in some ports, the backlogs of container ships   have hardly shrunk at all since the workers returned in early October This is particularly true at   LA/Long Beach, which of course is the largest port  Only the port of Seattle has completely   recovered from the lockout, having no ships queued in the harbor at the present time  More   generally, congestion, truck and railcar imbalances, and periodic work disruptions have delayed   deliveries and shipments and boosted freight costs for many District businesses  Companies   have reported that deliveries and shipments are running one to four weeks behind schedule  The   largest delays are for automobiles moving through the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach    Ongoing disruptions have prompted some retailers to accelerate their shipment schedules in   order to get merchandise in stores for the holiday sales season  In a preemptive move, Target   stores reportedly chartered a ship in Asia in mid-October and moved cargo to be sold in the   December holiday season through the port of Seattle  Target usually would ship through Los   Angeles and Long Beach three to four weeks before it needs to have the goods in its stores  With   shipping problems continuing, we are hearing many reports of congestion fees for the use of   ports, rising truck and warehousing costs, and the near doubling of airfreight charges for new   clients   Turning to the national economy, obviously recent data have been disappointing The   31 percent growth rate for third-quarter real GDP was not very encouraging, given the large             November 6, 2002 27 of 122  contribution from the temporary surge in autos  Moreover, both business investment and   personal consumption expenditures weakened as the quarter progressed, even outside of motor   vehicles And, of course, the October employment report provided little reason to believe that   this period of weakness is behind us   While our near-term forecast remains somewhat higher than that in the Greenbook, the   revisions since September are similar  We have revised down growth in the current quarter by   more than 1 percentage point, to 1¾ percent We continue to believe that we are likely to see a   modest expansion in the economy next year  However, recent developments dimmed prospects   somewhat for the first half of next year  The recent weakening in capital goods orders is   especially worrisome since capital goods investment is critical to a rebound in economic activity   next year Overall in our forecast, real GDP growth does not rise above its potential rate until the   second half of next year, and the economy ends 2003 with considerable excess capacity  Under   these circumstances, we expect inflation to trend down, with the core PCE index rising by   1½ percent in 2003 and 1¼ percent in 2004 I would add, somewhat similar to what Dave talked   about in terms of the Greenbook, that analysis at our Bank—based on historical inflation forecast   errors—finds that the risk of outright deflation in 2003 and 2004 appears to be quite small  It   seems to me that the case for easing policy is strong  There is little inflation threat, recent data   have been weak, and significant geopolitical risks appear to weigh on the economy  Thank you    Mr Chairman, to me it makes a lot of sense to go with the 50 basis point   cut, one that is large enough to have a noticeable effect  My main concern about this large cut is   that it might send the message that the economy is weaker than we currently think  But by   adopting a risk assessment that is balanced I believe we mitigate that possibility  So I think in   combination it’s the right choice    Mr Chairman, starting out with the fifth point, it seems to me that it is a   very good staff study, and I hope that it will be released at some point for public comment and   discussion As for the options suggested for additional study, I favor consideration of the   purchase of Ginnie Mae securities  Where such fully federally guaranteed debt is available, there   is a presumption, I believe, that it should be included in our portfolio  And if I remember   correctly, at our previous meeting there was considerable support for looking at that alternative    I also like the proposal for the ACF  It seems to me that the experience we would get from the   ACF would be useful for creating a contingency ACF if that were needed  Given current   projections for the federal budget, however, we are not pressed for time on these alternatives      It may be useful to initiate small Ginnie Mae and ACF pilot programs in   order to gain some experience  You asked also about the timing  I would suggest, somewhat   arbitrarily, six to twelve months of further study of those two options and a subsequent update to   the Committee    David, my question is related somewhat to the interchange you had with   Michael Moskow about deflation  I had a chance to look at the Board staff’s domestic   nonfinancial briefing and the exercise of estimating the probability of attaining deflation, as you   define it, over a four-quarter period I was struck by how large that probability is  I wondered   what level of concern you had about that probability; 28 percent is not a small number  We had   done a similar exercise for a previous meeting, but we didn’t have quite the same definition  I   actually like your definition better because I think it is more realistic in terms of assuming a   ½ percentage point error in the core PCE measure of inflation  How did the probability numbers   strike you when you got those results?     This may be more like a China version of deflation, where the deflation   probably reflects what is happening to productivity    Right, and for growth    What would the numbers be if you used the post-1983 period?    That would be interesting    I am!    David, I agree with the points you made about the timing of those   spending cuts in California  But that’s because the budget deficit is about $6 billion in the   current fiscal year and an estimated $21 billion in the subsequent year  So these announced cuts   are only part of the program      If they’re going to get to a balanced budget            December 10, 2002 27 of 87   I think they’re meeting this week to figure out how they’re going to do the   rest of it because what has been proposed so far—the numbers that David mentioned—are   mainly cuts in spending, half of which are in education because that’s half the budget  I’m sure   there are short-term actions they can take, but those actions probably are not going to be the   solution to the problem    Yes, I did see it It struck me as a very surprising number  I can’t   remember who made that comment    I don’t know, but I’ll take a look at that    Mr Chairman, the economic recovery in the West has proceeded   sluggishly in recent weeks, although some tentative signs point to a pickup in momentum going   forward Many District customers remained on the sidelines in October and much of November             December 10, 2002 42 of 87  However, early tallies of holiday retail sales indicate that consumers in the West may have re­  engaged Store traffic is high, and sales are stronger than retailers expected  Several retailers   have had to place additional orders for the hottest selling items     The tone in the housing market has moderated some, with buyers less eager than they   were earlier this year We’re beginning to hear about buyers canceling contracts and actually   forfeiting deposits Some builders have responded by delaying construction  In San Francisco,   work on some multifamily properties has been put on hold  Elsewhere, start times for residential   developments have been pushed back  Overall, however, housing is still solid, and builders are   optimistic about the future and are investing time and money acquiring permits to build once the   economy improves     Job growth in the District has been lackluster, in part reflecting businesses’ preoccupation   with reducing costs Several financial and tech firms announced additional layoffs as a part of   cost-cutting measures  Businesses more generally are emphasizing productivity gains to improve   margins  One retail consultant noted that she now spends more time helping firms to increase   output per worker than she does helping them to boost market share  Some contacts indicate that   the focus on productivity has begun to boost profits, likely easing pressure for additional layoffs   The closure of West Coast ports in October disrupted vessel traffic and increased   shipping times and costs well into November  For the most part, however, goods continued to   move Businesses worked around the disruptions by diverting cargo to other ports and by   shifting to other modes of transportation  Available data and reports from contacts indicate only   modest amounts of preemptive importing     The good news is that the backlog of ships is cleared, as are most ground transportation   bottlenecks More important, a tentative contract settlement between longshore workers and               December 10, 2002 43 of 87  shipping lines on November 23 makes further port closures unlikely  The contract will be put to   a vote in early January  Most people familiar with the negotiations and the settlement expect the   contract to be ratified   In contrast to most other District sectors, there is little room for optimism in commercial   real estate markets Vacancies have increased, and lease rates have fallen in several areas, in part   because a number of IT and financial companies did not renew leases  Pessimism about   recovery in commercial markets is leading some developers to look to residential development as   an alternative In Silicon gulch, which was the home to San Francisco’s dot-com boom,   developers are pushing the city to allow mixed commercial-residential properties to be converted   to residential only   Turning to the national picture, the economic data that came in since we last met have   been on the weak side We basically agree with the Greenbook forecast and expect weak growth   in the current quarter Some of this weakness can be expected to spill over into next year, though   maybe in a fairly limited way  Recent data on holiday spending and auto sales suggest that the   payback effect from the third quarter may be dissipating  And uncertainty appears to have   receded to some extent, at least as gauged by measures of risks in the bond and stock markets     Overall, the longer-term outlook seems reasonably good and the risks relatively balanced    Our forecast shows growth picking up from 3 percent in the first half of next year to 4 percent in   the second half We see downside and upside risks to economic activity going forward  Of   course, the geopolitical situation remains a risk But on the upside we have been surprised by the   rapid productivity growth And we continue to believe a good deal of this reflects fundamental   technological change that will bolster growth  Our inflation outlook is about the same as in early               December 10, 2002 44 of 87  November; we expect the core PCE index to rise 1½ percent next year and 1¼ percent in 2004    Thank you    Brian, I’d like to ask you a question about the path for monetary policy in   chart 4 in the Bluebook, which is right before page 9  The chart in question is at the upper left   The Greenbook path for the funds rate is above the perfect foresight alternative for about a year   and then falls below it I have two questions about that  First, could you talk a little about why   that path was chosen?  And second, if we go for a period of a year, say, where the path is above   the perfect foresight alternatives, is there a risk that markets might begin to think that our   inflation objective is below 1 percent?               December 10, 2002 70 of 87   But there is an implied view about policy    And that’s better because?               December 10, 2002 71 of 87   I agree, but there is an implied objective function in what does get put into   the baseline, and I think it had some interesting characteristics this time    I agree    I agree again [Laughter]     Mr Chairman, I’d like to ask two questions about the first paper  You   looked at these three factors in isolation, and then you indicated in a caveat that the factors might   interact  It seems to me that, indeed, they might and that could actually change one’s conclusion    I can understand, if you’re working with the FRB/US model, that with a model that size it would   be very difficult to incorporate the three effects simultaneously  Isn’t it possible to work with a   smaller model that would enable you to look at those effects and how they interact and determine   whether or not that leads to somewhat different conclusions?     Okay  There’s another point I’d like to ask about  First of all, we had an   interesting meeting in June in which papers on inflation modeling were presented  The   discussion revealed some differences around the table in views about which model is relevant    In one case we had a paper based on a Phillips curve, and another was based on a random walk    If the policy participants have different models of the economy, would that perhaps lead one to   the conclusion that we should be less aggressive in terms of our approach to policy?     It seems a little counterintuitive       That’s interesting  By the way, that’s President Stern’s random walk!       Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Twelfth District economy continued to   expand in recent weeks but at a very modest pace  Consumers turned in a disappointing   performance during the holidays, and early numbers for January suggest that they remain   hesitant and price conscious  One retail consultant characterized the current environment as a   “race to the bottom,” with consumers willing to hold out until they get goods at cost  Retailers   have responded—offering nearly continuous sales, rebates, financing incentives, and price   guarantees  District businesses also are looking for bargains, especially in real estate and IT   support services  One commercial landlord said he fields daily calls from tenants threatening to   move if their lease rates are not lowered  A contract manager at SUN Microsystems reported   increased pressures to lower prices for long-term service contracts and one-time technical   support   Now, let me say a few words about the state budget crises  The genesis of these crises,   not only in the West but elsewhere as well, appears to be overly optimistic revenue expectations   and, to a lesser extent, cost overruns  Revenues are running well below expectations, with   especially large shortfalls in states dependent on capital gains revenues  On the cost side,   Medicaid seems to be the main culprit due to rapid increases in prescription drug prices and   provider fees  Although a recent survey of state governors found that twenty-four believed their   fiscal crisis is the worst in the nation, it appears that things are especially bad in the Twelfth   District  [Laughter]  District states account for approximately 21 percent of gross state product,   but they account for about one-half of the estimated total state budget shortfall in the United   States  Of course, California’s gap is the largest—$26 billion or $35 billion depending on whom   you talk to—and that’s for both this and the next fiscal year   January 28-29, 2003 104 of 195    While these budget shortfalls pose significant challenges for state lawmakers, their   economic impact is less clear  For one thing, estimated budget shortfalls represent the difference   between desired spending and current revenues  They do not represent budget deficits    Therefore, they typically overstate the tax increases and cuts in spending that are required to   balance the budget  For example, California has a projected shortfall, at least as projected by the   governor, of $35 billion  But it actually faces a deficit of $15 billion  For another, states usually   spread the pain of budget deficits over several years, tempering the immediate impact on state   spending and employment growth  That being said, there are real costs to such large budget   shortfalls  California’s bond rating was downgraded in part because of the announcement of a   $35 billion budget shortfall  With the recent downgrade, rating agencies now score California’s   current fiscal crisis as equivalent to that faced during the state’s severe recession in the early   1990s  Moreover, the state faces severe cash flow problems, so it probably will need to take on   more debt to meet current payment obligations  On the brighter side, exporters and importers   breathed a sigh of relief last week on word that a new West Coast port contract had been signed        Turning to the national economy, obviously recent data have been mixed, with   employment and industrial activity on the weak side and consumer spending doing fairly well    On balance, though, the data have been somewhat disappointing  Our forecast for this year looks   a lot like the one in the Greenbook  We’ve revised down our estimates of real GDP growth in   the fourth and current quarters about ¼ percentage point, to ½ percent and 2½ percent   respectively  Assuming a constant funds rate this year, the most likely scenario for the third and   fourth quarters is that real GDP growth will rise above the potential rate by ½ to 1 percent,   depending on what happens with fiscal policy  The excess capacity in the economy brings   January 28-29, 2003 105 of 195    consumer inflation down at a gradual pace, and inflation in the core PCE price index falls to   about 1¼ percent in 2004     I have some concerns about this outlook  First, of course, the long-anticipated pickup in   growth has yet to materialize  This pickup seems to depend importantly on an acceleration in   business fixed investment occurring before consumer spending falters  The longer the growth   has to depend on the auto and housing sectors, the riskier the situation becomes especially in the   context of geopolitical uncertainties  Second, even the projected expansion is modest at best,   and it still would leave the economy with excess capacity through the end of next year  This   brings me to my third concern  Our forecast also would leave us with an inflation rate next year   that’s below 1 percent after taking out the estimated bias  In my view, that inflation rate is   slightly on the low side     To see how these concerns play out in the longer-run forecast, we ran a number of perfect   foresight simulations as in the Bluebook  We used a couple of different models, including   FRB/US, and some alternative assumptions about FOMC policy preferences, including different   assumptions about interest rate smoothing and also the degree of responsiveness to the output   gap  In all cases where we assumed a target for measured core PCE inflation of 1½ percent, the   optimal policy involved significant near-term funds rate decreases  These simulations nicely   capture the implications of our current situation  We have excess capacity, prospects for only a   modest increase in real GDP growth, and a fairly low inflation rate  Adding any downside risks   for economic activity to this picture would only strengthen the argument that perhaps a further   easing of policy might be appropriate before too much more time passes  Thank you     I support it as well   January 28-29, 2003 152 of 195      Second     Dave, a common theme of many forecasts is that a gradual slowing of   consumer spending, especially for durables and residential investment, will be more than offset   by a pickup in business investment  Somewhat in contrast to that, the Greenbook forecasts   considerable strength in spending for durables and for residential investment  As a matter of   fact, such spending accelerates in the second half of the year, and expenditures for durable goods   grow 8 percent in 2004 with market rates, on Treasuries in particular, rising  I was wondering if   you could comment on why the projection shows that strength and if you think it might be fairly   optimistic     There is a mention of an increase in Treasury rates     Thank you     Mr Chairman, economic expansion in the West remained sluggish in the   recent weeks  District consumers reined in spending in February and early March, making   profitability a challenge for many retailers  A number of District auto dealers also faced more   difficult times as unit sales and profit margins fell  Rising gasoline prices apparently constrained   sales of SUVs, leaving several dealers with excess inventories  One contact noted that   manufacturers’ incentives are no longer enough to entice borrowers  Customers want dealer   discounts as well   Like consumers, many firms also have hit the pause button, postponing investment and   hiring decisions until the future looks clearer  Some notable firms in the IT sector are actually   scaling back  Micron Technology of Boise, Applied Materials of Santa Clara, and Agilent of   Palo Alto recently announced plans to lay off 10 percent or more of their respective workforces    A large San Francisco IT oriented investment firm said it will release up to 20 percent of its   workforce over the next several months    March 18, 2003 35 of 101    State and local governments in the West have been handing out pink slips as well    Several thousand California teachers received layoff warnings in recent weeks, joining the ranks   of park rangers, reserve fire fighters, and library staff  Elsewhere in the District, states are   looking at salary cuts and program reductions rather than layoffs to balance budgets    California’s credit rating is now tied with Louisiana’s for last place after a round of downgrades   by major rating agencies  Although these downgrades increased states’ borrowing costs, our   estimates indicate that the increase will be small relative to the size of the budget and the budget   deficit  While state budgets have constrained government spending in the West, federal   increases for defense and homeland security expenditures have been a significant positive for the   District  The importance of defense dollars to the West can be seen at Boeing, where defense-   related business has helped offset declines in the commercial aircraft side  Boeing now employs   more people in the defense systems units than in commercial jets     Turning to the national economy, recent data have been negative on balance  Given these   data and intermeeting financial developments, we have lowered our expectations of growth this   year, even after allowing for some further easing of monetary policy  We now expect that real   GDP will grow 3 percent this year versus 3½ percent last time  As a result, excess capacity rises   further over the next few quarters, which puts downward pressure on core inflation  The core   PCE price index is now forecast to go up by just 1¼ percent in 2004  Along with the weaker   forecast we have heightened concerns about the potential downside  The longer the economy   remains partially paralyzed by high energy prices and uncertainty, the more serious the downside   risks  Our forecast that the pace of output growth will pick up during this year depends on   business fixed investment rebounding before consumer spending falters  Recent data on retail   sales and auto sales have not been reassuring in this regard  And there is as yet no convincing   March 18, 2003 36 of 101    evidence that investment spending is ready to take up the slack  Of course, the situation in Iraq   is contributing to some extent to the recent deterioration in economic activity  However, it’s not   certain that a quick favorable outcome is imminent or that such a resolution would provide an   immediate boost to the economy that would remove the need for additional stimulus  Some in   the private sector have postponed hard-to-reverse investment and hiring decisions in the face of   uncertainty     As in the Greenbook, our most likely scenario shows subpar growth and rising excess   capacity for the next year  Also, I agree with my colleague, President Minehan, about the risks    While the risks on both sides are sizable, the downside risks to both inflation and output are of   much greater concern to me  In my view a significant easing of policy seems appropriate as a bit   more insurance that we could take against these downside risks  Thank you     Mr Chairman, although I think an economic case can be made for easing   policy, I support your recommendation  I would also suggest that the idea of having a   March 18, 2003 80 of 101    conference call strikes me as very useful  It may be that a call wouldn’t necessarily be scheduled   only for the purpose of considering a policy change  If we’re going to have the events that we’re   all anticipating imminently, it seems to me that a call next week or even—     I’m thinking only in terms of getting updates from the staff about how   things are unfolding, not in terms of any consideration of policy action     We did     Fine     David, this is Bob Parry  When you made the revision to the current   quarter did you have the data on production of domestic motor vehicles and also the IP numbers?     Thank you     Dave, this is Bob Parry  At the beginning of your remarks you made   several comments about the general contour of the forecast  I think you said that, at least at the   present time, it looks as if the economy is continuing to expand sluggishly, particularly on the   private side, and that in contrast the fundamentals in some respects look stronger  Where would   you expect us to be at year-end in terms of progress in eliminating excess capacity in the   April 1, 2003 9 of 34    economy?  Will we likely be at a level similar to what was in the Greenbook or one that is   somewhat lower?     Right     Okay, thank you      Mr Chairman, this is Bob Parry  I agree with your analysis as well  Let   me mention one thing that I think might be helpful  We’ve been trying to survey businesses and   bankers and a lot of people in our District and we’re beginning to get some information that I   think is of some interest  I wonder if it might not make some sense either at the meeting on   April 8 or April 15 to have a somewhat abbreviated go-around so that, if people have new   information that might be worth communicating to the group, they can do so     Okay  Also, most of us will have had our directors’ meeting by then  I   know we have an advisory council meeting as well between April 8 and 15     Okay   April 1, 2003 14 of 34      David, this is Bob Parry  I was wondering if it’s possible at this point to   quantify the second half of the year and 2004 a bit  At the time of the Greenbook, of course, you   had a little over 4 percent growth in the second half of 2003 and a little over 4½ percent in 2004    Are you talking about a tenth or two or—      Okay, thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Indications are that economic growth in the   West is still sluggish, with the situation in Iraq having little discernible effect on spending in   most sectors  Uncertainty continues to hamper business spending  Capital investment that can   be postponed still is being postponed  Moreover, some businesses are revising down their   estimates for sales in coming quarters  For example, some department stores are concerned   about spring and summer sales and have canceled some apparel orders for the quarter  Also,   we’re still getting reports of layoffs, and firms appear reluctant to add to their payrolls  The   April 16, 2003 22 of 47    continuing sense of caution is confirmed by our banker contacts, who report that business   spending is still quite weak, although some strength exists in southern California and in Hawaii   Residential real estate except for high-end houses was doing well in the weeks before the   war started  Since then, however, new home sales appear to have remained strong, but the resale   market may have started to slip to some extent  Consumer spending can be described as fragile    Tourism, especially from abroad, is one area that has weakened noticeably over the past few   weeks, reflecting the effects perhaps of the conflict in Iraq but certainly concern over SARS    Passenger loads are down for international flights at all the major airports, and some airlines   have cancelled international flights  Hotel occupancy rates are down, and sales are down at   restaurants and at retailers dependent on tourism    Finally, turning to the national economy, like the Greenbook authors, we have lowered   our near-term forecast in response to incoming data  Thank you, Mr Chairman     David, I have a question about plant and equipment spending  In the last   forecast you indicated that geopolitical uncertainties and risks were likely to be taking a toll on   businesses’ plans for equipment and software spending  Of course, to some extent those   concerns have been resolved, but the forecast for plant and equipment spending in the second   half of the year has been revised down significantly  Does that suggest that there are more-  fundamental factors that have been at work for quite a few quarters in terms of the weakness in   plant and equipment spending?     One short follow-up question  The acceleration of equipment and   software spending in 2004 is quite marked  Is a significant portion of that due to the end of the   favorable tax treatment for equipment and software?     Thank you     Mr Chairman, the Twelfth District expansion continues to be sluggish but   seems only mildly affected by the Iraqi war and the SARS epidemic in East Asia  The main   impact of both events was a sharp reduction in international travel, especially from East Asia    As a result, airlines suspended some regularly scheduled East Asian flights, and load factors on   remaining flights fell by half or more  Some firms have reported increased difficulties in   maintaining overseas supply chains due to travel restrictions and scattered plant shutdowns in   May 6, 2003 28 of 115    East Asia  However, the production and supply effects of SARS have been quite limited to date,   and a recent pickup in domestic tourist travel suggests that war-induced anxieties are subsiding    More generally, the lack of bad news on the consumer side has been striking  Solid automobile   sales were fueled by generous incentives  And while sales of most small retail items have been   slow, they did not fall noticeably because of the war  Moreover, the existing vigor in housing   markets was largely maintained throughout the District   On the business side, firms have remained reluctant to expand employment or capacity in   anticipation of improved demand and bottom lines  Moreover, some firms stated that their   caution was not directly tied to the war with Iraq  Businesses have been investing in new   information technology equipment but mainly for replacement and upgrade purposes, and   District tech contacts are not especially sanguine about short-term prospects in the industry  For   example, the search for cost savings has led to increased reliance on overseas suppliers—  especially in China, where firms have undercut domestic production of some tech products  Of   course this has an upside as well, with US technology leaders such as Intel seeing strong   exports of their products for use in low cost assembly operations overseas   On a final negative note, District states are still struggling with budgetary woes  Revenue   flows have been uneven lately; and despite some successful efforts to bring spending in line,   most District states still face a large current year budget gap  Moreover, preliminary data for   April suggest that revenue in California may fall below even the more modest targets that it set   in January  That increases the need for borrowing and for other measures to ensure short-term   cash flow   Let me turn to the national economy  In light of weaker-than-expected economic data,   we like nearly everyone else revised down our real GDP forecast for this year  We now project   May 6, 2003 29 of 115    growth of about 2¾ percent, which is below most estimates of the potential rate  The risks to the   outlook have shifted in a favorable direction with the end of the armed conflict in Iraq, and it’s   certainly possible that this will lead to the rebound in activity that we’ve been looking for  But   substantial downside risks related to external developments remain, including the aftermath of   the war and ongoing geopolitical concerns, as do the risks from a well-known list of more   fundamental domestic economic concerns  These downside risks, combined with the   expectations for subpar growth, could have rather serious consequences in view of the low level   of inflation  With excess capacity in labor and product markets likely to remain at or above   current levels through the end of 2004, we expect core PCE inflation to fall to just over 1 percent   both this year and next  As Dave mentioned, the Greenbook has a similar forecast  After   adjusting for a reasonable estimate of measurement bias, the two forecasts imply true inflation of   about ½ of 1 percent  An analysis by the San Francisco staff of typical forecast errors for core   inflation suggests an uncomfortably high 20 percent probability that true inflation could fall   below zero next year  Of course, as we’ve just heard and as we read before in the Greenbook,   the Board staff puts this probability at 35 percent     This possibility brings to mind familiar research suggesting that, given the long lags in   the effects of policy, it’s best to move sooner rather than later when the economy is within range   of deflation and the zero bound  Therefore, as insurance against downside surprises to both   economic activity and inflation in the future, it would seem prudent to ease policy further    Thank you     Mr Chairman, I have just a comment  We’ve discussed the probability of   deflation quite a bit today, and a lot of attention was focused on the 35 percent probability in the   Board staff’s exercise  In answer to Tony’s comment about the time period used in that   simulation, I would note that we did do the exercise beginning in 1985, which is a much more   tractable period, and the probability we got was 20 percent as I indicated  It strikes me that both   of those exercises suggest that the probability of deflation is higher than I think we’re all   comfortable with      Mr Chairman, I think a good case could be made for a further easing of   policy today  The most likely scenario for the economy over the next year or so leaves   significant excess capacity in place  With low inflation and the economy in a weakened state, I   believe that erring on the side of ease most likely would entail very little cost whereas erring on   the side of inaction could be significantly more costly  The cost of inaction could be especially   large because we are within range of deflation and the zero bound  Finally, I believe that being   preemptive has served us well in the past  Quite frankly, if my recollection is correct, at times   our acting in a preemptive manner has involved surprising the markets, and I don’t think we’ve   suffered as a result of that     I also would say that the third paragraph is helpful to me  Let me make a few comments    I never thought when we talked about the upside and downside risks that it was in terms of   commenting on sustainable growth  It always meant to me the risks to our forecast of growth—  that we saw either upside or downside risks to our projection of growth, not to sustainable   growth, which I think is a very different concept  Also the last two sentences help me a bit   May 6, 2003 99 of 115    because they do point out clearly the issues that I think we ought to be focused on, particularly if   we’re still interested in acting in a preemptive way  Thank you     But it’s your baby!  [Laughter]     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would agree with you that, if we were   thinking about answering the four questions in order to come up with a tactical plan, the exercise   wouldn’t be very productive  But it seems to me, based upon the information provided by   Vincent and his colleagues, that there’s a lot of information that could prove to be useful under   certain future circumstances  That leads me to believe that it is worth studying some of the   issues raised in these papers  For example, there was a question asked by Vincent about   alternative instruments  I’d like to know a lot more about some of these alternatives—clearly the   use of the discount window and also longer-term Treasury securities  One concept that I thought   was extremely interesting was the issue raised about changing expectations  I think it would be   June 24-25, 2003 32 of 211    very interesting to find out a little more about the effect on expectations of making clearer to the   public our views on what rates of inflation we would find desirable  Those kinds of studies are   not in my view part of any tactical plan that we might implement in the future, but they may   contribute to our understanding of how we might want to react to certain events  I’ve tried to   talk about the desirability of making our views clearer on inflation rates without using the “T”   word  [Laughter]     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have a question about the Greenbook   baseline and also about the alternative simulations  First, after reading the text in the Greenbook,   it seemed somewhat surprising to me that you had the real growth numbers for the second half of   this year as low as they are  I’d be interested in what the results might have been had you   allowed the model just to run  That’s one question  Second, as always, the alternatives are very   interesting and certainly cover a very wide range of potential experience  But I’m rather   amazed—I think that’s the right word—that the lowest rate of growth for 2004 under any of the   alternatives is about 4¾ percent  If I went through this exercise, maybe I’d have a similar   problem  But I would say that, if one used a VAR model that is affected very much by what has   happened to the economy in the last three quarters, it would be pretty easy to get numbers that   June 24-25, 2003 77 of 211    are a lot lower than these  I just wondered whether you think real growth rates of 4¾ percent and   above really are where one would expect the reasonable alternatives to lie     Even the second-half result of 35 percent growth with the “weaker   response to fiscal policy” alternative is impressive   June 24-25, 2003 78 of 211      Okay, thank you     Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Twelfth District economy has shown   little sign of ending its lull  Consumer spending did not pick up much as the conflict in Iraq   subsided, and it even weakened a bit in some areas  Many retailers have been struggling with   thin margins, especially in Washington State and Oregon, which have had the highest   unemployment rates in the nation  In Washington, Boeing’s production of commercial aircraft   has dropped to its lowest levels since the mid-1990s, and the state has offered Boeing substantial   financial incentives to produce its newest commercial aircraft there rather than in one of the   numerous competing states  The District manufacturing sector more generally has been   struggling as well  For many IT products, demand has been especially weak of late, due in part   to the restraining effect of SARS on retail purchases of IT products by consumers in mainland   China  Few District manufacturers have plans to expand their capital investment spending this   year, although firms in other sectors are more upbeat     We also see some upbeat news in data for a few key sectors  New home sales and   construction have maintained a torrid pace, with only the slightest hint of slowing reflected in a   moderated pace of price appreciation in some areas  Increased federal government outlays for   defense hardware have provided substantial stimulus to local economies, with southern   California and especially Arizona ranked among the primary recipients of the new contracts  As   yet, however, the District has shown little or no sign of an improved employment outlook   overall  The depth of the job losses in some areas is startling  In the San Jose MSA, which   contains Silicon Valley, employment has fallen 18 percent since its peak in late 2000; and the   June 24-25, 2003 91 of 211    overall job losses in the San Francisco Bay area rival southern California’s losses during its   economic doldrums in the first half of the 1990s     The persistent economic weakness means that there has been little relief for most states   facing large revenue shortfalls in the upcoming fiscal year  In California, budget negotiations are   deadlocked; and with the campaign to recall Governor Davis now emerging as a significant   distraction, the state is unlikely to approve a new budget until several months have elapsed in the   new fiscal year  In the meantime, the state expects to sustain adequate cash flow through   September largely through the recent sale of $11 billion in warrants backed by future revenues    After that, additional and more costly short-term borrowing will be required unless a workable   budget is in place  California is also grappling with severe problems in its workmen’s   compensation system  Last year the typical Californian employer saw a 40 percent increase in   workers’ comp costs, and the trend has continued this year  This is large enough to noticeably   increase growth in total compensation costs, causing some current and potential employers to   reevaluate the desirability of operating in California   Let me turn to the national economy  Taken as a whole, the data on the current quarter   have been weaker than we expected, continuing the pattern of disappointing news that we’ve   seen for several quarters in a row  As a result, we’ve once again revised down our estimate of   growth, this time by a full percentage point  That said, there have been a few signs of   improvement in activity very recently, although they by no means constitute evidence of the   long-anticipated rebound   Going forward, financial developments and the recent fiscal package have caused us to   revise up our forecast for the next year and a half, although we are far less optimistic than the   Greenbook  Assuming a funds rate of 1 percent, our forecast shows growth of 3¾ percent in the   June 24-25, 2003 92 of 211    second half of this year and 4½ percent in 2004  Although a rebound in activity seems likely,   this scenario remains all forecast and little actual data  We have yet to see clear signs of the   acceleration in equipment and software spending that appears to be a key to a stronger economy    Nor have we seen a convincing rebound in confidence that would support investment spending   following the end of the Iraq war  Moreover, even with the acceleration in our forecast,   substantial excess capacity would remain in the economy through the end of next year  As a   result, we expect to see inflation remain low for some time, with core PCE prices expected to   increase about 1 percent both this year and next     Overall, we face considerable uncertainty about the future strength of the economy    There’s a strong likelihood of excess capacity continuing through next year even if the economy   does pick up steam  And we have low inflation  We believe this combination of considerations   makes a strong case for an easing of policy at this meeting  Thank you     I have two questions, Vincent  First, if we look at the middle chart in   exhibit 3, which shows the actual real federal funds rate, the current real rate has moved up since   the last meeting  How is an easing of 25 basis points an insurance policy?     Or about six weeks ago     Okay  Second, I just want to raise an issue, and if this is the wrong time, I   can come back to it  In exhibit 5 in the bottom left-hand corner, the panel entitled “For today’s   choice” says that the growth rate risks are balanced  The issue I want to raise at some point   relates to the word “sustainable” that shows up as an adjective in our statement  I really think the   way we used it the last time was wrong  I checked how we’ve used it in the past, and I think it   was different  It seems to me that the problem could be fixed very easily by using the word   “acceptable”  I may be focused on a point that seems narrow to some, but I just don’t think   “sustainable” was the right word the last time, and I can’t see how it would be right this time  I   don’t know if you’ve given any thought to that or come to any conclusion about it, so I wanted to   mention it  Or should we talk about that later?     Before May that is exactly what it meant   June 24-25, 2003 136 of 211      Well, it seems to me it’s a little problematic to view it one way one month   and a different way another month     Thank you     Mr Chairman, I really have a preference for a cut of 50 basis points, in   part because of the arguments that were made by Governor Gramlich  In addition to that, it   seems to me that 50 basis points would actually more than offset the decline in expected inflation   and, therefore, the increase in the real funds rate that has occurred since the last meeting  To me   a 25 basis point cut merely undoes an inadvertent tightening brought about by declining inflation   expectations  And if that’s the case, it’s hard for me to conceive of a cut of 25 basis points as   taking out an insurance policy  It just gets us back to where we were     “Acceptable”       Yes     In the first sentence of the second paragraph you list the reasons that there   is strength  When we talked about it earlier in the meeting, we were citing three reasons   monetary policy, productivity, and the stimulus from fiscal policy  The last one is missing from   the statement     Do we have any data on shipments of euros?  Could there be a   substitution process under way?     One thing we could do is to check with the cash product office  They and   New York work closely together on such issues   August 12, 2003 8 of 110      Dave, for some time now, market forecasts of inflation have been quite a   bit higher than the forecast of the Board staff or for that matter of the Committee members  As   an example, the inflation forecast for next year of the 10 lowest Blue Chip forecasts is about   ½ percentage point higher than ours, and of course, the midpoint of the Blue Chip forecasts is   even higher  Can you explain why that difference persists for so long?  Second, are you at all   concerned that, if other forecasts began to line up with ours, that development in itself could put   some downward pressures on inflation?  It would be an indication that the market’s expectations   for inflation were changing and we already have a very low inflation rate     I know     Well, what about the second point I made—that, if others were to change   their forecasts and become more convinced about the possibility of inflation rates being lower,   that could put some downward pressures on inflation rates as well going forward     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Twelfth District economy appears to have   gained some momentum coming into this quarter, although attitudes are still more cautious than   optimistic  Consumer spending is holding up generally and is actually picking up for leisure-  related businesses such as restaurants The recent rise in mortgage rates appears to be   accelerating home sales, as buyers on the fence look to lock in interest rates that are still below   historical norms     The IT sector is benefiting from the effects of a pickup in investment in equipment and   software  Jobs are being shed at a slower pace in IT manufacturing  And Intel and Apple   reported strong revenue growth in the second quarter, while Microsoft plans to increase R&D   and also hiring  Nonetheless, firms remain focused on cutting costs and increasing efficiency    So although they will be adding jobs down the line, growth will be muted, and many of the jobs   lost in the recent downturn are not expected to come back  Residents of tech-dependent areas   such as San Francisco and the Silicon Valley seem to agree, as on balance people are moving out   of these areas     August 12, 2003 25 of 110    In the Northwest, sour conditions in Boeing’s commercial side remain a drag on the   economy  Boeing recently announced yet another series of job cuts, this time of between 4,000   and 5,000 workers  Boeing’s commercial woes apparently are due to three trends  a decline in   the overall demand for commercial jets, a loss of market share to AirBus, and a shift in airline   demand toward smaller planes     All District states except Oregon have signed budgets for this fiscal year  Despite   widespread press reports of drastic cuts in spending, most states, including California, actually   will show a small increase in nominal spending in fiscal year 2004 compared with 2003    California avoided a decline in expenditures without raising general taxes, mainly by putting off   some hard choices for at least another year  The state’s near-term fiscal problems were handled   through a combination of spending deferrals, fee increases, use of one-time revenue sources, and   just over $14 billion in debt financing  On the heels of the budget signing, Moody’s downgraded   the state’s general obligation bonds, while Standard and Poor’s reaffirmed its earlier downgrade    The rating agencies’ concern is not the state’s immediate debt burden but rather its inability to   address the long-term imbalance between planned spending and expected revenues, which is   somewhere on the order of $8 billion   For the national economy, recent economic data generally were somewhat stronger than   expected  It was encouraging that real final demand by domestic purchasers jumped sharply in   the second quarter and that the increase was not only because of strong auto sales but was broad-  based and included investment in equipment and software  The recent improvement in   manufacturing output and the strengthening in corporate profits also raise the odds that the long-  anticipated investment-led rebound in the economy may be under way  However, there still is   plenty of room for uncertainty about the next few quarters  First, disappointing labor market   August 12, 2003 26 of 110    developments may suggest that businesses aren’t very comfortable about the future and also may   undermine the confidence of households  Second, there is the issue of how to interpret the   tightening of financial conditions since we met in June, especially the increases in interest rates    To some extent these increases suggest slower growth going forward, since they may represent   the market view that policy will be tighter in the future because we are less concerned about   deflation than we were in May and because the situation with respect to the federal deficit has   deteriorated  But part of the increase in rates also probably indicates stronger growth prospects   for the economy     On balance, we have changed our forecast very little from last time, although our   confidence that an acceleration in activity is under way has strengthened somewhat  Our   forecast is a little weaker than the one in the current Greenbook  We expect real GDP growth of   about 3½ percent in the latter half of this year and 4½ percent in 2004  As before, this   performance doesn’t appear strong enough to eliminate excess capacity in the economy by the   end of next year  As a result, we expect core PCE inflation to average about 1 percent in 2004,   which is about as low as I would like to see it go  Thank you     Mr Chairman, recent data give me more confidence that an acceleration   in economic activity has finally begun  At the same time, however, there is an uncomfortably   high risk that inflation may move lower than would be desirable  On balance, I do favor leaving   the funds rate unchanged at the present time and waiting awhile to see if the incipient rebound   continues to develop  I favor retaining our current risk assessment, with the risks being balanced   for growth and weighted toward the downside for inflation  In expressing our risk assessment, I   would prefer to use the wording in the Bluebook that we actually vote on rather than an   interpretation like the one in the last press statement  I’d feel more comfortable voting for a   particular risk assessment if I knew in advance exactly how it would be expressed to the public    This is an issue that I hope will be on the agenda for our discussion of communications in   September     The “mixed” is because of the initial claims data     Yes   August 12, 2003 85 of 110      That’s what we did last time   August 12, 2003 91 of 110      Could you read it again, please?     “Judges” or “believes”?  You said “believes” the first time     Eighteen     The meeting could start at 5 o’clock in the morning     Mr Chairman, I was planning to comment on some of the points that were   made by Vincent and by implication you as well  Is this the right time?  [Laughter]     Okay  Let me start by noting that I have never thought it was clear that   the post-meeting press release was a statement of the FOMC  I always considered it more the   Chairman’s statement than the Committee’s, and I thought it was presented at the meeting   September 15, 2003 26 of 78    mostly for information purposes about how policy would be communicated to the public    However, if the statement is to be used as an ongoing policy tool of the Committee, then in my   view it should be drafted in a way that reflects the views of the Committee in setting policy  For   example, if a risk assessment is included in the press statement, then it should be the same one   that was voted for by the Committee and not a restatement or reinterpretation of it  If the   wording in the Bluebook isn’t suitable for the press release, then it probably should be changed     Again, I’d feel more comfortable voting for a particular risk assessment if   I knew in advance exactly how it would be expressed to the public  Given this general principle   that the statement should be from the Committee, the remaining questions revolve around how   the Committee will draft its statement  One choice to be made is whether various alternative   wordings will be available to the Committee in advance or whether the statement will be   composed and edited during the meeting  My preference is for the former  Another choice is   whether to rely more on formulaic wording options or whether to use language basically tailored   to each meeting  I prefer primarily formulaic wording  I think some of the recent press releases   were too nuanced and inadvertently injected noise into the bond market  In general, I’m not   convinced that including more words in the release necessarily advances the cause of   transparency     In terms of process, I suggest that we “routinize,” to use Vincent’s term, the wording   options for much of the statement and circulate alternatives in advance  Editing should be a last   resort in which wording changes are suggested and then approved or rejected by the Committee    In terms of content, the wording of the risk assessment is at times ambiguous to me and should   September 15, 2003 27 of 78    be considered a work in process  I feel it has been useful to separate the risks, but they still need   considerable clarification  For example, the reference to the risks to economic activity should   include a level concept in my view, and I don’t think the current phrasing is up to that task     Some idea that we’re talking about the gap, sort of a Taylor rule     Right  But we know at times that it’s getting larger or getting smaller  At   least we have some views about that; otherwise it’s a little difficult to make policy     The “coulds,” “woulds,” and “mights”     When you say get back to Vincent, I want to clarify what you mean  For   example, if we use the current Bluebook, the staff set out two alternatives  I assume there would   be a discussion about each and the only question would be how the verbiage associated with one   of those alternatives should be modified?     I would hope Vincent wouldn’t have too great a burden as a result of that    I hope the language would stick to what I’d call the high points  I don’t want to use the word   “formulaic”       Mr Chairman, with regard to the first sentence of the proposed addition, it   seems to me that in the past we’ve referred to the objectives of fostering economic growth and   price stability as long term  So it would make some sense to stay with language that refers to our   objectives as being long term     No  I don’t think that’s what we meant in the past when we’ve used that   language  I think we knew that we couldn’t achieve our objectives in every instance, but they   were set out as long-term objectives     No, that’s fine     I agree   September 16, 2003 5 of 106      Dave, the Greenbook projects that the bond rate will fall as markets learn   that the economy can grow at above-potential rates without stoking inflationary pressures  As   you noted, the estimate of structural productivity growth has been revised up significantly That,   of course, should raise equilibrium real rates  Do you think the market will begin to incorporate   the higher equilibrium real rates at some point?  Wouldn’t that counteract the tendency for bond   rates to fall in response to changing market expectations for the funds rate?     Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity in the Twelfth District   appears to have picked up recently, but employment remains flat overall  Our contacts in the   manufacturing sector indicate that, although they’ve been continuing to shed jobs, they’re more   upbeat about business prospects  Several high-tech producers are reporting improvement in their   businesses  Revenues and production have been rising at Intel, and higher prices for memory   chips over the summer reflect the stronger demand at firms such as Micron     September 16, 2003 46 of 106    The improvement goes beyond the high-tech sector  For example, machine-tool makers   and metal fabricators in the District indicate that orders are up, and the majority of those   businesses are telling us that they are increasing capital spending  Consumer spending also is   rising  Back-to-school sales are reported to be strong in southern California  More broadly,   retailers are saying that price discounting has become less prevalent as demand has increased    Several District tourist destinations have started to see a rebound in activity after the lull   associated with SARS and the Iraqi war  At Los Angeles International Airport, international air   traffic has been increasing strongly, and some domestic routes are seeing increases as well  In   fact, Southwest and Song Airlines, a subsidiary of Delta, reportedly are planning to add flights   from Los Angeles to Las Vegas  San Diego hotel occupancy hit more than 83 percent, which is   among the highest in the country  In Hawaii the increase in domestic travelers has more than   made up for the decline in international travelers  At this point, total visitor traffic for the State   of Hawaii has regained pre-September 11 levels  Housing markets remain strong throughout the   District, especially so in southern California, Arizona, and Nevada  Along with that housing   strength have come reports of significant spending on major appliances and furniture     The fiscal situation in the District remains challenging  [Laughter]  The Oregon   legislature decided to meet its budget shortfall by passing a temporary increase in personal   income and corporate taxes, which will expire when the economy improves  In one of the more   original new tax proposals—and hoping you are all still alert—the citizens of Seattle will vote   soon on an initiative to place a tax of 10 cents a cup on espresso drinks  [Laughter]  In   California, with a structural shortfall of nearly $8 billion looming and uncertainty about the   recall election, investors still are requiring a premium on the state’s general obligation bonds of   September 16, 2003 47 of 106    about 40 basis points, only about 10 basis points lower than before the signing of the state’s   budget    For the national economy, the recent positive data strengthen the case that we’re finally   in a sustained rebound  I’m encouraged by the broad-based increase in demand, especially in the   key element of equipment investment, and by the upbeat news about corporate profits, equity   values, and productivity  Still, I won’t be convinced that we’re out of the woods until I’ve seen   some job growth  We’re not quite as optimistic as the Greenbook, but we have revised up our   projection of real GDP growth moderately—to 4 percent in the second half of the year and   4¾ percent in 2004  Although this faster growth absorbs some excess capacity and therefore   tempers my concerns about further declines in inflation, it doesn’t entirely mitigate them  Recent   productivity data do raise the odds that the trend is a bit higher than we thought  Of course, that   would offset some of the gains against excess capacity that we might have expected  The GDP   growth we anticipate going forward doesn’t appear to be fast enough to eliminate excess capacity   by the end of next year  This is an issue—considering that we expect core PCE inflation to   average only about 1 percent both this year and next, which is already at the low end of what I   consider to be the desirable range  Thank you     Mr Chairman, given the strength of the economy that we see, at least on   the basis of the most recent data, I support leaving the funds rate at 1 percent  However, even   with the expected pickup in growth, there’s an uncomfortably high risk that inflation may move   lower than would be desirable  Certainly in the Greenbook, with the revision to productivity, it’s   clear that the gap is probably greater today than we thought was the case in the past     I favor retaining our current risk assessments, with the risks being balanced for growth   and weighted toward the downside for inflation  But I do want to make a parenthetic point    When I read the Bluebook and heard Vincent’s presentation, I was struck by the case that was   made for an easing  In particular, one or two scenarios seemed to indicate that an easing might   be appropriate as something of an insurance policy—and one that I can’t see as having any cost    So I would suggest that, if indeed there is a perceptible lull in the economy, we ought to jump on   the chance to ease and the exit strategy will not be an issue     My question is related to that of President Moskow  At the end of the   forecast period, when the output gap in the baseline is close to zero and inflation is close to   1 percent, a neutral nominal federal funds rate would be around 3½ percent, which is about   where financial markets actually expect it to be  Isn’t that a more reasonable baseline   assumption than that of the Greenbook?   October 28, 2003 21 of 126      It would seem to me that perhaps one reason the financial markets might   have higher expectations with regard to inflation is that they’re looking at different models    Those models could have expectational effects that would be quite pronounced if our exogenous   assumptions about interest rates were to be incorporated     Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Recent economic growth in the Twelfth   District appears to have kept up with the national pace  In fact, Nevada and Hawaii have grown   quite rapidly with a boost from strong tourist trade  Arizona also has had relatively strong   growth, though our contacts tell us that this comes in part at the expense of California    October 28, 2003 33 of 126    Throughout the District our contacts have noted more cases of employees working longer hours   and of plans to add positions in coming months  However, it is also clear that firms are   continuing efforts to increase efficiency  Manufacturers in the District are reporting increases in   orders  The demand for building materials in the Northwest has been growing  On the   technology front, most IT producers are reporting improved business conditions  It is also   encouraging that R&D spending by IT and biotech firms generally has held up relatively well in   the downturn     With business conditions firming, office vacancy rates edged down recently in San   Francisco and Seattle, two areas that have been hit hard  The housing market in the District   remains strong, especially in the Phoenix area  In California much attention is on how the   governor-elect, Arnold Schwarzenegger, will deal with the state’s fiscal situation  For example,   the budget agreement worked out last August left the state with a structural budget shortfall of   about $8 billion for future fiscal years  Even more pressing, though, are the cracks forming in   the state’s budget agreement for the current fiscal year  In September the courts disallowed the   sale of $2 billion in pension bonds the state planned to use to make payments to its retirement   fund  More recently, a suit was filed challenging the legality of a proposed bond sale of $107   billion to pay off the short-term debt supporting current spending  Also thrown into the equation   is the governor-elect’s vow to reduce the car registration tax by $4 billion—which, of course,   would be a direct hit to state revenues  One plan put forth by the Schwarzenegger team to meet   funding needs is to issue about $20 billion in long-term general obligation bonds  This was not   well received in Sacramento or by the rating agencies  The reality, though, is that without new   debt of some kind the state will be in a cash flow crisis come next June   October 28, 2003 34 of 126    Once again we’ve been pleasantly surprised by the recent data on the national economy    As a result, we, too, have raised our estimate of how fast the economy is likely to grow in the   near term  We now expect real GDP to grow at a pace close to 5 percent in the second half of   this year and in 2004, which is really not that different from the Greenbook forecast  However,   we have a less accommodative path for monetary policy that is much closer to market   expectations  Output is expected to grow noticeably faster than its potential rate next year and to   continue to grow somewhat above potential the year after that, but the economy does not reach   full employment until the second half of 2005  So inflation is expected to remain around current   low levels  Although these low levels of inflation imply that disinflationary shocks could still   impose substantial costs upon the economy, recent data suggest that the risks are not as large as   before  In fact, recent developments such as the lower dollar have caused us to raise our   inflation forecast slightly  To me this suggests that it may be time to consider modifying the   risk-assessment statement to indicate that the risks to the inflation outlook are at least close to   being balanced       Vincent, in the top panel of exhibit 4, there is a column labeled   “unwelcome fall”  One thing we’ve learned in the last two quarters is that productivity has been   extraordinarily strong  Certainly the probability of a decline in inflation from, let’s say, the level   in the forecast may be reasonably remote, but the proportion of it that may be welcome may have   changed because of a shift in supply  There’s no mechanism for reflecting the fact that not all   declines in inflation are unwelcome     Of course     But it appears as though it would be less unwelcome than we may have   thought before we knew what was happening to productivity     Well, in my effort to communicate better with you, I feel better    [Laughter]     I agree with your recommendations     At the last meeting I came away with the impression that what we seemed   to agree on was that the directive wording and the risk assessment we voted on should be what   we communicated to the public  It was important to many of us—maybe to all of us—that the   communication directly reflect our vote  Is it naive, Vincent, to think that we could focus on the   directive wording and the risk assessment, which we didn’t seem to have too much trouble   agreeing to and voting on today, and find a way for that language to be what we release?  How   long did it take us to agree on that wording today—two nanoseconds?     What we agreed on is what is going to appear in the minutes     Yes    MR REINHART  That isn’t identical to what is in today’s press release for the   following reason—     Oh, I know that     Okay  Isn’t the goal to get the language in the vote and the press release   the same?  Why should that be so difficult?  Based on what I’ve read in the last couple of weeks,   October 28, 2003 96 of 126    it’s extremely difficult  I don’t understand why  Maybe we need an English teacher or   grammarian     Yes, I noticed     We have to address the issue of whether we would get the same kind of   product as we do now     Dave, your comments today as well as a memo that was sent to the FOMC   contained a discussion of how rapidly employment is likely to grow  The view is that   employment growth basically is going to be consistent with what we’ve seen in the past    Frankly, I don’t really have much of a problem with that view  But one certainly hears a lot in   the public arena—from editorial writers, commentators, and so forth—about the impact of   special factors that are going to make such growth less likely to occur  These observers refer, of   course, to outsourcing, the loss of manufacturing jobs, and those kinds of things  My impression   is that the numbers attributable to those developments are really too small to make much of a   difference  Do you have a view about it?     Well, I think what’s involved now is a rather vocal group of skilled   workers, who are getting a lot of attention  We hear stories about financial analysis being   conducted in India       I agree  But nearly everybody one talks to believes this is happening    That’s the point I’d make     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Twelfth District economy gained   momentum in recent months, posting solid growth in a broad range of sectors  Consumers   continue to do their part  Early reports for the Thanksgiving holiday weekend suggest that   shoppers were out in force and were spending  Contacts noted that retailers are approaching the   holiday season with leaner inventories, hoping to avoid the heavy discounting that cut into   margins last year    District businesses also increased spending by entering into contracts with advertisers,   marketing firms, and IT support firms  One advertising consultant said that, after months of   cutting costs, firms have begun to turn their attention to building revenues  The improvement in   business conditions has been good news for commercial landlords  Several contacts noted a   pickup in the number of firms renewing rather than relinquishing their leases  Finally, the effects   of sustained economic growth have started to show up in the labor market  The pickup in hiring   has been broad-based, with only a few sectors still shedding jobs  Contacts suggest that this   improvement is not transitory  Many firms say that they will need to increase payrolls as   demand grows; nonetheless, they plan to remain cautious   Despite improved economic conditions, state budget troubles continue to be an issue,   especially in California  California lawmakers once again are in a special session in an effort to   gain control of the state budget  First they need to close a $17 billion hole in the current fiscal   year  Once the near-term hole is filled, legislators will still need to close a $14 billion structural   December 9, 2003 40 of 133    gap for the coming fiscal year  The governor has proposed resolving the near-term shortfall with   $15 billion in deficit-reduction general-obligation bonds and $2 billion in spending cuts and   deferrals  He wants to close the longer-term structural gap with a cap on expenditures next year   and rules limiting spending growth for all future years  The governor is taking his budget plan to   the public, campaigning across the state  At the same time, State Treasurer Angelides also is   going to the public, making a case against the governor’s plan  Angelides and other Democrats   prefer to cover the near-term shortfall with tax increases and intermediate-term borrowing  Their   plan for closing the $14 billion structural gap consists of modest reductions in spending together   with ongoing deferrals and additional loans  Despite the vast differences between the parties, the   heat is on to reach a compromise  The governor’s proposal requires voter approval, and the   legislature will need to act quickly to get the proposal on the March 2, 2004, ballot  Without   some resolution, California will be in a cash flow crisis next June and in fiscal trouble for some   time to come     Turning to the national economy, recent data have been better than expected once again;   and like the Greenbook, we are optimistic about the economy going forward  We expect real   GDP growth to be about 4 percent this quarter and to average about 5 percent next year and   4 percent in 2005  Unlike the Greenbook, this forecast assumes that the funds rate will begin to   move up as early as the middle of next year  Naturally, these growth rates imply rising levels of   resource utilization over the forecast period  We expect the unemployment rate to fall to about   5¼ percent by year-end next year and to 5 percent by the middle of 2005  Still, the economy will   have considerable slack over the near term, so inflation is likely to remain subdued, with core   PCE prices rising a shade more than 1 percent in each of the next two years     December 9, 2003 41 of 133    Although this inflation forecast is about the same as last time, it seems to me that the   risks are not the same  Specifically, the recent data appear to have reduced the risk of deflation    I’ve already mentioned the faster-than-expected output growth; I am also less concerned about   the inflation data than I was earlier  You may recall, and I think this was even mentioned earlier   today, that core PCE inflation showed zero growth during several months in the first half of the   year  That has not been the case of late  Financial market developments point in the same   direction  For instance, the dollar obviously has been falling recently  I don’t mean to claim that   there’s no risk of deflation  Continued high productivity growth, for example, could exert   downward pressure on prices  However, I’d be less worried about deflation from that source  In   any case, my point is that the risks with respect to inflation appear balanced now, and it seems to   me that our statement should reflect this change in the risk assessment  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  As you know, I’ve indicated a preference for   balance in terms of the inflation risk  It seems to me, however, that the suggestion you have   made moves us a long way in that direction and, therefore, I’m very comfortable with your   recommendation   December 9, 2003 99 of 133      Roger, Cathy referred to these three options as having lots of moving   parts  I think they are different  The number of moving parts and the number of things we have   to agree on are very different  One of the proposals has language we’ve actually used for years   and never had any problems with—or at least very few  While I agree that we don’t want to   have a lot of moving parts, I do not think that all three of the options are the same in that regard    So it seems to me that we can look at these three alternatives     That might end it!     Tony, that would be a shorter statement?     Thank you  I began this process as a member of the working group   leaning toward formulaic language, and the alternative that seemed most appealing to me was the   January 27-28, 2004 30 of 238    “levels A” one  But it became clear to me that, even in our group of seven, it would be   extremely difficult to get a consensus built around that alternative  In fact, I wonder whether we   can build a consensus of nineteen around any of the three alternatives, which leads me to believe   that probably the approach now being referred to as “gradual evolution” might be the correct   route to go  It seems to me that, if we have language in the Bluebook that is specific to the   policy alternatives, then the discussion of the words associated with whatever policy we want to   follow should be rather simple, requiring relatively few changes  Of course, Ned, the policy   decision would determine the statement we would issue; it would be based on that vote  So I   come to the conclusion that, given our different views of how the economy works, we probably   ought to look more at the gradual evolution alternative     I’m interested in but not yet enthusiastic about accelerating the release of   the minutes  I think the information advantage to the markets of getting the minutes roughly in   their current form several weeks earlier would be meaningful  But since the earlier release of the   minutes would become a significant policy event in itself and since it precedes the next FOMC   meeting, I am concerned that the accelerated minutes would be different and perhaps less   informative than the current ones  I also worry that our discussions would be affected by the   knowledge that the market would focus more sharply on the minutes than they do now  That   leads me to the view, if we’re going to pursue this—and I’d certainly be supportive of going the   January 27-28, 2004 53 of 238    next step or two—that we should have trial runs or parallel processes  For me the issue is not   getting the minutes drafted—I think the staff can do that readily—but the process of editing and   resolving any disagreements that may arise with regard to specific editing changes  So in my   view there’s room to look at this further     Thank you  I assume that we’ll continue with the MPR forecast, so I   would suggest only minor changes much along the lines of those mentioned by Governor   Bernanke  I think going to the core PCE measure makes a lot of sense because that’s in fact   what we focus on  And I’d probably favor a slight change in terms of the duration of the   forecast  I’d take the January forecast out two years so that both forecasts made in a single year   cover the same time period  I think that would be useful to the public       Thank you  Sandy, I have a question about inflation related to the panel   on the top right of chart 13  If we were looking at this chart in quarterly terms, we would be   seeing at the end of 2003 a rate of 05 percent—that’s the number in the Greenbook—and then it   goes up to 10 percent in the first quarter of this year  I know that in the Greenbook the recent   softness was characterized as “likely temporary”  I just wondered if you could talk about that a   bit because obviously, if it turns out to be less temporary, it would affect one’s assessment of the   probability of deflation and so forth  There wasn’t much said about why it is viewed as likely to   be temporary   January 27-28, 2004 107 of 238      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity in the Twelfth District   continues to gain momentum  For example, retailers in the West had an encouraging holiday   season, with considerably stronger sales this year than last year  Spending by businesses is also   picking up  The bulk of our contacts say that they will increase capital spending going forward,   citing plans to replace both IT and non-IT equipment  One machine tool maker tells us that her   order book is full for the entire year  District computer makers like Hewlett-Packard have seen   sharp increases in demand, helping to boost output for semiconductors and in turn semiconductor   equipment  Commercial aerospace has yet to see a pickup in capital spending; however, folks in   Washington State breathed a sigh of relief when Boeing decided last month to go forward with   developing the new 7E7 and to assemble the planes in the Seattle area  Overall, the labor   markets in the west have improved over the past year, especially outside California  In fact,   nonfarm payrolls in the Twelfth District outside California are back up to pre-recession levels     In California, a new governor and to some extent an improved economic outlook have   motivated lawmakers to break the gridlock and tackle the state’s accumulated and long-term   budget shortfall  In late December, legislators voted to place a long-term deficit reduction bond   and a state reserve fund requirement on the March 2 ballot  The deficit reduction bond would   refinance the state’s accumulated deficit from the current and previous budget years  At this   point, polls show limited public support for the initiative, but the governor and the state’s   comptroller have started a big push to convince voters to approve the ballot measures  A few   weeks ago, the governor turned his attention to the state’s long-run structural gap, proposing a   multiyear workout plan  For the 2004-05 fiscal year, the plan calls for $9 billion in permanent   spending cuts and programs saving $6 billion in loans and deferrals  We will see some fee   increases such as for higher education, but new broad-based taxes are not in the plan  So far the   January 27-28, 2004 122 of 238    governor’s proposal has received more positive than negative feedback  The independent   legislative analyst’s office called the plan a solid first step  The state comptroller, a Democrat,   and several members of the legislature from both parties have stated that they will work with the   governor to craft a final agreement  That said, significant hurdles to enacting a budget remain    A formidable group of lawmakers wants to raise taxes, and several of the governor’s proposed   spending cuts and spending deferrals may not withstand legal challenges  One example is the   proposal to reduce fees for MediCal doctors  Some of the governor’s revenue hopes also may   not be realized  He wants to get a larger share of revenue from tribal gaming, but the US   Department of the Interior probably will not cooperate since it has blocked similar contracts in   recent years     Turning to the national outlook, recent data on spending confirm that economic activity is   on a path of robust growth  We expect GDP to grow about 5 percent this year and about   4¼ percent next year  This forecast assumes that policy remains on hold until the fourth quarter   of this year and then tightens gradually until the funds rate reaches 2½ percent by the end of   2005  Under this scenario, resource utilization would rise over the next two years, and the   unemployment rate would fall to about 5¼ percent by the end of this year and to 5 percent by the   end of 2005  Here I must admit that the unusual behavior of payroll employment and labor force   participation raises questions about the amount of labor slack going forward     The latest data on core inflation have come in very low indeed  These data together with   earlier revisions imply that the core PCE price index rose hardly at all over the past year after   adjusting for bias  In response, we have lowered our forecast of inflation, and we now expect   core PCE inflation to come in at 1 percent this year and slightly above 1 percent next year  The   new data also raise the possibility that inflation will decline further to uncomfortably low levels    January 27-28, 2004 123 of 238    Although the probabilities of upward and downward movements in inflation may be balanced,   the cost of a bit higher inflation appears smaller than the cost of a bit lower inflation  To me, the   inflation and employment data argue strongly for leaving policy unchanged despite the strong   growth in real GDP  Further, some long-run simulations carried out by my staff suggest that a   policy of leaving the funds rate at 1 percent through the end of this year leads to unemployment   and inflation paths that are virtually indistinguishable from those generated under the optimal   policy, assuming an inflation goal of somewhere between 1 and 2 percent  Thank you     May I ask a question?  If you look in the Bluebook, the range of estimates   of the real equilibrium rate has shifted up substantially, which could suggest that we’re a lot   January 27-28, 2004 170 of 238    farther away from the real equilibrium rate than we thought  This is especially true for the   estimates based on the FRB/US model  Can you comment on that?     Okay     It’s wider       Yes     Mr Chairman, I support both your recommendation on the rate and the   change in the wording  I have a question  At our last meeting we voted on the exact words in   the press release  Are we going to do that again?     Thanks     It’s two more than I know about!     Thank you     Dave, there is a simulation called “rising inflation expectations” in the   Greenbook in which inflation expectations increase gradually by 1 percentage point  I don’t   March 16, 2004 21 of 107    know from what level to what level, but I do know that some of the surveys that we see, such as   the Blue Chip survey, suggest that inflation expectations are quite high—around 2¼ or   2½ percent  I think it would be interesting to know what the results of a declining inflation   expectations scenario would be because, if indeed the market expects 2 percent, it’s possible that   view could change  If that were to occur, I would assume that conceivably we could see   inflation rates moving down from current levels  So I’d find that to be a more interesting   alternative  But I just don’t know what the levels were in the scenario where the inflation   expectations number rose 1 percent  It went up from what to what?     I bet it’s a lot lower than 2½     You could exogenously make it 2½ percent      Okay, thank you     Mr Chairman, economic activity in the Twelfth District is moving ahead   solidly, with some areas growing quite rapidly  Many of our retail contacts are upbeat about   sales, even as they remain concerned about competitive pressures holding down prices  Housing   March 16, 2004 39 of 107    prices have boomed in many parts of the West recently  Low interest rates are part of the reason,   but local economic conditions also are important  House prices are up the most in Southern   California and in the state’s Central Valley, two areas with relatively rapid population growth   and expanding economies  At the other end of the spectrum, the hard-hit IT centers such as   Silicon Valley have seen little appreciation in home values  Conditions in the manufacturing   sector have become more upbeat  Part of the boost has come from a pickup in exports, including   increased sales of semiconductors to Asia  Competitive pressures, however, continue to force IT   producers to cut costs  That’s why Intel plans to move production of flash memory chips along   with 300 jobs to Oregon from its headquarters in California   In some parts of the District, strong economic growth has translated into notable gains in   jobs, though overall job creation has been tepid  Our contacts say that health care costs are   restraining hiring These costs were a central issue in the five-month long strike by grocery   workers that was recently settled in Southern California  That settlement will result in a shifting   of some health care costs to employees, and it likely sets the stage for a similar outcome in   upcoming contract negotiations in Northern California  The cost of workers’ compensation also   is a big issue, especially in California  Governor Schwarzenegger wants the legislature to reform   the law by the end of March  If the lawmakers don’t deliver, the governor plans to put his own   workers’ compensation reform package before the public on the November ballot  This is being   taken seriously given his recent success in convincing voters to pass two propositions that make   up phase 1 of the governor’s fiscal recovery plan     On March 2, voters overwhelmingly passed Propositions 57 and 58  Proposition 57 lets   the state issue up to $15 billion in general obligation (GO) bonds to finance accumulated deficits   from the current and previous fiscal years and to supplement revenues in the upcoming fiscal   March 16, 2004 40 of 107    year  Proposition 58 is Proposition 57’s quid pro quo  Once the $15 billion is gone, lawmakers   are barred from additional borrowing to meet budget shortfalls  Moreover, they must put aside   money to accumulate a state reserve fund  Rating agencies and market participants seem   encouraged by the vote  Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s upgraded their California outlook   statements, and spreads on California GO bonds narrowed slightly  State administrators have   placed Prop 57 on a fast track  An initial offering of $6 billion in bonds is planned for early   June  The state will use the proceeds, along with deferrals of payments to certain state programs,   to finance its accumulated deficits of $86 billion  Once the accumulated deficit is taken care of,   the remaining bond allowance can be used to fund current and future spending  Governor   Schwarzenegger supports this option, wanting to avoid drastic cuts  But several legislators are   urging tax increases or spending rollbacks to restore balance  With the state facing a $15 billion   structural gap in the upcoming fiscal year, California’s fiscal health likely will require a   combination of all of these elements   Turning to the nation, recent data have been mixed and taken together are moderately   weaker than we expected  While the data are still broadly consistent with the economy’s being   on a robust path of growth, they do heighten concern about downside risks  Disappointing   payroll employment and consumer spending are particularly relevant in this regard since the   household sector seems to be the main source of downside risk to a robust investment-led   expansion  In any event, we have lowered our forecast for the current quarter to 43 percent and   reduced our projection for the year as a whole by 04 percent, to 47 percent  Under this   scenario, resource utilization would rise a bit over the year, and the unemployment rate would   fall below 55 percent by the fourth quarter  Here the latest data on payroll employment and   labor force participation continue to raise questions about the amount of labor market slack going   March 16, 2004 41 of 107    forward  The most recent data on core inflation continue to indicate that we are close to price   stability  Our expectation for core PCE price inflation in 2004 remains at 1 percent, and for core   CPI inflation it is around 1¼ percent  As I mentioned, the latest edition of the Blue Chip   economic indicators includes long-range inflation projections suggesting that the Fed is going to   allow inflation to rise to around 2¼ to 2½ percent over the next ten years  Given that this is the   last time I will participate in these meetings, I’d like to say that I hope the Blue Chip panel turns   out to be wrong on that one!  [Laughter]     Mr Chairman, I certainly support your proposal  I also think that it’s a   very close call with regard to the balance on inflation  I must admit that recent developments in   energy prices and the value of the dollar have led me to conclude that it probably would be better   to talk in terms of balanced inflation risks  But for now, I could support your recommendation  I   think a change in our statement about the inflation risks is imminent; it’s just a matter of exactly   when it will be made     The old guy!
