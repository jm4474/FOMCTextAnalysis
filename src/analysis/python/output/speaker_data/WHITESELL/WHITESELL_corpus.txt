 The Committee again must decide whether to make any adjustments in the ranges for money and debt growth, which have been unchanged since mid-1995 In recent years, the Committee has been interpreting the monetary ranges as those that would be consistent with price stability and normal velocity behavior, while the debt range, by contrast, has remained fairly well centered on the staff's projected growth rate for this aggregate One reason for adopting this rationale for the monetary ranges was uncertainty about the behavior of velocity early in this decade  The handout reproduces several charts from the Bluebook that examine more recent evidence on this issue 3/ Chart 4 depicts the relationship of M2 velocity to opportunity costs--defined as the three-month Treasury bill rate less the weighted-average interest rate on M2 assets Breaking the analysis into four subperiods allows for shifts in the level of velocity--the largest by far being that of the early 1990s The elasticity of V2 with respect to opportunity costs was held constant across the four subperiods at its value estimated over 1977 to 1990 The panel on the lower right indicates that, after allowing for a level shift in the early 1990s, M2 velocity has had about as close a relationship to opportunity costs recently as it did in the past Chart 5 plots the percentage deviations of V2 as predicted by opportunity costs from its actual levels For the recent period, while the errors tend to run in the same direction for a while, they are not larger on average than those for other historical periods  But even if M2 velocity is again as predictable as it was prior to this decade, it may not be predictable enough Suppose the Committee decided to center a range of 4 percentage points in width on its forecast of M2, which was based on its desired growth of nominal spending If M2 began to move out of that range because of a departure of GDP from expectations, the monetary aggregate would be providing an appropriate signal for policy However, M2 may at times diverge from its range not because of movements of GDP but because of unforeseen interest rate changes or noise in money demand Such divergences would be reflected in errors in forecasting velocity, which are investigated in the upper panel of Chart 6 The solid line shows the errors in the Board staff's predictions in February of the annual growth of M2 velocity, based on Greenbook interest rate assumptions The parallel dashed lines show a 4 percentage point range  3/ Copies of the charts are appended to the transcript (Appendix 3)    6/30-7/1/98  around the projections There were six cases in the last 15 years in which errors in predicting V2 were outside that range The dotted line adjusts the errors in V2 for deviations of the federal funds rate from Greenbook assumptions; two of the six velocity forecast errors exceeding the range width could plausibly be attributed to unforeseen interest rate changes, while the other four were evidently noise in money demand  This analysis suggests that if you do again use a range for M2 that reflects M2's forecast growth for the year, you should expect on occasion a departure from that range because of unpredictable elements in money demand and not only because a change in policy was needed or was made  Despite the uncertainty in money demand, M2 still seems to be of some use as an economic indicator For instance, there is a strong correlation between the growth of M2 in one year and the growth of nominal GDP in the next Another example of the indicator value of M2 is shown in the lower panel of Chart 6, which plots surprises in nominal GDP relative to the staff forecast along with surprises in M2 adjusted for the effects of deviations of the funds rate from Greenbook assumptions The positive correlation suggests that incoming data on M2, which are available well before the final GDP numbers, give some guidance on contemporaneous developments in nominal spending The Bluebook provided a similar analysis of M3, not shown here, and found that the forecast errors for the velocity of M3 have been slightly larger than those for M2, while the relationship of M3 to GDP is a little weaker than that for M2  The final page of the handout is a table from the Bluebook showing the staff projections for money and debt growth and three alternative sets of ranges for the Committee's consideration We expect that growth of money and of debt will slow from their robust pace over the first half of this year, largely because of a deceleration of nominal spending In addition, the differentials between the growth rates of these aggregates and nominal GDP are projected to narrow in an environment in which longer-term interest rates edge up and the stock market slips off a bit Committee members may have a somewhat stronger outlook for money and debt growth than the staff, as the central tendencies of your forecasts for nominal GDP exceed the Greenbook projections by something in the neighborhood of 1/2 percentage point for this year and 1 percentage point for 1999 This would imply higher money growth by similar amounts, other things equal However, a couple of you noted yesterday that you had assumed a higher funds rate in making your forecasts, and that would damp money growth For instance, a funds rate 3/4 percentage point higher by the end of this year would mean nearly a percentage point weaker M2 growth over 1999, and the combined effects of the stronger nominal GDP and this higher funds rate could be roughly a wash    6/30-7/1/98  In 1998, M2 and M3 are projected by the staff to grow appreciably faster than their current ranges, shown in alternative I, and M3 is expected to exceed its current range next year Alternative II shows ranges reasonably centered on the staff projections for money and debt growth for 1999, albeit with the midpoints of the M3 and debt ranges a bit below the staff projection on the thought that the Committee's concerns about inflation pressures suggest that you would rather round the ranges down than up Alternative III could be used if the Committee wished to adjust the range for the debt aggregate downward further to make it consistent with the expected growth of debt under conditions of price stability, assuming the members see trend nominal GDP growth at price stability of around 3 percent, as does the staff  While the monetary aggregates have some value as economic indicators when considered in the context of a variety of other variables, it is now widely recognized that the monetary aggregates are not suitable for a role as intermediate policy targets Nonetheless, ranges for money and debt growth can be a useful means for the Committee to communicate to the public If you prefer to avoid attracting any attention to these financial quantities and have no intention of using them in policymaking, then leaving the ranges for 1998 unchanged and carrying them forward to 1999 might be your choice You could also use the ranges to communicate to the public the rate of inflation you believe to be consistent with maximum economic growth over the long run; this might be true price stability as implied by the current monetary ranges, or perhaps a small positive inflation rate that allowed some flexibility for policy above the zero bound on nominal interest rates The latter would imply an upward adjustment from the current ranges  Alternatively, ranges based on annual projections for money and debt could help inform the public about your expected annual growth of these aggregates, which could be useful, particularly if you had some sense of what growth rates would begin to raise concerns for you Rapid money growth relative to the ranges might be one factor you could cite in explaining a policy tightening, particularly if it were preemptive in nature Such projection-based ranges would also be closer to the spirit of the reporting mandated by Congress Projection-based ranges need not be linked to any greater emphasis on the monetary and debt aggregates in policymaking The Committee could make clear to the public that the forecast ranges were not at all policy targets and perhaps go even further to state that no additional weight on the aggregates was intended by a return to projection-based ranges On the other hand, retaining price stability ranges for the monetary aggregates does not preclude your giving them more attention in policymaking  Absolutely, and that is what that graph shows We may  sometimes be in danger of trying to overinterpret wiggles in money demand There does seem to  be some tendency over time for money demand to return to levels estimated by opportunity  costs, aside from the periods where we have had major shifts Instead of breaking past history  into subperiods, we alternatively have estimated money demand over a time frame--1964  through 1988--that has a very gentle uptrend in M2 velocity It could be that over long stretches  of time we have had some substitution out of monetary assets into alternative investments that is  reflected in rising velocity When the increased availability of bond and stock mutual funds  became very apparent to households in the early 1990s, especially with a steep yield curve at that  time, there was a burst of substitution out of monetary assets It seems that that phenomenon has  stabilized over the last few years, and there has not been what we had feared would be a  continuing substitution back and forth between bond and stock mutual funds and monetary  assets Of course, the stock market has not really been fully tested yet for that result It does  seem to be the case that the velocity of M2 is returning to the same type of relationship to  opportunity costs that it had in previous periods  To some extent, I would say yes Obviously, we do not have--  The staff forecast actually is in the first two columns of the last  table  Right  Projected M2 growth continues to be slightly above nominal  GDP growth so velocity would be edging downward in 1999 as well  I'm not sure if it exactly hits the opportunity cost line  Obviously, we are projecting that the opportunity cost itself will be flat I'm not sure where  velocity exactly hits on a level basis, but it gets very close to that opportunity cost estimate We  had some special factors affecting M2 over the first half of this year We had mortgage  refinancing effects, which boosted M2 growth We had very strong tax payments in the second  quarter that also provided a boost to M2 Those factors will unwind over the second half of the  year, but we still are projecting a velocity decline this year for the first time since 1986 We  anticipate that M2 growth will be returning to a rate closer to that of GDP next year when the  temporary effects disappear We do try to speculate about portfolio effects such as those  associated with shifts in expected rates of return, substitution effects, and possible wealth  effects--so-called rebalancing effects There also could be transactions effects associated with    6/30-7/1/98  high payouts of capital gains and retirements of equity that will boost M2 growth temporarily,  but our knowledge of these effects is very speculative    Thank you, Mr Chairman  This briefing provides background for   the Committee's decision regarding the ranges for money and debt in 2000  I'll be referring to   charts and tables in the Bluebook that have been distributed separately to you this morning 3    The Humphrey-Hawkins report of last July noted that the growth  rates of the monetary aggregates were likely to be at or above their longer- term price stability ranges in 1999 and 2000, given Committee members'  projections for nominal GDP growth  In fact, nominal GDP expanded faster  than the range of projections of Committee members last July, and the  monetary aggregates grew noticeably above their ranges  M2 expanded            6-1/4 percent last year and its velocity declined slightly on balance   Although M2 velocity tracked the rise in its opportunity cost rather well  over the second half of the year, as shown in chart 1, that conformance with  historical relationships followed a period when movements in velocity were  not so readily explained  From the end of 1995 through mid-1999, velocity  rose and then declined, despite rather stable opportunity costs, as  conventionally measured  The demand for M2 assets over that period is not  fully understood, but we believe that it was importantly affected by  interactions with household stock market investments  Increases in velocity  up to mid-1997 were associated with strong flows into stock mutual funds,  excluding retirement accounts, suggesting substitution of equity investments  for M2 assets  As capital gains boosted stock market wealth over the next  two years, however, non-retirement flows into equity mutual funds slowed  noticeably, and M2 strengthened relative to income, perhaps reflecting some  portfolio rebalancing by households  On balance, M2 demand, while more  predictable than in the early 1990s, remains very uncertain  As regards M3,  growth for the year came to 7-1/2 percent, boosted to some extent by a  Y2K-related surge in institutional money funds and large time deposits      Turning back to table 1, M2 growth is expected to moderate   substantially to 4-3/4 percent in 2000, despite projected growth of nominal  GDP at about 6 percent--the same as in 1999  The slowing in M2 growth                                                                  3 A copy of the charts used by Mr Whitesell is appended to this transcript  (Appendix 3)          81  owes importantly to the staff’s assumption of an increase in the federal  funds rate of 1-1/4 percentage points over this year, which should help to  induce a substantial rise in M2 velocity  The staff anticipates that the  demand for retail money funds and M2 deposits will be buoyed a little over  the year owing to disappointing returns for stock market investors      M3 is also projected to grow substantially slower--6-1/4 percent--  this year  Expansion of institutional money funds should weaken  appreciably as the buildup of corporate liquidity in late 1999 dissipates and  as investors find yields on market instruments more attractive than the  lagging returns on money funds  The managed liabilities of banks in M3  should also increase more slowly this year, as banks pare back their  extraordinary Y2K-related pace of issuance of the fourth quarter  But with  loan demand expected to remain strong over the year, M3 should continue to  grow faster than nominal GDP       The runoff of federal debt is projected to accelerate this year,   helping to slow growth of the debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors from    6-1/2 percent in 1999 to 5-1/4 percent this year  The advance in nonfederal  debt is also expected to edge down, though to a still rapid 8-1/4 percent   Although the gap between business capital spending and the generation of  new internal funds should widen noticeably this year, the external financing  needs of businesses will be restrained by the substantial volume of liquid  assets they accumulated in late 1999 and by a projected slower pace of  equity retirements  Household debt growth is also expected to ease  somewhat, along with home purchases and spending on durables, owing to  higher interest rates and a sluggish stock market       Table 2 in the lower panel shows the provisional ranges for money   and debt in 2000 that you selected last July, along with an alternative that  adjusts the money ranges for faster growth of potential GDP  Since the mid- 1990s the Committee has chosen ranges for the monetary aggregates that are  benchmarks for money growth under conditions of long-term price stability  and historically typical velocity trends, while the range for domestic  nonfinancial debt has been aligned with the projected growth of that  aggregate  The provisional range for debt, at 3 to 7 percent, is centered not  far from the staff’s projection for debt growth in 2000 and, therefore, no  alternative setting for that range is offered for consideration       You may wish once again to retain the provisional ranges, perhaps   as an implicit indication to the public of the low weight placed on the  monetary aggregates in formulating monetary policy  The existing ranges  might also be selected if the increases in productivity growth observed in  recent years were seen as likely to be transitory               82  On the other hand, the Humphrey-Hawkins report of last July noted  that an adjustment to the monetary ranges might be needed if the more rapid  recent pace of productivity growth persisted  In fact, with exceptional  strength in the second half of 1999, nonfarm business productivity grew an  estimated 3-1/4 percent over the last four quarters  In light of our analysis  of productivity behavior in recent years, the staff has revised upward its  estimates of the expansion of potential output  When the Committee shifted  to using price stability ranges in the mid-1990s, potential output growth was  thought to be only around 2-1/4 percent  However, the staff estimates that  potential GDP growth has averaged 3-1/2 percent over the last four years   Adding perhaps about 1/2 percentage point of upward bias in the implicit  deflator, that would imply nominal GDP growth at a 4 percent rate under  conditions of price stability  The ranges in alternative II are adjusted  upward to be better aligned with this faster steady-state growth of nominal  GDP, assuming historically typical velocity behavior  As shown in chart 2,  M2 velocity has been stable over most of its history, while M3 velocity has  generally trended down        The central tendency of potential output growth implied by your   forecasts for this year appears to be at about the 3-1/2 to 3-3/4 percent  expansion of real GDP you have, given the roughly unchanged  unemployment rate  This growth rate for potential, plus the estimated  inflation measurement bias, would be very close to the midpoint of the  ranges shown in alternative II  As you know, the staff has revised up its  projection for potential output growth to about 4 percent over this year and  next  Though higher than your implied potential growth estimates and those  of outside forecasters, productivity surprises have generally been to the up  side of late  These and other uncertainties are reflected in the idea of price  stability ranges rather than point estimates  Nevertheless, if you select the  adjusted ranges given in alternative II, the Humphrey-Hawkins report and  testimony could clarify that the revision reflects the faster expansion of  potential GDP observed in recent years rather than a projection of potential  growth going forward  It could also be stated that if additional information  suggests a different pace for potential GDP, the Committee could alter its  benchmark ranges again  In addition, the report could affirm that the  adjustment to the ranges does not reflect any change in your long-run goal  of stable prices and does not signify that any greater weight would be placed  on the monetary aggregates in the formulation of policy      Perhaps I can respond to that  I think you are absolutely right in   the case of a temporary supply shock  We would not expect the concept of some long-run steady   state condition to be altered if there were a transitory supply shock or temporary increases in   productivity  If, in fact, you believe that the productivity growth surge we have experienced over   the last four years or so is transitory and is going to go away soon, that would not be a reason to   alter long-run price stability  However, if you believe that there is a permanent component to   those increases in productivity, which I think most people do, then presumably you would be   altering your expected steady state of growth of nominal GDP  And if you believe that you need          84  to have comparable growth rates of, say, M2 to your expected steady state growth of nominal   GDP to accommodate that kind of steady state expansion, then presumably you would want to be   adjusting up the long-run range for that aggregate    As the Chairman mentioned, given the midpoint of the existing   range of 3 percent, if we take your estimate of potential output plus a measurement bias--  implying nominal GDP of 4 percent as consistent with price stability--that means you are aiming   for deflation of 1 percent per year    I’m not sure if this answers your question, but what we are   suggesting is that the 3-1/2 percent potential growth that has been observed--      --that plus a ½ percent measurement bias  In other words, the   measured GDP deflator would be ½ percent, but the true inflation would be zero    We have never interpreted the debt range as being a long-run   price stability range  We could move to that interpretation on debt as well, if you thought that   was desirable, and make the interpretation for all three of the ranges consistent and make all of   them long-run price stability ranges  If you wanted to do that, you could have the debt range   match that of M2, because for long periods of time debt has grown at rates comparable to   nominal GDP growth  Or if you take the decline in debt velocity of the 1980s very seriously and   think that experience could be repeated in the future, you might leave the debt range right where   it is at 3 to 7 percent and interpret it as a price stability range  But that is not how we have   spoken of it in Humphrey-Hawkins reports in the past    Currently it’s 3 percent    Not very much actually, in part because the staff’s current   estimate of potential output growth in the mid-1990s--through the second quarter of 1995--is still   2-1/4 percent  The current estimate for the last four years, by contrast, is 3-1/2 percent; and then   we have 4 percent going forward  There has been a ratcheting up of potential output growth   estimates with structural productivity, so that after the second quarter of 1995 we moved from      2-1/4 to about 3-1/4 percent  At the beginning of 1998 we have potential output at 3-3/4 percent   and then beginning this year we’ve predicted that it is 4 percent    Our estimate is still that up to the second quarter of 1995   potential output growth was 2-1/4 percent  Starting this year we have it up 1-3/4 percentage   points higher to 4 percent       Back in the mid-1990s we think that perhaps the bias was closer   to a percentage point, whereas now it’s only about ½ percentage point          94   In terms of the communications issue, President Minehan, we did   inform the public last July that a change in the ranges might be coming up because of   adjustments in our assessment of productivity
