  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Eighth District economic conditions have   softened, but with considerable variability across industries and local areas  The outlook for District   agriculture is very strong in the context of high commodity prices  This prospect is reflected in   prices of agricultural land, which in areas within the District have risen at a rate of 20 to 25 percent   over the past year in active markets  Production of agricultural equipment for the 2008 crop season   is fully booked, and prices of used equipment are at or very close to prices of new equipment    There was major activity in the District energy industry, with significant construction projects of   coal-fired generation facilities and rapidly developing exploration and production in the Fayetteville   Shale play in Arkansas  Total natural gas production from this source roughly quadrupled during   2007  In a recently published study, it is estimated that the direct impact on Arkansas output from   exploration and production will average about $25 billion per year for the next five years  For   perspective, this is about 28 percent of the 2006 Arkansas gross state product  Overall activity in   the Evansville, Indiana, metropolitan area is particularly strong  The unemployment rate there has   declined year over year from 46 to 42 percent, and nonfarm employment has grown 14 percent   from January ’07 to January ’08  A major investment in the auto parts industry is in the works for   this area   Activity in housing markets in the District is soft, with building permits in the four largest   metro areas down on average 168 percent during 2007  Nevertheless, house prices in the District   have held up much better than the national experience  In 21 District metropolitan areas, house   prices increased an average of 25 percent in 2007, with decreases in house prices reported in only 3   metro areas  However, in contrast to other parts of the nation, these areas did not experience major   house-price inflation before 2007  From 2000Q4 through 2006Q4, the average annual price   March 18, 2008 44 of 127    inflation in these areas was only 53 percent  Foreclosures have increased in 2007 in three of the   four largest District metro areas but at much lower rates than nationally, and 2007 foreclosure rates   are at or below national averages in three of these four areas   I solicited information on the national economy from a number of sources  Contacts in the   air and ground cargo industry report significant cost pressures from higher energy prices  These   affect everything from fuel costs to the cost of snow removal  Respondents indicate that these cost   increases are significantly but not completely passed through to their prices  International cargo   traffic is reported to show strong growth, but with some customers substituting sea for air shipment   and choosing less rapid delivery service to reduce cost  Year-over-year traffic out of Asia to both   Europe and North America has grown at double-digit rates  One contact indicated that volume   appears to have bottomed out in the first half of 2007 and has slowly but steadily improved since    In contrast, a contact in the over-the-road trucking industry reported that there was not much change   in the past two months  In his view, the industry has been in recession since December 2006  He   sees improvement for his firm going forward not because of increased demand but because of small   competitors exiting the industry through bankruptcy  Excluding fuel surcharges, freight prices are   flat to down   A contact at a major credit card bank reported that their credit card activity indicates that   retail sales, excluding autos, were flat in February and are likely to be flat to down in March  These   February data were confirmed by the advance retail sales report last week  He also reported that a   smaller percentage of customers are making full payment on their credit cards and that a larger   percentage are making only the minimum required payment  He sees delinquencies spreading to   credit cards  A contact at a major software producer indicates that revenue growth was robust prior   to the first quarter of 2008 and, while remaining strong, has slackened since the beginning of the   March 18, 2008 45 of 127    year  He reports strong retail sales, but that was possibly influenced by reductions in prices  He   sees business IT spending in the United States remaining strong and no deterioration in the   collection of receivables  Nevertheless, he is less optimistic about the industry outlook now than in   January  Finally, a contact in the quick service restaurant industry, or fast food, sees business as   stable at the moment, not getting worse but not getting better  He notes that while historically this   industry is affected least when the economy slows down, this particular time he sees gasoline prices   as a significant factor, with many consumers making fewer trips to purchase low-ticket items  He   also views financial markets as closed to all but the largest and most highly rated nonfinancial   corporations  In his words, there is no market for deals   The national economy certainly appears headed for a weaker first half of 2008 than seemed   likely at the January meeting  A model estimated by our staff economists for forecasting recessions   suggests a probability in the neighborhood of 60 percent that the NBER dating committee will label   the current experience an official recession  Unlike some, I am not an optimist on the effect of the   fiscal stimulus program on consumer demand  Economic theory and past experience with such one-  off stimulus programs do not provide a basis for assuming a strong response  In the current   situation, with many consumers heavily leveraged, it is likely that the stimulus to consumption will   be less than historical averages   Notwithstanding the February CPI report, the inflation situation is deteriorating and appears   likely to continue deteriorating  Beyond the immediate issue of containing systemic risk, the most   important issue is the subsequent economic recovery  We have eased aggressively already  We   must not lose focus on the lagged effect of current policy actions on that recovery  We must   preserve the credibility of our commitment to low and stable inflation  The greatest danger is a   relapse into a period of higher inflation, which then promotes a policy response that could generate   March 18, 2008 46 of 127    a future recession and start a vicious cycle of increasing inflation and increasing unemployment    Thank you, Mr Chairman     Mr Chairman, excluding for the moment the market’s expectations   of a significant downward policy move at this meeting, I have a strong preference for   alternative D, like President Hoenig  I see widespread evidence that the upside risk to inflation   March 18, 2008 98 of 127    has increased appreciably, as evidenced by rapid money growth, a depreciating dollar, rising   prices of energy and commodities traded on the world markets, and higher inflation   compensation in bond markets  However, as we all know, the market does expect a significant   reduction in the funds rate from this meeting, partly because of the state of the economy, partly   because of the turbulence in the financial markets, and partly because of past statements and   communications from Committee members  Consequently, under these conditions, I believe that   a failure to accommodate much of this expectation would produce additional, major market   turmoil  Hence, I was prepared to accept a 50 basis point reduction coming into the meeting and,   with some trepidation, can accept a 75 basis point reduction  In my view, however, it would be   desirable for the Committee’s communications going forward to emphasize that we have not lost   our zeal to fight inflation and that further rate cuts cannot solve solvency problems without   unacceptable future inflation  Thank you, Mr Chairman
