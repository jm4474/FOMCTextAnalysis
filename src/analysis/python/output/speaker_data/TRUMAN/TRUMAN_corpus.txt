 I don't have anything to add to Mr Cross' comments   In nominal terms, you have a slight weakness We are expecting, after all, that in the translation that you go through, we will end up later this month with a trade balance for the second quarter which is essentially the same, in nominal terms, as we had in the first quarter But you would still have some small improvement in the second quarter in real terms on top of improvements in both the first quarter and the fourth quarter [of last year] Basically, the effect of the sustained period of exchange rate depreciation that we have had, despite the slower growth abroad which you quite correctly point to, is now giving an added boost; in fact, it's striking something off   That is correct   In the third quarter, we think we're going to have this special effect with the oil--   Beyond that, we expect essentially the same forecast as this time--most of it accounted for by the exchange rate depreciation, taking account of the weak growth abroad   Governor Seger, we have not raised our oil price assumption for next year; in fact, it's the same one we had in February So, in some sense, you have to have some drawback in order for our forecast to be correct Obviously, there are some risks we were talking about the risk that the OPEC agreement that they made late last year would fall apart and that--   Well, that's one of the reasons why you're damned if you do, and damned if you don't; it's one of the reasons why    8/18/87  we had essentially stuck with an assumption that was close to what they were targeting six or eight months ago What will come out over this forecast period, not certainly that there was cheating among-- The real issue has to do with the behavior of the key producers in the Gulf region--[whether] Saudi Arabia, just as it is now producing more oil, will cut back sufficiently to sustain the price at something like $18 a barrel One of the factors which is [unintelligible] production over this period more than is necessary to take off being driven by the stockpiling   In the short run, I think it's going to be the other way   I don't think that should govern [unintelligible] If you look at outside forecasts that go into detail on real exports you will [not] find that much difference between [unintelligible] and exports over the forecast horizon from ours Generally, they do show very substantial declines over the period DRI, for example, has something very close, almost shockingly close, to what we have    9/22/87 -6-   Well, the truth of the matter is, President Boehne, that there are some examples where this has been successful A lot of them come from the early 1980s and, of course, during that period where you had essentially [slow growth of] GNP without going through a recession--that is essentially the question you are asking-- in a relatively short period of time There are several examples in    9/22/87  the early 1980s and, of course, those were [unintelligible] The other side of the equation, which you mentioned, is faster growth in the rest of the world, which was then the United States And there are some other examples We did look at this record about 18 months ago and that is basically what it showed   Germany and Japan [unintelligible] We tend to forget that they had deficits in the late 1970s and at the beginning of the 1980s They moved from small deficits to very large surpluses One feature of the forecast is that, while we don't have a recession in a GNP sense built in, we do have relatively slow growth in domestic demand In fact, we have a quite dramatic slowing of domestic demand built into this forecast In some sense, as Peter was saying earlier in answer to your question, that's part of the process--the process that makes room for this external adjustment in an environment in which growth of production as a whole is kept relatively high but domestic demand growth is low   It depends a bit, I think, on what else is going on at the same time Much of the impetus to net exports from the dollar, at least as far as this forecast horizon goes, is what is already in train Less than half of the increase next year in net exports is directly traceable to a further projected dollar decline But, presumably, if you didn't have the dollar decline, then you wouldn't have the same kind of pressures on interest rates So you would have less pressures in the interest-sensitive sectors of the economy So you have some compensation in terms of the economy's operation as a whole which, in turn, would tend to feed back again on the net exports, so you would have less improvement in net exports too But, there is a certain sense of [unintelligible] that is basically the way we think about this   Under that scenario, maybe instead of a $50 billion change in net exports you would have something like $20-$25 billion So you would have less than 1 percent of GNP in this forecast, and that's well within the error Mike put it that way in the overall forecast   If I remember, it was just about 100; maybe I'm off by a few points The non-oil price deflator was running about 1003 in the second quarter   Well, you would get some impact, I guess, from that   I don't know about extraordinary; maybe some of the comments earlier suggested that One problem is that, to the extent you get this going on, you're producing things which, of course, you're shipping abroad; and you don't see it showing up in consumption and things like that And that is part of the adjustment that President Boehne was talking about You are not going through a recession actually, but you are going through a much slower growth in [economic] welfare, as measured in current consumption   Their long-term rates essentially rose during that period   Their long-term real interest rates rose during that period   The question is whether institutions themselves would be supporting the dollar in this period, since it also affects the institutions--not just the ones that are accepting the 15% rule but the ones that are on a mark-to-market basis [unintelligible] particular interest    3/29/88   It may affect the general institutions a lot more across the board   This is an impressive movement with a [unintelligible] for the large banks  SPEAKER(?) Right   In fact, they have been progressively tightening over the last several months and this [unintelligible] they've obviously done their [unintelligible] this is one more out of about 3 or 4 now this seems to have been [unintelligible]   Yes, the research has been done--much of it here--and some of it was in the report on intervention that was done multilaterally The actual report on intervention was done by [the G- 7 central banks and finance ministers] and suggested that sterilized intervention may be effective in the short run but was not likely to have lasting effects We do end up somewhat tied into a semantic problem, in that it's a little hard to say there was $100 billion or $150 billion of intervention last year and it had no effect whatsoever I think that the thrust of the research might say that it had some effect, but it's on the whole--small [unintelligible]   [Statement--see Appendix]   In the forecast, where we have a decline in the dollar at an annual rate of a little less than 10 percent occurring smoothly over the forecast period, that's not a big factor, vis-a-vis an absolutely stable dollar, because half of it comes after the first part of 1989 Remember now, inflation is a little higher than it was earlier With a situation in which you have something like a 10 percent decline in the first quarter of 1988, the rule of thumb-- taking into account feedback effects, such as a damping in demand abroad and increased demand here--would say that that would add 2 to 3 percent to the level of goods output in the fourth quarter of next year Goods output is now running $16 trillion in 1982 dollars It's a nontrivial amount, but most of it is in 1989 But that's the aggregate amount; it's certainly true that you could well get severe pressures in particular industries   Roughly, yes   It would be investment   Yes Right   Mr Chairman, in the Jurgensen report, it's fair to say that group did not really examine closely, in a statistical sense, the effectiveness of intervention in the framework that President Corrigan is putting forward In fact, it concluded that in the very short run there was some case for the effectiveness of intervention, and that I think is close to what President Corrigan has said is a testable proposition That's about all you can say Translating that in terms of the early 1980s, and the notion that some central banks then had--and even now have--a practice of being in the market in order to constantly provide a sense of two-way risk [unintelligible] The Bank of Canada, for example, follows a strategy of that type And from time-to-time the Bank of England has done it, although not recently And that was recognized as one motivation for intervention that was different from a motivation designed to alter the medium-term course of exchange rates And I think President    8/16/88  Corrigan is now commenting on the merits--saying that in some situations, there might be a case for intervention, even recognizing that in terms of altering the medium-term course of exchange rates, a sterilized intervention is likely to be singularly ineffective   I will cover that in the next--   Well yes, I think to some extent it was because, as I mentioned, we were encouraged by what we had seen in the first half of this year So, given that, along with other anecdotes and so forth and so on, we have carried a bit more of that through to the second half of the year And, in effect, that attenuates some of the effect of the dollar alone on the forecast So we scaled it back a little bit on the basis of an assessment of what the appreciation to date has achieved for us, or how much it's going to achieve for us   That's right   It could also be a little more I must say you try to put it down and--   Essentially, they are very close, [even] with the revision Although the June number is "bad", the May revision was quite large and in fact if anything, the two together were a little better than we expected in our forecast They were a little worse than what was implicit in the GNP numbers But it translates to something like maybe a 10th or two at an annual rate on the second- quarter real GNP So that's not going to change anything And both components pretty much matched up with what we suspected   Yes The number would be exact I think that number, if I may put it that way, had less impact on us than normal I wouldn't--   For the monetary policy side, we have interest rates abroad rising at about half the amount that they do here over the forecast period   Yes, that's right So, that may be between 1/2 and 3/4 of a percentage point on short-term rates abroad over the forecast period On the fiscal policy side, we don't have anything built in of a particularly stimulative nature in any of those countries As you know, there's a slight expectation that fiscal policy in Germany will be coming in tighter in this forecast horizon   There's only two things to say about the model over the forecast period One is that in talking about trade these days, we have found that you have to sort out the effects of business machinery on both the import and export sides On the export side in the model, we may be slightly more--well, actually, not even that much more--optimistic than the models we use Taking the second quarter as a base, we have improvement of $40 billion in the volume of non- agricultural, non-business machine exports; and the model that we use has just improvement of $36 billion So, the order of magnitude is quite small on that side and I think it's roughly the same on the non- petroleum volume It's about the same in terms of the changes that we produce The other thing that's going on is that, starting from the second quarter of 1989, you get improvement on the volume side in the agricultural exports--which gives you a boost in this period when we total these figures That's a special factor   We don't have a lot of optimism In part, the optimism that we have is built into the level that has been associated with the first half of this year We have to acknowledge that perhaps the first half has performed better than the models would produce for the year And we had chosen not to take [unintelligible] In that sense you have maybe more of a catch up with the [unintelligible] the first half of the year To say one more thing On the import side, we have increasingly tried to relate business machinery, which is quantitatively very important in GNP terms, to the forecast for business fixed investment in general So that's driven in large part by that forecast and our assessment of a large portion of that [unintelligible] is sort of how the world markets for computers seem to be developing [unintelligible]   Well, we didn't The official forecasts have been revised up; they lagged way behind the data We have not changed our forecast In fact, this morning the Japanese GNP number came out for the second quarter, which shows a decline of 39 percent at an annual rate; That is largely statistical We had built in a decline of 2 percent at an annual rate So that's a [unintelligible] Our sense is that, if anything--although we have about the same outlook over the six quarters of the forecast--it is at a materially subdued rate relative to what we've seen And that's largely because we have a tighter monetary policy picture for most of these countries, and most of the countries are moving in the direction of fiscal restraint Germany, the UK, and Japan are basically moving in the direction of    9/20/88  fiscal restraint over the forecast period And then you have that tightening monetary policy move   That's largely a function of the capital gains effects You had net capital gains in the current accounts--I don't remember these numbers, but on the order of plus $15 billion--last year because as the dollar declined you had a favorable valuation effect on foreign investments And this year, with the dollar appreciation, we are estimating a loss of $4 billion The swing is essentially $20 billion in capital gains for this year versus last year And that swing is what generates the investment income Next year, with a much milder decline of the dollar--although we have a smaller positive factor--the swing is not nearly so important There are some other special factors this year, including the fact there has been a tax ruling on foreign investments in the United States that requires them to report them as income deferred tax liabilities That will generate a reported increase in income this year, and that's already in the third quarter And that shows up as an outflow last year and will reverse [unintelligible] a bit next year when you get a positive net effect And that's the main--   You said there were two questions   The decline in the dollar is fairly gradual over the course of 1989 There's very little effect--essentially zero--in terms of the forecast of the real economy coming from that factor It will begin to have an effect as you go off into 1990 Even the forecast of the dollar that we have using conventional models You can have essentially an improvement in the trade balance falling out as you go into early 1990 if you just stop the exchange rate where it would be in the fourth quarter of 1989 If you stopped it where it is today, we would fall out earlier That's something in the trade balance of around $100 billion, depending on what happens to growth differentials--if things turn around and begin to deteriorate, or if our growth is approximately the same as that of the rest of the    9/20/88  industrial world But the forecast itself is not heavily dependent in this time horizon on the course of the dollar   Maybe I ought to do that The forecast for the dollar is largely driven by the view that ultimately you have to have substantially smaller trade and current account deficits than we have now The exchange rate adjustment will be part of what brings that about We don't have any strong view about when we're going to get it, but it would be over the next five years, say So in building the forecast we have tended to put in a moderate decline in the dollar as a background factor, which does not have a big role in the short run but it is the direction of where we think the pressure is going to be, as I said in my answer to the question from Governor Seger In producing the forecast we tried to, in some sense, trim that longer- term view by what our assumptions about monetary policy here and others [unintelligible] Over the past several meetings of the Committee we have tended to adjust up our forecast of the dollar; we have less of a decline in the dollar cumulatively over the period for basically two reasons One is that the trade performance has been better than we--and I think a lot of people--expected Therefore, in some sense, the amount of adjustment you need in this process is less So you don't have to build much into the medium-term framework We have moved the dollar up because the presumed stance of monetary policy has been somewhat tighter But over this immediate horizon, we have the dollar flat, essentially, over the balance of this year That is associated with a view that there's a perception of policy as being tighter But as we move into 1989, there inevitably will be some slowing in the pace of current account adjustments from what we've had over the past three or four quarters, and we would expect to get some reemerging pressures on the dollar despite the increase in the interest rates that we have had We have tried in a very crude way to talk about what it would take to stabilize the dollar, and it is a difficult question to answer convincingly--as I explained in the first part of my answer--if you view the dollar's course as being driven by medium-term factors But the answer comes out somewhat like the answer to Governor Angell's question That you need more than monetary restraint in the short run [unintelligible] the dollar   I think the international understandings-- whether the authorities will consider intervention--in fact are part of the framework for international economic cooperation that is designed to deal with common international problems And there is a considerable [range of] views about how large those problems are and what the price [unintelligible] to be and how effective some various [approaches] are in doing so But as the major industrial countries [unintelligible] of the growth-driven process try to deal with large imbalances [unintelligible] this process of intervention that we've been involved in will be as noticed as [unintelligible] to the exchange rates over the various parts of that But the price to this Committee seems to be the more risky case in saying you don't know better, or if you don't know then you can't concentrate or think about it, is the risk that comes along with the accusations of [benign neglect] about US policy in the past And you're just watchful In fact, you'd probably argue that if we are going to solve our financial problems, we're going to have to do so on our own   You do, but both arguments are indivisible, when put that way in terms of economics It is true that if the economy is weaker, interest rates go down or may go down and lower the attractiveness of the dollar But it also is true that if the economy is weaker, then the economy can absorb more aggregate demand [stemming from a] depreciation So if it were economists who were trading [in the exchange markets], let me put it that way, then [unintelligible] and it may not even be convincing or have anything to do with what we're doing But at the same time, it would tend to be a motivating force in correcting the trade balance   Thank you, Mr Chairman I'll try to be brief Basically, I have three points The first is about developments in the last two weeks or so Over the 11 business days since the announcement of the willingness of the Federal Reserve and the Treasury to develop a short-term bridge loan for Mexico's economic policies, Now, that compares with over the previous two weeks In the first week, in fact, oil prices remained relatively firm, and short-term interest rates were pushed up by 200 basis points to 45-1/2 percent Last week oil prices eased, interest rates were left unchanged, and so indeed  and I guess we would not be surprised if interest rates rose after today's auction  The second point has to do with where we stand on the documentation for this proposed bridge loan It is assumed in our review with the Bank of Mexico and the Mexican government that it will involve, as we now envisage the situation, a new special System swap arrangement for $1-1/4 billion on which various amounts would be drawn successively I would describe successive [drawings] as bridging to various IMF drawings in advance of payments for oil for the strategic petroleum reserve and World Bank loans Those drawings would [not] be made until the sources of repayment were reasonably assured And each would go on to--, be made on a new swap line with the Exchange  -18-    11/1/88  Stabilization Fund of the same size The remaining $1 billion of the arrangement would use the existing Federal Reserve and ESF swap lines and  We expect to have the technical details fully agreed in a couple of weeks at which time we would ask the Committee for its formal concurrence of those arrangements  The last point would be that Normand Bernard sent out to the Committee a paper by Ives Maroni on Mexico's economic situation and prospects I hope it was informative, and I'd be glad to respond to any questions   Well, I'm trying to be optimistic about it It's a guess The General Counsel is nodding 'yes' and he's--   On the first point, there was some activity in advance; and we, the Federal Reserve, have had a swap line with the Bank of Mexico since 1967 In fact, over that 20-year period the Bank of Mexico frequently has turned to us for short-term bridges and swap drawings, whatever you want to call them The reasons for that swap line have something to do with the financial, political, and economic interaction between our two countries   No Well, traditionally the swap network was a Federal Reserve operation It is true that the Treasury has a swap line too, but in every case going back at least as long as I've been here these operations have been joint and/or the Federal Reserve has has been in there alone in some smaller, less dramatic circumstances, We have increased the swap line to show support, to allow them to borrow over an election period, whatever it might be, to provide some degree of financial support On the second point, I think it's particularly difficult to generalize about bridge loans At the broadest level, this operation is not any different from any of the other ones that we've been involved in over the last six years We have identified a means of repayment of our swap; and once that's identified, we are reasonably sure that we are going to get repaid  -19-    -20-  The issue which I think is found in the press was more in the context of loans that Mexico may receive from the World Bank than a full-fledged IMF program That issue really turns on a judgment as to how serious Mexico's current economic problems are, which I would argue in turn depends on one's forecast for oil prices If oil prices go down a lot, Mexico is going to have to take another strong dose of adjustment to another terms-of-trade shock And that necessarily is going to involve a full-fledged IMF program If oil prices stay where they are or go up some from where they are, it's less clear that they will need the kind of international financial support that is associated with IMF programs, and they more appropriately can look to further longer-term, development-oriented financing that comes out of World Bank loans So, it's a question of how you see Mexico and its economic situation with regard to the extent to which the particular financing or bridging is oriented more toward the Fund or more toward the World Bank   I think it probably has been less Capital flight is very difficult to identify even ex post, much less while it's going on As far as we can tell,  some private sector entities in Mexico have various kinds of arrangements by which as of certain dates they can obtain dollars from the Bank of Mexico and they have the option to do so And they have opted in the last couple of weeks, especially last week to make use of those options In a number of cases they have been using them either to go out and retire some of their own debt at a discount, which you may want to call capital flight, or to invest in something, or to buy Mexican public-sector international debt which they are using themselves for their participation in some    11/1/88  of the privatization efforts that have been going on in association with this general effort Those are part of the debt-equity swap--if you want to put it that way--mechanism And as far as we can tell, most of the [official] sales of dollars over this period--the last week--seem to be associated with those kinds of operations rather than a sort of a run on the peso The general financial market conditions have been quite calm That has been confirmed by  and the Treasury attache Nevertheless,   Well, I've seen it   I think the answer is that one can't completely tell, and I'm not sure exactly how that would modify our behavior under that You were speaking of the behavior of the US government in general The behavior under these circumstances--, all I can say is that what I have read and picked up in the last month or so suggests that (a) there was certainly a high level of uncertainty; clearly, that was one of the things, along with declining oil prices, contributing to the problems that they first approached us on But (b) my sense is that the efforts to, or the probability attached to, sort of destabilization has lessened somewhat Basically, I'm basing that on an assessment that the [unintelligible] has said the immediate candidate for president seems to be having difficulty organizing a coalition because essentially his opposition has combined a group on the left and a group on the right against a [unintelligible] center treaty faction And despite his efforts and obvious popular appeal, the efforts can carry through the kinds of demonstrations that were held during the summer [and] immediately after that seemed to have died down somewhat That's not to say that I wouldn't expect some attempt to disrupt or show dissatisfaction at the time of the inauguration on the 1st of December In fact, I would be flabbergasted if that did not happen, but I don't think anybody feels that this is life threatening, if I can put it that way, at this stage   And Denmark   [Statement--see Appendix]   Yes First, let me say this is an area where we feel so nervous we call it an assumption and try to have some rationale behind the assumption The assumption that they'll stay around the current level or maybe rebound after [the OPEC meeting to] $13 a barrel is based upon an assumption that they will be able to restrain production of crude petroleum to slightly under 20 million barrels per day   From the current 21 million plus that they're at now If indeed they fail to do that, and say they were at or above 21 plus, then you could have a drop in oil prices down below $10 a barrel, roughly that order of magnitude  [Coffee break]   Governor Seger, this is one of the [unintelligible] to President Hoskin's comment This is one of the asymmetries in the international financial system today Other countries--   Small countries can buy yen or sell yen But for big countries like the United States and Germany and Japan their actions in this area are guided by different understandings, if you want to put it that way, about when one does it for the reasons that Sam mentioned If Canada buys yen, or even if the UK buys yen, that's not the same thing as our buying yen or the Bank of Japan buying yen Now, the other point--   That's right   The other point is that there are certain understandings about the point at which intervention becomes more favorably regarded But as far as the yen is concerned we're far away from that point   Well, but they weren't down at the 6 percent level They have a wider band   Italy has a much broader band   One of the problems is that even if they want to move the D-mark [vis-a-vis] the Danish kroner that would raise questions about what else they would do within the EMS It seems hard to do since there is this strong desire, especially between the Germans and the French, not to do anything for who knows how long By [their suppressing] all this, it may be like the US attitude toward sterling in the late 1960s   [Statement--see Appendix]   I don't think we have much improvement in the second half   Yes, but some of the changes have to do with special factors in the last quarter of 1988 when there was a deterioration, some of which was caused by a surge in oil imports and  -13-    3/28/89  probably a surge in nonoil imports associated with the buildup in [inventories] So, you take that out and that's where much of the improvement comes on the trade side in the first half of the year   What?   What I mean is that while there is a small improvement in there most of it is a bounceback from the fourth quarter on the trade side   And there is a small adjustment in the--   No, because we think that there still is some effect in the pipeline from the delayed effects of the dollar decline and we have built some of that in there So that's consistent with the models and the equations that we use in terms of those effects And then we add on the special factors like oil and agriculture--to the extent that there's a rebound this year in agricultural exports in real terms, in comparison to the flat performance last year--and that's what gives you some of the improvement   I've always felt there's a lot of uncertainty That may be because I've been closer to it But I think that Mike sends me his gospel truth and he's always right   That is what it is basically As you know and others who have looked at it know, the equations for exchange rates just barely qualify as equations in the statistical relationships--  -14-    3/28/89   Well, as we get over this peak and the economy softens a bit--this is basically what Governor Johnson was commenting on in terms of the Bluechip forecast--we have US rates coming down in 1990 and coming down relative to rates abroad No matter what model you put that through, that gives you essentially a differential effect It could differ with regard to how much you get in the short run on the one side But the changing effect comes from the change in the influence of the interest rate differential on the exchange rate In a sense we pushed aside the fact that you get very little improvement in nominal terms over this period And we are assuming, maybe based in some sense on recent experience, that the market will continue to finance us about--   Well, it clearly works in that direction, though it all depends a bit on what one thinks the current meeting will produce for the balance of 1989 I have not seen any reports that suggest that the Saudis will step up production because of their fiscal situation or that they do not need to step up their production because prices have moved up Posted prices have not moved to the same degree as spot prices, although--   But they have some long-term contracts It depends on how those contracts are written; that's right It works in that direction One of the favorable factors has been the supply disruptions in Qatar; that has tightened the supply side And in some sense there has been a spillover to the price the Saudis are getting We have a small step-up in production in the second half of the year built into this Our guess is that they decided to accept the prices coming down on the assumption that there will be a modest increase--a couple hundred thousand barrels a day--in OPEC production in general in the second half of the year That's not a big deal A small increase, on that order of magnitude, is built into what we have and if you parse that out among all the producers--   President Hoskins, certainly their action in April to raise interest rates, which Sam reported on, was triggered in part by the continued rapid growth [above] their targets And certainly the Bank of Japan, while maybe not excessively concerned about monetary growth per se, would be delighted--if I might put it that way--to raise interest rates What will they do? In both cases, as far as the central bank is concerned, there is a concern about [unintelligible] monetary growth, inflation, and so forth   Well, I don't know about that   The last time we did this was after the Louvre Accord; we raised it by $3-1/2 billion when we had, in fact, less leeway than we have today So if you want to look at it in that perspective it gives you quite a lot of leeway [unintelligible] giving your [Foreign Currency] Subcommittee some opportunity to revisit the issue from time-to-time   Unless we should go into debt   Mr Chairman, we circulated a memo, which I hope was self explanatory, relating to the provision of a certain amount of bridge financing to Mexico in connection with the Mexican agreement in principle with commercial banks on July 23 It's a total amount of $2 billion a billion dollar's worth would be a multilateral facility of which the US share would be $250 million split equally between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury; the second billion dollar facility would essentially draw upon existing swap lines--our $700 million swap line and the Treasury's $300 million line for the full $1 billion--  The other half of it would draw, after the multilateral facility, on disbursements from the Fund and the World Bank As outlined in the memo, there is a small anticipated shortfall--on the order of $86 million--of the full $1-1/2 billion that would be paid out of Mexico's reserves; or, if they somehow couldn't draw any other monies after the 15th of February, we could [if necessary] obtain repayment from proceeds of sales of oil as we have done in the past The proposal here is to approve a special swap arrangement for the $125 million--a one-time only arrangement that would be drawn on once and then on repayment would expire The proposal is also to delegate formal    8/22/89  approval of that to the Chairman, and also to delegate to the Chairman the approval of the drawings once they [are requested] The reason for the lag is that there is a desire to have a certain linkage--I think that was the phrase you used, President Corrigan--between this facility as a whole and the consummation of the term sheet between the Mexicans and the bank advisory committee So, it is conceivable that that never will happen, in which case we wouldn't want to have this on the record, so to speak That's why we have suggested this procedure in the first place; normally, when we activate these things, Norm would send out a telegram asking for the Committee's concurrence We thought it would be just as easy to get your concurrence in advance, assuming none of the terms changed   Yes   Well, [that would occur] when it was activated Our intention would be for the Committee to act to delegate this decision to the Chairman And when he acts and implements the decision, then it would go on the record But if this whole thing fell apart in the meantime, between now and your next Committee meeting, it would not [go on the record]   That's right I've been told by the authorities that that's a reasonable procedure to follow   Legal--that is, the General Counsel   We have done this before We used this same procedure for the same reason in 1982 when we made an arrangement with Mexico; we weren't sure that the conditions would be such as to need this arrangement If you want to do it the other way, you can approve the swap line [increase] and then explain in the policy record that because the conditions never were met we never [implemented it] I don't have a strong [view on a] way of doing it We had done it the other way in the past, and that's why we proposed this arrangement    8/22/89   That is what we intended The other parties are doing essentially the same thing The BIS, while it has gotten agreement of all the central banks, is not going to tell the New York Fed that it is in agreement to its part until everything is ready to go So we're all on the same procedure   It's up to the Committee what they want to do If it's never implemented, one might argue that you would not want to publish it But you do it either way you want   Well, unless everything falls apart; that's the only other contingency   That's right There is another feature here--if they get everything done by the first of September they will then announce a bigger number for their reserves on the first of September I think it's also partly the cosmetics of the number When we looked at  That's how the structure was negotiated in July   Mr Chairman, for staff purposes could we clarify that the contingency was established--that this was an authorization of the special swap but also concurrence [on the delegation to the Chairman] of the activation? We will let you know when it happens Otherwise we tend to send out a notice [requesting Committee action] One of my housekeeping concerns is that this might happen around the Labor Day weekend when people aren't even around So do we take it that all is encompassed in that action? Is that how people interpret it? Or do you want to have another round?   I think the motion was to authorize the special swap arrangement, with its activation subject to the Chairman's satisfaction that the understandings have been met and to concur in the activation of the two arrangements, again subject to the understandings being met That would be the easiest   [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, first the answer is the add factors; we have reestimated our equations in any case You are right that there is a problem because it creates a gap between '85 and '86 and you have a discontinuity here In answer to your question about what we would    8/22/89  do, we either would try to smooth it or [unintelligible] back Normally, they take these things back   For some reason they didn't do it this time because they ran out of resources   Yes   I don't know about inventories It may have been [just] this particular area; what they did essentially was add new information that they collected on these exports and imports of various services that they didn't have [information on] before They may have felt that they couldn't quite figure out how they wanted to feather it into the past So, it's more than a correction of past numbers; it was [brand new] information   Yes, we put them right in We've discussed that here with the Board and to some extent that's good news It is good news in the sense that the base on which we forecast our exports is that much higher and one might even argue that some of these services, which are education and medical services and travel, are ones that have rather high income elasticities Therefore, the overall elasticities might be a little boosted by this   It was moved out   That's right, I guess Yes, to some extent, that's right   Well, presumably, the relatively good trade numbers and the current account revisions certainly have been factors --I would say largely the factors--that underlie the strength of the dollar we have seen so far this year It's certainly positive in that direction One might argue that if you want equilibrium, whatever you thought the current account had to get to, the revisions suggest that you need less exchange rate change ultimately to get there I would accept that But most of the models have this characteristic, and they may be wrong, that at unchanged exchange rates with approximately a slightly lower growth here [than] abroad you're going to have a widening of the current account I think the only issue is how much The models differ and actually ours is modest, I think, by the standards of most of them And we have goosed up, if you want to put it that way, the thing considerably   I'm quite modest about the nature of the underlying projection of the dollar, and that's one of the reasons why in our presentation Mike and I agreed that we should give you some sense of what difference it makes I certainly don't mean to suggest it's a sure thing that this degree of deterioration is going to generate that much decline or that adding $15 billion more to it is going to mean that the end is near I can't give you any assurance We have the feeling that ultimately maybe it's like the budget deficit ultimately a somewhat lower percentage of GNP is going to have to be imported What the time pattern of that will be and how much of it takes the form of pure exchange rate adjustment and other factors as it gets there is up for grabs  -22-    8/22/89   Well, the fact of the matter is that we knew these [revisions] would come In fact, the Federal Reserve [unintelligible] instigated this with Commerce Department five years ago to start looking at some of these things As far as I know there aren't any more in the pipeline So it's found money and it does change the base, as I said earlier; but I don't think there's any real chance that we're going to revise away a $100 billion current account deficit   If you put these numbers together, it's financeable but the problem is the level of our debt You're worried about the base in all these numbers but it comes to something like 40 percent of GNP That's where the steady state is And that is a big number It is as big as any major industrial country has had [except] Australia and Canada And Australia and Canada have the advantage, I think, basically that their capital intensive exploitation of--   If you play it out, the $100 billion current account deficit as a percent of GNP would, assuming a steady state and making all kinds of assumptions about the growth rates and so forth and so on, you get something like 40 percent of GNP   Net external debt as a percent of GNP Now if you're worried about the base--and that's a big number--my feeling is somehow that probably we're not going to get there   That's right    8/22/89   [Unintelligible]   No, I don't think it's very much smaller   Absolutely   They have done it on several other issues   They did it on debt strategy, so it's clear that the same man who did it to us on the debt strategy could; I don't think there's any doubt that he wouldn't do it on this one And the trade issue is the gut issue in Congress   No   There is some I think the Canadians have some differences of view within the central bank   Maybe the General Counsel can speak to this, but isn't the issue here that he has done his job within the guidelines and the Committee is ratifying the transactions?   Virgil [Mattingly] is nodding   Yes, but he does [operate under] certain procedures in the Authorization and Directive and the question is whether he followed the guidelines and procedures   I understand that   The issue is whether the transactions have been carried out consistent with the Authorization and the Directive; it's the same thing as for the domestic operations   Okay, then you're fine "Ratified" is the word that is used in the minutes   I'm not quite sure what it means; maybe we can get the lawyers to write us a memo   2-3/4  -36-    10/3/89   The Desk did operate [in sterling], but--   That was before the last meeting, in early--    11/14/89   Yes I think that's one of the factors, as you said, underlying its remarkable resilience in some sense, despite the fact that we've had this [move in the differentials] So, I think it's fair to say that the last couple of days' movement in the German interest rates has been more a German phenomenon, perhaps associated with a market interpretation of what's going to happen to Bundesbank policy three to six months out in light of all this This is pretty much what's going on with real interest rates in that context-- although there is a bit of a difference between nominal and real interest rates in this process If you think in the short run that there's going to be some inflationary impact from this--and I think most people would--even given the longer-run positive aspects, you could then say that eventually the Bundesbank will lean against this, at least in nominal terms though maybe not in real terms We may just be seeing that; and that's a slightly different phenomenon than what might just be driving their--   Yes, it has to be true   Well, Sam went through it They have gone [up] by 350 basis points since April and the dollar is stronger than it was then So, you've got to say that something has changed in terms of expectations for the future The qualification that Sam put in there [relates to] how people also think they can get out if they need to   Well, the dollar's depreciation relative to oil prices [is a factor] Its impact over the last year on our producer prices--and recently it has gone the other way--has been magnified by the fact that the price of oil has gone up more rapidly than dollar prices have gone up [Unintelligible] came through into the producer prices   Well, the Committee may want to take it--   Presidents [may] argue against it, but it is true that the task force was targeted to finish its work by the end of March [If you wait] a month we'll have more--   There is much work [to be done]; it's partly a result of that, but--   [Statement--see Appendix]   The dollar forecast error offset the interest rate forecast error  SPEAKER(?) Right   That's the first approximation   Of course, it was done without the September numbers and our guess is that the September numbers will move it somewhat in the other direction but not a lot One of the factors is the oil [developments] that I mentioned There is a big bulge in non- oil imports; and remember, this is the opposite--like a barrel of oil is valued in 1982 dollars So it has a big impact on the GNP accounts Cutting through those two factors, I think it is--   Well, on the factor income side I would say we have no information That was not up [in] our forecast And we stubbornly think that they probably overdid it--or underdid it, if you want to put it that way I say that with some trepidation, since they do make up the numbers--   Well--   We don't have a good story Periodically, we try to discuss that with them and we have not gotten a very good story out of it   It could conceivably have something to do with the loan loss reserves that were taken by banks and that kind of thing Conceivably, they may have attributed some of that-- I don't know how they treat that   Or something like that Conceivably, that's one of the factors That has been one of the factors before but they haven't [told us] They push these things around, so that may be one of the areas where they have done that They also have tended sometimes to fudge, but one factor in particular for the third quarter that we tried to take account of is the fact that developing countries may stop [servicing their debt], but there weren't any particular factors of that sort in this period   Yes   As I said, first of all, we had some of this built into our forecast for Germany because there already had been in the early part of the year a marked increase in the flow of migration to West Germany So, some of this is built in on both sides But obviously, in the last couple of weeks (a) things have gotten more so and (b) things have gotten fuzzier in terms of the total overall magnitude But it is clear that there is going to be more demand in the economy in the short run--by that I mean in 1990 and 1991--than we otherwise would have had And that will tend to put short-run upward pressure on prices and so forth and so on Germany is an important market and, of course, it has multiplier effects in Europe But [East] Germany's exports are 4 percent of total German exports So it's not big; it's not West Germany, in any case And as I said, presumably that pressure, given the current state of the German economy, will be met to some extent by Bundesbank policy, at least I think, in terms of the dollar [being] somewhat higher than it otherwise would be Again, there is some question about what happens to real rates assuming that we [unintelligible] for them The other aspect is that it has not been decided yet what they are going to do on the fiscal side I understand that there is at least talk in Germany about having a special tax to finance this sort of thing So, a lot of these expenditures are transfer payments--for transportation, or publicly subsidized construction in the housing area, and so forth It's a little hard to shape the whole macroeconomic situation until one is more certain about the overall dimensions and the overall thrust of macropolicy I think that's one of the reasons why the Bundesbank itself is not going to rule [that] out ahead of time-- because they don't know to what extent there will be fiscal policy offsets to this situation   [Statement--see Appendix]   Just to come back to the collateral issue, since it has been raised twice now It was a self-denying ordinance that the Board imposed on itself, given the circumstances as they existed in the early 1980s And I suspect that the proposition that you--   You'd have to change your policy The question is whether you--   It tends to be associated with one or two people in Congress at least one of whom, Ron Paul, is not there anymore It was also associated with concern and confusion in the outbreak of the debt crisis and the misuse of that power to bail out Brazil, Mexico, or any of your favorite or nonfavorite LDCs It is not currently an issue I'm not saying that it wouldn't be noted--   If the circumstances were such that the Congress felt that the dollar should go up and we were excessively buying foreign exchange--which I think is what you're talking about--it would become an issue That is correct Generally the bias in Congress has been the other way, however   May I come back to one point that Mr Johnson raised? We did look at this question of volatility, which is related to the sterilization; it's the very last three or four pages in the book In fact, much to my surprise, we did not find a correlation between interest rate volatility and the scale of our intervention whether we were in the market in a moderate way or a big way The volatility of interest rates, whether long or short, seems to be the same I was surprised because in some sense it was a biased test I  -52-    3/27/90  would have suspected that [unintelligible] in the market because there were certain other things going on It's not a strong test, but there isn't [a correlation]   There seems to have been less confusion than I would have thought   That's their loss   Just to give my answer to your question, I think one thing that needs to be recognized is--and I don't think the situation in 1989 was any different, quite frankly, from the situation in 1978 in this regard--that there is a desire if you're sitting where the Treasury is to think that you have another instrument, a very strong instrument And in the more recent period that has been complemented by the sense that they have an additional dimension of that instrument that's associated with something called the G-7 process They see that as an instrument of dealing with a trade problem, which could be viewed either in terms of short-run policy or in protectionist terms or a longer-run build up of liabilities [unintelligible] of the United States that will bankrupt our children or grandchildren   In fact, the Chairman recently asked Charles [Dallara] why he was concerned and that was the answer he gave   They see it as a device, I would argue, that gives them another degree of freedom I don't want to get into a debate with President Corrigan about what the technical literature says on this matter, but the Treasury officials certainly are on the side that says that intervention is and has been and can be and should be--certainly should be--effective And if it is over the longer term, then they have a tool to deal with the problem that they see, the perceived problem I don't think it's any more complicated than that We were in exactly the same situation in the 1978-79 period   If it's a problem, it's a smaller problem I think that's all the Chairman is saying   If it's going to be a problem, it's either a $500 billion problem or a trillion dollar problem   That's a different question   I would agree with what I think Sam said here implicitly and what President Corrigan said earlier The Treasury recognizes--all Treasuries, if I may put it that way, have recognized --that they need the stature of the Federal Reserve or the central bank behind them and that it is not in their interest to go to international meetings, whether it's G-7 or G-10 or G-22, at loggerheads with the central bank The Japanese are proving that today   So, therefore, they feel that they're better off keeping peace in the family; it's not any more complicated than that   Was it a crime, to use your word, in the 1960s when we were partners with the Treasury in protecting our gold stock by getting back into this business and creating the swap network? Now, some people will read history and will say that it was a mistake of policy to--   The world was very different   But I don't think that the motivations of the Treasury and ourselves [yesterday] in terms of working together to deal with what was perceived as a common problem or common threat are any different than their motivations to work with us today I don't think they have any ulterior motives It's not in their interest to do so   But I think it's fair to say that the Treasury does not know--and no one else, I think, outside this room essentially knows--that we have gone through this exercise and that the timing was of a nature that these two practically came together We did not think it was in the System's interest to communicate with the Treasury that we have planned all along to have a big pow-wow on all this and, therefore, we're holding up [our participation] So, in that sense it was technical; it seemed appropriate under the circumstances, including the uncomfortableness that has been building over the last six months, to say that we would pull out and re-examine this and would come back and tell them where we [stand] after the meeting At least that's my--   I think that's what the Chairman--   No, they used the profits from gold sales   Yes  -73-    3/27/90   A lot of things that we do have never been tested before   I don't want to play lawyer here but it does strike me that there was one act of Congress that created the Exchange Stabilization Fund and gave it some capital Okay? And [that was] 50 some years ago and since then there have been no appropriations In fact, the appropriations in the meantime have taken some of that capital away and given it to the IMF It was used to pay for our IMF subscription Subsequently, [Congress] did give it capital in the sense that they assigned the holdings of SDRs to the Exchange Stabilization Fund and at the same time, after a big tussle with the Federal Reserve, authorized the Exchange Stabilization Fund to be able to sell us SDR certificates So, they already created one area in which they can expand the balance sheet of the Exchange Stabilization Fund   And the gold certificates   Yes, but that seems to me--   Yes, but the warehousing is public, the Shadow Open Market Committee notwithstanding It was public at the time that they passed the Monetary Control Act Just because the Shadow Open Market Committee can't look up in the policy record and see when the [amounts] have been changed, they have been changed It's part of the policy actions of the Committee In fact, it dates back 28 years It strikes me that the notion that the warehousing is a flimsy legal reed just doesn't [wash] A different question, which I think the Chairman has addressed, is the risk to the United States of these large balances; that is a separate issue It certainly is one that the Treasury Secretary as the chief financial officer of the United States ought to address in that capacity And indeed, the Chairman has said that he plans to raise that even more forcefully than he has in the past   The current system really is not that We were the reserve currency; the dollar is regarded as that in a certain sense, but the current monetary system is not built on the Bretton Woods system where the rest of the world is obligated to defend the dollar That's not true anymore   Well, I can only speak for the last 15 years When you first did this operation in the late '70s, in 1976-77 in connection with sterling balances, in the second and third sterling balances agreement there was a maturity on the arrangement When we came to the point where the Carter bonds had been issued and the issue was how the Treasury was going to hold those proceeds, which initially were being held pending intervention and later were held pending  -77-    3/27/90  repayment since the Carter bonds were 3 or 3-1/2 year notes, the Committee eliminated that restriction So at the moment there is not that kind of restriction Speaking only from what I've heard in this discussion one component of resuming the discussions with the Treasury would be the question of dealing with the warehousing sooner rather than later And presumably if that were the desire of the Committee, warehousing of foreign currencies would be dealt with before other foreign currencies would be dealt with So, if you used foreign exchange--as has been done in the past--to pay our next increase of IMF quotas, it would come out of the warehouse if that were the choice of the Treasury And we would certainly have the grounds on which to insist on it We even have the grounds to insist that they redeem SDR certificates; that's written into the legislation We can't force them but we do have the grounds because there is the legislative history on that point So, it's the same type of issue But at the moment there is no maturity I'm not even sure it makes any sense to have any maturity unless you wanted to approach the Treasury and say "Okay, $45 billion is too much and we want to get rid of $10 billion over the next 10 months" We could no doubt work out a program in which we did that I'm not sure it would make much sense, but we could do that   It was taken away when it didn't make sense in the context of the Carter bonds   So you could argue, if you wanted to raise this general question with Congress in a nonconfrontational way, that that in one sense does give you the basis to raise this question The Chairman of the Board made this promise in 19--whatever it was--  SPEAKER(?) 1982  -78-    3/27/90   --in 1982 in connection with [unintelligible] The circumstances have changed; these are why the circumstances have changed; and this is what we're now going to do That invites the Congress to decide whether they're serious about the collateral issue, which was not a matter of law but rather a matter of procedure, including Governor Angell's warehousing   Well, it's on our balance sheets   Right   It doesn't matter which way it's done the way we do it   The Committee has to take a separate vote to warehouse Argentine australs   Yes   It's up to them; they may ask for less   If I may be allowed to advise you in public, Mr Chairman I would suggest that since the [G-7] meeting is going to be held very shortly, on April 7, if there is anything even remotely substantive, you might want to have a telephone conference at least to report on the G-7 meeting   We'll have Norm call everybody up and say there is nothing [substantive to report]   [Statement--see Appendix]   We're assuming from now on, [after] the first quarter, that the dollar will decline on average about 3 percent   For the rest of the forecast period--taking account of the adjustment through the first quarter, which still is negative And that compares with 5 percent in the last forecast Then you adjust for the higher inflation abroad and that's where I sort of got the 1/2 percent   I think so The major focus of our analysis has been on the German situation   Basically, as far as the rest of Eastern Europe is concerned, we took the general level of exports of those countries with the United States and added on $1 billion or something like that by the end of the forecast period just to get some sense of where one would be going in the future But I agree with you that in the short run we could have some negative impacts It's a little hard to factor all these things in because each country is moving at a different [pace] In Poland, on the one hand, although things seem to have gone downhill in terms of domestic production, they have gotten, as a  -10-    3/27/90  consequence of the changes there, a great amount of increased access to foreign exchange How that nets out in terms of their hard currency current account position and potentially demand from us and other countries is a little harder to estimate And, of course, the oil question, which is in fact a negative impact in the forecast [unintelligible] oil price It's one manifestation of [unintelligible]   I'm not sure what I hope, actually, at this stage! I think there are three points One, which is the basic story, is that we had some improvement--and I'm excluding capital gains and losses--in the current account in the last quarter of last year That was $1 billion at an annual rate and some further improvement is projected there We had the view that although this external adjustment problem is shrinking that the general adjustment problem would tend to weigh on the dollar And we have essentially adjusted in light of the stronger [interest] rates We moved from a  -12-    3/27/90  modest weight to 60 percent of the weight or something like that I don't think there's any magic in this; it certainly is possible that the dollar could be unchanged over this period It wouldn't make much difference in terms of the immediate forecast because most of the effect of the exchange rates, at least in the context of the forecast and how we put these things together, is the adjustment from the middle of last year--that part moving through the pipeline So, one would take maybe 3 off the growth of GNP over this period if the dollar were unchanged from the first-quarter average levels and maybe $3 or $4 billion off the current account level, if you believe the way this black box works on these things The one point I should mention is that to the extent that the dollar's nominal strength were associated with [higher] inflation abroad, then in real terms you would be in about the same place If inflation went to 6 percent in the major industrial countries on average and the dollar was unchanged, or if it [depreciate] by 3 percent relative to where we are now, in terms of the way things worked out that would be about the same The [depreciation] essentially would offset the inflation abroad So, one needs to set that partly aside That's the best I can do We've been wrong before and no doubt we'll be wrong again-- which way I'm not sure   Well, we don't even try to do it over a short period of time One factor that hasn't been focused on very much is that the current account adjustment in Japan has been quite impressive in dollar terms A piece of that is the J-curve But they've had about a $30 billion adjustment over 3 years in that current account position So that's 40 percent, essentially--on the same order of magnitude that we've had, if you want to put it that way Part of it is the J-curve; part of ours last year also was the J-curve effect Some of that is going on but there are some questions about how that's going to play out You could even tell yourself a story that the current account adjustment is going more rapidly in size in Japan overall--   --and that it continues here overall and, therefore, the expected level of the yen/dollar rate in the future is [unintelligible] Now, that certainly is possible There are a number of people who worry about the fact that we could get ourselves in a situation in which the US current account position is in balance, however one wants to define that, and the Japanese current account position is in balance and we would be stuck with this large continuing imbalance in the [bilateral] trade balance And that, I think, bothers some people for a variety of reasons But it is something that can't be ruled out   [Unintelligible] uses lesser or bigger weights In fact we use two weighting systems On the import side we tend to use import weights and on the export side we tend to use multilateral weights We have looked at multilateral weights in the models in terms of whether changes in the weighting system give you much difference and the answer is "no," even though Governor Seger is correct that they are ancient weights that haven't changed that much over time Obviously, the weakness of the yen is affecting the outcome and we tried to take that into account On the other hand, the strength until very recently of the DM and other European currencies, and the Canadian dollar for that matter, is on the other side We have a lot of trade with Canada and they have a huge current account deficit at the moment They do even up Whether we have gotten the balance right in terms of these aggregates is obviously an open question   It is in the forecasting process   17 percent at an annual rate   The average of the fourth quarter of '89, which was 97 plus, to the average of the first quarter which is [93 on our index]   But there clearly is room for a different scenario, a more rapid inflation scenario, and that's why I put that forward as a risk As the staff usually does on these things, we sort of bend part way in that direction in putting together the overall forecast, but not all the way To the extent that we get both more inflation and more economic activity than we've built in, we are going to get more corrections on the current account In addition to the real versus nominal split, we would get more in terms of just the adjustment process and the dollar could well appreciate This is not a very finely-tuned point [estimate of the] deficit There is another point, which your first comment illustrates, that I think should be emphasized Again, it can be viewed in two directions Given the fact that the dollar has been in this channel--a wide channel, but a channel--for three years now, one might argue that the current account performance has been remarkably good Indeed, in the last year or so it has been much better than most models would have predicted   Yes The US current account position is doing much better than [predicted] We were saying a year ago that with the dollar staying where it was the current account was going to  -16-    3/27/90  deteriorate and it has not Now, you were saying that indeed a process is going on here which is outside of the exchange rate, however you want to weigh the process; or you could say that we have the [weights] all wrong and somehow the past will catch up with us It is an area of uncertainty in terms of the whole outlook   But if it's on the inflation side, I don't think it will affect the basic forecast very much   Okay And if it's because of prospects for economic activity, then presumably that will help us And one question is To what extent is this featured appropriately in the 18- month forecast?   Oh, I think you'd get some considerable--   It would depend a bit on the timeframe of all this and what kind of music went along with it, if I may put it that way, and as Don has already said on what the reaction was abroad But if you take what policies are abroad [now], my feeling is that you could get 3 or 4 percent, anyhow, on the dollar in the short run Then, as other things came into play that might be sustained or move the other way It would be affected by what goes on later But I think you could get quite a lot of movement at this juncture, if the funds rate went up that much in the short run   [Statement--see Appendix]   I wouldn't want to overinterpret the information, but the current Canadian experience is that they have had slow growth for an extended period of time, not a recession, and their consumer price inflation has begun to bend down The year-over-year rate has declined by about 1/2 percentage point They have been helped, if you want to put it that way, by a depreciating dollar I'm not sure how accurate that [linkage] is, but it is an example where a basic strategy that is essentially the same--maybe a little more so--seems to be producing some results along those lines   They've been at it for, depending on how you count these things, about a year and a half or so   Yes, a little longer They've had slower growth; they have come down from a higher growth [rate] to [unintelligible] So in some sense there has been more deceleration of growth in the period and their unemployment began to turn up in about the early part of this year   Well, as I said, I don't want to overinterpret this It is generally accepted that they have a much less flexible economy than ours and, therefore, their natural rate of unemployment should be higher Their market mobility and so forth is tighter and they have complicated laws; that is one explanation for why they started out with a somewhat higher inflation rate   Yes As Dave said, we assumed essentially a shortfall of 4-1/4 million barrels a day from Iraq and Kuwait And then we assumed an offset of 2-1/4 million barrels a day Partly just    8/21/90  because we felt it was useful to write down figures so we could in some sense check our assumptions--and I emphasize assumptions--later on against the realities, we assumed 1-1/2 million barrels a day in Saudi Arabia, [300,000] barrels a day in Venezuela and 200,000 barrels each, I think, in UAE and Nigeria just to spread it around   No, 50 basis points   Well, in order to achieve this real GNP target, the model made us, if I can put it that way, reduce the funds rate by 50 basis points in the third quarter That was sustained and then gradually the gap between that and the baseline [unintelligible] I should emphasize [unintelligible] we're dealing in a quarterly model, so we moved Iraq back to [30 million barrels per day] in some sense   Obviously, the neutrality of oil prices is a feature of the model Whether or not it's a feature of history, at least it's captured by the model And there's no particular theoretical reason why that necessarily has to prevail at least to the degree it has; maybe it [unintelligible] As far as the model goes, you're correct that there are not forward-looking expectations in the model, though it's not quite clear to me in this world with which we are dealing what you would ground forward-looking expectations on because you have to have expectations about, among other things, the oil price scenario itself And, as has been discussed, that could go a variety of different ways When we ran the simulations, we did adopt at least, again as a mechanical feature, slightly different monetary policy assumptions abroad And that does produce some depreciation of the dollar and gives us some impetus to consumer price inflation from that source So it does wash through this way; you don't get a very dramatic impact As I tried to lay out our judgment about policy responses, I'm not so sure that other than in Japan we are going to get any particularly pronounced policy responses I think it is true that the market is expecting a more--and I should underline "a more"--vigorous resistance to inflationary impulses from the Bundesbank at this time Our judgment is that the market is wrong or maybe overdoing it And in some sense, that's what we built into the forecast To the extent that we do get more [policy restraint] abroad, then we would have a more vigorous resistance to the inflationary impulses from higher oil prices I think that would manifest itself in the first instance in exchange rates, and that clearly is a risk to the forecast   Well, I think the point you're getting to is that if you drove that process far enough, that would be one interpretation It might even be minor But in the 1970s process it would result in circumstances in which, although in the short run the mechanics of the model would generate lower real interest rates and so forth and so on, in the longer run you would have a higher built-in level of inflation and all the associated dislocations that we believe underlie that So it could get us on a higher plateau of inflation [and a lower] long-run potential of the economy under those circumstances [than we] would assume, even though in the short run it might have stimulative effects as Mike described   So it's relatively optimistic because, as Dave said and as President Boehne's question implied earlier, in some sense the fundamental forecast accepts that the amount of slack that's built in the underlying forecast--given no further shocks from further oil price increases--is enough to begin to bend down inflation But it's postponed and it's at a higher level   Well, there are some nonlinearities involved in this, but in that range the models will tell you that you would get proportionally the same kinds of responses or a little more Instead of losing 1/2 percentage point of growth, we would lose another 1 percentage point plus of growth over the next four quarters--at least abstracting from the dislocation effects, which I would argue and I think you would argue probably would be there So, the models would suggest that a $35 oil price rather than a $25 oil price for a sustained period is going to cut another percentage point or more off of growth And given the level of growth that we have, that would put us near zero or below We all know that when we make up numbers, a smooth forecast will show something like zero but that probably is going to mean several quarters of negatives--on that order of magnitude   Well, that's one of the conditional dimensions of the forecast We're reasonably comfortable, given the particular oil price scenario that is built in here In the baseline scenario we think there would be a spurt in inflation, some reduction in growth, and some reduction in exports in the short run--over the next several quarters But then these economies--at least the continental European economies and Japan--in general would be relatively robust There is still the phenomenon of rebuilding in eastern Europe and East Germany that is driving those economies and it should help sustain exports,  -14-    8/21/90  In Japan in particular, as I mentioned in my presentation, there has been quite a lot of rise in short-term nominal interest rates, so they call it monetary restraint and as always there's a question of calibrating the extent that that is going to bring about adjustments And the big drop in the stock market in Japan [unintelligible] as well So I suppose we could see--it's not outside the realm of possibilities--half the growth that we now expect in Japan That would have some implications for the forecast But I think it's no more uncertain than anything else that we put before you in this export [unintelligible] policy   There are really three factors there The answer is that we can't give you too many assurances, obviously, for  -12-    10/2/90  the reason that you cited We have the same [uncertain] oil situation here There are some short-term effects built in, which cause this low that's going to look like [unintelligible] As a short-term factor, we took account of the fact that we're not going to ship any more grain to Iraq right away but that the grain will go somewhere else as we get into 1991 So, that tends to give you a short-term decline that magnifies the bounceback Then in the fourth quarter to the first quarter, with the negative growth in the United States, imports are held down So that gives you an arithmetic effect as far as net exports are concerned Then, as we get further out into the forecast, the lower dollar that has come about over the last year tends to give a boost to exports as well as to hold down imports The growth assumption that's in here has been marked down somewhat from recent forecasts; it was marked down last time and it was marked down this time consistent with the effects that we have in the US economy And we have quite slow growth built in, as the Chairman mentioned earlier, for Canada and the United Kingdom, for example; we have negative growth in those two countries On the other hand, we have some resumption of growth next year, especially in Canada So, that does give a boost in that direction We also have a somewhat rosier outlook--or let me say a less negative outlook--for Latin America in 1991, which gives us a boost to [exports] Those are the big factors   Which one is which?   Well, I think you would get a reaction with "A," quite pronounced, if you get it all done at once With the two-step process the way Don described, you might get a reaction with the second step, depending on what the circumstances were at that time As Sam said earlier and Don suggested, I think there is something built into the market at this time Sam, you may want to comment again in light of what has been said We probably would get some adjustment In some sense there was an adjustment yesterday, essentially anticipatory The exchange market came back a little today; I think the adjustment may have been overdone   Falling out of bed?   The [current] limit is $10 billion and the [potential] limit actually voted by the Committee is $15 billion   President Forrestal, you probably have seen it, but you've seen it more in the exchange rates than in the interest rates   Although Japan is still running a current account surplus, it is a lot smaller, so there's less financing going to come, net, from that country anyhow So, some of that is going to come out in various pieces But to the extent you have some [unintelligible] factors, you're going to find it both in interest rates--and there may be special reasons why you don't see it in the Treasury bill market--and also in the foreign exchange markets   The Board [unintelligible] required authority There was some in place because your Bank and a couple of others used it as I remember The Board declared that it would not do so    11/13/90   No, it came up because we were using Swiss francs   Yes   It is true that during that period there were problems with the Mexican peso, but in the particular cases in which [foreign currencies] were used we were using Swiss francs The Board said at the time that it would not do so again except under a determination of unusual and exigent circumstances So, there's an S letter out governing the use of collateral and that would have to be changed   The greenback would go to a premium then   [Statement--see Appendix]   Implicitly, I think the assumption is that the war would be short and would have, as Mike said, relatively minor impacts on the production side The other scenario, which I think is also broadly consistent with the oil price assumption but doesn't have quite the same broader psychological impacts, would be just a stalemate And under those circumstances we could have much higher prices That is, with oil prices that are consistent with existing supply and demand relations you would find a gradual erosion in oil prices You can even argue that that's what has happened to some extent over the past several weeks I don't want to push these data too much, but we've had some of both scenarios So, it's fair to say that this is not a "long war forecast," if you want to put it that way   And it is essentially the drop in the dollar that has occurred between the forecasts   Well, the models, such as they are, don't help very much in this area The quantitative history does say 50 basis points on the funds rate is not going to do much more than 1 or 2 percentage points at most on the dollar What the Bluebook was trying to point to is that there are things that are [beyond the] model In some sense we haven't had much change in interest rates since July We had an 11-1/2 percent drop in the dollar So, it really is a question of how much more of that there is in the pipeline As you know from dealing with economists these days, there are two views One would be the market view that Sam put forward that things are very fragile and [the dollar] could move quite far and quite quickly The other view, as Sam also said, is a sense that has been partly articulated that authorities might take action But one could even say--I'm putting words in his mouth that he didn't actually say--that there's a sense that the dollar has moved a long way down and, therefore, has created more of an upside potential   I think what the Bluebook was trying to point out was that there is no significant risk! [Laughter]   With another quarter point you're going to get some [dollar movement], and we saw that over the last several days-- though, as always, these observations over the last 10 days or so are contaminated with things like the Bundesbank moves or other events that happened in the world But I would say that with another quarter point the dollar would move down marginally because it is already mostly discounted   Yes, the action to renew them was endorsed by the Committee at the last meeting   [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, it could be You may have noticed that last year we had a similar aberration in October, so I think there are some misplaced seasonal factors at work in these data Obviously, if we had to go back and do the forecast given the data we have as of this morning, we might have a somewhat smaller swing However, much of this swing is coming from the oil phenomenon and we have pretty good data going through the early part of December on that I might note that the oil number that's on the table there is higher than we had projected both in quantity and value, but that is largely because we found some oil in the New York harbor that hadn't been included in previous months If you strip that out, you have a sharp drop-off in    12/18/90  the quantity of oil, which will be stripped out in the GNP account, and a sharp drop-off in the volume of oil imports, which get valued at 1982 prices So, that's going to have a big statistical impact in the current quarter   Sure   Every category was actually up; there is no one particular thing to point to Automobiles were up substantially and that may be the luxury car phenomenon Other consumer goods also were up substantially, but capital goods were up too   Well, viewing the forecast as a whole, it is not an assumption that is part of the projection process It is endogenous to our outlook for interest rates here, which is where we start from, our outlook for interest rates abroad, and what else is going on in the forecast The MPS model has a slightly different exchange rate equation than most others, none of which does very well these days Basically, since the forecast for interest rates is flat here and flat abroad, the unchanged dollar, at least [to the extent it is] driven by interest rates, is consistent with that To the extent that one wants to add in some view of what is happening in the current account, which some other equations do--that's a feature that has tended to do very poorly in the models recently--the fact is that the current account is continuing to be in the negative It is quite modest, at least taking the judgmental forecast Again, I don't think you can find any particular downward pressure on the dollar from that   [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, we have incorporated into the forecast a dollar at essentially the level that we have today, though there always are uncertainties, as Gretchen has said, about how that will end up playing out in terms of the fundamental competitiveness and perceptions thereof and, therefore, export sales and import purchases So, there is certainly some looseness to the translation between the exchange rate and everything else that goes along with it and the net export picture And, of course, there is some uncertainty on both sides--on the up side as well as on the down side as far as growth abroad is concerned We have a modest expansion abroad; it would certainly be easy to sketch out a scenario that is weaker than that It's also possible to sketch out a scenario that is stronger either in its own right or to some extent stimulated by maybe a somewhat stronger picture here than we or others are currently thinking about But there's some [uncertainty] on both sides, I'd say   [Statement--see Appendix]   One other aspect of this is that on the trade in computers, which is subject to the same kind of influences, it does seem that there has been a structural shift Our trade in the computer area, broadly defined, is such that essentially we now have balanced trade We've gone from a situation in which we had a slight surplus in this [area] to balanced trade That seems to be associated largely with the change in the structure of the market whereby mainframes and so forth are being de-emphasized and peripherals, software, and other computer processing [equipment] are being emphasized more [These categories] are those that tend to come in from abroad and [they are subject to] all kinds of relocation decisions and so forth and so on We have vaguely adjusted to that process as it seems to have unfolded over the course of 1991, and we see no basis for [assuming] it will change Therefore, we have in some sense a stronger import component to computer-related demands than we had built into our forecast before   I think the other distinction, President Jordan, between the period 20 years ago and today is that 20 years ago the operations took place without the concurrence or even the knowledge of the U S monetary authorities In this case we're moving  to the BIS with the Bundesbank's knowledge  So, it's folded into their monetary policy and they have the capacity to offset the temporary effects  The other side of it is that   The balances moved to the BIS   President McTeer, as the Chairman said, two years ago we did have an investigation, if I can put it that way, of this matter Maybe I've been derelict, but I have provided the new governors with a copy of that study and, if the new presidents would like a copy of that document, they can get it if it's not already in their Banks I think it will be useful as background to this matter The simple point is that the System has independent legal authority to operate and we have set procedures that have been in place and reviewed periodically over the last thirty years We have the ability to make our own choices about whether we operate with the Treasury or not In fact, as Bill has described, this last period very clearly    3/31/92  illustrates the usefulness both of having our independent authority and of using it from time to time because it serves in my opinion to improve the overall character of the policy decision   There is a directive that is approved by this Committee at least once a year   The Committee will remember--those of you who were here--that at the last meeting the Committee voted to reduce the size of the Treasury warehousing facility from $10 billion to $5 billion, a level at which it had been for most of the last 15 years As the Chairman said, in the aftermath of that decision there was an exchange of letters between Treasury Secretary Brady and the Chairman As I noted at the last meeting, this reduction from $10 billion to $5 billion caused a certain amount of anxiety at the Treasury There was concern or nervousness about whether the Exchange Stabilization Fund, which remained pretty [fully invested] on the foreign exchange side relative to the dollar side, would be available to carry out other vital functions Secretary Brady wrote to the Chairman expressing his concerns to this effect The Chairman replied making three basic points One was that he could contemplate a wide variety of circumstances in which he would strongly support an increase [in the size of the warehousing facility] Secondly, he expressed his confidence that the Committee would give full, careful, and expeditious consideration to any reasonable proposal in that regard [Lastly,] he said he could not guarantee in advance what the Committee might do with such a proposal On the second point, just to clear everything up, we mentioned to the Committee last time that it was our hope and expectation that the Treasury would unwind the remaining $2 billion of DM that they had warehoused with the System And they are planning to do that; they are ready to do that effective on Thursday So, the facility will be wound down to zero effective as of that date [Secretary's note Copies of the letters referred to by Mr Truman are appended to this transcript]   [Statement--see Appendix]   I'm not sure what you assume about rates abroad, but on the interest rate side we have essentially the same [amount] of decline in long rates We're assuming that ultimately the Germans will get things under control and bond rates will drift down as well, though maybe not quite with the same timing as US rates, by about 50 basis points over the projection period   And that includes Japan, though the timing might be a little different for German and Japanese rates   Well, it all depends on the model Exchange rate models that use longer real interest rates essentially produce an unchanged dollar using these rates   Yes, an unchanged dollar, given our inflation forecast and given our interest rate forecast We mentioned in the Greenbook that there is one qualification that one might introduce here and that is the issue of what is expected either here or abroad One can tease out of some of this yield curve information and certainly out of T-bill futures a view of US interest rates that is different than Mr Prell's, if I can put it that way And to the extent that Mr Prell's true view becomes clear to the markets, one might argue that that would put downward pressure on the dollar I think the only question is whether there is an analogous error of judgment about interest rates abroad So, there is some downward risk coming from that disconnected light at the end of the tunnel that he referred to   Bill is using dollar equivalent figures and combined Treasury/Federal Reserve figures That's at current exchange rates   In fact, Mr Chairman, it's interesting that in that tortured history, going back to the early 1960s [when] the Treasury agreed to the interpretation of the Federal Reserve Act made at that time, they did not assert that all we did had to meet with the approval or the control of the Treasury We understood at that time the need for cooperation, but that was not an element of the debate in the early 1960s From time to time, there have been some discussions on that point, but it has never been asserted as far as I know that as a legal matter the Treasury had the power to order us what to do with our own portfolio   I agree 100 percent with Mr Corrigan that we don't have the power, at least as a technical matter, to operate on our own We'd be foolish to do so And the [Committee's] directive under which all these operations [are conducted] does require us to operate in close and continuous consultation and cooperation with the Treasury and, as appropriate, with other monetary authorities, for the reasons that President Corrigan just articulated   President Jordan, two points seem to need to be added here One is that in the second phase--the September phase of all this--I at least detected from my own contacts that there was essentially no pressure on us from the other Europeans to operate We did not have the same thing going in August So, they too were not looking for us to get involved in Europe On the last point, I think it's worthwhile sharing with the Committee the current attitude of the Treasury, which was that they were not interested in sharing the operation with Sweden That's why you are about to approve the entire $400 million So, there is a certain reluctance there It is my judgment, certainly, that these are not the right circumstances to put that issue squarely to the Treasury It is probably better to wait until things settle down   In many respects, given the magnitudes that Bill described, which are unprecedented in terms of anything I've heard of  [unintelligible], I think they have been remarkably successful--so remarkably successful in fact that they had already put the markets back in a position in which they were net short of funds at the end of the maintenance period last week, which is one of the ways the Germans were able to stabilize the situation In talking to people at the Bundesbank--though every person one talks to probably would give a different answer on that question--my impression is that at a very technical level they have been able to force some changes in their own operating procedures, but nothing like the price system to [unintelligible] instruments But they have been quite successful in the first round However, there's a big dispute within the Bundesbank that goes back decades about whether one can fully sterilize any of these operations The only way I could understand it is that if you have large capital flows, it is not clear that you could return the liability side of the central bank's balance sheet to its status quo ante But it's not clear with that and the same interest rates that you have changes in the demand for money that will give you different money supply numbers, a change in the multipliers, or whatever you want to call it There's a lot of dispute within the Bundesbank itself about whether one can truly sterilize the [effect on the] money supply That's at a different level, I think   [Statement--see Appendix]   I think most of the surprises are in the computer area If you strip out computers and look at nominal imports, our standard equations are not--   --doing any worse than they were before, if I may put it that way So, when you take out computers, other imports have not gone up The real surprise has been in computers which seems to be [a mystery] First of all, no one has a good model about what drives computer imports at this stage What seems to be going on is that there are a lot of applications with more power, but they are at the low end of the technological scale and that's where we are relatively import intensive At the higher end of the technological scale we are export intensive As a result we have a situation in which the computer trade balance is reversed And even assuming exports and imports now grow at the same rate, we would have a widening of that gap   We cooperate with R&S on this, and our sense from contacts we had after the Greenbook went to print was that the very rapid rate that we already had in the forecast might underestimate what is going on   That certainly is possible, though I will make two comments One is that over the last decade the Commerce Department has dramatically improved its collection of data in this area Moreover, we do see a dramatic upward trend in our exports of services of all kinds Now, the question you're asking basically is whether we're picking up as much of it as we should be The answer may be that the statistical system probably is lagging behind somewhat That's one of the reasons why, as I commented at the end [of my remarks], the services component of exports of goods and services is growing in the forecast even while the goods side of it is shrinking   As I said, I think it is unappreciated that, as opposed to the 1970s, one of the big impacts of the weaker dollar--not where it has been but where it has gone--has been the income effect as growth picked up in the rest of the world   Income differentials are less so that foreign travel, which is generally a luxury good anyhow, is cheaper and easier for people to do So, there are two things together Coming to see the Grand Canyon or Fisherman's Wharf or whatever is a big deal and it's cheaper and easier, and it affects the--   It does affect the GNP, I think   Right   If it's accurately measured, it's in the services area   Right   I take your point; I actually was trying to have it both ways, if I may put it that way It depends on what question you're asking I would separate it into two parts One relates to what has been going on with respect to the yen, where the dollar has been weaker But given the size of the Japanese current account  -12-    10/6/92  surplus, it's difficult to imagine that the dollar isn't going to have to move down against the yen at least in the near term It is difficult to believe anything else is right for that particular problem  On the European side, the normal historical pattern back in the 1980s when we had more frequent realignments in the EMS and ERM was for the dollar basically to be unchanged on average following [the realignments] because the mark was going up and the franc was going down The market in some sense is simply thinking in terms of competitiveness They had the dollar unchanged And the fact that the dollar has come up on average in the face of all this is something that should be noted because, among other reasons, in terms of thinking about the outlook it is a real appreciation and it has a damping effect It comes back to this question of how we live in this new ERM [era] They jumped in the canoe and we have for some period questioned whether they would toss us into the lake So, I think it is not irrelevant that the dollar is down relative to its level at the time of the last FOMC meeting by 3 or 4 pfennigs against the mark but up 3 or 4 pfennigs from the low of 138 So, in that sense we have a bit to go; there is a cushion there, it seems to me, before we really are breaking new territory on the part of the European currencies  I would put the yen on the side But, the important point that you're emphasizing--and I agree with it--is that the markets, as we saw yesterday, seem to be extraordinarily jittery One needs to recognize that fact And whether this is the right time to log another action, which may or may not be fully discounted in the markets, I think is a question   That's a very difficult question   I think that's right In some sense this is the position we were in at the beginning of September when we had the bad employment report Do you disrupt the market more by disappointing it relative to its expectations or do you disrupt it more by giving it  -16-    10/6/92  what it expects, assuming we have [assessed] the expectations right? We can guess, but our guess is not perfect I'd just add one point from a rest-of-the-world perspective It's one thing if we were just running our own situation But one of the problems, which makes this a little different, is the uncertainty that has been generated by the European situation and the fact that that has not played itself out in all its political as well as economic dimensions That does seem to me to add one small note of caution I don't think it is decisive, but to the extent that Federal Reserve easing at this point disappoints Mr Sapin again, he may have to cut off a few more heads [unintelligible] go forward But I think that goes with the territory That would be basically my response, but it is a possibility   They included some of those, but in the public versions some parts of those reports were edited down   Well, the Secretary of the FOMC made us hew to a [strict] standard about what we left in and what we left out But you're right, there was still some lively material   It just so happens that we actually have two documents--a summary and a background document--that we did several years ago With one exception, I think it's mostly current It may not answer all your questions but it will give you quite a lot of background on what other central banks do; I'll distribute that after the meeting is over   I would have given them to you but I didn't want to disrupt the meeting   Well, I don't think one can exclude it Our outlook has been decidedly less optimistic than the IMF's or the OECD's for that matter Certainly in the case of Japan we see essentially no growth--a bit above zero--through the middle of next year For Germany we are a little more optimistic than some of the forecasts we now see coming out of Germany itself, though it may be that we have assumed that the Bundesbank might do a bit more in the meantime But I think [the possibility] is difficult to dismiss; a one standard deviation in the negative direction gives you a quite gloomy outlook in this situation We obviously don't have a lot of positive information suggesting that a turn is coming, and I think you're absolutely right that the feedback effects of a period of European stagnation on top of what they've just gone through in terms of trade relations and so forth could be quite disruptive not directly to economic activity but to the [economic] environment and, therefore, real activity Japan, of course, continues to be a question mark The Nikkei came down below 16,000 though it's back into that range, which makes things a little dicey They seem not to be making much progress   Well, I didn't want to tell too many secrets in this temple!   What happens in the Census data is that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is treated as a foreign country [Laughter] And when a real foreign country takes some of the gold out of New York and ships it abroad, it counts first as imports and then as exports However, the import side is not picked up in the Census data So there you get the export side of it   That's because you haven't been filling out your import documents!   And in the balance of payments accounts it also counts as an import, so it washes out   And sometimes when they sell the gold, it might be sold into the United States, so it should count as an import It doesn't necessarily always show up as an export   Essentially, it's linear If you want to say the cutback in growth is approximately half of what we built into that worst case scenario, the impact on US growth would be roughly half I do think that memo in a way indicates that the worst case scenario is more probable in 1993 than in 1994 just because, with the passage of time, we are going to get more in the way of positive policy responses than one would expect, although it becomes increasingly possible to have two bad years as it is to have one I was surprised at that, too, but the basic reason why we get a bigger impact than one might intuitively have thought stems from two factors One is the dollar appreciation; that is quite substantial and it has a big impact, which one doesn't normally associate with this kind of    12/22/92  scenario on a sustained basis Secondly, with income elasticity, generally when you get above 1 you get a multiplication effect; things begin to add up   Yes, our forecast is somewhat weaker than the recent OECD forecast and the IMF forecast released today that I heard on National Public Radio That is partly because we forecast more often and have a faster turnaround in this process   Yes, though I think on balance for all of them including the staff [unintelligible] the US story--although it fluctuated up and down within a relatively narrow range over the last 12 months--has been their most accurate forecast, whatever consensus one wants to take The one that has been the most [unintelligible] has been Canada Whereas the Canadians, if you go back 12 months, for obvious reasons were looking for a faster pickup in the first half of this year than they actually had, that was one of the factors that weighed on their marking things down [unintelligible]    12/22/92   The other factor--I hesitate to mention it--is the appreciation of the dollar, which is partly a function of what is going on with US real rates and partly what we assume is going on with foreign real rates That's the major factor in the attenuation of growth on the external side, the net exports side, in 1994 The appreciation building over a two-year period begins to have effects It's like a tightening in monetary policy, [resulting in] weaker growth in the short run The stronger dollar affects '94 predominantly   But those could be short-circuited, too I'll give an example in a European context--maybe it's a far-fetched example One could argue that in Germany, given what they've set in motion, if they don't ease short-term interest rates, it essentially would be using policy against the natural lubricating forces in the economy So, if policy is too tight for any extended period of time, ultimately maybe the economy could adjust to sustained high levels of short-term interest rates of 8 percent or 9 percent, but you'd have to tell a very complicated story about how you got to that--   [Statement--see Appendix] That concludes our presentations   We have continued with the same NAFTA assumption we've had in the past, which has been that the legislation will pass We noted in the Greenbook that in light of recent noise, if I may put it that way, that may be somewhat less of a "gimme" putt than we regarded it earlier And we thought a bit about what the implications of that might be, which largely--at least in the short term--revolve around the impact on Mexico, not the secondary impact on the United States We have seen this year that Mexican growth has slowed substantially That appears to us to be a combination of tighter policies in Mexico in the face of what had been a rising current account deficit and some uncertainties associated with NAFTA and the level of capital inflows Therefore, for next year, on the assumption that NAFTA would pass, we had moved up Mexican growth somewhat by about a percentage point In the absence of [NAFTA], we regard that increase in growth as problematic--I think that's the way we put it in the Greenbook Moreover, we think there would be some downward pressure on the peso and, therefore, there would be some drag on exports for the United States as a result of the failure of NAFTA That's about as far as we've gone   [In] 30 years   Thirty years He's asking about the redaction of material that would be confidential--that relating to foreign governments or proprietary information And that would be redacted for 30 years, is that true?   No later than 30 years?   Thirty years   Just briefly the state of play is as follows As you know, last week we put in place, in the sense of being ready to go, a bilateral package between the US monetary authorities and the Bank of Mexico, and because of the favorable behavior of the financial markets it wasn't necessary to use that Meanwhile, we have been working with the Bank for International Settlements and their backing central banks to put in place as a contingency a package in which the [United State's] participation would be the same $6 billion The Federal Reserve's [part would be] $3 billion the existing swap line of $700 million that Peter just referred to and the special swap arrangement of $23 billion Our aim is to put all this in place on a contingency basis by tomorrow--to have it ready to go sometime after 800 pm Eastern standard time if things should turn out poorly, but not to do anything unless things should go poorly and the Mexicans decide to activate the arrangement In that connection I would request that you maintain contact with Norm Bernard, telling him where you are In particular, I think we need to know where you might be between 8 and 12 tomorrow night; or if that's too inconvenient, you might give Norm your proxy Our hope and the Mexicans' hope too, obviously, is that none of this will be necessary and it will all go away by early Thursday morning   Well, your memory is probably better than mine, President Jordan I don't think there was a commitment to review  -64-    11/16/93  whether we needed to do away with the swap network The commitment was that we needed to work on the question of balances, and that work is continuing We have had some problems getting the Treasury to focus on that, but I understand that is a continuing effort But if the Committee would like us to prepare a report on whether the swap network should be continued as it is, we can do that I feel that it is probably one of those things that is easier to retain than to do away with   The other part of it as far as I'm concerned and the reason I reacted the way I did--and I obviously misunderstood or misremembered, President Jordan--is that I don't see this as a matter for the Treasury Department at all It is true that since it's the FOMC that maintains the swap network, the FOMC can do away with it I think it is probably fair to say that if we were to move in that direction, we might want to have some consultation because over time we have used that cooperative [approach] But essentially what we do with those things is not a Treasury decision The balances side is a bit more [of an] ongoing [issue] I would note that both last year, in September, and this summer there were approaches from some of the European central banks about possible use of the swap network It is also fair to say, as this current episode with Mexico illustrates, that if one really wanted to help the Danish National Bank--I can't remember the size of our swap network with them but Peter can tell you because it's right there in his table--it's hard to imagine that it  -65-    11/16/93  would cover more than half a day's worth of the Danish National Bank's intervention Is it $100 million--?   But it also [should be noted] that these mechanisms are there and they are a form of central bank cooperation; they are the basis on which we receive and provide information to other central banks And if the need [arises] they provide a framework where we can easily augment [balances] either for our own use or for their use under appropriate [conditions] But, as I said, if the Committee would like us to take another look at this question, we will be glad to do so   I noticed that President McTeer qualified it, saying once we get beyond other more pressing matters--  SPEAKER(?) Yes, that's a big qualification  -66-    11/16/93   --but I hear the directive   [Statement--see Appendix]   The subject is the permanent enlargement of the Mexican swap line I hope the background material that was circulated to you was reasonably comprehensive and comprehensible and that, therefore, I can be brief As was explained, there are two themes to this discussion One is the Mexicans' desire for a substantial and permanent enlargement of their current swap lines with the Federal Reserve System and the United States Treasury; those lines are $700 million and $300 million respectively The second is the United States Treasury's desire not only to be responsive to the Mexican request but also to set up a consultative mechanism on macro policy issues among the three NAFTA countries, which makes a certain amount of sense  Specifically, what is proposed to be put in place, which is now thought would occur sometime in the second half of April, would be a consultative mechanism among the three NAFTA central banks and finance ministries and an announced increase in the swap lines What is being thought about is for the United States Treasury and the System to increase our combined lines to either $5 billion or $6 billion, though I think there is a preference for $6 billion The new swap lines would be divided half and half between the System and the Treasury Activation of those lines, of course, would require consent as is the case at the moment And normally that consent would have to be linked to our satisfaction with the economic policies and reasonable agreements on repayment Indeed, it's contemplated that all or most of any drawings would be collateralized It is contemplated that there would be a parallel, though somewhat smaller, increase in the Bank of Canada's swap line with the Bank of Mexico, though the size has not been decided The thought is that there would be some staff meetings with the Mexicans and the Canadians over the next month that would refine this proposal and then we would come back to the FOMC for action, probably by telegram No action is needed today, but it was felt that a discussion would be helpful As you know, Mexico has been the principal user of our swap network over the past decade or so The size of the actual swap drawings has often been augmented by special arrangements A change in the swap line at this point would clearly be linked to NAFTA and to the shift in Mexico, as of the first of April, to an autonomous central bank It is not, I should emphasize, linked in any way to the recent pressures on the peso I would be glad to answer any questions    3/22/94   On the question about Canada, I think it's required that the Canadians come in at some point They actually do have a swap line now Whether they will agree on the amount that the Treasury is thinking about, which is C$1 billion to C$2 billion or the size that the Mexicans are thinking of, which I was told is C$3 billion, I think is another matter  As far as the conditions are concerned, all swap lines have at least implicitly a condition in terms of the Committee being satisfied that any drawing would be supported by the economic policies of the drawing country So, in that sense it's the same, and I'll come back to that in a minute As for the collateral, normally we don't have any language to that effect in the actual swap line agreement The reason for that in this case is that the Treasury has had in the past quite elaborate conditions in its own swap line with Mexico and in its other arrangements relating to outstanding swap lines My suggestion, or my inclination anyhow, would be essentially to leave our swap line the way it is, except to say that the amount X would be raised to Y We would rely on provisions of the Treasury's agreement for these conditions I think that's a cleaner way to do these things So, in principle there could be, as there has been in the past, activation of one line without activation of the other But when an activation took place, then one could decide what conditions were warranted We have over the years--both with Mexico and with other countries in the more distant past--always wanted to make sure that if a country was going to draw, we had some assurance that they would be able to repay us from one source or another But the details of the conditions specified in advance have varied depending on the circumstances   I assume so We haven't had a full set of discussions, so I can't say that with certainty   No, Canada's line with Mexico would be increased from its current C$250 million to between C$1 billion to C$2 billion   It hasn't been proposed yet to increase our swap line with Canada    3/22/94   Right   Their argument at the time obviously was that announcing a drop in their reserves would cause problems on the financial markets and that was the reason we went along with their request    3/22/94   I think they have been used for both purposes At times when we have been involved, there have been so-called window- dressing operations There were some in the 1980s During the 1982 period they were driven by a slightly different set of considerations that had to do with domestic currency cover concerns I think it is right to question--and I would put it the other way around--whether central banks I think it's fair to say, however, that all central banks do this these days though they tend to use other mechanisms to window-dress the reserves rather than central bank swap lines You could argue that the use of central bank swap lines, which ultimately becomes public, seems much more forthcoming than what has done to manage their reserves over essentially the past 20 years when they have   Well, there have been occasions on which they have been drawn other than in Mexican presidential election years But it is true that those last three have been election years   That's a fair interpretation The $5 billion number was a number that in fact the Mexicans put forward a year ago when they approached us and they had done a rough back-of-the-envelope calculation of the increase in swap lines since the swap network was first established One can come up with these numbers for various countries in a lot of different ways but it's fair to say that the largest increase in our trade since 1967 has been with Mexico, both globally and bilaterally That's where the $5 billion number came from; the $6 billion number came from the fact that that was the number we contemplated providing last November in the context of NAFTA So that's the source of those two figures Neither is based on fine scientific analysis   Yes   Well, we went the same way in the past The most recent other drawing was in the early '80s by Sweden And we asked ourselves the same questions at that time, about how long the drawing was going to be outstanding, what the conditions were, and how they would contemplate repaying it So in that sense we asked the same questions as in the Mexican case   Well, maybe I have not been clear on this What I was suggesting, just as a matter of convenience, was not that we would rely on the Treasury but that the Treasury could put the conditions in their swap arrangement because they have done that in the past We have not put such conditions in our agreements in the past, whether it's the $6 billion line we have with the Bundesbank or any of the other lines And when it came time for a drawing, then we would draw on those conditions rather than have the lawyers specify all those things in advance and have to rescramble them when the time came for a drawing I was speaking just in terms of convenience from our side   They would have to come and ask to draw on the swap line and we would have to approve it And at that time we would say, "Well, yes, we will approve it as long as we make these collateral arrangements" That's what I would contemplate rather than pre-specifying those conditions But we'll do it either way   I don't know for certain; that's why we are having this discussion, if I may put it that way If the weight of opinion in the Committee was against going ahead with this request, I think we would inform the Mexicans and the Treasury in advance so that they didn't embarrass us and themselves--particularly themselves--by announcing something they couldn't deliver on  I think the consequences would be that the Treasury would go ahead and enlarge its own arrangement, presumably substantially Whether they would go all the way to $6 billion and leave us at $700 million, I don't know But something like that might happen And that would affect to some extent, I think, our relations both with Mexico and with the United States Treasury at this point But it wouldn't be the end of the world   I'm sorry I didn't answer your question I'm not sure what you mean when you say "treat Mexico differently" If you mean by turning down their request, there have been a number of countries over the years whose requests, either to join the swap network or to enlarge existing swap lines have been turned down So nonapproval of their request would not be unprecedented from that standpoint, though in most cases the countries that were turned down were discouraged before they had gone very far into the process But it would obviously have adverse implications at least in the short term for our relations with the Bank of Mexico--and I think it is not irrelevant in that regard that the Bank is now entering into a new status--and also would have some adverse implications for our participation with the Treasury and the Canadian authorities on the macroeconomic policy coordination process I can't speak for the Treasury, but my guess is that they would be less inclined to pursue the arrangements they are now contemplating if we were to back down We do have a long-standing relationship with Mexico and they have called upon us in the past for assistance There have been some debates about whether it has been appropriate, but it's fair to say that the Federal Reserve has taken the lead in many cases in helping    3/22/94  Mexico over the past 20 years So, nonapproval would really have some implications for our relations with that country and that central bank   It's doable but I'm not sure it's worth arguing about, if I may put it that way   Well, let me make two points This Treasury certainly agrees that we do not want to get engaged in using the swap line to peg the exchange rate That's point number one Therefore, in the circumstances, we are dealing essentially with pressures on the exchange rate, which as President McTeer explained, can exist even with a crawling peg or a floating exchange rate We ourselves drew on swap lines in the late 1970s when we were operating with floating exchange rates because we were intervening Presumably the discussions, including the ongoing discussions associated with the consultative mechanism, are designed not to surprise ourselves, so to speak, when these things come up On the question of window-dressing itself, I think it is fair to say that it's a little difficult-- particularly for me speaking as an outsider--to bind all future members of the FOMC But I think it would be perfectly appropriate, based upon this discussion, to convey to the Mexicans in the staff level talks that we are going to have in the next few weeks that there is extreme reluctance to use the swap line for window-dressing purposes And, therefore, since they have to come and ask our permission to begin with, they should know in advance that that's an even harder sell, if I may put it that way, than dealing with more garden variety disorderly markets   Yes, although it depends on the circumstances; but yes in principle In the past that's how things have happened and I would expect no matter who is the Chairman that's how things would be done   We are not always perfect at this, but in the past efforts have been made by the staff, particularly in the case of Mexico because the Mexican swap line has been more actively used than the others, to keep the Committee informed about developments and to try to anticipate possible requests There have been discussions and consultations with the Committee when there have been approaches to us Maybe I shouldn't mention it, but the recently released transcripts included a conference call in October of 1988 about a special swap arrangement which in the end never was implemented, but that was discussed extensively by the Committee at that time And I would presume that that's the way things would happen in the future   Well, I think it would be difficult to say "no" if they came to us, as they have in the past, and asked for a special arrangement, too Obviously, you would confront a slightly different situation if they have a $6 billion--in our case $3 billion--swap line with us; it may be slightly more difficult to say "no" to an actual drawing than it would be to set up some special arrangement But we can say "no" In 1982, for example, we said "no" repeatedly We were dealing with a set of circumstances which were quite different from what one would hope to see today or in the near future But we repeatedly said "no" We did allow them to have a few window-dressing operations, but that was part of a strategy that set out to get them in the position so they would go to the International Monetary Fund and they would change their policies  So I think the Committee and the Chairman of the Committee would have to make those decisions as they came to them In some sense, you'd have to make those decisions anyhow We can't disengage from Mexico; I think that's the point that President McTeer made basically Mexico is there, and we are going to have to deal with its central bank and all its problems regardless, because we are neighbors and have to share largely the same space   In our case it is central bank to central bank and will remain that way In the Treasury's case, currently it is the Treasury using the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as its agent with both their treasury and the central bank of Mexico I assume they will continue that practice, but that's a question the Treasury has to address But as far as we are concerned, the only issue that would come back to the Committee would be whether to enlarge our swap line with the Bank of Mexico from $700 million to X   [Statement--see Appendix]   The trade deficit on goods and services was slightly smaller in January--I made the mistake   President Jordan, just to amplify on what Peter said, since you referred to the finance ministries, the principal consultations initially were between us and the Treasury Department, and between the Chairman and President Tietmeyer on the day before his statement These consultations were followed up by some discussions about whether the Bundesbank felt it was appropriate to join in a coordinated operation It was only on the morning of May 4 that there were any additional consultations with the Japanese along with the other central banks   Well, I guess that's right, but I can tell you that the Bundesbank Directorate did discuss this operation Whether Mr Issing was present at that discussion I do not know But both Mr Tietmeyer's statement--the excerpts from his speech, which were deliberately released early--and the size of the Bundesbank operation were discussed by the Bundesbank Directorate   [Statement--see Appendix]   They're reluctant to do it even in their own market these days You may have noticed that they just stopped issuing short-term paper We didn't know that was going to happen The proposal would take two steps forward, but at the same time take one step back in terms of the overall goal Notwithstanding President Broaddus' comment, the goal is to get off the Bundesbank's balance sheet,  So, to get off their balance sheet, given that they don't offer any other kinds of facilities like the investments in dollars that we offer, we are left with a limited number of options There is one other consideration about how fast we should go and how we should do this and that is that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, of course, also invests the foreign exchange reserves of the Treasury Department Although we are not tied to following exactly what they do, I think it would be on the whole constructive to bring them along at roughly the same time in this process So, we think a wholesale change in what we are doing would be more difficult Peter and I have had extensive discussions with the Treasury about their plans On the whole, I think they are pretty much on board They may be just a little behind us in terms of thinking this all the way through   As a technical matter, we still have an offer outstanding to the Bank of Mexico through the end of Friday of this week, September 30 So that's another reason to keep the Committee updated on the situation   [Statement--See Appendix]   I think that's right if you just rely on the microeconomic indicators There are three factors that I think would produce essentially this result One is that we had what we think is a bulge in consumer goods imports in the second quarter We suspect that has to do with either some combination of China or spread of sanctions against China, and/or movements in the seasonals in terms of the timing of imports as they relate to fall purchases   Part of that has shown up in the level of inventories coming out of the third quarter The second factor is that there also was a bulge in oil imports in the second quarter--this certainly is a big difference in terms of 1987 dollars And again we are getting the effects, in fact we are looking for a decrease, in the third quarter as inventories have gone down a bit The third factor is that there was also a considerable increase in imports of computers, which in real terms had a big impact And consistent with that, we are anticipating in the July data at least a drop-off in computer imports So, some of that has to do with these longer-term factors, but the sharp change relates to our interpretation of these volumes   I think that is the point, President Broaddus Ultimately, we can and have declined to participate There have been occasions--I am referring to a long period of time--when we have declined to participate The suggestion that we are not going to participate can be a significant brake on the enthusiasm of the Treasury--of all the Treasuries that I have had anything to do with over the years--partly because the norm for the last decade or so has been that almost all operations are joint and all are on a 50/50 basis since we have roughly the same amount of reserves If you said, Peter is just their agent, the quality of our advice would probably be unchanged, but the consequences of ignoring it would be substantially reduced compared to current circumstances where ultimately it becomes known via the Manager's reports whether the Federal Reserve was part of the operation   On the communications question?   I think President Jordan is absolutely right In a sense, we are suffering from the fact that various Treasuries have had a sequence of ad hoc or at least temporary policies for our currency I think that relates both to the international value and the domestic value Those two things are bound up and are inherent in the discussion that we had earlier this morning about whether the foreign exchange value of the dollar in part should be an overt target for monetary policy Given the current way things are structured in the US government, it is difficult to predict where a particular Treasury or Administration will be on this matter Administrations do change and it is, unfortunately I think, an area where personalities, or maybe I should say philosophies, matter to a somewhat surprising degree The evidence on the effectiveness of intervention is mixed, but I think the academic profession would say today that the pendulum has swung back somewhat on the question of the effectiveness of sterilized intervention, and not just through the signaling channels connected to monetary policy but also the signaling channels connected to other policies I think it is fair to say that, as on many other issues in economics, experts lie all along the spectrum [Laughter] I think that's right I have felt that over the years the Federal Reserve has on balance been a very positive force in trying to modulate the excesses of various Administrations It has not always been easy and often the Federal Reserve has found itself leaning to one side of the boat because the Administration or particular people in control of the Administration were leaning to the other side of the boat This has involved a certain amount of moving from one side to  -54-    11/15/94  the other, though I think the basic objective has been to make sure that if the instrument is used, it is used sensibly, not overused, and one does not exaggerate its effectiveness or ineffectiveness  To comment if I may on Governor Lindsey's price message, that is certainly in one set of circumstances something we do and have done implicitly in one form or another There is another side to it, if I may go back to the late 1970s The way I saw the heavy intervention in that period, which was promoted by the Administration at the time, was that that was the device which in the end was needed to convince the Administration that what they saw as bitter medicine had to be taken in October 1979; it was necessary It took 18 months to convince the various people in the Administration, as well as maybe some people within the Federal Reserve, that that was necessary It is difficult to come to the question of disorderly markets narrowly defined I don't want to get into this I think you might not want to use monetary policy, so that it would be only a club in the closet under the right circumstances I think the various German and other officials who have been involved with us have used it that way  One further comment I haven't gone back and checked the record precisely, so I apologize if I go back and find that I am mistaken I would not characterize this Administration as being particularly trigger-happy in this regard They have intervened relatively few times Aside from the Administration in the period of the early 1980s, they are probably the least active The one difference of strategy that the current Administration has followed, consistent with what the Chairman has said and probably not accidentally, is that when they wanted to operate, they have wanted to operate in significant volume to get the market's attention Governor Mullins commented at one point that one could view intervention to some extent as a type of circuit breaker in the market If you hit the market hard enough, it forces the market to stop under some circumstances and it gives the market the opportunity to stop and say Do they know something we don't know, which could be monetary policy or a variety of other things? In order to do that, you need the right scale of circuit breaker to get their attention I think this Administration has tended to be much more deliberate in its policy of wanting to operate on a larger scale But in terms of the number of days of operations, they have tended to be toward the lower end of recent experience We are less than two years into the Administration and all this could change, but that's something I wanted to point out   Maybe I'll just add one footnote to the history before I pick up on your comment After 1971, of course, we did not intervene for quite an extended period of time--March 1971 to July 1973 It was Arthur Burns and President Hayes who essentially prevailed upon the Treasury to take that small instrument out of the closet It may have been a big mistake but that was what happened That's just one example of where, for better or for worse, this Committee at that time found itself quite supportive of intervention because it was a question of caring about our currency, at least that's how it was perceived As Governor Blinder said earlier in the monetary policy discussion, we are dealing in an area where we can sometimes prejudge perceptions with great confidence  As the Chairman said, the Treasury has talked about a multinational, multiday operation that would be relatively small in scale at least by historical standards, but where we might operate successively for 3 to 5 days We might imagine the US authorities thinking in terms of a budget, if I may put it that way, of $6 billion of sales, half of which would come from the System and half would come  -56-    11/15/94  from the Treasury under normal procedures If we did that, we would as a technical matter have to come to the Committee for clearance to increase the limit on the change in the System's overall open position during the intermeeting period The limit is now set at $1-1/2 billion The clearance would be for a larger reduction in our overall open position The clearance is needed regardless of the direction we are going We would raise that--up to, say, $3 billion so that we could accommodate this type of operation I guess the only procedural matter would be that if events over the next few weeks lead the Chairman to think that that is the right thing to do, we would come to you to get your clearance This is not, as technical matter, a vote; it is a procedure that is partly designed to meet, though maybe imperfectly, the Committee's desire--a desire reiterated by President Stern earlier--to have some degree of communication about what we are doing, maybe not why we are doing it It may provide opportunities to ask why we are doing it, as has happened in some of our conference calls It is a mechanism that has been set up both to keep this Committee informed and to review these matters After it is all over, you can review whether it was a success or failure or why it was a success or failure Procedurally, it does put everything on the table   This is obviously a matter for the Committee to decide The historical antecedents of the procedural instructions were in fact to provide greater restraint on our interventions than had existed For example, on the domestic side there is a limit on the intermeeting change in the System's overall holdings of U S government and Federal agency securities, but that limit is very substantial and is occasionally raised On the foreign side, the  -57-    11/15/94  procedural instructions are written the way they are because it is also judged that in some circumstances--given the international nature of these discussions since they don't just involve the United States Treasury but often at least two or three other central banks--they should provide the Chairman with some degree of flexibility to act on behalf of the Committee as long as it is consistent with the foreign currency authorization and the foreign currency directive We have subsequent discussions and provide a way for the Committee to be informed--in contrast to the situation that existed before 1976 where there could be very large operations and, unless the Committee members kept score as they went along, they wouldn't know how much had been bought and sold until the next Committee meeting The existing procedural instructions are designed that way, but you can change them On balance, I think they work pretty well, but obviously there has been a range of views on all the issues in that respect I think one of the purposes of having this discussion was in fact, as the Vice Chairman said, in order to give the Chairman some basis to have further discussions of this with the Treasury and other central banks   Let me come back to where you started the discussion with one question that has been kicking around for weeks-- whether we should do something not routinely larger but nonroutinely larger in the interest of varying the tactics I see some heads going this way around the table but, of course, that's one risk I think the other view of this matter has emphasized that one risk we see is if we do it once, it might become a bad habit But depending on how the market reacts to developments over the next several days or weeks, a possibility is that we might have an operation that is a little larger in scale and a little bit more sustained as a way of varying the pattern of behavior but not necessarily something that would become a new pattern I just wanted to make it clear that--   I think I have been around too long to be able to give you a precise definition of what is a disorderly market   Let me try to do what I just said I can't do Disorder to some extent is in the eyes of the beholder Sometimes we have a situation where the dollar is weaker than the fundamentals would justify Sometimes the weakness has to do with market conditions Both situations have been used Although I know there are preferences for being more precise, there also are preferences for being less precise   Certainly, it was successful! [Laughter]   Not to put words in your mouth, we could be capricious or appear to be capricious about why we are operating We ought to have some sense of what we are trying to accomplish and why we were trying to do it even though it is not always very well articulated   Reread your recommendations  -60-    11/15/94   They will come up a year from now   [Statement--See Appendix]   If I could add just two points One is--I'm not sure this is helpful--my impression that the Administration is going through much the same problem If they think that the NAIRU is about what we have estimated it to be, they no longer are in a position to say growth will slow down to potential of 2-1/2 percent because in that case they will have built in a permanently higher inflation and lower unemployment rate I'm not sure how they will square that circle In terms of comparing the Committee's forecast with the Administration's forecast, there may be some leeway on that score My second point comes back to your initial question on the effectiveness of monetary policy and whether it may be reduced In today's world, of course, we tend to assume that one of the channels of monetary policy is through the exchange rate That is why we have model results that suggest the overall effect may be the same as it was 15 or 20 years ago, but the channels have changed with the relaxation of Regulation Q I don't know whether you want to call it an exogenous event, or a favorable event, or an unfavorable event, or something unrelated where there has been a breakdown in monetary policy But, of course, with the dollar having gone down this year rather than going up, which would have been your ex ante assumption, you do have a difference that could either be attributed to a stronger than expected "economy" in some sense or a short circuiting of that channel in this particular instance   He's not here, but maybe I can make it He can clarify the facts later, but let me just state that at about 930, the Mexicans did announce that they had moved their intervention band by 15 percent and will continue to crawl that band by four new centavos a day So, they basically have moved the band by 15 percent We don't have any market quotes--   As Peter mentioned in his earlier report, one problem with their monetary policy is that they have an auction today    12/20/94  of their tesobonos and another auction tomorrow of their peso- denominated debt Financial market reactions will depend on how they choose to play those auction results   The reason, Governor Lindsey, is that we often do report intervention numbers in that document We can't say it's Class II when it has intervention numbers, and it's not classified when it doesn't have intervention numbers because then we would be revealing something That is the point That's why it's always Class II regardless of whether or not it has intervention numbers in it   Mr Chairman, just to make a technical point on the warehousing issue I don't want to comment on the political aspects of it; that is not my role But as a technical matter the Treasury could conduct its warehousing transactions with the market or with another financial institution So the notion that warehousing as a technical matter is an evasion of the fiscal authority of Congress I think is not correct I am not talking about perceptions We have    3/28/95  worked hard and have changed the warehousing arrangement so that it is now very clearly an arms-length, market-related transaction We do it on exactly the same terms that the Treasury could if it divided it all up and did it with 150 institutions in the market All we are doing is to accommodate the Treasury as a convenience to them This does raise questions about our role and our role in assisting Mexico in these kinds of things, which I perfectly well acknowledge But as a technical matter, the transaction could be done with the market Therefore, I don't think it's fair to say that this is an evasion of the fiscal authority of Congress   It wouldn't show up in the budget either way What the Treasury does is to swap their DM or their yen with us They sell it to us spot and buy it back forward They can do that on exactly the same terms with Citibank or Chase or Deutsche Bank or the Bank of Tokyo, whatever institution it might be That would have exactly the same impact on them fiscally   The Mexico situation, for better or for worse, has clearly given the Halifax Summit something to focus on--something more than just chit-chat about stable exchange rates, if I may put it that way Doing something in the bankruptcy or orderly workout area is one of the ideas that is under some discussion It's also fair to say that other ideas under discussion include some that the Chairman has tried to pour cold water on--that of vastly increasing the size of the IMF and its capacity to deal with these kinds of situations I don't think there is a consensus among the various nations involved in the G-7 on what to do at the moment It appears that most options are still on the table, though some people think that a few options have been taken off   Yes, certainly there are big and small issues involved and both types have been raised here in this discussion That's partly because we started with Mexico, which on the one hand is a country-specific type of problem On the other hand, Mexico is regarded as symptomatic, as the Chairman has said, of the nature of the international financial system and its functioning and the potential problems and challenges as we move into the 21st century It's difficult to sort those things out As far as country-specific problems are concerned, it is fair to say that many other central banks of the major industrial countries are in fact more involved in this process than we are The nature of their involvement is different from ours It might be useful to the Committee, as one of the little studies that the Chairman requested, for us to describe what other G-10 central banks do with regard to dealing with these smaller--if I may put it that way--problems Indeed, in most of the cases where efforts have been made to help other countries we have not been involved in terms of our own money, though the U S Treasury is often involved whereas other central banks have been involved An example is the current effort to put together a bridge loan for Argentina You will find the other G-10 central banks backing the BIS in that loan In the case of United States participation, if that goes forward, it will be done exclusively by the Treasury Most of those central banks in turn are supported by their treasuries in one way or another, sometimes formally but not always formally In some cases there are central banks that take a degree of risk in a loan to another country in a far corner of the world; an example is Sweden relative to Argentina The Federal Reserve has chosen not to do that So maybe it would be useful, at least as a background note, to try to put together a study to describe what other countries do That doesn't touch the big issues but it might help deal with the little ones   Well, on the tougher question, I think you are absolutely right about the result that the standard macro models will give you A cut in the fiscal deficit will produce lower interest rates and that in turn will translate through to reducing the external deficit through lower interest rates and a lower currency One way to square that with the notion that the dollar should appreciate if the fiscal deficit is cut, is to distinguish between real and nominal To the extent that there is a fear out there that the central bank will seek at some point to monetize the deficit or float it away through more inflation, then a country could have a stronger nominal currency at the same time that it had a weaker real currency   There is one other argument for which there is some support in the literature It is a longer-term argument that would run from a lower deficit to more investment, a more competitive currency, and therefore an appreciation of the dollar That is a very long-run argument A slightly different argument has a timing feature If the fiscal deficit is cut, that will start to bring down the current account deficit sooner than otherwise and less of a depreciation will be needed in the long run than otherwise That is a sort of "compared with what" argument In terms of the long run, much of this argument does turn on the factors that Peter was talking about--the notion that the fiscal situation has played on the dollar more in terms of whether we, the United States, can manage our affairs appropriately That probably has been exacerbated again in the psychological realm by the Mexican situation Those two situations have played off against each other more than any deep reading of the macroeconomics involved   No I only wish I had thought of it   There is one explanation that I'm not sure is right, but it helps to answer the question of why the dollar was weak relative to many of the European currencies over this period One story that can be told is that there has been some degree of flight from emerging markets, or shifts in demand for emerging market instruments And emerging market instruments are dollar-denominated  Ms MINEHAN Right   The most important of these are the Brady bonds Those bonds have taken a tremendous hit over the first quarter of this year Although US investors hold some of the Brady bonds, they also are held around the world by all kinds of investment funds It's not irrational for those funds, many of which are Japanese--after all there is a lot of savings in Japan--to think that as investors move out of Brady bonds that are dollar denominated instruments, they will move into instruments denominated in the other two or three major currencies, including the Swiss franc So that seems to me to be the one element one can point to that would help explain some degree of rally in terms of our own bond market and some degree of weakness of the dollar vis-a-vis the yen, the deutschemark, and the Swiss franc I am not sure it is quantitatively significant enough, but if you look at what has happened to the prices of the Brady bonds, it has to mean that there has been a big shift in the ex-ante demand for those instruments over this period   We wouldn't have the data unless they are held at the New York Bank   You have to remember that as a statistical matter they can move investments from Eurodollar holdings to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and that will show up as custodian holdings but it doesn't have any currency implications at all   Either that or an exception   I apologize because I thought I had read the minutes earlier, but I had not Out thinking at the time of the last meeting was that the Japanese earthquake would affect our imports but not our exports The truth of the matter at this point is that we think the earthquake will affect neither But that was where we were, so I would prefer to take out the phrase in paragraph 14 that says it will affect our exports That shortens the sentence to the one fact that we know pretty certainly--that the Mexican situation will affect our exports   [Statement--see Appendix]   Maybe this is cutting it too close, but if you look at the two years together in the Greenbook, we have a little more inflation this year because of what we have assumed about the dollar Therefore, the flatness produces a bit of a distortion It suggests that the trend is very gradual, but there may be more trend than the numbers themselves suggest   A slight deterioration   Just one technical point The pickup as far as this year is concerned is quite modest I think the fundamental pickup may be seen by focusing on the fourth quarter-over-fourth quarter number Because there was a big negative number last year, the pickup looks a little better as a percent than we would think, though we are looking for an annual rate of growth in the 2 to 2-1/2 percent range for the balance of this year But, as Mike mentioned, we have tended to mark things down over the last several forecasts I think we would have marked things down even more in the absence of this fiscal package, which came in a bit on the high side of people's expectations I find it extremely difficult to judge Japanese fiscal policy because we don't have a very good baseline, if I may put it that way They have two or three supplemental budgets a year The fundamental budget may be good from the standpoint of fiscal rectitude It may be a great way of running things because they can always drop back to a more restrictive policy in the absence of special supplemental budgets On the other hand, in terms of judging the ongoing thrust of policy in the context of unusually large output gaps and, as Peter mentioned, the threat of deflation, that probably is not the right assumption to make I believe the Japanese situation clearly involves some downside risk on balance It is not an unreasonable forecast, but it probably has an uncertainty band around it that is a bit wider than the forecasts for the other industrial countries   We have essentially ignored the trade relations question in the forecast So, I guess implicitly we are assuming that some time between now and the end of June this particular matter will be settled There are then two questions One would be what happens if Congress does go through with the sanctions The trade and the price implications of that are likely to be pretty secondary; we are talking about $6 billion worth of consumer demand I guess the simplest calculation would imply a shift to that much more nominal spending, but that is only 01 percent of total consumer spending over some period We have to worry about secondary effects, but we also have to worry about other adjustments if we assume a full pass- through So, it is not a big number Also, the overall trade implications are not likely to be very large because most of the presumed shift in demand for luxury cars will go to Germany and other countries So, in terms of the aggregate effect on trade, not much would be different That's the easy part of the story The more difficult part would be to gauge what would happen if we got involved in a so-called trade war That is a phrase we throw around, but I don't think we really know what it means, or I don't know what I mean when I say it Probably the most important aspect of that would be the impact on financial markets on the one hand and some broad perception of where economies were going, which I think is likely to be negative It is hard to imagine that a trade war would not be a negative factor on the whole, but how bad it would be is difficult to judge So, in that context, we have assumed it is not going to happen!    5/23/95   There have been long articles in various German newspapers about the advantages of this kind of operation--newspapers such as the Frankfurter Allegemeine Zeitung and the Suddendeutsche Zeitung The Swiss are understandably somewhat unhappy since they are just sitting there like any other emerging market, if I may put it that way [Laughter]   [Statement--see Appendix]   They announced today, Japanese time, that the head of their New York office had been making false trades for 11 years, which is hard to believe, and had lost roughly $1 billion in the process They will take that loss in their fiscal half-year results The news was released early enough to be in The Washington Post You may not have seen The Washington Post   Peter or someone else may have some more details They called me last night The announcement apparently did not affect their markets The Nikkei, for example, was up 300 points in Tokyo today   Peter has some comments Let me give you mine What I tried to suggest in my briefing is that this is a process that is going to go on for years It's going to be up and down and up and down As different countries and institutions within the countries jockey for position, there will be, I think, a heightening of the debate about the EMU and whether individual countries are ready for it You saw, for example, how Mr Arthuis got beat up on Thursday by Mr Waigel who came out at Majorca and said that maybe we just ought to postpone the EMU for a couple of years Now, that's not necessarily anti-EMU, but it changes the whole timetable The debate is heightened as the time for various kinds of decisions comes closer The effect on the dollar, it seems to me, is largely secondary It partly depends on what you mean by the dollar The dollar tends to weaken relative to the deutschemark the less likely the EMU appears to be and therefore the more likely the deutschemark will be free to rise relative to the dollar Then, the ebb and flow of discussion does tend to affect the dollar The way I think of it is that for people who have liquid assets it is easier to get out of dollars into deutschemarks to cover positions than to get out of Swedish kronors into deutschemarks So, you have a backwash effect on the dollar, at least in the short run   It's certainly a possibility How big it is, I don't know   In some degree, it has occurred in the yen market itself That is one of the phenomena   That would be a little difficult One of the problems is that two things are going on with Japanese banks at this point One is the Japanese year-end premium The other is the general Japanese risk premium I think it's a little difficult, for some of the reasons that Peter just pointed out with respect to the funds futures, to separate which of the two you are dealing with You can make an assumption, such as attributing it all to the year-end pressures, but there is some leakage in this process And you have a phenomenon that whatever the pressures are, they are in both the yen markets and the dollar markets I think that's presumably where most of it is There may be a little in the sterling markets    11/15/95   President Minehan, I think one dimension of this that Peter did not include in his report, because he gave a lot of background and the report was already long enough, is that there is a particular problem, which I am sure you will appreciate, in terms of the payments system   We have staff who have worried about this general problem of foreign-held dollars in the payments system for at least a decade to my knowledge In some sense, because of the size of the Japanese banks and their role in the international financial system, they are a particular problem and this arrangement or procedure is designed to deal with that problem One dimension would have almost a pure payments system set of consequences, but I think we all recognize that it is a general dollar payments problem and that it is not unique to Japanese banks In principle, US banks could have the same problem elsewhere Although this arrangement was set up because of the current situation with respect to the Japanese banks, it is part of a general problem and I don't think we have a standard set of procedures to deal with it   Certainly As the Chairman explained, it got publicity when it was not intended and the latter was somewhat premature in any case   My assumption--it's a very safe assumption, Mr Chairman--is that in the case of the Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan you would be giving a signal by cancelling the swap lines For the reasons you cited, some people would not want to do that and we therefore have a problem with respect to the Norwegians, which is a particularly bad example My perspective on this has been, as I may have said before when we have had these discussions, that the time to rationalize these arrangements is in the context of European monetary union, if they get to the third stage of having a European central bank In that case most of these countries would have an arrangement with the European central bank Since Norway is outside the union, you would have a slightly complicated situation, but a number of these swap lines would be captured in that arrangement Now, if we want to do away with them completely, that is a different proposition I think it is also worthwhile to think about whether we could imagine using swap arrangements in the context of payments system problems In that case, as President Jordan suggested, we obviously would need more than $250 million It would be a very different operation Because these arrangements always have the characteristics of lender- of-last-resort arrangements as well as helping through what could be just glitches in the payments system, they are not easy to orchestrate   Remember, there was a first phase whereby the Committee initially activated the existing $3 billion Then, at the end of December 1994, there was an effort to deal with this problem in what I sometimes call the "old fashioned" way by getting banks together and so on The Committee approved a "temporary" swap line of $15 billion in conjunction with the arrangement that included $5 billion provided by the BIS Then, the Committee went up to the $3 billion temporary line in the context of the President's second program   Right   The original $3 billion was associated with the regular program   The other part of the confusion is that the Treasury also has a $3 billion swap line with the Mexicans   Too many threes around here   One of the conditions for the Committee's approval of the Mexican drawings was that we would be repaid either way--that is, by the Mexicans or by the US Treasury   I think it was just an accounting convenience that we assigned these drawings to their regular swap line We could have done it the other way around; it might have been somewhat more logical   My view is that it has worked, though maybe not as well as it should have In particular, there have been stepped up consultations at all levels among all three countries, some bilateral and some trilateral I think in fact one of the most useful things that was done--the only thing I think we did right--was that Peter arranged to have a weekly conference call with the Canadians and the Mexicans, which allows us to do a once-a-week update of economic and financial conditions in the three countries That regular weekly call has meant that it is therefore much easier to have ad hoc contacts So, that is one element that has come out of this process    12/19/95   The capacity of central banks to manipulate their reserves is quite substantial, but even in 1994 I think we had a pretty good fix on their reserves, though we may not have kept the Committee as well informed as we should have   The one thing that has happened since we circulated Steve Kamin's memo is that they have adopted a new framework for their monetary policy This is not a big deal, but they have adopted more conventional definitions of their domestic assets and international reserves than they used in the past I think this will facilitate market analysis of their operations I don't think it avoids the possibility that the market may still misinterpret developments in Mexico, but I think the warning flag is quite substantial It remains true that the capacity for the Mexicans, or any government, to try to slip things through is still there   Partly because of these calls that Peter has arranged and other contacts, we are much more informed than we were We can't avoid all surprises   I think that's the right implication and inference, if I may put it that way I can't speak for the Committee We did have a visitor last Friday from the research directorate of the Bank of Mexico I went over both the fact that we would not renew the $650 million drawing and that that was a matter for him to take up with the United States Treasury I also told him that the Committee was going to consider this matter today but that, all things considered, there was not a lot of FOMC appetite for new Mexican drawings in 1996 He said that was certainly the basis on which they were operating His view is that of only one reasonably important    12/19/95  Mexican official on the subject, but I think he was very forthcoming on that   That's one of the reasons why I think their preferred position would be for the Treasury to roll over the two drawings They have a $650 million short-term swap outstanding with the Treasury too, and I think the Mexican position would be that they would like to roll the two together into a medium-term obligation to provide themselves a bit of a cushion, given that the door is going to be closed later in 1996   Certainly that's their position; I think that's a logical position as well   I don't know whether that's the sole roadblock, but that's an issue that we wanted to surface The staff felt that it was a little arcane, and I apologize that the memo may not have been clear The truth of the matter is that even absent that issue, given everything else going on, the objective of the program was basically to get Mexico's financial situation stabilized, and that has been achieved Now, whether they will be able to move from that to what they need to do in terms of growth is a different matter We can't do that for them I think the general attitude is that we have done what we can   As was outlined in the memo, the Treasury is subject to the certification process of the Mexican Debt Disclosure Act In addition, the Treasury appropriation for fiscal year 1996 contains a provision that limits the extent to which they can use the ESF for operations without Congressional approval Since they may take over our portion of the Mexican drawings, that could mean they would be using the ESF for more than $1 billion and for longer than 60 days So, they would be constrained in terms of taking us out of further Mexican swap drawings Coming back to President Minehan's question, that is one of the reasons why it's unlikely that the Treasury will want to get into this right away once disbursements under the President's program come to an end Since they could not be our partner, we would be less likely to want to do something on our own than we might have been in the past   There would have to be an assured means of repayment for any drawing under the general arrangements Actually, the Mexican Debt Disclosure Act has a provision requiring an assured means of repayment in our case So, we would have to have some sense of how the System was going to get repaid in any case In the particular circumstances that Mexico was in, we were getting involved    12/19/95  at least indirectly in a medium-term program and the Committee felt that stretching the maturity to 12 months was about as far--maybe further for some members--as it could be stretched in terms of our normal financial operations   Except when the Committee started the meeting at 800 in the morning   People have said that [Laughter] [Statement-- see Appendix]   We are forecasting a decline in oil import prices to $17 per barrel and in WTI spot prices to around $1950 per barrel; that is down a couple of dollars from current levels Our forecast did not assume an Iraqi oil decision at this time, but it did assume that we would get essentially the same amount of oil in 1997, so our forecast had the increased supply occurring 6 months later We actually have the oil price somewhat higher than the futures prices as of last week, so in some sense all that has happened is an adjustment in the timing Other than the short-term factors that Mike was referring to, the one argument that you might point to on the further out picture is that one might be led to conclude that this is "it" rather than an assumption that Iraq will be allowed to export much more in the near term So, the prospect of full Iraqi production coming on stream in the next year or two has gone down That is the only story that I could pick up on that   That's right The probability that it will be 2 million barrels has gone down even as the probability of 700,000 barrels has gone up   It remains an issue under Maastrict, and I think the answer is politics It's not settled yet, but it appears to be headed that way   The question, Governor Lindsey, is whether we are talking about high politics or grass root politics and that is another source of uncertainty The high politics may bring it about The question is whether the grass root politics will follow the high politics   What is involved in the French budget is not actually an asset sale, but a somewhat complicated takeover of pension obligations in return for cash It is a kind of asset sale Economists would call it an asset sale; I'm not sure accountants would   If I could just interrupt, we could not buy any private assets other than bank deposits We should have mentioned that in the memo It may be useful to note as background that, before the Monetary Control Act, we could only hold our foreign currency balances in the form of bank deposits The Monetary Control Act added government paper So, the only private assets we may hold, as Peter has said, would be bank liabilities   There is one other factual point that it might be useful to note, and I think you referred to it in the memo, Peter That is that one of the characteristics of the German money market is that they do not have a lot of short paper That reflects a policy decision on the part of the Germans, and I might add a policy decision on the part of the Bundesbank They are changing this a little Therefore, the other side of their being good natured about this is that in some sense they themselves have not promoted the kinds of assets in the market that we could easily purchase That is changing a little as I noted, and the Desk has taken advantage of that Again, exactly how it will evolve in the context of the euro--leaving aside all of the other issues about the euro and the amount of euros we will get when the transition occurs--is unclear My guess is that on balance we will be better rather than worse off because the Germans are the "least modern," if I may use that word, in terms of the kinds of government paper that they have on the market   Congratulate the Chairman   (Statement--see Appendix)  -9-    12/17/96   I talked with Hong Kong Monetary Authority officials last night, and  they did not seem particularly concerned Their mode of operation is one that in some sense tends  to draw attention, because in essence they meet a demand for Hong Kong dollars when it arises, but  they automatically tighten their money markets That's why we've seen a rise in their short-term    8/19/97  rates, which they hope will be enough to adjust financial market balance There does seem to me to  be a question as to how long the peg of the Hong Kong dollar against the US dollar is going to  last The current mechanism is somewhat artificial, and now that the artificiality of the other pegs  in Southeast Asia has been revealed, there is some sense that the Hong Kong authorities are nearer  the time when they will have to make a decision on this issue   I don't think they know what they are going to do, quite frankly In  fairness, they face a difficult problem President Minehan and I were at a conference last week, and  a very bright woman from Indonesia asked what advice we had for them now that they had floated  their currency Mike Mussa of the International Monetary Fund replied that at a minimum they  should not freely float but should have some sort of managed float and should re-orient the basket  of foreign currencies in terms of which they had sought to maintain their own currency's value so  that the basket is less heavily weighted toward the dollar He added that that was the end of his  advice My comment to her was that it was very good advice, although it was only about 25  percent operational in terms of what they really needed to do They have a relatively small open  economy, so the notion that they can ride the roller coaster of international financial disturbances is  very difficult for them to accept Their financial markets do not have the depth or resiliency that is  necessary to allow them to go, for example, to a Canadian style of monetary conditions index and  expect to have the sort of gyroscopic stability that the Canadian dollar has displayed It is a real  problem for them, and we should not underestimate it Perhaps monetary union with the Japanese--  [Laughter]   I think there are two points to be made One--about which it would  seem appropriate to inform the Committee in any event--is that the United States government was  very concerned about this from the beginning In fact, this issue came up last March and I think it  is fair to say, as Governor Meyer can attest based on meetings he attended, that this is an accident  that did not particularly surprise us Once the pressure built in March, we were in the awkward  position, partly because of US political opinion, of not wanting to be perceived as pushing the  Thai authorities into an action that I believe most observers thought was inevitable The Thais  and they have a very serious problem in terms  of restoring confidence and the stability of the baht The Treasury's position basically was to  encourage the Thais to engage with the International Monetary Fund, which has a traditional view  on these types of things, and to urge the Japanese to restrain from pouring money into Thailand  until the Thais had fully arranged their loan from the International Monetary Fund When it came    8/19/97  time for the Fund to put forward its package with the augmentation of bilateral assistance--a quite  unusual feature and one that the Fund tried to put together in connection with Mexico but could not  find countries that were willing to take on the direct Mexican risk in the way the Asians are  prepared to take on the direct Thai risk--the Treasury had to contemplate, in consultation with the  Chairman, whether to participate in this arrangement Post Mexico, as you may remember from  our discussion of the renewal of the swap lines, the Treasury is under much tighter constraints  about what it does with the Exchange Stabilization Fund than it was in the past So, the Treasury  would have had to jump a lot more hurdles to participate, and they have a number of other  proposals before Congress that require political support The latter include the approval of the New  Arrangements to Borrow, which is on the legislative agenda, and the potential approval of an IMF  quota increase So, on balance, they said that they would like to participate for purely geopolitical  reasons, but for internal political reasons it would be risky for them to do so They have said they  can anticipate some step-up in EX-IM Bank financing, but that financing is tied aid as opposed to  the untied aid contained in the rest of this Fund package  The one thing that we and the Treasury have done is to put forward a proposal, which  has now been accepted, to provide some backstopping in the form of short-term liquidity bridge  financing This was in the works from the beginning We were sufficiently skeptical about the  ability of the Fund to raise this medium-term money in Asia that we tried, and were largely  successful, not to put this forward as an alternative but rather as a supplement to the basic package  Agreement on that package has now been reached by the G-10 countries and a few non G-10  countries It is expected to be announced tomorrow or Thursday after the IMF approves the Thai  program That program provides a degree of political, if you want to put it that way, or  international monetary support for the operation, but obviously not on the scale to which the    8/19/97  Japanese and the Southeast Asian and other Asian countries have participated Some people in  Asia think that the Japanese they put up $4 billion and  everybody else put up $6 billion, which is a higher fraction than we got with Mexico On the other  hand, as President Minehan knows, the Japanese were represented at our conference by Mr  Sakakibara, who observed that  So, I don't think we've heard the end of this For your information, this  arrangement probably will be announced Thursday morning or late tomorrow afternoon and will  include a conventional bridge loan--the amount will not be announced--that is intended to bridge to  some World Bank and ADB disbursements that are part of the package The BIS will be putting up  the bridge loan money and will be backstopped as an agent by the Federal Reserve Bank of New  York and ultimately the Exchange Stabilization Fund   I think everybody in the room has heard in one form or another that  they have a very strong political commitment I was referring to the future At this point, it seems  to me that it would be very difficult for them to abandon the current policy The Hong Kong dollar  may be under considerable tension right now, but the right time to rearrange things would not be  only two months after the hand-over, no matter what one thinks about the long-term viability of the  current exchange rate regime One also could say that they ought to pick some point of relative  calm in the next five years and adjust their exchange rate regime They will face some of the same    8/19/97  kinds of issues as they do now concerning which way they should adjust, and if some of their  economists were to say that they have the right answer, I would not believe them  Let me just add the fact that Hong Kong and China have participated in the Thai  financing arrangement and they also are going to participate in the bridge financing; there's not  much risk associated with the latter It is essentially an operational risk--symbolic in my view of  their perceiving themselves as having a big stake in stabilizing this situation for exactly the reason  that they do not want to confront these difficult questions concerning the Hong Kong dollar right  away   You can use the word "bailout," but I am not allowed to The  financial situation in Thailand is in some respects much more problematical than was the case in  Mexico They have something on the order of $38 billion in short-term obligations Most are bank  obligations, of which more than half are to Japanese banks They also have a very large forward  position that is approximately equal to their gross reserves The amount of money being put up,  about $16 billion, is relatively small If we net out the forward position against the foreign  exchange reserves, their reserves position is no better than Mexico's was In a sense they are  getting some $16 billion in this package against $40 billion of short-term obligations, which are  mostly private-sector debts In that sense the whole program is predicated on the assumption of  credibility rather than a bailout because the money is not sufficient to allow all these short-term  lines to run off In the Mexican case, we had a package of close to $40 billion against essentially  $40 billion of short-term bank obligations and tesobonos We tend to forget that there were a lot of    8/19/97  bank obligations in the Mexican case, but they were as vulnerable as the tesobono problem In fact,  in the short run Mexico did lose some dollars through the banking system, but they recovered quite  quickly So, in that sense that financing package was less problematic  Two elements of moral hazard are involved in this case One has to do with the people  on Peter's acreage who conduct their business, but do not book their positions, on that acreage  They are on the other side of many, but not all, of the forward liabilities of the Bank of Thailand  You could say that the system is financing the Thai central bank's ability to meet its commitments  It would be a tricky business if the Thais were to start to default on their foreign exchange  contracts It would change the nature of the business The second element is a little more  conventional It has to do with what should be done with the obligations of banks in Thailand The  Thai central bank already has expended 16 billion--that's in baht, not dollars--to bail out domestic  institutions whose operations have now been suspended They have been quite successful in  sterilizing it, but it has become in effect an obligation of the Thai government as a whole It would  be one thing to stiff bondholders and still another to stiff commercial banks that might be expected  to come in and help support the Thai financial system as a whole The goal is to keep the central  bank's gross and net reserve positions from going to zero as they run down these forward  obligations I think that is the simple answer to your question   We do not yet have the June trade data Taking the inventory data to  give us a hint about what is going to happen to the trade data, one would expect imports to tail off  That would occur especially in the consumer area because we saw such a big rise in imports of  consumer goods in April and May Understanding all of this is a bit puzzling Our forecast tended  to level off such imports in June and into the third quarter, but there is a tension in the forecast as a  whole on exactly this point and how this should be put together   There has been some shift in the seasonal factors over the years and to  some extent earlier this year, especially in the consumer goods area One would not expect  Christmas to come in April, if I may put it that way It is not clear to what extent the seasonal  adjustments may have become unreliable, but it would not be a surprise if the seasonal adjustment  of imports were another source of the noise in these estimates   My guess is that that is the way it would happen In fact, a country  can always experience the problem of domestic capital flight, of which there is a substantial  amount in China--on the order of $10 billion a year Another way that domestic residents can  attack the currency is through classical, if I may call it that, leads and lags There also are certain  foreign investment strategies that could be used I do not think the yuan can be attacked in a  money market or financial market sense but--while it is much more difficult--pressure can  certainly be brought on yuan asset values, and in some sense that has been going on   Not much happened in Brazil after they announced their program  Rates were down marginally yesterday; stock markets were flat and are down a little today   Yes, both cases   I thought it would be useful to say a few words about how we have tried, in preparing the Greenbook forecast, to take account of the recent turbulence in the international economic and financial environment I would note at the start that our assessment is very much a work in progress; in particular, the assumptions, explicit and implicit, underlying our analysis could be vitiated  In preparing the Greenbook forecast for the global economy and its impact on our external sector, we tried to take account of three interrelated changes in the international environment since the Committee's previous meeting in September (1) the evolution of the economic and financial    11/12/97  crises in Asia and the limited spread, so far, to other developing economies, particularly in Latin America; (2) changes in our outlook for other industrial economies including the influence on them of Asian and related developments; and (3) the modest further depreciation of the dollar against European currencies The net impact of these changes on our outlook for real net exports of goods and services has been small; they increase the negative contribution of the external sector to growth of real GDP by about two tenths next year and one tenth in the following year Although we think that this is a reasonable best estimate, we also believe that the negative risks to our overall forecast associated with developments in the rest of the world have increased Let me touch on each of the three principal sources of change in our forecast Asia, the other industrial countries, and the dollar  We have sliced and diced in a number of different ways the implications of the financial crises in Asia and hints of their spread to developing economies elsewhere, but I think the simplest way to understand the forecast is as follows In effect, we have taken as a starting point an assumption that in 1998 the current account deficit of the developing economies as a group will have to shift toward surplus by a combined total of $50 billion relative to our baseline in the September Greenbook, which implied a combined 1998 deficit of about $100 billion Based on historical trade patterns, principally with respect to Asian imports, the US share of such a required external adjustment is about $15 billion, or about two tenths percent of nominal GDP In this simple framework, it does not matter much for US economic activity or prices whether this adjustment is caused by macroeconomic policies, by collapsing financial systems, or by severely depressed stock markets, nor does it matter much whether the impact on the US economy is felt via exchange-rate, other relative-price, or aggregate-demand channels as a first approximation, it is the size of the overall adjustment that counts We are assuming that most of the adjustment occurs quickly, by the end of the first half of 1998, and that little further external adjustment in Asia or elsewhere is required in 1999 Our basic message, as we see it, is that in terms of deflationary effects on the US economy, developments in Asia will be more like a ripple than a wave  With respect to other industrial economies, in our forecast we took into consideration two influences the underlying pace of expansion and the effects of the Asian crises Excluding the effects of the Asian crises, we probably would have left our outlook for Japan unchanged because recent data on the economy have been broadly consistent with what we had expected, pointing toward a resumption of growth at around 2-1/2 percent in the second half of the year and extending into 1998 However, mainly because of Japan's relatively large share of Asian trade and relatively small    11/12/97  GDP (compared with the United States), we have marked down Japanese growth next year by about half a percentage point due to the Asian crises With respect to Europe, recent information on trends in economic activity have on balance been better than we had anticipated which, other things being equal, would have led us to edge up projected growth However, these economies also will be affected by the economic adjustments in Asia Europe's share of Asian imports is essentially the same as ours while its combined GDP is somewhat larger, suggesting that the direct effect of the Asian adjustment on European growth should be marginally smaller than on US growth The feedback effects on the US economy of lower growth in Japan and Europe are negative, and they are expected to be somewhat more spread out over time than the direct Asian effects  Turning to dollar exchange rates with the other industrial countries, as Peter Fisher reported, the dollar has appreciated on balance against the yen over the intermeeting period and it has depreciated against the DM and other European currencies, with the latter effect outweighing the former effect in terms of our G-10 average exchange value of the dollar Broadly speaking, these movements are consistent with relative trends in economic activity in these economies and shifts in the market's view of the outlook for monetary policies extending the period of easy money in Japan, continuing moves to withdraw monetary stimulus in Europe, and foreseeing no change in policy in the United States Looking ahead over the forecast period, we have left the dollar unchanged at its recent lower level, on average, in terms of other G-10 currencies This has the effect of providing a small net stimulus to US net exports that partially offsets the negative effects of Asian developments and their feedback on the US economy through weaker growth in the other industrial countries, Japan in particular  Returning to our basic message, the combination of these influences and considerations has led us, on balance, to increase by a small amount the negative contribution of the external sector to US growth over the forecast period The small downward adjustment in prices of imports, other than oil, computers, and semiconductors, in the Greenbook forecast for this meeting is due not to changes in our outlook for the dollar--which on an import- weighted basis in terms of both G-10 and non-G-10 currencies is not projected to change further on average over the forecast period Rather the lower import prices are due to the small decline in international commodity prices that has occurred over the intermeeting period, a decline that may or may not be attributable to developments in Asia  The risks to our forecast with respect to the dollar and underlying growth trends in other industrial countries, we believe, are balanced In    11/12/97  terms of the Asian crises in all their ramifications, the probability of further deterioration should be thought of as greater than the risk of a sudden unexpected improvement However, it would be a mistake to think that there are no upside risks involved in the Asian situation For example, the news coming out of the deputies' meeting in Manila next week about a new Asia-Pacific cooperative financing arrangement may be perceived as sufficiently positive for the region as a whole that net inflows of private capital will resume and substantially reduce the size of the external adjustments that we now think will be required  On the downside, the new government in Thailand may not be able or willing to deliver quickly on that country's IMF-supported economic and financial program; the implementation of the Indonesian program also may get bogged down in domestic or family politics; the storm clouds over Korea may darken further; and the spread of contagion to Latin America may intensify We circulated to the FOMC a note on a so-called "worst case" scenario in which the negative impact on US growth from the Asian crises is roughly double what we incorporated in the Greenbook forecast, largely because of an assumed spread of the turmoil to Latin America That scenario might better have been called a "worse case," since it is easy to spin out scenarios that are more extreme  Mr Chairman, I will stop on that pessimistic note   It has not moved much It is still a very big negative or positive  depending upon how you want to think about it   When we did this calculation, we held that unchanged We forced  the adjustments to go elsewhere rather than into the statistical discrepancy   It seems to me that two or three points could be made One is that  there is a sense in which all of this volatility in foreign markets has been associated with some  moves toward tighter policies, as Peter has pointed out We have had the Canadian moves, the  British moves, the German moves, and although Japanese moves have been postponed, it is fair  to say that the generally benign monetary conditions in the industrial countries have been one  factor that has contributed to the acceleration of capital flows to emerging economies As we  have commented before, when that comes to an end, there is some risk of a process of  readjustment, some of which may already be under way I think it is probably a reasonable guess  that if the Committee were to surprise the market and move sooner, or move at all at this point,  there certainly would be some short-run dynamic effects And no doubt we all would come  under some criticism That having been said, unless you think that early tightening would set off  some great avalanche that would continue regardless of fundamentals, I don't think the timing  will make much difference in the medium term I don't think that in any fundamental sense an  earlier policy move will somehow cause political leaders in Southeast Asia to step back from the  things that they have said they were going to do I might even argue that it could accelerate the  adjustment process, but there might be a lot more broken crockery in the meantime    11/12/97   There is always that problem, and that is why I made my last  comment You could always say that if growth is going to be marked down by 5 percentage  points, why not mark it down by 6 percentage points? That is at one level There is always some  chance of a cumulative process, reminiscent of a lot of economic history On the other hand, one  also has to think about something from which many tend to abstract, namely, about what might  happen to policy along the line There likely is some policy whose feedback could prevent the  cumulative effects So, what may happen is difficult to say One point to think about, at least in  terms of developing economies, is that many of them are high-growth economies If they go into  recession, say their GDP declines by 2 or 3 percent, we would not think of that as a big recession  but for them it would represent a very large adjustment from previous growth rates of 6, 7, 8, or  9 percent The adjustment in growth would be something close to double digits We might  anticipate that Korean growth would still be 1 or 2 percent, but that would be a decline from 7 or  8 percent, a 6 percentage point change in the trajectory of the Korean economy Obviously,  there is no magic about zero here, and I think what you are saying is that in some real sense these  economies will be going into some kind of recession  Such a development could have further feedback effects, especially in Japan which, I  would argue, is hampered principally by their delay in doing something about the problems in  their financial system That has meant, at least in part, that their standard macroeconomic  measures may have been somewhat less effective than one might otherwise have thought, and  they are to some extent running out of string I don't think that is true for other industrial  countries as a group The industrial world seems to have the capacity to take policy steps that    11/12/97 37  would cushion some of these effects and in turn avert feedback effects on the developing  economies Things could be much worse  One part of the world that we have left out of our analysis is Eastern Europe There,  too, some economies have been impacted by at least the financial dimensions of all this turmoil  Although our trade with Eastern Europe is trivial, Western European trade with Eastern Europe  is not so trivial If there were dramatic changes in conditions in Eastern Europe, that presumably  would have some impact on Western Europe While it may be fair to say that Western European  nations have scope to use policy to offset the general macroeconomic effects of such a  development, it is not unreasonable to question whether they would be able to coordinate their  policies to do so So, I think there is some risk stemming from potential developments in Eastern  Europe that we have not taken account of arithmetically It is one reason why we probably  should have called our analysis "a worse" rather than "the worst" case scenario Absolute zero is  difficult to define in this context   It is a little more   It is more like adding 02 to 05 in 1998 and 01 to 02 or 03 in  1999 I think that is the order of magnitude There is always a question about multipliers in  these exercises Now, in fact, when we run these through, the ex post multipliers tend to be close  to 10 It is not entirely clear to me whether that is because the true multiplier is close to 10 or    11/12/97 38  because either automatic policy responses or discretionary policy responses are such that the  multiplier ends up being close to one   That goes to the question of global deflation Perhaps Mike Prell  and Don Kohn ought to answer this question, but my view is that the fundamental behavior of  the US economy has not changed so much in the last half dozen years that we can no longer  analyze effects of this size through standard aggregate demand approaches Obviously, the  developments in question would raise our unemployment rate and lower inflation pressures much  as one might argue that the collapse in Latin America in the early 1980s may have affected our  economy At that time, our economy was recovering from a recession, but it also was a recovery  from a recession with, at least as perceived at the time, remarkably quiescent inflation Inflation  was then in a 4 to 5 percent range, and that rate of inflation may have reflected some influences  from abroad in terms of downward pressure on commodity prices and related developments We  are looking at an effect on our macro economy that is marginal rather than large in terms of  fundamental behavior   On your first comment, I would agree with you and maybe I should  have been more clear It seems to me that in the particular framework that I laid out, which is  not the only way we looked at this, it is the capital account that is forcing the current account  adjustment As you say, the order of magnitude of those capital flows certainly is larger than the  gross trade flows But when it comes down to the corrective effect on goods and services--  which is what we measure in GDP--we end up wanting to look at that in terms of trade We  always have this question, much like the question on stock market effects on consumption, about  how to marry something with financial dimensions to how these things play out in real  dimensions, and whether the effects will be cumulative We have not added that in except, as I  think we mentioned in the Greenbook, that there is a side of this that looks at the implications for  growth in the developing countries It is hard to make everything consistent One sense of why    11/12/97 43  you might find less growth in developing countries would be that the cost of capital has gone up,  uncertainty has gone up, and there has been a big drop in investment It is not only investment  that comes from the public sector, which is supported in these economies, but from the private  sector as well as we go through this financial turmoil In that sense, we try to take account of  that effect   I was traveling, too I got trapped in Springfield, Illinois   Are you not just as likely to see higher short-term interest rates, so in  fact it would go the other way? The forward foreign exchange rates would be more depressed  You use the word position, which is quite different--   I don't think you can find 2-year forwards in these markets If they  existed, they would tend to have higher interest rates and would be more depressed than the  current spot rates   Peter Fisher may want to comment, but I think it is reasonable to say  that many people want to cover their positions There are a lot of different ways of covering  them Some covering can be done in the spot market; some in the forward market; some  through borrowing; and some through lending How it manifests itself in individual cases may  be quite different If you have thin markets, this continuing activity may be depressing spot  exchange rates and you may get some bounceback even though the whole process has not played  itself out because basically no one is in a position to provide forward cover   Our message about the international economy and the external sector of the US economy is straightforward and easily summarized We have a weaker outlook for net exports, primarily as a consequence of the further deterioration of economic and financial conditions in Asia While I am tempted to stop at this point and turn to questions, there may be a bit more that I usefully can add It is true that we are again projecting slower global growth, in particular in Asia We also are projecting a stronger dollar and lower oil prices; the first is associated to a considerable degree, though not entirely, with Asian developments, but those developments have only marginally affected our view of oil prices Finally, we have updated our worse-case scenario, and I will say a few words about our current thinking on that subject  With respect to the current quarter, we have very little hard data on US international transactions; trade data for October will not be released until Thursday However, we have written down a small negative contribution of net exports to GDP growth this quarter, in contrast with a small positive contribution in the November Greenbook This estimate is based primarily upon three considerations first, our assessment of the third-quarter data that revealed somewhat weaker exports than we had anticipated; second, a judgment that the unexpected strength in our exports during the first half of this year was coming largely from an accelerator effect on exports of capital goods that has waned with the Asian crisis; and third, anecdotal information, for example, from the Beige Book and the supplementary reports received from Reserve Banks about the apparent negative effects of the Asian crisis on trade flows this quarter The anecdotal information, in turn, is consistent with our prior assessment that the first-round effects of the Asian crisis on our trade will be felt sooner rather than later  Turning to our forecasts for 1998 and 1999, our aggregate projection of growth in the rest of the world, weighted by US nonagricultural exports, is now 2-1/2 percent next year and 3-1/4 percent the following year, compared with a trend rate of around 4 percent Most of the downward adjustment is for the developing economies in Asia, where we anticipate greater near-term    12/16/97  weakness and a more protracted return to trend We have also marked down slightly further our growth forecast for Japan, while that for the other industrial economies is essentially unchanged  Our outlook for Japan and the other industrial countries has been affected by our revised view of dollar exchange rates As Peter Fisher has reported, the dollar strengthened against both the yen and the continental European currencies during the intermeeting period We attribute the yen's weakness to continuing question marks hanging over the Japanese economy and financial system--questions marks that we do not expect will be removed by the announcement, now postponed until tomorrow, of yet another package of policy measures Because we do not expect underlying conditions in Japan to improve immediately or dramatically and because we anticipate that the effects of Asian developments will prevent a further substantial expansion of the Japanese external surpluses in the aggregate, we have incorporated into our projection only a slight appreciation of the yen/ dollar rate from its recent level Compared with our September projection, we now have the yen more than 15 percent weaker at the end of 1999  With respect to continental Europe, we are no longer expecting a further increase in German official interest rates prior to the start of monetary union, and the market appears to be gradually coming around to the same conclusion This has contributed to the weakness of the DM and its associated currencies, and we expect that recent lower exchange rates against the dollar will persist, on balance, over the forecast period We also anticipate in our forecast that sterling will depreciate somewhat against the dollar as UK economic growth and interest rates ease but that the Canadian dollar will strengthen somewhat as interest rates continue to rise in Canada  With respect to the currencies of non-G-10 countries, in particular in the Asian region, our crystal ball is murkier The Asian currencies, except for those of China and Hong Kong, have declined substantially further over the intermeeting period We are not expecting further depreciation, on balance, from the current highly depressed levels, nor are we expecting a recovery To borrow a term from the politics of 1884, I would characterize this as a mugwump position with regard to the nominal exchange rates of these economies--our mug is on one side of the fence and our wump is on the other However, real dollar exchange rates of these countries should appreciate somewhat due to inflation rates that in many cases will approach or exceed double digits  The net result of these assumptions is that the dollar is stronger in both real and nominal terms throughout the forecast period against both G-10 and    12/16/97  non-G-10 currencies, with an associated negative impact on our outlook for net exports  Turning to oil prices, we have reduced our assumption about the price of imported oil by about $2 per barrel in 1998 and 1999 Our revised assumption is based on the substantial increase in official OPEC quotas (which has led us to boost our projection of OPEC production by 900,000 barrels per day in 1998), the easing--at least for the moment--of tensions with Iraq and Iran, and the slowing of global growth, especially in Asia The market appears to have adopted a more cautious interpretation of these developments Although futures prices have declined, the implied downward adjustment in import prices over the forecast period is about half the size embodied in our assumption We believe that the difference reflects primarily continuing concerns about the availability of supply from Iraq and, perhaps, a different assumption about the increase in actual OPEC production--in particular by Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates--under the new quotas  In terms of our overall forecast, lower oil prices, of course, imply lower US inflation The principal impact on our external forecast is with respect to the nominal balances Our assumption of lower oil import prices translates into a projected reduction in the value of US oil imports in 1998 and 1999 of about $7 billion a year compared with the November Greenbook Lower oil prices have only marginal effects on net exports in real terms, boosting real imports slightly  In total, the estimated drag from the external sector in the December Greenbook is about 09 percentage point over the four quarters of 1998 and 04 percentage point during 1999 As a rough approximation, the drag from net exports would be a bit less than half this amount in the absence of the effects of the Asian crisis and the weaker outlook for Japan and the yen, using the September Greenbook as the basis for comparison I would caution, however, that it becomes increasingly difficult to disentangle causes and effects in successive forecasts For example, in the case of effects that are transmitted through third countries, establishing the counterfactual assumption is problematic As an illustration, in the November and December Greenbooks, we've assumed progressively more moderate trajectories for monetary policies in the major foreign industrial countries as well as in the United States, and these assumptions have affected our thinking about the path for the dollar No doubt some, but probably not all, of these adjustments can and should be attributed to the generally weaker global outlook and in particular to the effects of the Asian crisis, but it is increasingly tenuous to try to separate out how much is due to developments in Asia and how much is due to other underlying factors    12/16/97  Some of the same qualifications apply to the interpretation of alternative scenarios For this meeting, we have updated and circulated to the Committee a "worse case" scenario for the global economy in which the already seriously affected Asian economies experience deeper and more prolonged recessions and less recovery in their real exchange rates In this scenario, the crisis also spreads in a major way to China and Hong Kong, and it impacts with greater ferocity on Latin America, Eastern Europe, and the countries in the area of the former Soviet Union On our assumptions, such a worse case would further reduce the growth rate of US real GDP by about a half percentage point next year and about a quarter point in 1999, compared with the Greenbook forecast, with comparable effects on other industrial economies An important qualification to this analysis is that it assumes that the authorities, in particular those in the major industrial countries, would respond under the hypothesized circumstances by taking appropriate countercylical actions, primarily in the area of monetary policy--that is, they would lower interest rates As I noted earlier, in preparing our Greenbook forecasts, we have already incorporated assumptions that go in this direction; we are no longer assuming much monetary tightening It is another matter, some might argue, to assume that policymakers will act aggressively and on a timely basis to damp a global slowdown in growth that is having differential effects on their economies Policymakers in Europe, preoccupied with the transition to monetary union, might be less than poised to take prompt, decisive action On the other hand, this alternative scenario is one that combines both lower inflation and lower growth, which would facilitate easing action, at least in the area of monetary policy  Although our revised worse case scenario is possible, and you might even see it in February as our base case, I do not believe at this point that this scenario is the most likely outcome No doubt, Asian financial markets and economies will continue to experience substantial downs and ups for some months, but my view of the situation is one of optimism combined with realism I am optimistic that the political leaders in Asia, on balance, are acting and will continue to act constructively to stabilize their economies and financial systems and that the support they receive from the international financial community will help to bridge the gap until confidence in their policies and underlying economies returns On the other hand, it is clear that the crisis is not over, and there is plenty of scope for additional errors or negative surprises  Mr Chairman, I will conclude our presentation on that note   I am never quite sure how to answer those questions about  probabilities, but I would guess a fifth or something like that How seriously should we take that  scenario? I would say moderately seriously This is not a meltdown scenario because it assumes  that action will be taken by others to prevent a meltdown   Yes, I think there is That's partly because we are in December and  this crisis has been going on for some time As Peter said, we have the sense of a flood rather  than a severe rainstorm The psychology is pretty gloomy, though one might say it has been  slightly less gloomy in the last couple of days It is slightly less so only with respect to Korea,  not with respect to any of the other countries But there is a scenario in which we could have a  rebound in that situation For example, their exchange rates could move back up in nominal  terms--we are assuming essentially that they will not--and the global economies could pick up  faster than we anticipate I think this scenario is equally likely, though I would argue that it is  not completely symmetrical I think a better case would be associated with a series of the right  policy steps in the right order, rather than two steps forward and one step back as is often the  case in these situations   No, I would say the better case has the same probability, but it  probably is not as good as the worse case is bad We have a somewhat skewed distribution in  that regard   That possibility certainly is incorporated in the worse case scenario  we have laid out, though the effect may not be as big as some would argue it could be Let me  go back to one of your premises Although there was a 40 percent adjustment in China's official  exchange rate in 1994, most of China's trade--some 80 percent of it--was already being  conducted at the unofficial exchange rate So, although the sign certainly was right, we, unlike  some commentators, do not think the depreciation was a major cause of all these developments  Moreover it came in early 1994, not in 1997 The Chinese financial system is very weak and has    12/16/97 17  many of the same problems, if not worse, as the financial systems in these other economies The  important difference is that the Chinese financial system is not as integrated into the world  financial system so it is not a major source of external weakness It may be a source of internal  weakness, but one can debate that point Clearly, it is not the same source of external weakness  that we find in some of these other countries  That having been said, there certainly is scope for continuing capital flight from  China I know some analysts, including colleagues on my staff, who estimate that capital flight  on the order of $10 billion a year probably is occurring today from Mainland China It is  disguised in the trade account and so forth and there are errors and omissions in the data There  certainly is plenty of money in that economy and there always are ways of getting it out, though  that may require some patience In my view, the Chinese authorities have taken a fairly  responsible and nuanced position to date with regard to the yuan In fact, at the meetings this  week in Kuala Lumpur they basically said that they were not going to devalue their exchange  rate, but they also indicated that they were not going to go out of their way to help neighboring  nations financially any more than they already were As you know, they have a fairly  comfortable international reserve position of well over $130 billion--the latest number that I  remember seeing So, there is a risk there Setting aside the Chairman's view about the  possibility of a downward limit to declines in other Asian exchange rates, which seems to be  right to me, there is a point at which the competitive pressures on China and the different  competitive pressures on Hong Kong would be felt Therefore, I think we cannot rule out the  possibility that that pair of dominoes, to use an old metaphor, could affect other Asian economies  and likely have a secondary ripple effect on the United States and other parts of the world That    12/16/97 18  is a risk, though if I were to assess the risks, I think there is a higher probability of a problem in  Brazil associated in the short run with a spread of the Asian disease and a lower probability of a  problem in Mainland China and Hong Kong   It is in this scenario; it just may not be in the outline that we sent to  you We assumed that the Hong Kong peg goes and, as I remember, that economic growth in  China drops from essentially 4 or 5 percent to zero or close to it next year and similarly in Hong  Kong That aspect of the scenario could be worse, if you want to put it that way, and in some  sense it is just illustrative of what would be happening Any of these developments could be  augmented by 25 or even 50 percent without much argument from me   This time we did it right; we did not call it "worst!" [Laughter]   On that average, the dollar is about one percent higher than it was at  the time the Greenbook went to press   Isn't this one instance, President McDonough, where that bank  paper is covered by the implicit guarantee of the government? Actually, the Bank of Japan itself  has substantial profits, so I think it could absorb sizable losses The first recourse might be that if a  bank failed, the creditors would be made whole by the government, as has happened in all the other  bank failures, and then the Bank of Japan would be made whole, too   I don't think it is insolvent!   I think it is fair to say that there are other mechanisms to take over  the really bad paper In some sense this occurs when they actually resolve institutions It's not  clear to me exactly what has happened when institutions that failed were taken over by one of these  resolution banking organizations That is where the bad debt of these resolved banks ends up,  although obviously some of it is on the Bank of Japan's balance sheet Actually, their advances  have gone up and down, which suggests that there have been mechanisms to delay some of that in  order to allow time to seek other arrangements The advances got quite large in certain periods, in  the fourth quarter in particular   With regard to your comment on exchange rates, President Poole,  we did look about a year or so ago at whether we would forecast better if we used expected forward  exchange rates and forward interest rates It gets a little complicated when we use non-G10  currencies by the way The answer is that we introduce more noise by using that than by using an    5/19/98  assumption built off independent assumptions for exchange rates and interest rates here and abroad  That is true partly because in the short run, over periods of a year or so, expectations about policy  movements or other developments move around so that a lot of noise is introduced into the  forecast I think we are better off with this arbitrary assumption rather than something that is  driven by market interpretation We are not a lot better off, by the way, but obviously the former  gives us a less good forecast   I don't know either, but my guess would be that the fixing rate is a  rate at which people have agreed ex ante to settle certain contracts Ultimately, it should provide  some guidance, but it doesn't necessarily provide any in the short run The black market rate  presumably depends a bit on where you are and who you are and which black market you are  talking about--the foreign exchange kiosks outside the railway station or the large transactions I  think there is a big difference between those Over time, we could see a black market in Russia  that was very important in terms of its effects on import pricing and the inflation structure or one  that was of only minor significance because it would be the place where one might go to take    8/18/98  $100, not $100 million, out of the country The Russians have essentially brought their foreign  exchange and financial markets to a halt In time, as they announce what they are doing with the  GKOs and what they are doing with the 90-day suspension of debt repayments, one would think  that these things will come together For a while, though, I would assume there will be a number  of different rates depending on the nature of the underlying transactions I guess that's as far as I  would go, which is more words but less substance probably than Peter Fisher conveyed   Good!   They floated their exchange rate   They had a band before, but they were really operating with a heavily  guided, narrow interbank band However, they floated the ruble in a wide enough band that it is  trading, at least for the moment, within that band; it is not yet at the lower limit They announced  that they were going to restructure their internal official debt in the form of the GKOs, which are  obligations with maturities of less than one year, and their OFZs, their more than 1-year  obligations They announced a debt moratorium or suspension of controlled payments, and they  clarified that announcement slightly this morning to say what was included and what was not  They excluded debt to the EBRD, state and local debt, and some other categories   They have excluded foreign official obligations    8/18/98   Private-sector debt is subject to a form of temporary capital control   Yes, debt owed to foreign lenders The trouble is that the linkages are  quite high It is a little odd to read in the wires that Russian banks have borrowed abroad in order  to invest in GKOs, which are obligations denominated in rubles That is not exactly what one  normally would think would be the way so-called financial institutions should operate That has  led to a lot of problems and, of course, there has been a lot of financial engineering going on  relating to those transactions That has created a lawyers' paradise   Well, lots of laws, maybe no justice! [Laughter]   I think the answer to that question is "yes" They had lost about $5  billion in reserves, most of it in the last couple of weeks since their program was put in place It  was quite clear that the new program approved by the IMF on July 20 had not stabilized  confidence They were facing an external and internal financial crisis The only difference is that  they did it with $10 billion of actual foreign exchange reserves still in the bank rather than zero  One might argue that it is better to take such actions sooner rather than later   Yes Their dwindling reserves combined with the momentum in the  market last week did not, I think, give them much choice on Monday Both of their actions are  regrettable, as has been amply highlighted Abandoning the peg means, at least for the moment,  that they put in jeopardy the one success they have had on domestic inflation With regard to what  might be viewed as their internal defaults, I think that will be mostly a matter of restructuring and  refinancing their internal debts, though that process gives rise to some trepidation It is hoped that  there will not be a confiscatory refinancing in real terms, and in that sense one might argue that  they will just be leveling the playing field that is particularly oriented toward the domestic fiscal  problem Even making relatively modest assumptions about how much they have achieved on the  fiscal side, they have a primary surplus Their problem relates to the fact that they have  accumulated a lot of debt recently, and they have very high interest rates   Let me start with a few words about the June trade data that were released this morning The deficit was $142 billion compared with a downward revised $155 billion in May As readers of the footnotes in the Greenbook know, we put down an estimate for the June deficit that was somewhat larger than the one that was implicit in BEA's preliminary estimate of second-quarter GDP We had weaker exports of goods and services, stronger imports, and a deficit of $16 billion That deficit was similar to one of the consensus market reports and a bit higher than another, though both were above the BEA estimate In fact, exports declined further in June by about the magnitude that BEA assumed but by less than we had estimated The decline in imports was more than BEA assumed and substantially more than we estimated, suggesting perhaps a bit less strength in underlying domestic demand than we might have thought Despite this positive surprise, the effects of the Asian crisis on our trade balance are not over Our bilateral trade deficits with the Asian economies, including Japan, widened further in the second quarter Moreover, we had a decline in real exports of goods and services for a rare second quarter in a row The differences between the staff and BEA estimates for real net exports in Q2 from the now-published data merely reduce the deterioration from almost $60 billion--measured in chained 1992 dollars--to slightly less than $50 billion at an annual rate Our quick look at these data suggests that, taken alone, they would imply an upward revision of about half a percentage point to second-quarter growth However, there is likely to be a substantial offset in producers' durable equipment  To state the obvious, the June trade data do not alter the contour of our outlook for the external sector from the one we have presented for the last seven meetings continuing restraint on aggregate demand in the United States associated with very weak growth on average abroad and a strong dollar But we see some diminution in these trends Though it is difficult to imagine at times, growth abroad will eventually return to trend In our outlook, growth picks up next year, but it remains extraordinarily weak We believe that the modest pickup in foreign growth on average--with perhaps some associated modest uptick in interest rates abroad--the success of the euro's introduction, the stabilization of the Asian crisis, including importantly the situation in Japan, and the widening US current account deficit will be enough to bring about some decline in the dollar next year  As I am sure you can appreciate and as was amply demonstrated in Peter Fisher's report and by the discussion that followed it, we once again had to assemble a forecast against the background of substantial turbulence in global financial markets that has been associated with considerable uncertainty about    8/18/98  the course of policies and other developments in much of the rest of the world While most of the major industrial countries seem to be on solid growth paths, Japan is a glaring exception In fact, one might argue that the uncertainty about its prospects are indicative of the risks in the entire external forecast  So, let me say a few words about our outlook for Japan while staying away from the deflation debate I proceed from the assumption that Japan's downward spiral eventually will come to an end We have a bottom built into the forecast but not much of a recovery Four consecutive quarters of negative growth are projected to end this quarter For the remainder of the forecast period, Japanese growth averages less than one percent at an annual rate While net exports impart a small positive contribution to Japanese growth throughout the forecast period, that growth is driven almost entirely by government spending We have a swing in the structural budget deficit of 3/4 percentage point this year and a bit more than 1 percentage point next year, including a large dose of permanent personal and corporate tax cuts and some additional spending that is not yet on the plate of the Diet However, private domestic demand contracts through the middle of next year and is flat thereafter, even with substantial tax cuts Thus, we have at best the hint of a turnaround in Japan based on the assumption that the Japanese authorities will continue gradually to get their collective act together on fixing the banking system and the macro economy  For the developing countries in Asia, we have five quarters of negative growth extending into early 1999 and a modest recovery thereafter Our basic story is that external and internal financial conditions stabilize, recovery begins in the traded goods sector, confidence improves, and investment begins to pull out of its deep swoon, financed primarily from internal sources of funds--not by domestic banks  Outside of Asia, we have weakness in Latin America owing to the spillovers from Asia that add to investor caution and boost interest rates With slowing growth in Canada and the United Kingdom because of the rise in real interest rates in both countries, there is not enough growth in Euroland to provide much impetus to aggregate foreign growth  Weighted by US nonagricultural exports, the four-quarter growth of foreign GDP was less than 2 percent in the second quarter of this year and will have remained below that rate for six consecutive quarters ending in the third quarter of next year The only comparable period over the past thirty years was in 1982-83 By this metric, the Asian crisis and its surrounding events and aftermath are now projected to match the scale of the Latin American crisis in the early 1980s To review a bit of history, in that case the dollar continued to rise through early 1985--albeit with a different US fiscal-monetary mix--and our current account deficit peaked at 36 percent of GDP in 1987, the year in which our net international investment position turned negative In contrast, we    8/18/98  project that the current account deficit as a share of GDP will exceed the previous peak by early next year and that our net international investment position will be an estimated minus 20 percent of GDP  There are still considerable downside risks to the outlook, as illustrated by the material on the possible implications of recent Russian events that was circulated to the Committee late yesterday by Peter Hooper At the same time, there are some upside risks as well Without spelling them all out, let me just say that at some point our outlook for the external sector will be seen in hindsight to have been too pessimistic  Nevertheless, I suspect that the next cycle of external excitement will focus on our external position and the dollar The reason is that unless growth in the rest of the world comes roaring back, we are likely to see a continuing erosion of our external position from what is already a rather low base, and investors will see dollar depreciation as the only way to narrow the gap Moreover, we don't know how much of the recent strength of the dollar has been driven by safe-haven or risk-aversion considerations It is suggestive, I think, that the dollar did not rise against either the DM or the yen yesterday following the Russian announcements Once Japan and the rest of Asia stabilize, the air could come out of the dollar's balloon in a rush, and I could find myself in another location drafting vacuous statements about the excessive and unjustified weakness in the dollar  Mike Prell will now add his own perspective on the outlook   I would say a couple of things I think your sign is probably right I  believe the problems are still there; we still hear these reports The question is one of magnitude  It is fair to say that our imports have not increased as much as one might have thought as a result  of this crisis But we have to be a little careful about that conclusion because those imports have  held up in nominal terms and their prices clearly are down So, in real terms there has been an  increase in imports from Asia, though perhaps not as much as certain incentives would suggest  there could have been Therefore, it would seem to me that in time, one way or another, if the  incentive is there and remains, people will find a way around the obstacles and there will be  some upward impact on our imports On the other hand, to the extent that the growth of the US  market slows, not all of the higher Asian exports may be coming to the United States I find it is  quite interesting that the one area where we seem to have been about right in our forecasts is the  extent to which the swing in the trade position of the developing Asian countries has been shared  among importing countries Some considerable fraction has gone to Japan, notwithstanding its  own situation, and a considerable fraction to Europe as well Indeed, in line with some  comments at recent meetings, European domestic demand has been much stronger than we  expected before the crisis, and European net exports have been much weaker Thus, there has  been a parallelism in this situation   The answer to the first part of your question is that we have aggregate  price and aggregate quantity numbers The aggregate price numbers basically come from the BLS  survey of import prices There are problems with those import prices, and what we do is to take a  nominal total and deflate by an index at various levels of detail to get real figures The quality of  the price data is substantially better than it was 20 years ago We used to have something called  "the unit value," which really would have led you to ask this question On the other hand, it also is  not clear what we are now getting with the price data or what question they are answering That's  because it is unclear what the relationship is between the price that is quoted on an invoice and    8/18/98  included in the index and the price at which the sale actually is made and embodied in aggregate  demand  The other point is exactly what I was trying to say in response to Bob Parry's question  We do have disaggregated price indices by area, and we can see what has happened to the price  index for the Asian countries That has declined dramatically You may then say that the nominal  amounts of our imports from them have been flat, so the increase in real imports has been  substantial I think the only point that we can make here is that we have a J-curve effect We  might have expected that J-curve effect to have run its course earlier I have not been able to look  at the detail of the numbers that came out today, but there have been stories, for example, relating  to some industrial supplies You probably have heard additional stories about iron and steel, for  example, some involving Korea The trouble is that we have a third factor, which is the general  weakness of commodity prices In fact, one of the surprises in the data that came in today was  that June exports and imports of industrial supplies were much less than we had anticipated I  asked the same question you are asking, is this shortfall nominal or is it real? The answer may be  some of both A lot of it may well be nominal, in which case real would be less The analysis is  very complicated The other thing you want to remember is that although conceptually we think  about exports and imports as being final demand, they are not Very few imports go directly from  the ship or the plane to the supermarket shelf As a result, the way they get imbedded in the  production and therefore the price structure is very complicated, and it probably has become more  complicated in recent years Just-in-time inventories, reduced transportation costs, and the  reduced weight in GDP which the Chairman likes to cite mean that the way these things get  integrated accounts for much less of GDP That is probably one of the reasons why simple rules  of thumb for exchange rate depreciation or exchange rate changes and inflation have tended to    8/18/98  break down Another reason may be that we are not talking about just two countries We are  talking about the increasing number of sources of imports to be traded, as in the Indonesia point  that you raised   They never involved trade! Seriously, Peter did not mention the fact  that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is going to release its turnover survey today If we  go back and look at the first such survey many years ago, we find almost precisely the same low  number, namely something like 10 percent or 15 percent of all the financial transactions are  traceable to real transactions The multiplier essentially has been constant over the roughly 20  years that the Bank has been doing that survey I don't think there has been much change, at  least on the foreign exchange side One can assert that it is a Ponzi game, but I'm not sure it is a  bigger Ponzi game than it was 20 years ago   My impression of most of the work that has been done on this  subject over a long period of time is that volatility has not shown much trend in markets that are  well developed Of course, we may have episodes of high volatility and that is what Peter has  pointed out This is an episode in which we observe an extreme set of withdrawals from a large  number of markets But that does not say anything, it seems to me, about whether we are on a  new trend   These things, it seems to me, give us six years worth of information  and they are all off the charts   There is collateral but no margin   The off-balance-sheet presumably goes the same way as the balance  sheet   What can I say after all the talk and ink that has been spilled on international economic and financial developments since the Committee's August meeting? It occurred to me that the Committee's    9/29/98  "central tendency" preference might be that I should shut up and get out of here My so-called international friends have caused enough trouble, and you do not need any further explanations from me about the consequences of external developments for the US economy  On the other hand, you may have noticed that our forecast for the external sector of the US economy has weakened further, although it has not changed all that much from the one prepared for the August meeting, before the Russian authorities lost their game of roulette with the domestic and international financial markets and set off a global withdrawal from risk That may be surprising in light of the aforementioned spilled ink It is clear that our external forecast would have been different without the change in our assumption about US monetary policy and the calming influence, even before its delivery, of the Chairman's testimony last week  In brief, four factors have influenced our outlook for net exports in different directions Recent trade data have strengthened our near-term outlook Projected slower growth abroad and in the United States reduces both our exports and our imports, but the former is more important than the latter A slightly weaker dollar tends to strengthen our exports and weaken our imports  On the first factor, US trade data for June and July were stronger than we had anticipated, leading us to reduce slightly our estimate of the negative contribution of net exports over the four quarters of 1998 In the June data, imports were weaker than we expected; however, this weakness brought the second quarter as a whole more in line with our model estimates In both June and July data, we were surprised that exports, particularly of machinery, did not fall as much as we had expected In the Greenbook forecast, we carried some of that strength through into the remaining months of the quarter However, in light of the August report on shipments of capital goods that was released late last week and suggested weaker- than-expected PDE shipments in that month, we may well have overdone our cautious optimism On the other hand, there may well be some remaining residual seasonality that will boost fourth-quarter exports that we have not taken into account in our forecast  Turning to the second factor, our forecast for growth abroad, which was very weak to begin with, has been revised down again--by half a percentage point this year and three quarters of a point next year This is the major reason why we now are projecting no growth in real exports of goods and services between the second quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of next year, in contrast with the 2-1/4 percent growth in our previous forecast  In particular, for Latin America we have reduced growth by 1-1/2 and 2 percentage points this year and next, respectively, in reaction to the reduced access of countries in this region to credit in international capital markets    9/29/98  and to interest rates that have been elevated in defense of their currencies In particular, we have negative growth this year and next in Brazil and Venezuela, negative growth this year in Chile, and negative growth next year in Argentina We are assuming that Brazil will adopt a program that involves significant fiscal tightening and a depreciation of the Brazilian real with negative short-run effects on Brazilian growth, but our base assumption is that these adjustments will be relatively orderly and will not push the Argentine peso off its peg  With respect to Asia other than Japan, we have reduced slightly our already very weak outlook There are a few signs of a bottoming out of economic activity in Korea--ask the US steel industry--and Thailand, but not enough to lead us to alter our basic outlook  Turning to the industrial countries, we have not altered our basic view of the weak outlook in Japan We had anticipated the cut that occurred earlier this month in the Bank of Japan's target for the overnight rate The official release on second-quarter growth suggested that activity was not quite as weak as we expected, largely because of a sharper-than-anticipated decline in real imports We expect the third quarter to record a fourth consecutive negative quarter, in part because of delays in the implementation of the program of fiscal stimulus We now anticipate that more of the effects of that program will be felt in 1999  We have weakened our outlook for the other foreign G-7 countries more significantly in light of the deterioration of global financial conditions, spillovers from Russia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America, and in the case of Euroland, a stronger currency that has affected our outlook for Germany in particular This deterioration occurs despite significant changes in our assumptions about monetary policies in these economies In the United Kingdom, we now assume that interest rates will decline by 125 basis points by the end of 1999, to a level 150 basis points lower than we assumed in August In Canada, interest rates are assumed to decline in line with US rates, but with a longer lag and from the elevated level to which the Bank of Canada pushed them in late August In Euroland, we assume that short-term rates converge to the current German level by the end of the year and remain there through the end of the forecast period, in contrast to the assumption in the August Greenbook of a rise of 75 basis points over the course of 1999 We have not assumed that the outcome of the German election will affect policy or the economy during the forecast period; it remains to be seen if we will be right  With respect to monetary policy in Euroland, it is clear that right now euro-area central bankers do not want to lower interest rates below the current German level before the European system of central banks becomes operational on January 4, 1999 However, in considering how attitudes may change going forward, I found it instructive to consider how the outlook for    9/29/98  growth in Euroland has changed over the past 12 month  Using our own forecasts for the G-7 members of the Euro area as a proxy, our current forecast for growth over the four quarters of 1998 is lower than we thought it would be a year ago by three tenths in France, four tenths in Germany, and one percentage point in Italy Moreover, contrary to European protestations that the Asian crisis has had little effect on Europe, our estimate of the contribution of net exports is half a percentage point lower for Italy, 1-1/4 points lower in Germany, and 2-1/4 points lower in France As the Europeans have pointed out, they have had a positive surprise on domestic demand, leading to caution about monetary policy easing in Frankfurt--both at the Bundesbank and at the ECB Nevertheless, if the euro should appreciate against the dollar by more than the roughly 10 percent that we are projecting from the second quarter of this year to the fourth quarter of next year, we could well see a reduction in interest rates before we see an increase  With respect to my third factor, US economic activity, the downward revision to US growth, despite our changed assumption about US monetary policy, is the major factor behind our projection of somewhat slower growth of imports of goods and services  Fourth, the dollar has weakened a bit more than we expected over the intermeeting period, primarily against the major foreign currencies We expect the dollar to continue to decline on average during the forecast period, reaching roughly the same point by the end of 1999 in terms of our real 29-currency index as we had projected in the August Greenbook This forecast seems reasonable with respect to the major currencies, given the roughly parallel adjustment in our monetary policy assumptions here and abroad However, the slightly weaker dollar in the near term tends to strengthen our outlook for exports and weaken our outlook for imports a bit  The combined influence of these forces on our outlook for real net exports is to weaken it somewhat further, but not by a huge amount However, the risks over the forecast period as a whole remain skewed to the downside Moreover, in thinking about Federal Reserve policy in this context, the issue is not simply one of how developments in the rest of the world will affect us Under current circumstances, the size of the potential linkages from Federal Reserve actions or inactions to the rest of the world and back onto the US economy appears to have been magnified  Dave Stockton will complete our report   In preparing for this meeting, I looked back at the work that we did  on a worse case scenario late last year In one sense, we are close to the worse case, but it has  taken a different form The sense in which we are close is essentially in that the total impact on  the US economy is commensurate with it It has taken the form, however, of the deeper  recessions and problems in Asia including Japan and no spread to Latin America We had in our    9/29/98  worse case scenario a generalized spread to Latin America It is a little embarrassing to say so at  this time, but this proves the less than reliable nature of forecasting We had no growth in Asian  economies last year in our worse case scenario and also no growth in Latin America We now  have positive growth on average in Latin America and negative growth in the Asian economies  So, we are close to our worse case forecast, but we have a slightly different mix  I think that outcome also points to the second part of your question about where these  foreign economies are heading I probably should have said this in my oral presentation Our  outlook for Latin America is quite gloomy and is much gloomier than I think anyone will see in  other forecasts That may just be because we did ours three days ago, and most of the others you  have seen were done three weeks ago But as was pointed out in the Greenbook, we made a  rather modest adjustment I always find it easiest to think about current account deficits, at least  in terms of our own economy, by calibrating them on the basis of how large an adjustment in the  deficit goes with everything else that is happening in the economy It gives me a shorthand way  of assessing how big the impact is on the United States The answer there is that in our forecast  we only cut the current account deficits of Latin America in half from where we had them last  year We are still assuming that the major countries in Latin America can finance $30 billion  current account deficits rather than $60 billion deficits It is easy to envision, especially in light  of what has happened in Asia, that the number could be zero or a $30 billion surplus without any  stretch of the imagination I think that will be the next aspect of this  One other point about Asia is that our 1998 forecasts for China and Singapore are  about the same as they were earlier It is the affected economies in Asia that were much weaker  than we had them before But clearly in Latin America and, I think, in eastern Europe and  Russia--which are not as important to our economy as to the economies of Europe as I tried to    9/29/98  illustrate in my little story about our forecasts of the G-3 nati ns within Euroland--there clearly  has been a big impact  The interesting development is our forecast I did not go back and look at it, but I  believe our US forecast for 1998 even now is probably stronger than it was a year ago  Interestingly, our Euroland forecast is slightly weaker than we had it last September The Euro  area has taken a very large hit on the external side This suggests, I would think, that there is a  risk of some substantial cumulation on the downside Now, we could talk ourselves into being  too gloomy about these things   It is useful to think about worse case scenarios, but worse case  scenarios do not always come true Let me just end on that point   When we do these forecasts, there is a tendency to be at least slightly  conservative There are so many different scenarios that are possible for Brazil We took a sort  of average of what we felt was a reasonable set of scenarios in which we assumed that the  Brazilians basically have three problems they have a fiscal problem; they have a banking  problem; and they have a competitiveness problem We are assuming that these problems are all  somewhat interrelated If they address the fiscal problem that will be enough to avert a complete  loss of confidence Although the exchange rate may have to give, it may give in a way that  either is a discrete devaluation followed by a faster rate of crawl or simply a faster rate of crawl  so that by the end of the period, the real will be at a level that by one rule of thumb appears to be  sustainable One indicator suggests that the currency may be 15 percent overvalued So, the real  could get down to an acceptable level without too much of an adjustment  I'm not sure what you mean by drawing the line in the sand, unless you mean drawing  the line in the sand in terms of the exchange rate itself?   I think that is one of the problems with these situations Brazil has  an election on Sunday, so I don't imagine that the president of Brazil is going to say they are  about to devalue Nor do I think they want to devalue They actually may be considering a  widening of the band Setting a faster rate of crawl is not as much of a problem as a devaluation  They might want to talk themselves into that, maybe correctly It did seem likely to us as we  prepared our forecast that there would be a devaluation or some adjustment of their exchange  rate over the period But since we did not know when it was going to come, whether it was  going to come tomorrow or next week or the week after that or in January, and whether it was  going to be discrete or gradual, we put it in as being at the desired level a year from now We  drew a straight line between its pre- and post-devaluation levels so that it did not drift around  during the forecast period I think there are very sizable downside risks The worse the scenario,  the more likely obviously it could have ripple effects not just in Latin America but elsewhere   Yes, and that has been in our forecast On that point, we have  tended to be somewhat more optimistic all along That may not have been the case initially  when we probably had convergence at a higher level Fairly early on, however, we had  convergence at the relatively low French and German level and the beneficial effects of that on  the Euroland economies I don't want to minimize the actual problems that they have had  There are two groups of countries Italy, where the actual performance of the economy is not so  great, is lowering its interest rates One could argue that is not so bad, but that gets everyone  involved in the fiscal fights that they are having Then we have the other group of countries that    9/29/98  have higher interest rates because they want to pursue tighter monetary policies The question  then is, what about France and Germany? At the moment, there is no reason for them to panic,  and I'm not sure that I necessarily would panic In my view it is a little foolish to say that there  is no way one can imagine why they would need to lower interest rates In some sense, our  forecast does have them lowering interest rates It's just that by not having an increase in interest  rates associated with a boom condition in the wake of EMU, we now have them with unchanged  interest rates The rate differential in this forecast in some sense is not that much different than it  was in the last forecast
