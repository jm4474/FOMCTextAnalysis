  What’s in this monthly model?  Is that the federal funds  rate?    I also have a couple of other questions--it surprises me,  if I read this right--the nonborrowed reserves one--it gets very little better when you take a two- month average compared to some of the others  Why is that?    It seems to be a particularly worse year for that one than  for some of the others  And I assume, subject to correction, that this is operating in effect  without any federal funds constraint in here at all At least you get worse if you do review some  [unintelligible] equations, not worse but you would expect to do worse in this practice as soon as  you put any other--    The question is, on these equations, it’s necessary to  assume you hit the [non]borrowed reserves target  If you were using them as a target, you might  not hit the target, which would make the error greater    That’s still true on all these models  Is it going to be  more true of the nonborrowed reserves model than either of the first two you have listed, which  look a lot better than the [unintelligible]    These models put in the actual GNP figures    Even that strikes me as being very difficult  You’re  more than a few days away and you’re engaged in some operation, and the situation is different    What troubles me, Bob, is that I start out philosophically  thinking this is a good idea, but the more you learn when you look at these numbers, the less it  seems to be borne out statistically, and the more you wonder whether it’s just a question of  getting the Committee used to it  This really doesn’t look very good in substance    Looks better than nonborrowed reserves--that’s all you  can say    Well, what is the theory of the subcommittee?  [Unintelligible], forget about M1 and operate on [unintelligible]    This is the ultimate, the--    The staff will inform us about at least one and I hope  two things--how these equations look extended over a longer time period and how the present  model would look if you were operating on forecast of GNP instead of [unintelligible]   SPEAKER(?) Right, we’ve noted that in--    Mr Chairman, this is a parting shot here--maybe this  will make you feel a little better about the report  Certainly [speaking] for myself, and I think on  behalf of the other members of the subcommittee, I can give you categorical assurance that there  is not a monetarist in the group    But literally, if I understand the subcommittee’s  recommendation properly, Alan shouldn’t even have been looking at M1 or M2  All he knows is  that [non]borrowed reserves is above the targets so he should have been acting     Just to return to the general economic outlook question   First quarter [unintelligible] were certainly affected by inventories that we didn’t anticipate, and I  share some of Bob Mayo’s questioning about that  But I should say that the final sales, as Lyle  mentioned, have been sharply affected by net exports, which we would not expect to continue in  terms of a decline  Certainly, we have been looking at numbers in New York that are in this case  significantly higher than what the Board has been projecting, ranging higher by roughly 1/2 to  1 percentage point, quarter by quarter    Real GNP over the next year    For the time periods I have here, it runs about 6 percent  beginning on a quarterly basis, depending upon whether you go a year ahead or 18 months  ahead    Or it might look different next month or it might be just  what the doctor ordered    The money supply increasing both the target rate--      4/20/76 - 17 -            There is a question of a lag here, and the money supply  has been running a little high in the last couple of weeks    Just following up on your suggestion of a subcommittee  here  Do you contemplate it would be [within] the jurisdiction of that subcommittee not to have  the credit proxy at all or do you think that we’re--     That may be indicative of the amount of study that I’ve  given to the credit proxy     But on the general question [of the ranges for growth of the monetary aggregates],  obviously very persuasive reasons have been suggested around the table already, which I share,  for lowering these ranges  Indeed, for M1 at least, I came to the meeting prepared to raise the  question, but not to press the question, of lowering them by more than 1/2 [percentage point],  largely on the grounds that when one looks at this in a perspective over a period of time, as you  did, Mr Chairman, in your introductory remarks, and if you assume that you would like to get  down to 1 or 2 percent eventually, and you go at the rate of 1/2 [percentage point] a year, which  is what’s implied here, it takes a hell of a long time to get there  And it may raise some question  of the conviction with which we pursue that prospect  I do indeed think you could make a case  for 1 [percentage point] a year quite reasonably, but I will not belabor it because it’s an extension  of the arguments that you use     I also came prepared to quite happily support a 1/2 [percentage point] reduction as an  appropriate move at this particular point in time  That would even include just 1/2 percent[age  point] on the upper ranges, as you suggested, because it seems to me the upper end of the ranges,  as a number of people have suggested, is the more significant figure here and the figure that  people will look at as to what we’re willing to tolerate in some sense  That’s of the greatest  value, but I would be happier to be placed on the side of those who think on balance it would be  better to reduce it both at the upper end of the range and the lower end of the range, both for the  substantive reasons that have been suggested and the fact that I’d like to keep the range a little  wider than a little narrower       4/20/76 - 29 -           On M3, it seems to me that you can make a very good technical argument  But consistent  with those kinds of decisions, the thing should remain about where it is, and we just track our  past performance  It seems to make sense if we’re going to meet both targets at the same time,  judging from what has happened  My only concern there is I’m a little bit restive about some of  your rationale, Mr Chairman, because it seems to promise conceivably that you would be  trapped if interest rates did begin rising at some point and we began failing to meet the range on  M3--which one do you look at?  Which one do we really think is more significant?  And if we’re  too afraid to reduce the M3 range when it seems appropriate, which I don’t argue is necessarily  [the case] this time, we could be in trouble     So I would just put a little footnote on keeping that one unchanged, which does seem to me  appropriate for this particular quarter  But maybe it is something we want to look at next quarter  in the light of what is then going on and what the interest rate developments have been and what  their prospects might be in the coming period  In fact, that one also looks unsustainably high to  me over a longer period of time, and we ought to be thinking about when and where it should be  reduced  So my acquiescence in that which I think is correct and [unintelligible] but strongly  support is perhaps [of only a] limited time duration    It’s more than that  A projection is a policy decision   That was the whole purpose--this was to segregate out from the policy decision what was fact,  and this is certainly a policy decision    For this time, right?    You’re asking us to vote as a consensus, whether or not  we prefer it?   SPEAKER(?)  We agree with your judgment that there is consensus  Whether or not  you’re part of it--    Well, Mr Chairman we just reached a consensus on the  longer term  Since that’s so fresh in our minds, I guess we are forced to be consistent, or should  be consistent on this immediate decision  And when I looked at what the staff has done here,  they set forth some figures that are consistent in their way, but it seems to me not the only way  you can be consistent  And the implication of what they have set forth--based upon some  projections of uncertain reliability--permit faster growth now, with the prospects of substantially  slower growth later on  I’m not convinced that makes maximum sense from a policy standpoint   When I look at some of these figures, I don’t know as I would want the aggregates rising so  slowly next year, and therefore I feel a little less tolerant of letting them rise more rapidly right  now   I think you can make a case that, if interest rates are going to rise a little bit, now is a  reasonable time to permit that  What this means, specifically, as I’ve thought about this is, given  the decision we’ve just made, we ought to move toward what appears to be the tighter  alternatives for the short-range specifications  In fact, I had in mind that we might even retain  the M1 range we have now of 4 to 8 percent, in full recognition that, certainly if the Board  [staff]’s projections are right, we are most likely to get triggered with some higher interest rates  in the near-term future, and that seems to me acceptable     I wouldn’t want that to go too far, so I would put a collar on the federal funds rate  In fact,  that range, so far as I’m concerned, could stay where it is  But in assessing the probabilities, I  would assume that we would be moved up to 5 percent and maybe as high as 5-1/4, although I  would be reluctant--I wouldn’t want to go beyond that  I would want some time to pass before  we went beyond 5 percent, it seems to me  But what I am suggesting is that we be reasonably  tight, on the high side anyway      4/20/76 - 38 -           In setting the M1 range, 8-1/2 percent is certainly all right for me, as in alternative C,  although in a way I would be just as happy with something as low as 8, recognizing that that will  probably bring an increase in short-term rates in this period before the next meeting  And I  wouldn’t want that to go more than 1/4 in the near-term, and certainly not more than 1/2 before  the next meeting--and I would set the federal funds rate ranges in that light     Now, in approaching this, I should also note that the New York Bank’s projection of the  M1 movements, in the short term, particularly, are significantly lower than the Board [staff]’s  I  don’t attach much reliability to either of these, but it so happens that the New York estimates are  6 percent, which is exactly in the [middle] of a 4 to 8 percent range  And the M2 estimates are  also somewhat lower  While they are not as strikingly much lower as the M1 projections, I  think, consistent with what I said, the M2 range should be perhaps 8 to 12 percent or a bit lower    If I may just interject one thing here, Mr Chairman,  because there may be some misunderstanding  I certainly have the feeling that in this time we  ought to be responding to the aggregates, too  If I said something that didn’t--    We have a difference on the range, but the philosophy  that you were expressing I share in this particular instance    If I could come back just a second, Mr Chairman    I have recognized what Mr Black and Mr Partee are  saying  I’m not sure there’s all that much difference between myself and their comments except  to this extent  I am worried about the inflation thing that a number of people [are worried about]   I think the [unintelligible] figures are unreal, and I’d just as soon make a move right now in the  face of what I suspect are going to be much worse inflation figures in the next few months  But I  don’t want the federal funds rate to go above 5 percent very quickly, and I really don’t want it, as     4/20/76 - 46 -           I see it now, to go above 5-1/4 percent--which I think is expressed in your specifications--before  the next meeting  At least not without a lot more information than I have now  So in that sense  I’m not sure I’m very different from their comments     I do think we have a technical problem with the Treasury financing, perhaps  I would like  to see the market [unintelligible], if we’re going to go up, lead us up on the basis of some of the  aggregates  But if we’re going to move, we probably will have to move pretty quickly to get in  front of the Treasury financing, and we may be left with the choice of making a very small step  now, let’s say 4-7/8, and not doing anything almost regardless of what the aggregates are doing  until we get pretty well into May    That’s right  No, I don’t think this is inconsistent with  what we’re saying, but I’m almost saying you may want to take that step even if the market isn’t  leading right at the moment    The [one-]eighth move, that’s right    Almost regardless of what happens in the aggregates      Biases you to moving, but then I want to constrain how  far you move    Well, I want to be pretty reluctant to get to 5-1/4    It doesn’t in our projections  As a matter of fact, it  biases it the other way, but on the Board’s projections--    Isn’t the problem, Mr Chairman, not that you’re  comparing [the expanded Record of Policy Actions] with [the Memorandum of Discussion]  that’s only available after five years, but you’re comparing [the expanded Record of Policy  Actions] with their hope or expectation that it’s going to be available almost immediately  And  [unintelligible] they may lose on that, but they’re not intending to lose, therefore, they may feel  that we’re being even more secretive    I feel this is the issue here, in a sense  I have no  sentimental or nostalgic attachment to the [Memorandum of Discussion], and it seems to me I  can live without it very easily  The only question in my mind is whether, on balance, it helps or  hurts us in terms of basically defending ourselves in the present situation, when we may be  subject to the accusation--as nice a face as you try to put on it, we are hiding more than we are  revealing against the hope and expectation that they get the policy    Where would something get reported, if at all, when it  comes to, let’s say, rather informal guidance to the Manager about how the federal funds rate  might be handled over time within the framework of the formal decision as to what the range is  for the aggregates or for the federal funds rate itself?     4/20/76 - 61 -            If the Committee did not report it in the policy record--is  that what it’s called?--it would be your thought that this would be one of these things appearing  in the other Memoranda    It wouldn’t appear in either place    It wouldn’t appear in either place; either in the  Memoranda--if that course was chosen    Mr Holland’s suggestion seems to me a very neat way  of handling the problem, in making the Record of Policy Actions an appendix to the formal  minutes    I just want to clarify one point  I think it’s the whole  thrust of this when you talk about 30 days--we mean after the following meeting      In terms of this talking in general of 30 days, in reading  your memorandum, you meant after the following meeting, which typically, or often, is more  than 30 days    And at the level of principle, do you find objectionable  the principle that it would be released as soon as possible or as soon as feasible following the  next meeting?    Yes, that’s what I would think would be natural  But in  the substantive--     Let me just make my substantive point  It seems to me  it would be a bit of a confusion to have this record of the past actions coming just before the  Committee is meeting again  It kind of gets people excited about what last month’s policy was  on the eve of the new policy     4/20/76 - 72 -             Well, the information in any sense is distorted anyway   You would have always had another meeting before this is released  That’s the object of  delaying      The fact that there is a meeting is always reported?  And  if we had a telephone meeting and we have reached [no] decision in your terms, you just note  that there’s been a meeting with no discussion at all?    Just to return to the same question of the intermeeting   It seems to me the general choice one has is, one either reports the interim meetings before the  next full meeting in the policy record--is that the right term?--which comes out immediately after  the next full meeting or almost immediately after, or you wait a month and report it with the  second meeting  We can go one way or the other       5/18/76 - 12 -         I feel a little bit uncomfortable, although I think it would arise very rarely if we did have an  intermeeting just before our regular meeting  What’s the point of delaying the report on the  regular meeting--since it probably pretty much validated what you did at the intermeeting--why  delay that a whole month?  It seems a little inconsistent if we feel that there is some point in  delaying the report basically a month  I suppose you could split the difference by saying you’re  going to report on any intermeeting that takes place 20 days before the release, or something like  that  So, once it got near the next meeting [it] would be [in] the following report then--    I think that’s right, it would arise very rarely    I’ll make the motion if that’s what you’re waiting on    You said 12 to 15 percent in real terms    No, it’s not unprecedented, but it just doesn’t seem to be  in line with these surveys and so forth    Oh, mid-’77  Okay     5/18/76 - 25 -          I think you said mid-’76  Could I fall [back] from this  pace just a second, Mr Chairman?  In reconciling these various views, [we] certainly have some  of the same instincts and hear some of the same reports that John Balles does  You just asked  Lyle, he states a kind of basic forced pressure from the wage side, of 5-1/2 percent or so  And  [he] concluded that the overall price performance ought to be at about that [rate], and I’m trying  to explore for a minute how you get to that conclusion  I mean assume for a moment the 5-1/2  percent is [correct] on the wage side     The unit labor cost, not the wages themselves, although  even there I tend to think it may be higher than that, but we are talking in a fairly narrow range   But you do see materials prices rising  The fuel thing, partly [depends] upon OPEC, I suppose,  but it’s not going to be as good as it’s been, presumably    Even if OPEC did nothing  You do, I think, see some  evidence of this desire to expand profit margins in an economic environment where that will  become possible  All these modifications to the basic unit labor cost kind of calculation would  seem to [give] a plus to the [unit labor cost] numbers  We’re just wondering why you didn’t  arrive at that conclusion    Where are you putting it?     5/18/76 - 26 -         SPEAKER(?)  [Unintelligible]    One other question on the unit labor cost itself  How do  you appraise what’s going on in wages now?  Are they tending to rise with a more rapid rate?     Well, I’d like to make just one more comment on this  price matter  Irrespective of whether most of the directors around the system are right or  wrong--they may be wrong, I’m not sure--but even if they are [wrong], the fact that they believe  that there is going to be a resurgence of inflation could be an important element in how they  behave both with regard to inventory policy and capital expenditure policy  And that kind of  business psychology is something that perhaps you ought to take into account in terms of the  outlook    But capital expenditure plans have picked up strongly  this year, as you know    But I don’t feel that a businessman would react to a firm  expectation of prices accelerating by expanding inventory and capital spending  I think they may  react by saying this will bring in another recession      No--from the viewpoint of an ex-Treasury official, I  think your comment is well-justified--even going back a few years  But I find Mr Partee’s  comments may be subject to a little different interpretation, anyway as I read the record here     We did discuss this a bit at the meeting last week  And what was interesting about this  past month, it seems to me, is, in part, that action was taken almost on the eve of a Treasury  financing and very shortly thereafter  I think the Committee did suggest that some account be  taken of the Treasury financing itself, with the implication that one doesn’t act very vigorously  right during the very days that this rather complex operation is going forward  Unusual in that  sense, but looked at in a broader prospective, it seems to me that this operation went on during  the month with the minimal necessary consideration for the actual financing operation during the  particular days when it took place     If they needed the $5 bill to go to the grocery store,  they’d replenish the $5  It doesn’t come out of money in checking accounts if they are really  hoarding it    Well, I don’t know that I have very much to add at this  point  My reasoning on the federal funds rate is very similar to what has been expressed by Mr  Mayo and yourself  I could visualize going above 5-3/4 percent, but I wouldn’t want to do it  without another crack at it in some kind of a meeting, so I’m happy with that upper limit and the  general specification     I share, for some of the same reasons and maybe some additional reasons, Bob Mayo’s  feeling that you’ve set the ranges [for the monetary aggregates] a little on the low side  The  additional reason would be we’ve recently set long-term targets, and I don’t see any reason to  deviate from them very far  I would kind of straddle that basic target that we have on M1, and  we probably have to adjust M2 a little lower relative to M1 for technical reasons  So I came out  about 6 to 10 in my own mind for--    Six to 10 for the M2 number and the same as we had last  month, 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 for M1, or 4 to 8, which straddles pretty much the long-term target In  either event, I would think that we are talking about moving the federal funds rate by at least  one-eighth now, and maybe one-fourth, certainly contemplating it may go to 5-3/4, but I don’t  want to make any judgment about going beyond that  So the crucial thing, I guess, is that upper  limit on the federal funds rate, so we can pause and take another look before we exceed that     But I would expect some tightening here  It seems to me appropriate for the reasons you  mentioned [regarding] the general economic climate, including the fact that some people are  going to be concerned when the exceptionally good price moves that we had in the first quarter  are dissipated, as I think is inevitable in the short run at least     5/18/76 - 42 -          The Board’s estimate is 7-1/2    May I raise a question or comment along that line, Mr  Chairman--7-1/2 does seem to me unduly constraining, but I would not worry  I say that partly  because I still feel quite uncertain about where these numbers are going to go, and we’re very  much influenced by this big April figure  If you look back, we were right on target with the  December longer-term projections we had because we were running low  So it depends  somewhat upon the perspective [from which] one looks at these     The 7-1/2 percent seems all right to me if, indeed, we’re not going to go above 5-3/4  percent in the federal funds rate  I have a little trouble expressing a preference on it without  knowing what the upper limit of the funds rate is because I think that, with a 6 percent federal  funds rate, this would very likely carry us to 6, and I don’t really want to go there soon      Right, right    With slightly higher aggregates    I guess so, I prefer    Yeah, I had my hand up, but only because I think the  funds rate is more important than the aggregates    Well, let me just try tentatively--maybe there’s no  sentiment for it--I’d prefer the aggregates more like you have them in B and the funds rate the  way you have it in A     5/18/76 - 51 -         SPEAKER(?)  So do I, and I’m not voting    Well, I’ll say--    Right--4 to 8 for M1, 6 to 10 for M2 [or] 5-1/2 to 9-1/2,  I’m not going to fight about that difference, and 5 to 5-3/4 for the funds rate  So make M2  whichever way you want it     Well, I don’t know That’s the simplest way, I think--    Right    Depends on how you want to run your program    He would understand that the presumption would be our  current projections; it would be a small move right now     We could have counsel of our own, Mr Chairman, and I  would hope that they would be involved in this process    I don’t have any disagreement with the general pattern  of the remarks that have been made, and, too, I’m not terribly concerned over this hesitancy in  the economy, although in our own projections I guess we have it a little greater than the Board’s  staff does     I do remain concerned over the sluggishness of business investment  As we look ahead,  I’m a little less optimistic than the staff projections there  And I’m also disturbed over the  Gramley view of inflation, which is widely shared I’m sure, but I do think there is some  possibility of making some further progress on inflation as expansion proceeds, and we ought to  do what we can to facilitate it  And that leaves me with somewhat opposite prescriptions of  wanting to boost business investment but at the same time wanting to be very cautious on the  inflationary side, which leaves me right in the middle where the rest of you have been  [unintelligible]     I would be very reluctant, however to see the actual fed funds rate go above 5-3/4 or below  5-1/4, so I’d be perfectly happy with that specification  I do share Mr Mayo’s feeling that we  would be better off with a 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent M1 figure  In addition to the reasons that he  presented, which I think are valid, I would note that in New York, we have a lower projection of  the M1 figure that would be right at the lower end of the 4 to 8 percent range  So I would rather  pick up the [alternative] C specification there of 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 and leave the [alternative] B  specification for the M2 number  But that’s a very small modification of the proposal you made  and is directly in line with Mr Mayo’s proposal   I think it is a good idea     I just wanted to clarify one question on which I think  you have already expressed a judgment  It seems to me that a very pragmatic question of great  principle is at stake  As near as I can see, we made a pragmatic judgment with good and  sufficient reasons  We ought to dispense with this [discussion]  The only new thing that has  entered in is a congressional complaint     Pragmatically, I would say, if the [congressional] committees are going to be upset, we  would have to retreat if it got to the point of a [congressional] committee action  I think I  wouldn’t want to [before then]  Your judgment is, as I understand it, that this is far from a  matter of great concern to the [congressional] committee; it really looks like these two people are  not going to go further  So we’re not going to have to [unintelligible] in the future  And if this is  all the complaint we have, there’s no reason that I would agree with that  If indeed that is the  correct judgment--    You’ve got to be incited    [Unintelligible]    How much help does a fellow like that get  [unintelligible]?    If I may just supplement that, Mr Chairman, this is the  same point that I was going to raise  We have had a fairly sharp decline in the full-employment  deficit, and it levels off awhile, according to the projection, and then you get another decline and  a movement into the surplus    The figure is bigger than that for the previous--    No, the surplus is tiny when you get to a surplus--    Well, this is basically my question now, what  significance Mr Gramley attached to that--    No    I think that my impression is that the newspaper’s pretty  faithful in reporting it this way, too, but I think you are up against the fact that the only news is  the latest week’s figure, and that is what they look at on the ticker on Thursday afternoon or  whenever it comes out, unless it’s in the headlines    Mr Chairman, as often is the case, we have somewhat  mixed signals before us in a number of respects  In terms of a business outlook, I find myself  wishing to believe the staff forecast of prices, and maybe that we can do it, but I am a bit  skeptical of whether the outlook is that good  And on the other hand, I share some of Mr  Eastburn’s skepticism about the plant and equipment side of things  And hearing so much talk  along those lines from businessmen, I don’t have great fears that the business situation is going  to run away with us on the up side     In the light of all that--and in very general terms I’m not very eager to make changes  now--but if I convert that into a short-run interest rate kind of feeling, I wouldn’t want to make  any aggressive changes in the federal funds rate  But you were talking about long-term targets  on monetary aggregates, and the problem here is the one that you mentioned  We start with this  high base, and I’m left a little bit with the feeling that if we don’t change M1, we have in fact  eased  I’m not terribly happy about that prospect, and I think it’s of some significance  I realize  that, if you go back over a longer period, you can say we have not [eased] because we undershot  in the previous two quarters  The only difference is, I was happy about the undershooting and  I’m not so happy about the overshooting, so I do think this is a bit of a problem     My own reconciliation of this is that we ought to lower the M1 ranges a shade on the  presumption that this could be explained as not a significant change in policy or any change in  policy at all from what we arrived at last time because we do start from a higher base  I do share  the third point that I think you made, that you don’t want to give any real signal of a change in  policy, and if I thought this was going to be interpreted as a real tightening, I wouldn’t be very  happy about it       7/19-20/76 - 53 -   So I guess what I would still like to do is get some shading in the M1 figure in the context  of your April explanation that this is no real change and that we are adjusting for the overshoot   To some extent that would be only a partial adjustment in the first quarter  I’m consistent with  not wanting to make a very great change in M2 and M3; I will be content with their ranges as  they are because I think the major problem here is in M1     Now you’ve kind of reversed that in the context of the long-range objective, in which [you  express a concern] I certainly share, that we’ve got to get these things down  I’m left not feeling  very strongly about which way we do it but I do feel we ought to get something down I guess  my preference would still be M1 on the presumption that you could explain this quite reasonably  in terms of the change in the base, and if you think you can’t do that, I am somewhat affected in  my own judgment    Well, this is, I think, a relevant question, and I think it  bears upon my own judgment here, but I think in general terms that’s where I come out      I know  If I may just interject a question in here that I  think lies behind this  Were you happy or unhappy with the overshoots or undershoots?  And I  happen to be happy with the earlier undershoots  If we had not had the overshoot last quarter, in  fact to an extreme we had an undershoot, would Governor Partee, consistent with his position, be  in favor of raising the ranges now?    No, I understand but, consistent with your position, I  think you would have to get a higher range    I’m reasonably content if we are going to reduce some  of them     7/19-20/76 - 59 -    Let me make a comment in general  I wouldn’t be  inclined to dissent for this one  I would be perfectly happy to have a discussion that reflected  some of the varying considerations, but the actual vote somehow puts you in a more rigid  position than maybe the discussion in this particular case justifies  So I can see some advantage  in not having a vote, but the particular reasons cited [for not having a vote] don’t seem any more  persuasive to me than to Governor Partee     7/19-20/76 - 61 -    I’d start the other way around on interest rates, as I guess  you did, and I preface my comment with a note that our own projections in New York of the  aggregates are lower than the Board’s, as they were last time  Last time, reality, of course, came  out lower than both by a considerable margin, but against the longer-range background, I  wouldn’t like to see the federal funds rate going down to 4-3/4 percent, and unless things really  went haywire, I wouldn’t particularly like to see it go below the 5-1/4 that we are at now  A  range of 5 to 5-3/4 might summarize the view; it puts the midpoint a little above 5-1/4    The ranges [for the aggregates], I feel a little bit trapped  with [them]  We just set some long-term ranges, which we are below, so you could argue the  logic is to let them go up a little bit in the short-run to get within the ranges we just established  I  would not press the logic--not having agreed with putting the range that I would prefer,  something like [in alternative ] C, which spreads the long-term range that we have  And it  doesn’t make it quite so likely that we would be pushing interest rates further down for a  temporary period  So I would [favor] something like the C ranges on aggregates  And more of a  downward constraint in the federal funds rate; and a money market directive    I’d like to throw a suggestion in that I was tempted to  make last time on precisely this point, and I’m rather sorry I didn’t, in retrospect  The way you  weigh M1 [relative to] M2 is somewhat troublesome  But it seems to me that, in some  circumstances, and this may be one of them, one way of approaching it would be to say you  don’t move to the extremes unless you get confirmation in both these measures  That if M1 or  M2 went above or below the range, that in itself wouldn’t push you to action until it’s confirmed  by the other moving in the same way  Last time, I guess we had M1 going below the range  whereas M2 stuck within it, and in fact was above the midpoints    Yes, revived toward the end, I agree  For a while it was  below the middle--    It was never out of it  For a while it was low, and then it  actually got back in the high side of the range    The middle range--    I agree with all the sentiment you’re expressing, and I  guess I think it’s less mechanical than doing it the other way, on occasion, leaving some  discretion to the Desk at the same time  I feel you get kind of a mechanical averaging here  which may not always be suitable to the--     Oh, I think either way, that’s--    I don’t profess any great knowledge of the behavior    Because maybe you get shifts between the two, as we  had said at ample length this morning  You know, how do you interpret it when one’s going in  one direction and the other in the other direction?  Is an arithmetic average really better?    Frustration’s built up    Well, I have the same feeling  I’d just add to that, Mr  Chairman, that I think, inevitably, whether we like it or not, we give a pretty strong signal if we  move by more than a quarter here in either direction  And the market is going to interpret it as a  strong signal, and I don’t think this is the time for strong signals    Seems to me we lose a little sight, Mr Chairman, of the  one thing we are sure of--which is that these aggregates in this short-run perspective move very  erratically  You haven’t got any idea whether they are going to the upper end of the range or the  lower end  They’re likely to break one or the other     I don’t take all of the discussion of the so-called pause in  business as indicative of an emerging long pause or recession along the lines that everybody  seems to agree upon this morning  But I do take it as resolving some doubts in my mind [about]  a real booming picture in the economy in the next year, either in actuality or in psychology  I am  less concerned than I was a few months ago about shortages and bottlenecks arising in the next  12 months  I’m less worried about it for various reasons, first in the general price level  I can’t  believe the unemployment figures month to month, but we know that after a year of recovery  they’re pretty darn high  And I’m still not entirely convinced by the investment outlook  So I  put this all together, and it’s clear you can make a case for a little bit of easing  I don’t feel  strongly about that case     My concern is that, when I look at alternative B, it still leaves me with the possibility that  in the face of this situation, we could have a substantial rise in the federal funds rate in the next  month  I feel a bit at the mercy of what happens to the aggregates in that respect, and I don’t like  it  In fact, I think that would be a signal in the wrong direction  I’m not bothered by the ranges  in the aggregates in alternative B  In fact the New York projections for this particular period are  a bit below the Board’s projection, which gives maybe some feeling of comfort that the rise in  the aggregates will not be so high as to trigger a sizable increase in the federal funds rate  But  still, taken literally, it leaves me quite uncomfortable to be at the whim of how these statistics  come in and to [possibly] find myself with a 5-3/4 percent federal funds rate two or three weeks  from now     To sum up my feelings, in the old days I would say we ought to conduct ourselves so that,  if we err, it’s a bit on the side of ease  I feel that way in spirit, but how you put [that spirit] in  [terms of] these kinds of constraints, I’m not quite sure  But I guess I’d rather see that federal  funds rate at something like 4-3/4 percent to 5-1/2 percent without any implication that it be  changed now  We [admittedly] skew the thing a bit, but I don’t like the possibility that, in the  face of all that is going on in the real economy, we end up with a 5-3/4 percent federal funds rate     My substantial feelings about the situation have been  pretty well expressed by Mr Balles, I think, and his repeated allusion to erring on the side of  ease, if we make any change at all  I don’t feel any strong need for changing interest rates, and  the kind of bands that you proposed for the aggregates are all right with me     My concern--to express it opposite, I guess, to the way Mr Balles did--would be  increasing the federal funds rate very readily, and that’s what bothers me about a range of the  federal funds rate from 4-3/4 to 5-3/4  I really don’t look at moving down in the same way I  would look at moving up at this stage of the game, given the degree of sluggishness there has  been in the economy  How to handle that problem within the framework of the mode of  operation that we have isn’t quite clear to me  I’m inclined to say we ought to have a range of  4-3/4 to 5-1/2 without moving the rate right now--not moving it at all unless we began moving  outside these aggregate ranges  But whether that kind of asymmetrical approach makes sense to  other people--[it’s] not quite rational, I don’t think, but it expresses my feeling about where we  should be with the aggregates    Well, I will leave that as a rational proposal and I--    Well, I’m not sure about that    I’m not sure I fully appreciate all the implications of  what Governor Coldwell was saying  At times he seemed to be saying things that I agreed with,  and at times he seemed symmetrical and certainly with larger federal funds movements in fact  than I think we want to see at this point    No    Or you can go the other [way] and say why confirm it at  all    I was surprised to hear we did this, as a matter of fact    Well, this does say they respond to news media, which I  assume means it can be published for all    Well, I don’t really know why we do it at all    We publish weekly    I must say, Mr Chairman, I find their argument in this  particular point somewhat more persuasive than you do  Maybe I’m more conscious of the  frailties of human beings in responding to the pressures that I suspect would arise     But I mainly wanted to say, I found these couple of paragraphs that you referred to,  beginning at the bottom of 7 and 8 and going to the top of 9, interesting and to the point in the  light of discussion we should be having, and have repeatedly referred to here, about our  operating techniques  I think there are some problems that we’ve all been restive about, but  they’re not very easy to handle, as this suggests, in my opinion, and this does raise some points  that we have to consider carefully     Well, I think there was a fair degree of harmony  displayed  That’s the only thing that surprised me, in a way, even among the LDCs [less  developed countries] in terms of not pushing for unrealistic assistance programs  I was  impressed by the degree to which they didn’t seem to object to the relatively hard line  [conveyed] from the United States to other countries  These are the financial representatives of  the LDCs and not the political representatives      The advantage of coming late, Mr Chairman, is that the  observations that one was going to make have already been pretty well made  Mr Guffey’s  comments remind me--I think it’s a fact that the slowdown in personal income has probably been  more directly related to the slowdown in agricultural income than anything else in the last couple  of months  Is that correct?      I was going to make some observations on the  international situation, which we really covered pretty completely between Governors Wallich,  Partee, and yourself  Let me just add that I think the most critical country is certainly Germany,  which was not mentioned, and, there, things seem to be moving a bit sluggishly  The sense one  has is that, if anything, they are going to tighten up a bit because they don’t like the growth in  their aggregates, which poses a bit of a problem, particularly in terms of the vulnerabilities of the  exchange rate, which I wouldn’t like to see further upset at this point--it’s just an additional  complication in our own policymaking     In the UK situation, it does seem to me that things in the production sense will get worse  before they get better  It is almost inevitable in their situation  I’m not so sure we can absorb so  much more of these deficits very easily  I’m just not sure it’s going to work out that way      10/19/76 - 25 -   Particularly with our exchange rate being as weak as it is and with production here slowing  down, it only points up the vulnerability of the international financial situation    With respect to the LDCs, it’s going to be hard as hell for them to cut down on their  deficits and therefore cut down on their external borrowing, which is already too high  It’s an  additional real financial and economic risk in this situation, as I see it  So the stakes get raised  all around     One point that I would make that I don’t think has been commented on may be fairly  obvious  I think part of the more depressed mood that seems to be rather general around this  table and in the economy is partly related to the oncoming election  People are not terribly  happy with the way that campaign has developed, to say the least  Which raises at least the  possibility that, whoever gets elected, people may feel a little better after November 2nd   Feeling that uncertainty is behind them, in the little sense that maybe some more coherent  program or policies will be emerging  I don’t know if that’s true, but I do think that part of the  throes of uncertainty is fairly directly related to the malaise in the political environment     None of this tells me very directly what to do in terms of policy, and I also want to raise a  question Mr Eastburn made and Mr Gramley commented upon  My first instinct would be that  the economy needs a further push that might more efficiently [come] through the tax avenue   But that might not be a very realistic way of getting it, under all the circumstances, very  promptly anyway, given political [unintelligible]  We could be basically dealing with the kinds  of structural confidence problem that are commonly found, which raises some question about  any of the traditional knee-jerk kinds of reactions      What are the elements of these based upon?      There’s another factor here that seems to be moving in  the same direction, suggesting the effective increase in money supply has been bigger than it  looks naked  I can’t believe myself it hasn’t had some impact  The outstanding characteristic of  this advance [unintelligible], so far is the banking world is concerned, is the lack of loan  demands  And when you look at this whole [unintelligible] of expansion, I can’t believe that this  has not significantly reduced the increase in compensating balances for loan demand to what is  typical in earlier [unintelligible] deposits measured, but it seems to me it must have had some  significant effect      In that figure that you--     I don’t know how you measure it, but I just can’t believe  this  The expansion is [unintelligible] component, it’s from our advance--     Well, I basically am in full agreement with the kind of  philosophy that you expressed for both the short and long run  And I come up with the same  federal funds range that you specified  I thought this worked out rather well last time in terms of  sneaking in a little easing but not doing it very abruptly  I still think it is premature right now,  given not only our economic conditions but also this time on the calendar, to give a really strong  signal of easing, but I think it’s appropriate to go in that direction  So, within that general  specification, I would have some preference for the kind of asymmetrical treatment that we gave  it last month, but that’s perhaps marginal     I do think the ranges that you have specified [for the monetary aggregates] just strike me as  being a bit on the high side  I worry about that M2 range, for instance, which is not quite, but  almost, entirely above the long-term range--a13 percent figures in the shop window, so to speak,  worries me a bit  So I would be inclined to, say, knock 1/2 percentage point off of those  numbers, so it would be 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 [for M1] and either 8 to 12 or 8-1/2 to 12-1/2 [for M2],  but these are pretty small differences      Only slightly on the M2, they are significantly above it  on the M1      That worries me a bit, but I suppose I am most  impressed when you talk about these ranges, and Mr Axilrod’s very trenchant comments in  general  The most trenchant one of all seems to me the clause that he began with, and that you  can begin almost every one of these meetings with  “Contrary to the staff expectations”      “…Ml and M2 did thus and so”  In fact, I think you can  make the case for widening this range, so this is the ground that we’ve gone through before  If  you had said 4 to 9, I’d be happy  But I’m just worried about those ranges being a little on the  high side given all--    Yes, I’m worried about the M2 figure being too high  when you say 13      Well, now, I’m just thinking in my mind, but if I really  had my druthers, I’d say, I guess, 4-1/2 to 9 [for M1] and 8 to 12 for M2      I’m more concerned about the federal funds  specifications  I think that does reflect the kind of approach that I’d like to see here      I’ve just been listening around the table this afternoon,  Mr Chairman, and I do think there’s a little Ml myopia  When I look at all these things, you  didn’t go quite far enough according to the different ways of drawing these things  Going  backward, it does seem to me going on the high side of M2 and very much on the high side in  M3 in terms of longer-term targets; we are on the low side of M1       10/19/76 - 48 -   When I look at the economics of these different things, M2 over a considerable period  doesn’t make much sense to me  I could never see the distinction between the savings deposits  at commercial banks and savings deposits elsewhere  It’s very convenient to use in the short run   Those proxies should move together anyway, but looking over a longer period, the M3 numbers,  which are more meaningful to me alongside the Ml ones, are really pretty high, and it concerns  me     I think we have both a technical and economic problem here, as has been advised, with the  [broader] Ms coming out higher relative to the Ml figure than people have expected, and that  should be corrected if we have a chance to correct it because it will probably persist at the  current level of interest rates  When I put that together with the economic problem, it seems to  me that all these specifications have lots of room for increasing any of the aggregates as much as  I’d like to see them increased over the next year, almost regardless of business activity  If  business really slacked off, these numbers, as they are, imply a very easy money market  situation--extremely; you would probably have trouble making these figures      Well, the Ml, that’s right, the discrepancy will increase  even more      So taking all these things into consideration and  considering the long-range objective of moving them down--and they do still seem high to me in  a secular way--given all the technical arguments you’ve made about Ml, to which I’d add the  compensating balance thing, I very much like the idea of moving down the M1 figure  I had  actually thought of moving down the lower end of the range rather the upper, so that nobody  would raise questions about it if pressures did go the other way  We’d be committed to continue  for a while, but I’d take either one and be perfectly happy with what you suggested     Reluctantly, but in recognition of the technical problem, I could conceive, if we went down  in M1 slightly, going up on the others equally slightly and getting some balance the same way, if  someone attached great importance, as obviously some do, to the announcement effects  I think  that is of some importance, but since it runs a little contrary to what I would like to do in  substance, I guess I would swallow the announcement effect  And I think we can get by with it  safely enough without moving the M2 and M3 up, even though I think it could be justified  technically, in moving the M1 down a little on the basis you suggested  I would hate to see a  general movement upward in these things, but it seems to me precisely in the opposite direction  you want to go, and we’re already too high in the long-range perspective      Can I interject another time and make an assertion, and  the staff can tell me I’m wrong--or somebody else  My memory is that previous changes in the  long-range targets have been so small that that there’s almost no announcement effect  I don’t  recall the market recoiling in horror or praise in any of these announcements       I don’t think I have anything to add specific to the  Mexican situation other than reiterate a comment that has already been made, that Mexico is  basically a country that could manage the situation if they are able to economically  It should be  a manageable situation  I do think what we’re seeing here is the symptom of general strains and  tensions around the world that are going to be difficult to manage  They will be difficult in this  case, they may be difficult in other cases, and I feel very strongly there is nothing we can walk  away from     And we will be called upon from time to time for this kind of difficult operation in  Mexico--maybe there won’t be any others, but I suspect there could be  It seems to me to be a  very modest kind of effort on our part  It’s got some risks, but the risks are limited in view of the  risks from the situation not being managed correctly  I think we need to exert a little leverage  here  A little help from us from time to time, and this is a manifestation of it    My reaction is the same yours, Mr Chairman  There’s  no distinction basically between the executive committee meeting and our regular board meeting  in the Bank  If there are not enough directors there, we have an executive committee meeting,  and I think we would leave irregular gaps that would just raise questions    Well, the important thing to protect here is the  attachments to the minutes--in our case, they’re very long minutes and they include a great many  sensitive, as well as a great many dull, things    The trouble is, he’s got a big enough staff so one of  them could make this his personal interest    One short preliminary question with respect to the  wholesale price index in particular  My impression is that that has been decidedly affected by  some fuel prices, including gas prices, in the last couple of months, where there have been some  administrative decisions  Is that correct or incorrect?    That was my impression, and that explains some of the  seeming puzzle, I think  But in general, my comments are very much parallel to those of Mr  Baughman, I think  What I find in all the areas that he has mentioned, Mr Chairman, is  substantial uncertainty  It’s not so much that people are outright gloomy as that they feel  substantially more uncertain about things than they did earlier, whether you are talking about  retail sales or investment--where they were never very optimistic, particularly on our board of  directors, anyway--and the price thing seems a little inexplicable to some of them under the  circumstances     In terms of the outlook, I just want to emphasize the point that he really concluded on   Some of this uncertainty--to some degree, I suppose, a more restrained outlook--is related to  concern about inflation itself  And the uncertainty is particularly emphasized by the coming to  office of the new Administration that we don’t feel so sure about, and some concern that an  increase in inflationary pressures will eventually [emerge] that will not be healthy for our own  investment plans or for the economy in general  So while the uncertainty is there, the policy  implications of the uncertainty are not all that clear in terms of that concern about relaxing on the  inflation front    I’d rather trade being the last speaker for some other  things you gave me    So I could pronounce the benediction, maybe I should   The advantage of coming last, of course, is that everything you agree with has already been said,  but a few things you may not agree with have been said too, so you’re still forced to say  something     One way or another, we’ve all been talking about how we can sustain a more satisfactory  pace of economic expansion next year  And I would just say, as a preliminary to the comment  on monetary policy, that [as] I look at the situation, and following some of the analysis that  Governors Partee and Wallich had earlier, the case becomes stronger for some fiscal action in  terms of weaknesses and personal income and declines in savings rates and feedback effects we  may be getting on the rest of the economy  I do [think] that case is growing [stronger], and I  suspect we may get some [fiscal action]  I hope it’s not of a rebate type, for the reasons you  suggested, Mr Chairman  I once testified that I thought it was a bad precedent when it was done  by a Republican Administration before--this idea that you just give away the money without any  relation [to] a tax burden itself  It doesn’t seem to me to be very helpful     But in that context, we have the question of monetary policy at the moment and how these  two fit together  And partly for the reasons that Mr Roos has just described and that you  described earlier, I think, it should be a measured move and not a feeling that we are now  embarking on a rather aggressive course of ease  And I quantify that, in my mind, anyway, that  through open market operations, I wouldn’t want to see the federal funds rate pushed down by  something like 1/2 percentage point, prospectively, over this next month, based upon what I  know now  I don’t particularly want to see it pushed down 1/4 percentage point right away  On  the other side of it, I share the view of those who don’t want to see it go above 5 percent, either   I think that would give entirely the wrong signal at the moment     On the particular questions that you asked about liquidity, I don’t think there is any certain  answer  Frank Morris has spoken my piece about that  I think, really, it’s all relative to what  you want  The kind of action that I would talk about isn’t going to produce any very substantial  change in liquidity anyway  But I think what we are looking for is a little encouragement for  long-term financing and a little encouragement perhaps to [get] some of the longer-term rates  down a bit to help the investment and housing side of the economy  And that point has already  been made     I end up on the open market side of the thing--right about where you began all this, Mr  Chairman, with the focus on the federal funds rate--contrary, I guess, to what some other people  have said  What I don’t quite understand is why we emphasize the aggregates at this particular  time, a point I want to pick up in a second  It seems to me this is a time when we are particularly  sensitive to what the federal funds rate is doing, and I came in with the kind of spread that you  suggested, of 4-1/2 to 5-1/4  I don’t really want to use the upper quarter of that, but I would  move to 4-7/8, and pretty promptly here, based upon what we know now  I really don’t want to  go down to 4-1/2 either, as I suggested earlier  So I’m symmetrical in the sense of not wanting  to use either side of the range, but get a little easing pretty promptly       11/16/76 - 45 -           So far as the aggregates ranges are concerned, I should point out I don’t attach any great  weight to any of these estimates, but the New York Bank estimates for some reason are  substantially lower this time than the Board estimates, which are already, at least in M1, fairly  low  Partly that seems to be for reasons--they don’t believe the seasonal, and they think we may  be entering a period where, without reflecting any basic weakness, we may be running into some  fairly low M1 figures and M2 figures relative to what we’ve been having--and really  significantly lower than the Board’s projection  Well, I don’t know what importance to attribute  to that, except it lends a little weight to Mr Partee’s feeling  They may come in on the low side  rather than the high side  It is a reason why, consistent with my feelings about interest rates, I’d  like the [alternative] B specification; and I thought the M2 one was a little high, as you did, Mr  Chairman, relative to our longer-term objectives  I was prepared to suggest even a percentage  point lower there  You suggested a 1/2 percentage point lower  I’m perfectly content with that   I do get a bit frightened as to the public reaction in terms of our general posture if we begin  publishing 10 to 14 percent figures after the rate of growth that we have had there     One of the objects of the strategy we ought to have now--and this is where the discount  rate comes in--is to, in a sense, [jawbone] institutions  I’m not sure they’re right on the edge--as  much on the edge as I would like to see them--but I think there is some possibility of getting a  reduction in the administered deposit rates here  And a discount rate change could help in that  connection by putting our own feelings in the matter a little bit more out in the open  I think the  time has come for a change in the discount rate  I even find the arguments rather persuasive for  going 1/2 on technical and other grounds, if, in fact, the open market policy was as moderate as I  am suggesting  If we gave a much louder signal to open market operations, as some people have  suggested, I guess I would want to mute the signal on the discount rate  And I think the other  combination might be a little more helpful--not really go overboard on the open market  operations but bring the discount rate more into line with where the federal funds rate is in fact     It seems to me a more logical combination of moves, but I still find myself with a  somewhat open mind about whether that should be 1/4 or 1/2  But in any case, the effort here,  and I think the major contribution we can make, is providing a little incentive to get some of  these interest rates down without really drastically changing our policy and without arousing  fears that we are going overboard with increasing the liquidity of the economy against the  prospect of a possible tax decrease shortly following  I think there is some real danger of  overdoing it, in fact, and maybe more so psychologically in terms of the balance of concern  about inflation and expansion      My question about this whole thing, Mr Chairman,  would be, obviously there’s very little difference in these ranges, whether you move them up or  down 1/2 percentage point on paper  But I am looking at at least one set of projections that says  we’re going to come straight in under the low point anyway, as it is  Now, I don’t know what  the reliability of these projections are, but what happens--    Do you go to 4-1/2, is what I’m asking, under those  conditions?  Fairly readily, that’s a--     We now just publish in a narrative form    Which changes from meeting to meeting, depending  upon--    It gives you November 12    It looks to me like it’s in the November 12, the sentence  that he’s referring to, and also the 14    I have one question of interpretation, Mr Chairman  At  the top of page 4, the first sentence in [point] 4  It says, “It shall be the practice to arrange with  foreign central banks for the coordination”  I don’t question this desirable practice, and I hope  that it’s done in all but exceptional cases, but I can imagine there’s an exceptional case where we  want to do something that’s not in coordination with a foreign country  They may not want to  operate, and I interpret this to mean that [their unwillingness would not necessarily be  accommodated]    I would be happy, I think, if you put in “normal” or  “usual practice”  I think something like that would be--    I don’t think so    If I understand the negotiating history here, it’s better  not to have an explicit understanding of what the words mean    To put it rather rudely, it seems to me, Mr Chairman,  that the object of this first sentence is not to constrain us in doing something that we are likely to  want to do in our own mind, sometime in the future  It doesn’t do that, as I understand, so  therefore it’s acceptable    Also, I suppose there’s an element of protection here,  going to the authorization, in that word “collaboration” we talked about--little chance of the  Chairman doing anything absolutely on his own    Well, I’ll make a brief comment just following up  Governor Partee before I get around to my question  I recognize from instinct that goes toward  the broader aggregates, but I really wonder, in line with Mr Axilrod’s earlier comment, whether  they’re broad enough when you get a situation where you may be moving out of the market  liquid assets, in or out of those particular institutional numbers     The question I had--Mr Axilrod touched upon [it] at the end of his previous comment, but  I’m not sure what I [unintelligible]  My impression was that both December and January were  probably the two most erratic months by some fairly clear margin  And you, I guess, suggested  that they are erratic, or at least that it wasn’t all that clear and pronounced [unintelligible]    Well, that’s more my memory that it’s far more trouble  than even [unintelligible]    Mr MacLaury said he wasn’t going to be very  controversial, and I don’t think he has been controversial, but I’d like to think he’s been wise and  insightful, because he’s seconded your motion and I sum up my position by saying that I third it   Very much along the lines of what’s already been said, I also interpret the recent bit of business  news as tending to confirm expectations that the pause is a pause and not the beginning of [a  recession]  I don’t think it suggests that the economy has great exuberance; there is certainly an  awful lot of unemployment  On balance, I think we could use some stimulus, but I would prefer  to see that come in a mild fiscal package  I think there is some danger [that] it won’t be so mild  as you suggested earlier, Mr Chairman     I think the real trick is getting some stimulus here without upsetting the inflation area--the  expectation of the inflation area  And if we think fiscal stimulus is appropriate, or whether it is  appropriate or not, we are likely to get it  I think it is important that monetary policy not appear  to be overdoing it  I think we can take a lot of satisfaction in what has been accomplished,  particularly in breaking the resistance in the long-term rate area and beginning to break the  resistance in the institutional rates, which, as commented on earlier, could be helpful to the  investment outlook and the general climate of opinion     I worry a little bit about the aggregates cross-[cutting] in various directions  I find myself  worrying about M2 and M3 being persistently so high  I’m a little comforted by the data Mr  Axilrod gave us on M2; it doesn’t fully reflect that it tends to [unintelligible]  I think the main  thing is getting some measure of stimulus here without upsetting the inflationary target  I am  also very conscious of the exchange rate thing at present that you mentioned, Mr Chairman  I  think that could be upsetting because the market’s into its very high range, as far as  [unintelligible]; [upsetting] not just because of balance of trade reasons, but upsetting [in] the     12/20-21/76 - 63 -         psychological situation it would pose, if it [went] much further  And I don’t see much hope that  we are going to get any significant easing on the other side of the Atlantic to help us out there     So I do come out in essentially a standstill posture, which I also interpret as [alternative] B   Just to spotlight that the projections may be particularly uncertain--and I agree that they are  always uncertain--I just report that New York’s projections are significantly lower than the  Board’s projections on both M1 and M2, a couple of percentage points  That creates the  possibility that, with [alternative] B and the 4-5/8 percent midpoint, if you push lower and track  the aggregates fairly closely, I could visualize moving to 4-1/2 percent in these circumstances in  the B context  I’d be awfully reluctant to see it go below that, and I’d be reluctant to see it go  much above the present 4-5/8  I would see use of this range as being increasingly viscous as we  depart from the midpoint by very much  But with that qualification, I do think that B looks right     There is one aspect of this that I just feel I ought to  comment on because as a matter of form it concerns me  In form, we have a take-out here after a  year, but since the risk-sharing arrangement in the third indented paragraph here extends beyond  a year, in substance we’re left with the risks of the credit and, therefore, in substance to credit  beyond a year    For half of it, that’s right  For half of it    No, I think the risk is minimal--I would think the risk  existed whether or not they were bankrupt  The loan may not stand for more than a year at the  exchange rate--no, there’s no exchange rate risk here    No, that’s right  That’s right  No, I agree, the risk is  very remote    That is correct    Correct    I think this contingency is extremely remote  I have no  doubt at all in my mind about that  But in form, the obligation really is for more than a year  I  don’t think we can kid it  I mean, I would have wished that the Treasury would have just taken  over the thing at the end of the year in view of this very minimal risk, and it would have been  much cleaner and reserved our one year as being much more--    Well, the risk is certainly minimal, and I don’t want to  suggest anything else, but as a precedent for the future and in form, I’m just a little unhappy  about that particular aspect of it  I will desist, but I just wanted to record some unhappiness over  that aspect of it    That is correct, too  Put on my old clothes, and I would  have been in the Treasury arguing that we should have taken all this risk after a year  I think it’s  entirely appropriate that they would have done so    You involve the foreign currency in this case, though   SPEAKER(?)  What?    We [unintelligible] involve the foreign currency in this  case    It belongs to the BIS   SPEAKER(?)  No, no it doesn’t    For other purposes, for any purpose?    Just on this latter point, I would think part of the  rationale--although I haven’t worked the figures through very carefully--is that an awful lot of  M3, in effect--certainly in the savings banks--is now going into the corporate bond market rather  than in the mortgages  There’s quite a lot of slack to be taken up if there was a real mortgage  demand     But more generally, you can’t help but sit here and be struck by the degree of consensus  around the table, which means that there is very little to add  The differences are very narrow   Certainly, in approaching this problem, I’ve been impressed by some points that have been made  repeatedly, that these targets are so high relative to our ultimate objectives, and we’ve got to  work them down  They’re also high relative to historical experience, including ’72 and ’73,  when the Federal Reserve had a lot of criticism for stimulating inflation  And both those factors  are fundamental to my approach     It’s a little tricky to work it in with the present economic outlook and the question of  whether we’re consistent with the fiscal strategy of the Administration  As I view the outlook, I  feel relatively comfortable, but I still do think there is a major problem in the investment area,  which probably won’t materialize in 1977 in terms of capacity restraints, but well could in 1978   And I don’t see us making very much progress in that direction  And the possibility of greater  congestion in financial markets, which was referred to this morning, on the surface at least,  doesn’t help     Take that all together and, in a kind of theoretical way, you could say what the doctor  orders here is a tight-fiscal-policy, easy-monetary-policy kind of approach  But there is an  overwhelming argument against that  We ain’t got the tight-fiscal-policy approach  That’s quite  evident  So you have to work within that framework  And I think expectational factors here are  very important in terms of that potential congestion in the market as related to the prospects for  inflation       1/17-18/77 - 54 -           So I think it’s very important that we do maintain a posture of not releasing the bands on  inflation, and that may--through the expectational route--help avoid late, excessive congestion in  financial markets and avoid inflational tendencies that we’re all worried about So I can  rationalize, for my satisfaction at least, reversing the presumption of tight fiscal policy and easy  monetary policy through that expectational route     My feeling coming here was that I’d be perfectly happy to see some gesture, not very  substantive, toward reducing the targets  But I was certainly prepared to support no change, in  recognition of the enormously difficult problem of explanation at this particular juncture  If we  were going to make a change for more or less technical reasons, I was a little more on the Balles  side in thinking that maybe at least the lower limit of M1 ought to be reduced--this consistency  point that other people have referred to     But I think you can also argue that M2 and M3 have been moving at an exceptionally high  rate with a change in the environment of the financial markets  And particularly without raising  the upper limit, as you have suggested  This can be rationalized over a period of time  So I’m  quite happy to go along with your suggestion, recognizing that you volunteered to take on the  burden of explaining, which I think is crucial here, and I think you have the equipment, as you  demonstrated here this morning and in the past, to do that  So on that basis, I’d rather follow the  instinct to get at some small gesture, at least, toward reducing the aggregates in the manner you  suggested    Just one brief question of what impressions or facts the  staff may have about the prevalence of a reduction in the passbook rate, or savings certificates  rates, around the country    My feeling about the interest rate range is exactly as you  expressed it  I’d be hesitant to see it move from 4-5/8, but [a] 4-3/4 percent midpoint is okay   And I think in practice it should be narrower; however, as far as how we put the thing formally, I  can’t see what would happen to this market if it went above 5, or I think it would be very  misleading if it went below 4-1/2     Let me just make one point on ranges for the aggregates  Governor Coldwell raised the  point this morning that we didn’t relate them enough to the long-term targets--or, [remove] the  word “enough”; we don’t relate them [at all], usually  I think we should; that should be our  usual point of departure, and I just want to make that point and associate myself with Mr  Balles--he’s another one who’s made it  Typically, these short ranges ought to straddle the long- range targets  There may be particular instances when we want to deviate, but we ought to be  clear why we are [doing so]  And we shouldn’t take as our point of departure these short-term  projections, which are very erratic, anyway  Our basic point of departure ought to be the long- term range and then deviate if we have a good reason      Oh, excuse me, let me just add [where] this leads me, I  guess    I was going to live with alternative B--I suppose I would  be a little happier, particularly if M2, in the light of our decision this morning, was reduced by  1/2  I think there are some reasons to make it a little higher at the moment, in the long term    Yes, I think that’s a good technique     It’s an undesirable growth rate?    Let me just sharpen this question a bit, if I may  I have  seen calculations which suggest, I think on an economic outlook very similar to the one you have  projected--about the same rate of growth--but by the second half of 1978, also given projections  of this sort for plant and equipment, we will be back at the 1973 operating rates on the average,  maybe as early as the midpoint of next year  Is that what your calculations--    It was about 88, I think, so that would probably bring it  to 88 or beyond by the end of next year    The dichotomy we have here is that maybe we have not  much excess capacity on the physical side and we’ve got lots on the employment side  In a way,     2/15/77 - 14 -           it’s getting worse, but that depends on what the labor force is going to be doing, too  I don’t  know what kind of projection you have on the labor force    I agree it depends on the precise character of the  forecasting of the distribution, but do you have any reason to think ex ante that it’s going to be  better distributed this time?    It’s not apt to be in the form of CDs; it would be in the  form of Eurodollars     2/15/77 - 24 -            I can tell you the New York hunch  That’s a little over 7  percent    What M1 would be without an increase in interest rates    Is it not true, as Governor Wallich, I think, already  suggested, that V2 may be a little more unusual than the V1 here in terms of a historical  perspective?  V2 hasn’t got the 3 percent secular--    Well, I just want to follow up on this question   Apparently our analyst thought that the refunds would have a significant impact in March,  anyway  But beyond that, the rebates, which won’t come for a couple of months subsequent to  that, you obviously must have made some calculations here that affect these numbers  I suppose  I would be interested in knowing not only what impact that has but what degree of confidence  you attach to estimates you can make about the rebate phenomenon at this point    9 percentage points?    I have no idea what confidence to attach to any of these  things, but apparently the New York people have a much lower estimate of this rebate impact  that you’re just citing now  I thought they had a little confidence in what they were doing, but if  I can do it over again and see whether we--    My initial approach to this would be, I think, similar to  what you just stated  That, on the basis of what I see now, by which I mean I would include the  projections we have of the aggregates during this period, I don’t see any basis for making any  change in our stance     Let me consider what would happen, or what should happen, if things in the next month  turn out, particularly in the aggregates, not to follow the pattern that is now projected  And I  speak in this connection against the feeling of some confidence in the outlook that has been  expressed earlier by a number of people  And that the fiscal program may be a little larger rather  than a little smaller if the Congress does change it, although I don’t think that’s terribly  significant     I am concerned in the longer range about the possible capacity problems that were  discussed earlier  I tend to share the staff’s optimism about prices, but I think it’s a very shaky  projection, and I think it’s very important that prices--we don’t have a feeling in terms of  confidence in the business community that prices are moving up again at a stronger rate of speed   So all this makes me a little sensitive to the aggregates speeding up well beyond the projection,  should that happen  And I’m particularly sensitive against the difficult background--as we get  into the rebate period, not wanting, rightly, I think, to act strongly then--in view of the  uncertainties of those estimates inevitably     So while I see no reason for a change right now on the basis of any information we have, I  could see the case more easily for shading upwards just a bit on the federal funds rate than  shading down should the estimates come in higher than we now expect on the aggregates  Now  how you transfer that into the precise specifications, I’m not sure  I have no trouble with the B  specifications on the aggregates, although maybe I prefer that A specification on M1  But the  difference is only 1/2 percent, it’s not enough to argue about     I wonder on the federal funds rate  I suppose I can express my view in terms of substance  more accurately if the federal funds rate was 4-1/2 to 5-1/4, let’s say, or even 4-1/2 to 5, with a  midpoint asymmetrical toward the lower end of that range  Something like 4-3/4, or even 4-5/8  to 4-3/4, so we have less room on the downside than on the upside      2/15/77 - 30 -            That’s where we are now  I don’t really want to change  now, but I’d like to give myself a little leeway for changing a bit if in fact the aggregates came in  high, and I mean quite high--a couple of percent, anyway     I think that would be acceptable  All I want to express  is, I feel a little asymmetrical about the situation  I’d be a little readier to move up just a bit if  things came out that way  I hope they’re not going to come out that way  They’re moving in the  other direction     That’s right    I don’t really want to move above 5, don’t  misunderstand me  I’m not sure I want to move to 5  I just feel a bit asymmetrical about the  desirability of moving if the estimates came in on the high side, and that’s the only thought I  wanted to express here really     You say any difficulty  I have a slight difficulty in that I  think it has a kind of spurious precision to it  And maybe it neglects some of the nuances in our  conversation  But I don’t have any strong feeling if this is the way the Committee wants to go     I think even in this case it’s pretty hard just to drop in these figures we’ve just talked about  and reflect all the conversation adequately around the table  By not putting them actually in the  directive, you leave that a little fuzzy  I think that’s a merit, but I don’t feel so strongly about it     --now appear anyway     They’re just a little more formalized this way, and I  don’t see that advantage, but I have no--   ]  That’s correct      2/15/77 - 38 -            In this particular instance     I think that this doesn’t technically mean you can’t call a  Committee meeting anytime you want to  This just says the Manager would notify you if [the  directive] is significantly inconsistent, and there may be other reasons for calling the meeting     You may recall, Mr Chairman, this group was appointed  specifically in response to a question about whether we should be purchasing what might be  called some special agency issues  More specifically, WMATA, the Washington Metropolitan  Area Transit Authority, and whether that was an appropriate kind of security for us to be buying     Our charge was more general, just to examine lists in general of what we should be buying   I’m not sure that the Committee, faced only with the WMATA issue, would have reached the  unanimous [result in the] report very easily  But we came up with the unanimous report quite  simply based upon a broader consideration of what kind of agency [securities] it was appropriate  to be buying, in the sense that we found we had been buying [securities of] some agencies, of  which WMATA was certainly one  They were not currently issuing any securities in the markets  and didn’t have any real prospect of [doing so], and there were relatively few outstanding     And we considered various alternatives as to how the instructions or directive might be  changed to exclude some of these issues  And what stood out, I think quite naturally, was, under  present conditions--unlike those that existed when the directive was originally formulated--with  the Federal Financing Bank [now] in existence, and in fact [with] the Federal Financing Bank  picking up a lot of these older agency issues--we could simply change the directive to exclude  securities that were eligible for Federal Financing Bank purchase     The practical consequence of this would be to concentrate on purchases in the federally  sponsored agencies  These are the agencies that are not now eligible for the Federal Financing  Bank because they have private ownership--FNMA [Fannie Mae], Home Loan Banks, and the  Farm Credit [System], primarily  This is where the action has been; these are the agencies that  were specifically mentioned by the Congress [as being ineligible for the Federal Financing  Bank] when the [Federal Financing Bank] legislation was formulated, and so we unanimously  concluded that the simple, straightforward thing to do would be to confine our purchases to  agencies not included in the purchase authority of the Federal Financing Bank  In fact, in  practice this means very little at the moment because those [eligible] agencies are selling their  issues to the Federal Financing Bank, and we are not purchasing any significant amount of them  currently in any event  So it regularizes to some degree the de facto situation that exists     It has the further merit, as the subcommittee saw it, of providing rather visible support for  the intention of the Federal Financing Bank to purchase these more singular-type issues, and we  felt, I think consistent with the thinking of the Committee as a whole, that the Federal Financing  Bank concept should be supported, and the Federal Reserve generally had supported the  development of the Federal Financing Bank     So this is a step, in a sense, consistent with that earlier view [and] recognizes the de facto  situation that the Federal Financing Bank is buying these other issues, and [it avoids] any  necessity on our part of selecting among agency issues     The one exception to the general statement that [only] agency issues other than the  [government]- sponsored-[agency] issues are being purchased by the Federal Financing Bank is     2/15/77 - 43 -           GNMA pass-through securities  This Committee, as a matter of practice, has not purchased  those issues anyway  This would, in a sense, formalize its decision not to purchase those issues  because they are eligible for Federal Financing Bank purchase  That’s the only one [of the  government-sponsored agency securities] that I am aware of that is eligible for purchase by the  Federal Financing Bank, of any significance certainly  It would not involve any change of  policy on the part of the Committee because we are not purchasing them anyway     So I think I can report a unanimous recommendation that we meet the issue with which we  were presented by [means of] this simple change of adding a few words to the instruction--that  we will limit our purchase to issues not eligible for the Federal Financing Bank  It will involve  very little change in practice, but a change in the way we describe practice     We are aware that new agencies may arise in the future, and if [they do], then we  conceivably would want to make a different decision then  But we felt we had to face that  decision in the future anyway, and this doesn’t prevent us from [doing so]     One other point I might mention  We did not interpret our mandate as looking more  broadly at the practices of buying agency issues, including the size of the issue that might be  eligible for purchase, the ones that would remain eligible, the percentage of those issues that  might be purchased  Some question was raised in our discussion about that  The [System Open  Market] Account Manager has been looking at the issue and is preparing to make some  recommendations  If the Committee so desires, those recommendations could be filtered  through the subcommittee if you want to keep it in existence for that purpose  I don’t think we  have any strong feeling one way or the other, other than some feeling that the thing ought to be  looked at  And the Account Manager ought to look at it anyway  And our basic  recommendation is the Federal Financing Bank     I should just add, Mr Chairman, which I did not  say--that the subcommittee contemplated that we would not sell those issues that would in the  future not be eligible for new purchase except as part of any general sales program which was  undertaken in any event  Since they have been at the very least extremely rare, I think in  practice we are not contemplating that particular issue, or any other particular issue, that it would  be sold out of the portfolio     Certainly     On the substance of your concern, Mr Chairman, I don’t  think the [sub]committee was of one view that there is a concern [but] I would have the concern  that it’s hard for this Committee to distinguish among issues that are fully guaranteed by the  federal government  That, in effect, the decision about support of a local instrumentality is made  by the Congress in providing the 100 percent guarantee in the first place, and it’s a little hard for  us to second-guess that one if we are buying guaranteed agency issues  And that’s of course why  we slid into this other approach, where that kind of consideration is absent from our  recommendation     We thought we were accomplishing that purpose and  have accomplished the purpose in terms of new purchases  We haven’t accomplished it in terms  of--     I think conceptually you are correct  If my memory is  right, virtually all these agencies--not by the terms of the Federal Financing Bank legislation, but  by the terms of their own substantive legislation--can’t go into the market without some other  device where the Secretary of the Treasury can force them into the Federal Financing Bank   That may not be 100 percent true, but I remember big discussions we had with the Post  Office--that the terms of the Federal Financing Bank legislation don’t require it, but there’s a  fancy provision in the Post Office legislation which gives the Secretary of the Treasury the whip  hand so that he can force it, and he currently is forcing it     But I think the conceptual implication is correct  And I can speak for only one member of  the subcommittee--[I] would have thought that that was desirable, to support the Treasury’s  effort to get them all in the Federal Financing Bank     No, but some of them have wanted to anyway   Historically, they wanted to be independent of any other government financing source     Most do, but I can’t swear that every one of these  eligible agencies do  In the case of GNMA pass-throughs, I don’t know what the situation is, but  that’s one that the Treasury didn’t want to get into the financing bank  Whether they have the  power to force them out, I don’t know     As the memorandum made clear, if I didn’t make it  clear, we can, under the terms of this, buy the Federal Financing Bank issues themselves  They  are currently financing through the Treasury  But if they ever finance themselves, they would be  eligible for purchase by, and presumably would be purchased by, the [Federal Reserve] System     You want us to look at this other--      2/15/77 - 46 -             There’s a bigger drop of the Swiss franc relative to the  mark  Considerably bigger than relative to the dollar  And it’s their biggest trading partner   And I think they’re a bit ambivalent  They worry a bit about inflation  I don’t think they--I  don’t get the impression they’re terribly unhappy, but they are not entirely happy, either, with it  declining too far relative to the mark    I might just note, Mr Chairman, that our projections,  prepared at the New York Bank, track the Board’s projections so closely that I suspect collusion   Except, fortunately, the pattern changes a bit through the year as whole  They come up to the  same tenth of a point on both the real growth and the prices, and there’s something the matter  there, there must be something--    The pattern is somewhat different in that we show a  slightly more rapid growth in the second quarter and the third quarter, and then it tapers off in  late ’77 into ’78     The point I want to make is that the analysis suggests somewhat more pressure on interest  rates, I think, than is suggested by the remarks that were just made and the discussion in the  Greenbook  Now these [projections] have been notoriously bad in the past year, and I am very  conscious of that, but I do think this is the problem we may be facing during the year with more-  optimistic economic projections  And my sense of it is that the Board staff’s analysis leans on  the side of moderation here  It may underestimate the kind of dilemma we have between holding  our aggregate figures and interest rates as the year unfolds  I hope that’s not the case, but I have  a little feeling that we do face that risk in perhaps more pointed fashion than our analysis  suggests    Mr Chairman, if I may just chime in on this again,  briefly  I reported that our price projections were the same as the Board’s, but I also want to  report on qualitative evidence  The kind of noise we are getting from the business community--  certainly somewhat to my surprise, I guess, and maybe it shouldn’t have been--is louder and     3/15/77 - 12 -           shriller about price increases than I can recall at any time during this expansion  It’s partly  reflecting this commodity business, but not just that  [There is a] kind of a feeling [that] the  better market is coming and the opportunity [is coming] to raise profit margins once again  Now  they have been talking about this, of course, before, but I am somewhat taken aback with the  strength with which I have heard these sounds in the past month or 45 days    I’ve heard less of that just recently    Did you get a rainstorm the other day?    Velocity of M3--velocity is declining    On that point, Mr Chairman--I was going to mention  this later--but I report the impression of my staff, rather than an impression I get directly, that the  market has looked into this bulge problem, [and] their estimates of the bulge from the rebates is  substantially larger than our own, meaning the New York Bank’s  I suspect also the Board’s  If  that is true, perhaps it raises some interesting psychological problems of that time--if they think  our estimate of the bulge is the same as their estimates of the bulge [but] their estimate is  substantially larger    Well, I mean much larger    I don’t know whether it’s difficult or not, but I want to  be radical and suggest that we be particularly sensitive to our long-range intentions on the  aggregates today, and that should make it easy  I say that against the feeling that the business  outlook is quite satisfactory, but the risks may be greater of maybe getting a little too much too  soon and aggravating this price and interest rate sensitivity  I continue to feel, or hope, anyway,  that the kind of macroanalysis on prices that the economists have presented is valid, but there are  a whole lot of psychological and confidence problems at work here, and they are important, and  they are important in the financial markets, too  [Those problems include] the fear of deficits  and, I think, some underlying concern that maybe the Federal Reserve may turn out to be too  easy in the end, when the crunch comes, in terms of a different trend in interest rates     Maybe in some of this thinking of uncertainty about the price situation and about the  interest rate situation, a feeling that between the deficits and maybe some pressure toward too  expansionary a monetary policy, [it] would be counterproductive in terms of interest rates  [ending] up higher rather than lower if we don’t handle it right  And this rebate problem is going  to confuse things in the spring and may make it difficult during that period to repair any move  that we make now or [any] failure to make a move now     Having said all that, I don’t see any case for making any aggressive move at all in the  money market indicators right at the moment  But what I’d like to see is a situation set up so that  if the aggregates do begin moving on the high side--and, indeed, I’d accept the symmetrical side  of that, if they continue low--we be prepared to move reasonably quickly in a modest way  And  I guess I don’t like the matrix that’s set up for us, which depends very much on a specific  projection of the money aggregates for the two-month period  And a typical way of doing this-- it puts a lot of weight on whether there is a deviation from the current projection--the short-term  projection--rather than how we are doing in terms of the longer-run projections       3/15/77 - 25 -           If I look at it in terms of the longer- run projections, you come out more like the C  alternative in the Bluebook  Even there, M1 is too high  It doesn’t straddle, symmetrically  anyway, the longer-term target, and I would like to see it straddle that target a little more  The  M2 projection does straddle it very symmetrically--a half a point on either side--and I’m sure it  would make me happier if the M1 short-term range was reduced to something like 4 to 8 percent,  maybe even 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent, which would be symmetrical around the longer-term range  I  would do that without contemplating any particular change in the federal funds rate at this point     But then, if we began moving in the upper part of those ranges, we would begin moving  the federal funds rate a bit  Just where I’d put the limits on the federal funds rate--I don’t feel  strongly about the particular numbers  I might be inclined to a 4-1/4 percent to 5-1/4 percent  range [with] 4-3/4 as a midpoint or 4-5/8 to 4-3/4, a slightly asymmetrical midpoint  I would be  equally happy--maybe slightly happier--with a 4-1/2 to 5-1/4 percent range but leave the  midpoint, in effect, asymmetrical--leave it where it is, or maybe 4-3/4 percent     But what I am looking for here is not a move at the moment in terms of the money market  but a readiness to move quite gently if the aggregates began coming in toward the upper end or  beyond the upper end of our longer-term ranges  Because if we didn’t make that move if that  happened, we might be piling up a little difficulty in the future, when we certainly expect the  aggregates to be rising more rapidly for some months thereafter, during a period when obviously  we’ll make our own estimates of what the rebate influence was  But it might be difficult to act  very much even if it exceeded our estimate of what the rebate affect was, as current estimates do  assume     So basically I would specifically substitute for that M1 range under C something more like  the long-term range  I’d be satisfied with a fed funds range more like what we have, or just  slightly tipped up on the upper side without any change in the actual rate, at the moment, until  we saw the evidence in the aggregates    Just very briefly, Mr Chairman  I don’t feel strongly  about this issue  I get a little nostalgic about this long tradition of the acceptance market that the  System explicitly nurtured, and it’s in the law  On the other hand, there’s an element of  artificiality at this point when we operate the way we do, and here’s this credit problem  But I do  think it’s wise to keep in the authorization and at least bow out in easy steps and continue to do  the repurchase agreements thing     Any further deterioration from the current level?   Further deterioration this year certainly, but I--    The question is whether we would expect the trade  balance to decline further from the level we’ve reached in the first quarter, not from last year    Let me say first, Mr Chairman, I just read this  memorandum of Mr Broida’s during the break, and I found it a very interesting and persuasive  document in terms of the difficulties of bringing these numbers down  I was also a little  concerned as I read it  It seemed to put the Committee entirely in a rather passive voice, so to  speak, to do what you can, when you can get by with it--until I get to the bottom of page 8,  where I think it expressed the philosophy that we have to follow  that progress should beget  progress as you succeed  And if what we’re doing here makes some sense in affecting the  economy as we succeed in bringing down these growth rates, the economic conditions that  permit us to bring them down more will be facilitated     I hope that’s true  I think maybe that’s a matter of faith, but I think that’s the faith upon  which we’re operating  If that suggests that I’ve become increasingly enamored with this  aggregates approach during the past couple of years, I think that’s true in this period of  uncertainty  I think it has been one little beacon of reassurance, perhaps  I do think we now  have a lot of uncertainties, and I don’t think the [President’s] inflation message does much, for  better or worse, to eliminate the very deep-seated feeling that I seem to be getting from the  business community and elsewhere, that the Administration isn’t serious about inflation, and the  Congress is less serious    I agree with what you’re saying  I think the business  community has almost gotten neurotic in their concern about the Administration, and over time,  that may be dissipated  I think they are misreading  I hope they are misreading it to some  extent  And I think this message may go in that direction  But I still think there is a need in a  sense to look toward the Federal Reserve as confirming that more hopeful approach [as] the real  bulwark     Against all that kind of background, if I really had my druthers--if we were really living in  an apolitical climate, I suppose--I would have bought both ends of your initial thinking  I would  have liked to see the M1 range reduced by half a percentage point, just on the low side, and some  reduction on both sides of M2 and M3  I am also conscious that it comes very rapidly on the  heels of this rebate decision  I think that’s perhaps more important in my thinking than the  energy issue, which I agree is a very large question mark  But it’s more a question mark than a  fact  And I think you could argue, since that is bound probably to have some inflationary  implications, that an offsetting action in some sense on our part could be reassuring       4/19/77 - 29 -           Putting all this together, I do think we ought to have some reduction in something  The  easiest thing is the upper end of the range  And the most meaningful thing, as minor as it is--the  upper end of the range on M2 and M3 by a half as you suggested  I guess I end up in a mood  that I would accept anything between half a percent on both the upper and lower end of the  ranges of M2 and M3 and half a percent on the lower end of M1--a kind of extreme program and  the limited program  It’s not very extreme in the context in which we’re talking, but just half a  percent on the upper end of M2 and M3 is my margin of being satisfied that we have taken the  minimum steps that we should take at this time     In a way, I wish this meeting were a month later, one month removed from the rebate  decision  I think we would not then be clouded by that psychological circumstance    Well, that’s the range of my indifference, I guess  Not  quite indifference, but tolerance    I’m afraid I left myself with a range  I’d rather retract,  after listening to everybody here, with the idea of going down half a percent, as you suggested,  with M2 and M3 and also a half percent on the lower end of the range of M1, as I take it  Governor Wallich first suggested and others did  It has some minor symmetrical advantage of  putting all the ranges at 2-1/2 percent, or all the same    You said 13, and you said these were 5, but [what] did  you do with 8?    It seems to me we’re in a little bit of a peculiar position  here  These aggregates did go up at the end of the period; we didn’t react to them--I think quite  properly  But if we now take off from the top of the range we had last time--or even beyond it, I  guess, in some cases--then we add to it some extraordinarily high ranges against our long-term  range for this two-month period  The implication is, we could have quite a long period of  excessive growth in the money supply without reacting at all  And I don’t think it’s time to react  now in substance     And in terms of the federal funds rate, I like the proposal you made, and I think we ought  to probably stick around the 4-3/4 for a while and get evidence that the aggregates really are  staying high before we react  But if they stayed even as high as projected, it seems to me we  probably ought to be reacting before the next meeting in a modest way  And I would, I think,  prefer--so that we don’t get locked in too long with too high figures--the kind of federal funds  range you have, with the expectation [that], unless something extraordinary happens, we’re not  going to move from that asymmetrical midpoint until we get quite a lot of confirming evidence  to combine that with something like the alternative C ranges  So that we do react if these  numbers come in that high before the next meeting date    But combined, that comes out--well, in the Board’s  estimate--8    Yes, I don’t know what May looks like either, and I’d  like to get a little closer before I do anything    But 13 for April, which leaves you an average of 8   Which is pretty high for a two-month period for no reaction    I’ll apply his language for lower limits     4/19/77 - 44 -            He hasn’t widened it as much as Bob Black widens it  from this language    Ask Peter    Would it be helpful to the Manager to describe how we  now interpret this thing?     You do have a rapid increase in the inventory-sales ratio  in early 1978?      I don’t know whether I want to add a great note of cheer  around the table, Mr Chairman  I came in feeling somewhat the way Mr Winn started us off  with, maybe a little more reason for uneasiness about the pattern over time  I think our basic  forecast is a little stronger in the short run and a little weaker as time passes  There seems to be  something--I don’t necessarily have a better projection to offer--but something inherently  improbable about the inventories proceeding quite so smoothly as the staff has it here, with  steady increases through the next four quarters  I would think that might come a little sooner in  terms of big increases and take some of the strength out of the latter quarters  As I listen to this  conversation, this kind of uneasiness gets reinforced, and I do have a feeling that maybe it’s  going too far  I don’t necessarily anticipate quite as smooth an advance as has been presented by  the staff this morning  I’m not sure--    That’s right, that always happens in forecasting, and I  sympathize    I agree with all that, but I still have a little more worry   Not quite as much as the general tone that’s emerged  Yes, I think for the first time, maybe, in  this expansion you can begin pointing to some things that could develop in an unsustainable way  over time  But maybe the most serious thing in the background is, I don’t like the way prices,  and particularly costs on the compensation side, are developing  They are not developing as  smoothly or as optimistically as I thought some months ago  And I do share the comment that  Mr Kichline made in that respect just now, that my earlier optimism on that score is being  somewhat eroded  I don’t think it is a good thing, in a vague way, looking out [to] the expansion  a year from now  But also, it has interesting implications for how you handle this in terms of  policy  This is a main source of concern    Well, the first quarter was certainly more, but if you just  look at the projections beyond the first quarter, it is also more than it was last year, although not  as much as the first quarter     It discourages me about this a little bit more  One more  comment on this point, purely a qualitative reaction  The more time passes, businesses seem to  take it more and more for granted that you give a 9 to 10 percent [compensation] increase, and  we don’t even raise much question about it  It’s the normal, expected way the economy works  these days  It seems to be part of the mentality  I don’t know how you get out of this syndrome    I’m afraid New York is not to be confused with Athens,  although I sometimes think the roof is falling in  Everything that I could have said has already  been said in one way or another  Let me just say in terms of the business situation, where I think  that a fair number of uncertainties could develop later this year and into next year--but that’s  always the case--I do think there’s a lot of buoyancy now, and as I add up the business and  inflationary situation, we may be better off to meet these uncertainties later in the year by  moving a bit now  And I think it would be reassuring psychologically and otherwise     I think the aggregates have certainly been rising too rapidly  This April figure puts the  frosting on the cake in a big way, but they were rising somewhat too rapidly before  And when I  look at this pattern projecting ahead, with all the uncertainties that it has, it brings the aggregates  down within the targets, but it does it with a lot of interest rate increases later in the year that I’m  not sure I would like to see, given the uncertainties that exist  We’ve also gotten by with an  adjustment so far with very little disturbance in the market  And I think I’d like to press that luck  a little further  This may be a better time to do it, with the market in good technical shape, than  some subsequent time     So in terms of the actual specifications, I had the same numbers in mind that you cited  about an hour ago, that if the range was widened at all, and I sometimes think it’s useful to widen  the range  I must say I would lower it  I’d put negative 1 to 4 [for M1], as Henry Wallich  suggested, and 2 to 7 [on M2], if I was going to move in any direction  It wouldn’t disturb me at  all to see zero or a slight minus figure in this particular period against the background that we  have  I would be content with zero to 4, 3 to 7     I also think the federal funds range of 5-1/4 to 5-3/4 is a good one  I’d want to stop and  pause before going above 5-3/4  But given the way I feel about the aggregates, I’m not very  eager to see the funds rate being reduced if we were plus 1 or 2 percent on M1 or equivalent  figures on M2, so that [a midpoint anywhere from] 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 strikes me quite nicely  I  suppose I would be a little cautious after what we have just done and like to consider the  midpoint something like 5-3/8 or 1/2, implying a pretty modest move at the moment  But  anything from 5-1/4 to 5-1/2, whether we consider it fully symmetrically or a bit biased at least  in not moving too rapidly to 5-1/2, is fine with me      Who is with me?  Jim Oltman and Peter Sternlight    Paul Meek is with me, too, Art    Okay  I’ll try to cut through as many of the  complications as I can, but the essential background is that for about four years [the New York  Federal Reserve] Bank has, as agent, provided a repurchase facility to foreign central banks  wanting to invest money from day to day  And about 71 foreign central banks, at one time or  another, have used this  On a day-to-day basis, the average is about 35 [foreign central banks]   Something between a billion and a billion and a half dollars is invested through this facility on a  daily basis     One other bit of background information  As a matter of convenience to the [Federal  Reserve] System account, about two-thirds to three-quarters of these transactions with foreign  accounts, RPs [repurchase agreements], daily RPs, have been provided with the System account  [acting as principal] on the other side of the transaction  The other one-quarter to one-third has  been done in the market [with the New York Bank acting as agent]     The problem arises because the IRS [Internal Revenue Service] recently had a ruling  specifically on the point--the circumstances were very different--but the point was whether an  RP on government securities is a purchase and sale, or is it a loan  And they came down very  definitely on the side of it being a loan  Now, that is significant [because] a loan does not  qualify for the exemption of foreign central banks from withholding tax  And we have not been  withholding [taxes] on these transactions on the presumption that they’re government securities  transactions and not loans  Now, among other questions, this could conceivably raise the  question of past tax liabilities     But the important question is what we do in the future?  And [with] this ruling coming to  our knowledge, it seems to me that we had to cut this off, at least until it was clarified  Which  would be quite disturbing in terms of our relationships with foreign central banks  We have had  discussions with the Treasury, and they confirm the nature of this IRS ruling     At the time I reached the conclusion that we had to cut this off, the Treasury came back  and pointed out to us--and our lawyers agree, and I think they agree in Washington--that the     5/27/77 - 3 -      exemption for foreign central banks includes obligations of the US government--the exemption  we thought we were operating under--and obligations of US government agencies and its  instrumentalities  And the Treasury pointed out that since we are an instrumentality of the US  government, if we were to be involved in these transactions not as agent but as principal, it  would be our obligation and therefore exempt in their opinion  And they offered to go to the IRS  and present that view to the IRS and see whether the IRS agreed, and they think the grounds are  very strong, as I understand it     Upon receiving that information, we took some interim action  We have made no further  repurchase agreements in the market  I said--for these past few days--if, in the ordinary course  of the System’s business, we would have made [these RP transactions with foreign central  banks] with the System account anyway, therefore the System account being the principal, go  ahead and do it  Now it so happens that, for the last few days, the System account found it  convenient to do it  They have followed the general policy during these years and reported to the  Committee regularly that, when the System account is operating in the market anyway, they  would do these transactions directly [as principal] with the foreign accounts  That’s the  procedure that has been followed since this arrangement started     Now the problem arises potentially on this interim basis  Sooner or later--although we  expect in the next few days that the System account will be active--but sooner or later, the day  will arrive when the System account would not otherwise be active, and therefore we are, under  the decisions taken so far, estopped from doing these transactions [in the market, as agent]   We’d have to notify all the foreign central banks and create a certain amount of uncertainty and  disturbance in those relationships     Now the essential proposal that I have here for a course of action is that we do go to the  Treasury, tell them we are prepared to act as principal in the future, and see whether that is  acceptable to the IRS  If that course of action is acceptable to the IRS, [then we would] take  what actions would be specifically necessary at the next [Federal] Open Market [Committee]  meeting to authorize us to proceed on that basis  We as a [Federal Reserve] Bank cannot  proceed as principal without the authorization of the [Federal] Open Market Committee  And  the Committee itself, [if] it deviated from past practices, I’m sure would want to recognize that  the System account [is] the principal on the other side  So some action, in my opinion, is  necessary sooner or later by the Committee if we take this course     And the point, I think, of this conversation is, if there is that understanding, should we go  now, as I would propose, to the Treasury, and ask them to clarify this with the IRS?  If the IRS is  agreeable, take the necessary actions at the next meeting  If the IRS is not agreeable and raises  some question, then I see no alternative to stopping these transactions at this time when they  raise the question  I can’t speak for the Treasury, [but] they obviously don’t think the IRS will  [object]; they think that the case is quite clear [and that] the IRS will not raise the question   [But] they obviously cannot speak for the IRS, and that leaves us in this dilemma      It is the first ruling we are aware of on government  securities  There have been rulings in the past, and there’s a long [history]--starting out  somewhat cloudy but getting less cloudy over time--on municipal securities, where they have  ruled you cannot pass through, in effect, the tax exemption on municipal securities because these  are loans  This is the first case on US governments    The ruling was in March, and I think it came to our  attention in April, at which point we initiated conversations with the Treasury  We didn’t really  get to the right person in the Treasury until approximately a week ago    I would, indeed    No, we will do that, we will  I am sure the Board staff  will be doing something, but we review the history and technical side of this and comment also  on what the importance of these transactions are as we see them and what the consequences are      Yes    We’ll get to work on that paper right away  Just to  repeat here, we will go to the Treasury and they will either go by themselves or with us to the  IRS  If the IRS raises the substantive questions, then I think we have no alternative but to back  off here and stop the thing  Doesn’t mean that we can’t start it again, but I think you have to  understand--once we stop it, it may be very difficult to get it started again on the same basis  because all the foreign central banks will have some residual question in their own minds about  the nature of tax consequences     So it’s going to be very hard to get it started again, which is why, when we got this  reassurance from the Treasury, we didn’t cut it off completely  But I think we have to [cut it off]  if we don’t get the reassurance from the IRS  If we do get the reassurance from the IRS, we will  continue on this limping fashion until the next FOMC meeting, and I would think--and I just  want to clarify this point, I’d like to get your opinion on this  Do we try to avoid [doing the  transactions on] a day or days when we don’t do any transactions, [or do] we just do them in the  System account assuming we have the IRS reassurance?    Yes  If we go to the IRS and say, “We plan to continue  these with the System account as principal during this interim period”--that’s the substance of  it--“We think that that is correct, and there is clearly an exemption,” [and] they come back and  say, “We don’t think there’s clearly an exemption,” then we stop      I would presume we would discuss it at the FOMC  anyway but would just be doing it from a different background--a quite different background of  having cut them off   SPEAKER(?)  Yep    Just technically, Phil, I have no problem with that, but as  it now is, with us an agent, it has not been an FOMC decision  We are just acting, as I  understand it, in an agency capacity by the New York Bank, and there’s no question of our legal  ability, in a sense, to cut it off, and our responsibility, I think, to cut it off  I don’t mind at all  discussing it with the Committee  I don’t mean to imply that, but I don’t think it’s necessary  either      We have now stopped, as I indicated, doing anything in  the market  That action has already been taken    Right  Well, the Bank, I think, actually is still acting as  agent; the System account is acting as principal     There is one question I raised  I’m just talking entirely  now [regarding the period] before the next meeting  [The question of] whether the System  account operates [on any given day], as you know, is always a matter of judgment  Should that  judgment be shaded in favor of [having the System account act] on these [foreign central bank  RPs] when, in past circumstances, the judgment might have gone the other way and we would  have done them in the market [as agent]?    Right     Is that agreed?    Right  I understand    Well, we will go ahead and prepare the necessary  background information  I’m sure the Board staff will be supplementing that, and we will keep  you informed as [we get] the result of the contact with the Treasury and the IRS    Thank you    END OF TELEPHONE CONSULTATION            My impression is the same as yours, Mr Chairman   There has been a slight deterioration in the wage pattern  We also, at this stage, expect to get  slower growth in productivity, I think  And the wage-cost element in the economy strikes me as  being less favorable than I had hoped earlier in the year--not by a major amount but moving in  that direction  And I must say I am struck by the kind of deeply ingrained expectation of  businessman and others in giving wage increases  There seems to be very little resistance to a     6/21/77 - 8 -         kind of 8 percent or higher level  No willingness to look forward to a decline in the rate of  inflation  And a kind of feeling that it’s only fair to give 8 or 10 percent      Well, they certainly argue it’s necessary  They’re  certainly not going to be willing to take a fight or strike or anything  Well, I don’t think it’s  terribly unusual for the big negotiated settlements  It’s obviously not the average increase  But  the general feeling of no resistance because they think they can’t presumably--and they think that  the prices are going to go up in the following year to justify--it seems to me to be very strong,  and we have made very little impact on breaking it     While I have the floor, let me just say that I certainly have noted--pessimism may be too  strong a word  But the strongly increased caution of the business community that Dave Eastburn  talked about has been reflected to me, too, and I haven’t been able to quite figure out why it  takes place during a period when the economy has been expanding more rapidly  Maybe the  stock market had something to do with it  I don’t quite know why it has happened, but I have  detected this mood of great caution, apparent on the surface anyway, in the business community      It’s not very identifiable, is the trouble    One way of handling it is, when you announce the  figure, emphasize that this happened    How much are we talking about?     6/21/77 - 25 -          Conceptually, I don’t see why this affects more than one  week  Why isn’t it all washed out the next week?    I understand that, but you get a higher month because  one week is higher     A billion and a half dollars for two days can’t affect the  annual average by even 1/10 of 1 percent    Well, it is true that New York normally lags, but this has  been an exceptionally long and pronounced lag  And I think the normal, usual explanation for it  in the Treasury market is that the biggest companies in the country are relatively liquid, and most  of the loan demands must be coming from smaller ones, which is reflected in the fact that outside     6/21/77 - 29 -         the weekly reporting banks, it’s stronger than in [larger] weekly reporting banks outside of New  York     And this is an exceptionally wide discrepancy by historical standards, although, in [its]  general direction it’s not unusual  I think the banks are in a conflict about the pricing of their  loans  They don’t want to reduce the prime rate  They feel it loses profit margin all around  On  the other hand, they have this problem--if they could reduce the prime rate without reducing it on  so many secondary loans, I think they would do it  They are unhappy with the pricing  structure--there are too many people with the prime rate; they haven’t been able to correct it    I have the same feeling about the federal funds rate  range that you do  I think, basically, we are talking about B  I am, anyway, and you are  I think  I feel a little more cautious about the business outlook than the staff does at this point  But also  the aggregates are going up higher, and I think that this is a little above our target  This is the  right compromise, and I wouldn’t like to see the federal funds rate declining [to] 5 percent here,  so I’d like that lower base, the one we have been working on  And the aggregates are also all  right with me  I’d be perhaps a little happier by lowering the lower end of the range of M1, just  in case it did come in low, because we could stand it coming in low again--make it 2 to 7--but 3  to 7 is also acceptable to me  I think the important thing is, if the aggregates come in a little low,  we can take that and not go below the 5-1/4 on the funds rate    I think there is some logic, as Mr Fossum suggested, in  just reducing the M1 a little bit  It is M1 that’s above our ranges, not M2--one way to  compromise it for me     I think that we need a report on foreign currency  operations from Mr Holmes    Mr Morris, please     6/21/77 - 38 -          I have a feeling we have been pretty fortunate that the  dollar has been as steady as it has been in view of the trade balance and our inflation  performance  And the key, I suspect, in the last month or so was this rise in interest rates that  came along at a fortuitous time from that standpoint     Well, we’ve had some discussions on that recently with  foreigners, and what they point out is that there’s no indication that our trade with other  industrialized countries is really suffering  It’s oil, and LDCs [less-developed countries] for  various reasons, and Japan--Japan [as an industrialized country] is the one exception to that    That’s right  But it’s in the LDCs and in Japan  It’s not  vis à vis Europe--well it is Canada, too; [trade with] Canada has been [deteriorating]    Well, this is the European argument you hear back,  though  There is no need for any depreciation of the dollar vis à vis Europe  Which is basically  what you are talking about here      The Italians are a bit worried about their economy  turning down; mass production figures showed a decline  Any other comment?    That doesn’t say whether they are hiding it?    Japanese commercial bank holdings       Any other comment?  I take it that we have to approve,  ratify, and confirm    Without objection, that is done  The only other thing we  have is this foreign RP [repurchase agreement] business  I don’t know whether I can assume you  have all read these memoranda--there is one from me and one from the Board’s staff analyzing  some of the pros and cons     If I can, let me just put the issue as simply as I can  If we continue providing this facility  for foreign central banks, it appears, under our current understanding of IRS [Internal Revenue  Service] regulations, we need to inject some arm of Federal Reserve System as principal  Which  means it would be an obligation or instrumentality of the US government and therefore free us  from withholding tax  And the legal situation is such that, even if we just inject the New York  [Federal Reserve] Bank as principal of the [Federal] Open Market Committee, it then becomes  an open market operation, which the [Federal] Open Market Committee must approve  So that’s  why we have an issue for the Committee     I think there are a couple of underlying questions that have been raised  whether in  principle it’s a good idea for the Federal Reserve to have such a facility for foreign central banks  or governments; and second, whether it helps, harms, or is neutral in terms of affecting the     6/21/77 - 40 -         conduct of our own domestic open market operations  Mr Holmes might offer a comment on  that at the beginning     Just to review the general background, we fell into, if that’s the right word, this practice  fairly heavily after the oil crisis, [when] a lot of short-term money was moving around  There  had been some isolated examples of doing RPs before  But after the oil crisis, there was a lot of  foreign central bank money that wanted a very short term investment vehicle  When they came  to us, it seemed logical to do RPs in a pattern of what had been done for the System account   And this has become a regular thing, averaging about a billion and a half dollars a day, these  days     We were operating under the presumption that foreign central banks are subject to  exemption from withholding tax so long as they are in government securities  What has changed  is [that] the IRS recently had a rather definitive-sounding ruling in a very different context  It  concerned a REIT [real estate investment trust] that wanted to count RPs that had been made [in]  government securities [under] certain other IRS regulations  And the IRS, for the first time [with  regard to] government securities--they said it before in municipal securities to avoid the tax- exempt pass-through--they said an RP was a loan for tax purposes and not a security     So the technical problem was, once they became a loan instead of the security--and the  loan in this case presumably from the government securities dealer, and we were acting as an  agent in between--there is a clear, definite threat that withholding is necessary, to the point  where I thought we could no longer proceed in this knowledge, so we stopped it  And since then  all transactions have been done with the System account, which was the pattern of 70 percent of  the transactions earlier  The general practice has been, if the System account is operating  anyway, they are done with the System account  The System account, as Mr Meek reviewed,  has had a lot of ups and downs recently, so we have been able to do them all with the System  account     But the question now is, how the Committee wants to regularize this, if at all  I should say,  if they are cut off, there is, I think, a justified feeling, although the magnitude of it can’t be  identified, that the RP facility has become enough of a part of our investment services and other  services to central banks generally that what would be affected is not just the RP facility but  some of the other investment transactions in some unknown dimension     Technically there is another route that could be [taken]  Foreign governments are also  exempt from withholding tax, and whatever they hold there, with some exceptions  But in  general they are exempt  Foreign central banks, if they are wholly owned by governments,  which is a big if, would presumably be exempt under that provision, but they can only get  exempt by making individual application for a ruling to the IRS  And it appears very doubtful  that they would want to do that because it raises other complications  There is one central  bank--I guess I am a little doubtful whether it was a central bank, because of its name, the Saudi  Arabia Monetary Authority--that has made such an application and is deemed exempt, but that is  the only central bank that is in that category  As a practical matter, I think if you relied upon that  exemption, the foreign central banks would not apply, by and large, and it would certainly  introduce a discontinuity       6/21/77 - 41 -         There have been conversations between us and the Treasury and between the Treasury and  the IRS, and where this stands at the moment is, the Treasury has gone to the IRS on our behalf,  so to speak, and discussed the problem and asked essentially whether the IRS agreed with the  theory that as a government instrumentality, if we’re injected as principal, there would be no  withholding tax  They got a favorable sound in response to that, but they also got the response  that we should ask for a ruling precisely to confirm that  The Treasury suggests that we apply  for the ruling, and technically we would apply for it as [the] New York [Federal Reserve] Bank  with the full support of the Treasury  The Treasury would attach a memorandum, and so forth,  saying they think it’s appropriate and proper     And in view of this apparent necessity to ask for a ruling, I personally think it is  appropriate today for the Committee to decide basically what it wants to do, but not to take any  formal action  Authorize us in effect to apply [for] the ruling  Assuming the ruling is favorable,  then adopt a formal action that regularizes the whole procedure  Otherwise, it is at least  theoretically possible that we would formally approve an approach here and then find that the  IRS didn’t act, and we might look a little silly--after we have to reverse the action  So you can  do what you want to do--I guess the basic question is whether you want to do anything  I don’t  think there’s any necessity for taking action today  But before we [go] to the IRS for a ruling, I  want to know whether you are prepared to take the action following presumably the favorable  ruling     We’ve proposed three alternatives here  I think the Board’s staff is in general agreement  here that these are the appropriate alternatives  If I understand it correctly--although you are the  man, Tom; you can [speak] to it--they prefer what we cited as the third alternative, which is  permitting the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to act as principal on these transactions  And  we would then act as principal when we were conducting it in the market  If it was convenient  for the [Federal] Open Market Committee, for the [System] Open Market Account, as in the past,  if [the System account] wanted to take the transactions, [it] could be principal     A variant of that is to put the New York Bank as principal whether or not the System  account is also principal  That is the course of action that I favor myself because it seems to me  closest to past practice and does not involve any question of whether the System account is being  involved in anything that’s special for foreign accounts  But I think the other alternatives are  technically feasible  The first alternative would not require any explicit action at all, just an  understanding that the present directive covered it  In effect that’s the way we are operating at  the moment  But in regularizing it, as I say, I have some preference for what’s presented as the  third alternative  I don’t know whether you want to say anything about the effect on the System  account, Alan and Tom, and the different alternatives, or any other aspect of it     Under the alternative proposal, anyway, these  transactions would be for the New York Bank as very brief principal to a foreign account, and  not to the System account  They’re all done as a trading [unintelligible]    Well, it depends upon where you begin this process  A  foreigner brings money in--of course, he wouldn’t bring money in if we didn’t have the  facility--but if that was not offset, it would be a drain  When the Bank acts for its own account,  there is no reserve impact  That’s one way of looking at it  It’s just monies passed through to  the market  There’s only a reserve impact when the System account gets in on the other side   Depends upon how you look at it      6/21/77 - 43 -          That’s right  It’s just like using bills for the foreign  account  Except the only difference is a technical one  We buy bills as agent  Here we would  just inject our name as principal on both sides of the transaction  That’s the only change that  would take place  Where we’re not acting as agent, we would act as principal, technically      Right    It was not a meeting  It was an informal discussion    I think that’s right, and I don’t think we need to know  specifically which approach will be adopted in the end  I think we need to know that one of the  three will be adopted  That decision, I think, should be made today    Although, I guess in applying for the ruling, [we] will  have to apply either in our [Federal Reserve Bank of New York] name or the System name,  won’t we     I think that is right  The basic issue is whether we have  this facility at all, at least on the present scale  And you may still do it in a very limping way   You can certainly do it with the Saudis    Some central banks acting as agency for their  government     Ficio, in Italy, has been one; that’s probably one we  have to stop anyway  It is not clear what its status is   SPEAKER(?)  That’s finished    In all respects, it’s the same people for which we have  always had investment accounts, which is--    Has this question ever risen, of a US governmental  agency wanting us to--any kind of government agency    Well, we do   SPEAKER(?)  At one point, I think before they took it over themselves  I think the  Treasury--    Well, regularly these transactions, they just go through  the Treasury  I am certain the FDIC [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation] was always  investing through the New York Bank, but they did it through the Treasury      Well, the charge is a separable issue  I think we ought to  charge, myself  And we are preparing some plans to that effect, and the charge would be--    Well, the whole foreign department in New York is a  very profitable operation  If you take all the balances which foreign central banks hold with us     6/21/77 - 46 -         and assume some earnings made on those balances, yes, just demand deposits  It is now,  however, very unevenly skewed  Some accounts have a sizable balance that we don’t do much  for, some we do quite a lot for and have very minimal kind of balances  There is no explicit  charge, although the total operation is quite a profitable one by commercial standards    Well, it’s just that we assume the earnings rate on the  portfolio--    For every dollar they have in an account balance, it’s a  drain on reserves which we have offset through enlarging the System Open Market Account    Well, the question--    The RP market itself, I think, is going to be difficult--the  federal funds market--for many of them to operate in  But they will make other arrangements,  and the question arises, what happens to the money?  My own sense of it is that probably most of  it will go into the Eurodollar market  That’s the big competitor  They will have tax problems,  among other things, if they put it in the federal funds market here  But many American banks  would try to take it and put it offshore, which is where the bulk of this money is now  There’s a  hell of a lot more there than there is in our billion and a half     Now some of them will reevaluate their position, and you can theoretically, or in practice, I  suppose, have some of it moving in the foreign currency markets  I don’t think that would be the  largest part of it by a long shot  I think that would be a small part  But they’ve got to put the  money someplace else, and those are their choices  elsewhere in the US market; the  Eurocurrency markets one way or another, which I think is where most of it would go; [and] to  some limited extent, perhaps, in foreign currencies    And you’re putting a little more in the Eurodollar  market  I think that’s quantitatively more important  You are promoting the growth of the  Eurodollar market as opposed to domestic markets      It’s been my strong impression that our record has not  been good in getting information elsewhere  We have always taken the position--and quite often  they will ask, “Do you have any objection if we operate in the private market?”  And our answer  is basically, “No, but we would like to keep informed about what you’re doing”  Any reports  about what they are doing are extremely scarce    They’ll still go ahead and do it in some form or another,  whether or not we’re the intermediaries     In general terms, the background of this whole operation  in dealing as agent for foreign central banks, whether it’s RPs or anything else, I think this grows  out of a tradition--and stronger than the tradition in most central banks--the policy that they want  this money funneled through central banks, and this is a service that’s expected to be provided,  and I think virtually all central banks would provide this service  The difference is that most of  them would say, “You’ve got to go through us--we think it’s discourteous to put it in the  market”  We don’t say that    It’s [in] relatively few countries--sterling, the French  franc to some extent  It occasionally happens in other countries, but for isolated situations  Of  course, we don’t have much occasion because we don’t keep foreign balances  But when we do,  we do use the facilities through the foreign central banks    Well, there is some sense of competition, I think that is  fair to say  It’s not hugely important  Obviously these are not very profitable operations, and  turning over short-term money of this sort, you make a little commission on it  It’s not--    I think most of them do    Well, I think it would depend upon the individual banks   Some of them would pick out an agent; some of the ones that aren’t too big, I suspect, do it--tend  to concentrate in one agent  Some others would scatter it around  I think most of them, even the  ones that don’t use us much, like to feel that they could use us in particular circumstances when  they didn’t want to operate through the private market for some reason, or [as a] kind of  backstop to their arrangements in the private market  I think part of it is basically that some of  them are uneasy about keeping so much in the Eurodollar market  And for this very short-term  money, there isn’t all that much alternative to an RP in the American market  And anybody is  going to run into this tax problem on RPs      We have told the market in writing a couple of times that  we have no objection to them competing for this business, no objection to a central bank using  them  We didn’t like the idea of very heavy arbitrage operations, so they are in and out every  day for billions of dollars in order to try to get next to three basis points    Yes, I think we can  We do have a charge for handling  gold, for example, which we’ve just revised to reflect current costs  We do charge for a few  things, a very few things      I personally think it’s very legitimate to make a charge   I don’t know just what that charge should be, but I--    Well, I was thinking earlier in terms of balance  Before  this issue ever arose,  I thought the most straightforward way to do it may be a minimum  balance  That may still be true, but now, it’s come up in terms of this particular issue, I think  you could inject a little commission for RPs    Well, changed in the sense that we have stopped doing  any of them in the market     Well, we could, but the issue having been raised, and  raised in very plain form by this IRS ruling--and in the light of the consultations with the  Treasury, and then in turn the Treasury with the IRS, and the IRS saying it looks okay but we  really want you to have a ruling--I think we ought to have a ruling  And that, you know, [it]  would have been nicer not to, but given where we are, given the question that has arisen, I really  think we have to clarify it      No  Well, I don’t think any of them would without the  ruling  With the ruling they wouldn’t have any incentive  But if they had another reason to  apply, for other types of transactions, for instance--if they wanted to do an RP in the market,  where you don’t have this governmental instrumentality interjected, they’d have to get a ruling     If they got a ruling, we wouldn’t need the ruling for that  particular central bank     There are some central banks we know will fail in  getting the ruling because they have some element of private ownership in them      No  Venezuela did--Venezuela is our big problem,  historically  Venezuela passed a law to eliminate their private holding, but during most of this  period they had some private holding  So they do not have available to them the defense that  they are a government institution  We don’t know about all the [central] banks--it’s hard to tell  whether some of them are privately owned or not  There are maybe a dozen that we suspect  have some private ownership in them     Well, some major banks do have private ownership  The  Bank of Belgium just comes to mind  But they are exempt by treaty  And there are several  things that cut across here  The Swiss have private ownership and are exempt by treaty; fully  exempt, too     The Federal Reserve could not get a ruling, that is right   We are a governmental instrumentality under the IRS, but we are not a government    Except Venezuela is big, and I’m not sure--we think  they are government owned now, [or] they will shortly become, but they may still be in some  transition state  The deadline of the law saying that they are [completely] government owned is  past, but we understand that not all the private owners have coughed up their stocks  So their  status is a little ambiguous at the moment       6/21/77 - 52 -          No, well, no more than they are now  Well, I just don’t  know the extent to which they are now doing RPs in the market, assuming they’re exempt   There is probably some of that  But we don’t know how much  Certainly when this [recent IRS]  ruling comes to their attention and is fully analyzed, to the extent they are doing it they must be  stopping    Our impression is, and I think it is mostly an impression,  that they do a lot of this with American banks, but the American banks book it in the Bahamas,  basically  I mean they move it offshore, for this reason      And that still goes ahead  And that’s what they have to  do with all of it--they have to get out of the RP vehicle  There may be other vehicles for doing it  in the domestic market  But that’s why I think the bulk of it will go into the Eurodollar market    Some of them might  I can’t predict that  I would just  suspect that it’s not going to be important to most of them to want to horse around with the IRS  in the United States, which raises a question about their other income from the United States if  they didn’t get the ruling     Somebody more legally informed than I can pick this up, but we can now certify under the  present exemption for central banks that they are a central bank and therefore exempt on their  government securities holdings  We can’t certify that they are a government; we can certify that  they are a central bank  Now if, for instance, they applied for a ruling that they were part of the  government and somehow failed, they might worry about jeopardizing the exemption they might  already have as a central bank  I would just guess that, you know, going to the IRS is a kind of a  horrendous decision for a foreigner, and they are not going to be eager to do it  But some of  them, I’m sure, would    I don’t think that anybody could argue that this is  absolutely crucial to a central bank’s operation--it’s a convenience for them    Pardon me?    The exemption that we are looking for says it doesn’t  make any difference what obligation we are giving them because all obligations of a  governmental instrumentality are exempt     No, anybody’s--    The way you say our present exemption--let me make  sure     Yes, that’s just for government securities, or deposits, I  think    None, no  Because that is what the ruling was  They  said these are not government securities, these are loans  That’s the problem    Under the Federal Reserve Act these are still purchases  and sales as far as we are concerned  Under the Internal Revenue Code they say they are loans     That’s all  Well, the exemption we seek is just to say  that we are a governmental instrumentality  I think a ruling that we are a government  instrumentality, which then permits us to make what we call RPs and what the IRS calls loans   We want a declaration that we are a governmental instrumentality  Because then the law is quite  clear  It says obligations of governmental instrumentalities are exempt      No That depends on which alternative you take   Whether it’s the Fed in New York or the System Open Market Account    I defer to the lawyers  My understanding is that it  doesn’t make any difference to the lawyers whether it’s the Federal Reserve Bank in New York  or the System Open Market Account  So I don’t think legally it makes any difference whether  it’s New York or the System account    One of the reasons, I think, [other central banks] will be  cautious about getting a ruling is there will still be some question about [whether] certain  operations are a business in the United States, in which case they wouldn’t be exempt  Or  whether it’s a passive investment of some sort, so there are all these complications around the  edge  I think what we really need here, and all we need, is a clear expression of sentiment by the  Committee--I don’t think we need a formal vote--that alternative 1, 2, or 3 is okay  One of those  three at least will be all right  And in effect, authorizing either the Bank or the System Open  Market Account--presumably do it in the form of both  So that we could go either direction  Go  to the IRS for the ruling    Well, that’s an additional question  I’m happy to do it  under that arrangement  Because I think we should anyway  If the Committee wants to issue  that sentiment, I think that’s appropriate, too     6/21/77 - 55 -          Let me propose specifically, and maybe we can have a  showing of hands  The Committee is in agreement that we go to the IRS for a ruling in  contemplation that one of the three approaches will be adopted assuming a favorable ruling, and  that we will come back to the Committee with a proposal on changes and an analysis thereof      And selection of which of the three, right    Are we ready for a showing of hands?    But you’re indicating that one of the three is going to be  acceptable to the Committee    But through the System account    Beyond that, if there is a real difficulty with System  operations during this interim period , we won’t do it on that day    We would only be able to do it in conformance with past  practices during these fortuitous large movements in the System    Yes, I would  This is in favor of a suggestion that I had  made Do you have any expression of opposition?  Okay, well, we will proceed and ask for a  ruling in conjunction with the Board legal staff and in conjunction with the Treasury     6/21/77 - 56 -          Yes  I guess we are just left with the date of the next  meeting, which is July 19     END OF MEETING            Where do we have a current account deficit from?   We’ve got it partly from oil  It’s our own oil program as well as expansion  I think the rest of it  is largely cyclical, as Henry suggested  And it is likely to continue  And I do think there’s a  question whether this exchange rate change, going much further, anyway, is productive or  counterproductive in terms of the cyclical forces in both places--for the reason Alan suggests in  Germany, [and] in the inflationary psychology it may stimulate here  At some point, when this  gets in the newspapers and gets in the consciousness, I think it [will be] upsetting in terms of  what we’re trying to achieve through a steady monetary policy     I don’t know what the rate should be fundamentally now--I don’t think anybody does with  these imbalances in current accounts  But I do think we’re now verging, more than verging, on  the risk of the rate [movement] being overdone in terms of rapidity, with destructive  psychological effects cyclically, both here and abroad  I don’t think that means we can act very  aggressively if the Treasury is going to be talking the other way  But I think it does suggest that  we ought to have some renewed consultations with the Treasury at this point to see whether they  don’t want to take a little more overt line, given that the rate has gone as far as it has in the last  month since they gave the tone of acquiescing--at the very least--and we have had a significant  change since that time  So the rate of speed is certainly at issue at the moment, it seems to me,  given what’s happened in the market in the past week, and particularly in the past couple of  days    I agree with that    I don’t really think you are going to find much  statistically here  And this floating rate system--you can’t have a net capital flow except to the  extent there’s intervention--for every transfer, you’re going to find somebody in the other  direction  The question is at what rate it’s taking place?    A somewhat different context  Oh, fixed rates    We were on a fixed rate then    If I can follow-on there, Mr Chairman, with a question  in this connection?  If I have my facts straight, your projections this time are very close to what  they were last time, within a tenth or two  But the money supply assumption has implicitly been  changed because you’re assuming 5-1/2 from the second quarter instead of from the first quarter   So, the result is a money supply assumption of something like 1 percent higher over the course  of the year  And with the same economic projection and the higher money supply projection, the  implication is, I guess, one of two things happening  One is that the business situation basically     7/19/77 - 11 -    is somewhat weaker, offset by higher growth in the money supply, so you came out the same   Or you discounted the change in the money supply    I don’t want to prolong this unnecessarily, Mr  Chairman, but I find myself very sympathetic with what Mr Partee had to say  It seems to me  there is some danger of lending more weight to this than it’s really worth  What we have is an  equation, as I understand it, that’s always going to have more or less the same answer  And if  we get the equation once, we ought to understand the answer that the equation has  But arraying  it every month in terms of the marginal effect on GNP and prices is telling us the same thing     7/19/77 - 15 -    every month  It tells us what this rather inadequate equation discloses, which is not a very  weighty piece of information, I think, to have before us every month    Until they revise the equation    That would only say that you have to make up your  mind    My understanding of this is that there are two deflated  series, and unfortunately they show different answers    I was about to make an observation on this point  As a  preliminary, I continue to find, in the contacts I have with the business community, that there  seems to be quite a discrepancy between their mood and what the figures seem to show  We are  coming off of a very rapid growth period, but a very distinct mood of caution seems to be  prevailing in most of the business community, as nearly as I can see  I think it does bear partly  upon the inventory situation, which has been touched upon  You commented that we might be in  the beginning stages of a mini inventory adjustment    Two months  I don’t know  The last figure went up  quite rapidly in inventories  That was--     7/19/77 - 26 -      I agree  The last inventory figure we have still shows a  rapid increase, but I would expect some decline--    They’re responding to that increase, that’s right, that’s  right    And in that connection, the staff did moderate their  projection, I think, with an offset on monetary stimulus or less restraint, however one wants to  word it  I think that’s in the right direction  I don’t think their figures reflect this kind of  prospective inventory development that perhaps you have been suggesting and [that] I think is  possible     So, therefore, I just want to record, I would think the odds are--while they have a  reasonable-looking projection--there is more chance of falling short of that than exceeding it in  the near-term future, and I wouldn’t be surprised to see a slower rate of growth in the latter part  of this year  I’m not sure that’s unhealthy, so long as it doesn’t go too far  But I find myself  psychologically prepared, anyway, for a somewhat slower rate of growth than what the staff has  projected  A more minor fact, following on Governor Jackson--I’m not sure I see quite as much  momentum in the residential construction area as they have continuing through the first quarter  of ’78    You have to move fast to get in    Well, I’d look at this problem in substance  I find  myself, in effect, quite happy with what we did last time  And in some sense I’d like to see those  numbers unchanged, but we’ve had this problem of base drift  What I’d really like to see--I  know you explained to me, Mr Chairman, that this is too difficult to explain--that we retain  somehow the base of the first quarter and say that we don’t see anything very different in the  second quarter, except that we had an overshoot  But over a period of a year ahead, we hope to  recover that     I understand that alternative D produces that arithmetic result a year from now, but I must  say I don’t like that when I see it because it sounds like a more abrupt change in policy than I  really have in mind  The difference must be cosmetic, since you end up in the same place, but  that way of expressing it is not very happy for me  So where I come out--assuming we have to  take a new base in the second quarter--is something like what the staff has for alternative C,  which only varies from your suggestion for M1 and M2, Mr Chairman, in also reducing M2 by  1/2 percent at the lower end of the range, as I understand it       7/19/77 - 39 -     Mr Partee has just expressed some of the concern that I would have of reducing the upper  end of the ranges  I’m not sure we’re going to make it, and I’m not sure we want to act  vigorously enough to be sure we’re going to make it in the face of what could be a slowdown in  the next quarter or so  I’d like to see a little more evidence, anyway  So I’m a little between  your suggestion, Mr Chairman, and those that want to reduce the top end of the range, too     So far as M3 is concerned, I suppose the logic is to do what the staff has said in  [alternative] C, but I also find myself in some agreement there with Mr Partee, and I don’t want  to make it look like we’re making a stronger change than I think in fact I want to  I wouldn’t  object to lowering that range to some degree, but I don’t think I would go quite as far as  alternative C  So I would pick up alternative C on M1 and M2 but moderate the change in M3,  and make that only 1/2 percent, too    Just to add, I think your reasoning is right on this, Mr  Chairman  I don’t think we should put the emphasis on lowering an upper limit and not be  serious about it, because it’s going to get us in all sorts of trouble publicly  I’d put an upper limit  that we mean and put our emphasis on the short-range implementation so that we don’t exceed it  rather than, for public purposes now, put a lower upper limit  At the same time, [it gives] us a  leeway on the lower limit; if the numbers do come in weak, we don’t have to react in the  opposite direction  So I think, in general, that widening the range on the lower side is definitely  the right way to go  I might apply that to M2, too, but I think in substance this is the right  posture we want to be in    Well, I’m not sure we’re willing to do that  It’s  depending on how these numbers come in  I’d be satisfied if we make sure we don’t exceed that  upper limit  And I think that will be the credibility  We’re in danger of losing the credibility by  these overshoots    Can I just qualify this, Mr Chairman?  Is [it] your  implication that we should go above where we are now, right away, if we were at the midpoint in  the aggregates?  We’re below the midpoint in the range you propose    But we’re not at the midpoint of the federal funds range  you now propose    And the midpoint of the range is 5-1/2    But you wouldn’t move right away, and there, as a  practical import, you say until some aggregates evidence can then--    This is the question--     Well, I am at about the same place I think that Steve  Gardner is  I can use the C and D aggregates projections or also go along with Mr Coldwell,  and maybe one or two others, who even went a half a point lower than that  But I agree with  Governor Gardner that we should not increase the federal funds rate to 6 percent without careful  further deliberation  So I also feel strongly that we ought to keep this range 5-1/4 to 5-3/4 and be  prepared to use it up to 5-3/4  But I think the common sense way of expressing it, I guess, is to  retain this asymmetrical midpoint so that we don’t move without some further provocation or  confirmation on the aggregates, which might delay us until after the financing      We might have a better discussion    Mr Chairman, I think I found the staff analysis quite  persuasive this morning, as I guess most people did in a qualitative sense, in terms of the  continuing momentum of the recovery  When my staff puts the numbers together, just following  up in these comments that were just made, they get a slower rate of growth in the second half of  this year, closer to 4-1/2 percent than the 5-1/2 percent, but I take it that there’s no major  disagreement  I don’t see at this stage, nor does my staff, that we can sit here very content that  it’s going to take off again in ’78  I think that remains to be seen  Our actual projections have a  little further slowdown in ’78     I’m not sure where the strength comes from in ’78  I think it’s just too early to say, except  from the kind of analysis that Governor Wallich had  And I think there’s a great deal to that   When I assess the business mood, while I haven’t gotten fresh input in recent weeks, the input  has generally been recently along the lines that Presidents Morris and Balles have already  commented on in terms of uncertainty--more uncertainty than the production trends seem to  justify--which I do think can be traced largely to the profits performance and a feeling that  there’s a certain amount of pressure on prices now  There is ample capacity available, they can’t  raise their prices yet nearly as fast as they would like to, but they hope it’s coming some day   They haven’t seen it, and they feel a little discouraged about their ability to raise prices, which  isn’t a very happy situation from my standpoint     My feeling about the inflation side, in terms of business attitudes, I’m afraid, has been  more one of resignation than real concern  They certainly see it there  They don’t see us--not  the Federal Reserve but the United States--dealing with inflation very effectively--they don’t see  themselves dealing with it very effectively  They see wage demands coming up, and the level of  resistance to those wage demands seems to me to be very low  I have three business directors, as  everybody does  Mine have just had three wage settlements, averaging about 10 percent   They’re all nationwide employers, and I must say I fail to detect the great sense of concern in  any of those three directors over the size of the wage increase they just awarded  They think it’s  in the swing of things, that’s the kind of wage increase you have these days  If you don’t pay it  without too much protest, you’re not doing right by your own company because you may have a  strike, and that’s going to be much worse than paying the same wage increase that they expect all  their competitors to be paying     And this kind of attitude and momentum, which I think we see in the cost figures and  indirectly in the profits figures, it seems to me, continues to present the major challenge for  monetary policy  Some day we’re going to run into a collision  We keep reducing the growth  rate targets [for the monetary aggregates], and if  [money growth does come in within those]  growth rate targets and there hasn’t been any decline in the momentum of cost increase, some  day we’re going to have a problem, and I don’t see yet how this works itself out  Add to that  Governor Wallich’s concerns, which I share to a degree  I don’t know whether he expressed  them as concerns; I think they are a concern in the inflationary context     We have a problem down the road  That’s not being very helpful in terms of our  immediate decision  I share the general feeling that we’re going to have some slowdown, but the     8/16/77 - 14 -           momentum is pretty good  And some slowdown is not a matter of great concern at the moment   This underlying inflationary cost momentum does concern me    I understand from one of my directors, a chairman of an  oil company, gasoline consumption is actually down this summer   SPEAKER(?)  [Unintelligible]    Year-to-year decline    But there’s some other indications of this, too, that travel  is down this summer from last summer  One of our directors is an airline director and travels--     8/16/77 - 19 -            What’s the definition of reasonably?    There’s a pretty fast rate in the first quarter--    Over the past year    It’s true that would have followed a low-velocity  quarter, the current quarter    And the average for the year would be lessened    Wait a minute  In three weeks    It’s got to run through the full moving average    It’s pretty hard to argue that we’ve had a burst of 18  percent or whatever in the money supply, and because we acted against this, the net result is a  decline in inflationary expectations  Maybe so, but--    Okay, you’re just looking at what actually is the--    We do anyway   SPEAKER(?)  [Unintelligible] Regulation A    What are the monetary shocks you were referring to?    I must say, Mr Chairman, if one gets your periodic  reports from examining your tables, and listens to Mr Mayo, and looks at the difference between  A, B, and C of 1/2 percent on the aggregates, and looks at what’s been happening in ranges of  errors of 15 percent, and the estimates are close to it, one has a little sense of futility in picking  between A, B, and C  I ended up, just to cut through all that, exactly where Mr Partee did  I  think it’s right to be tolerant of low growth in the M1 and low growth in M2, and I’ve written  down exactly the same figures he cited, 0 to 5 and 3 to 8, to express that I think our much longer- term problem, as I alluded to earlier, is how we’re going to reconcile getting these aggregates  down over a period of time with the inflationary momentum built into the economy and how we  achieve that without a real shock to the economy  I don’t think we really face that this month       8/16/77 - 44 -           I think I join practically everybody else who’s talked here in pushing interest rates up at  the moment in an effort to further assure we get the aggregates down  But I wouldn’t be allergic,  I think, if the aggregates continue to outrun the kind of range that I just cited  I don’t think that’s  impossible, seeing some further increase here after a little pause  I don’t think I would be that  sensitive to a further increase in rates, particularly against the background--I feel a little bit of the  schizophrenia that you expressed--but I still think, when we can get by with it without setting too  much of an impact on long-term rates, I feel a little more comfortable on balance  So I would be  prepared to see some further increase in rates after a little pause     If the aggregates are exceeding this kind of number with a couple of more weeks  experience, and I don’t know if we can be sure that it’s not--how you express that in terms of a  funds rate, I don’t know  I could live with the range that’s under B and that you cited  I had  thought in terms of 5-3/4 to 6-1/2, with a kind of a 6 percent asymmetrical midpoint expressing  what I just expressed verbally, perhaps a little better  But I could live with it either way  My  principle point is, if the aggregates really show further signs of exceeding where we want to go, I  don’t think we should be unwilling to make some--at least modest--further increase in interest  rates despite the amount we’ve already gone     On the discount rate, I have not thought it was appropriate until now to increase it  I do, at  this point, think the time has come, given the degree of divergence that exists between the  market rate that we, in effect, have manipulated and the existing discount rate  As a matter of  general policy, it’s not compelling in any particular instance  I don’t like the idea of having to  engage in the kind of partly semantic, partly real, I guess, discussion that Governor Jackson had  with President Morris  I would rather keep the discount rate, all things equal, somewhere near  the market rate so you don’t run into that kind of a problem  To the extent it has a signaling  [effect] now, I’d be willing to accept it in terms of our deliberate effort to increase rates here  against the background of a very large increase in aggregates  I think that President Eastburn  already expressed the thought that I have in mind here, that some mild signaling effect, I don’t  think it would be much, is not all together undesirable     I appreciate-- and I think this is the one difficulty--that if a change in the discount rate  appeared to trigger change in other administered rates, we may be in a less satisfactory position  in some context than we would otherwise be  I think, on balance, Mr Kimbrel has the timing  about right on this, and maybe even Thursday’s the afternoon, all things considered, partly  against the danger that the longer you leave it unchanged--if we don’t change to market  rates--we’re in an unsatisfactory gap situation  If the economy is slowing down, it looks  increasingly awkward to raise the discount rate, and we’re left with an unsatisfactory technical  situation, it seems to me, in terms of the amount of the gap    I agree  If it slowed down that much  If we became  concerned over the degree of retardation, I agree with you  If it just kind of slowed down to the  point we weren’t concerned, we wanted to keep the level of market rates, I think this is a fine  judgment--     8/16/77 - 45 -            I don’t think this is an overwhelming case one way or  the other here  But I think the presumption is, you keep the discount rate closer in line with  market rates than it is at present unless you have a pretty strong reason not to  And I’m not sure  we have that stronger reason at the moment    Well, I think technically you might be right  I don’t  think we should be very eager to change the funds rate, and I wouldn’t conceivably go into 6-1/2  until it got above that 5 and 8, for a week or two anyway    I’m still debating that in my mind  I think I probably  feel a 1/2  But I don’t feel very strongly about that    The logic says--in the box we are in with all this  precedence--I think the money market directive expresses the intent of Roger and myself, I  guess, even though I don’t like its cosmetics  I’d rather have a sluggishly behaved aggregates  directive    I expressed a preference for 5-3/4 to 6-1/2, but I am  perfectly satisfied with where we are, Mr Chairman    I just would have guessed that it went back still earlier,  that maybe it was just a change--six years to five    If you get technical about this, what is the Committee’s  policy?  Does it say generally after five years, or does it say January after?    We’ve always done it in January    Well, this is a kind of delicate negotiation  It seems to  me the worst of all positions is to let them take it to court and then we cave  If they take it to  court, it seems to me we probably ought to fight it and see what happens, because we don’t want  the key to the kingdom being taken in case to court    Well, I don’t know how we bring this to a conclusion,  Mr Chairman    Well, we seem to have been going off into different  directions  My own feeling, I think, is pretty close to that expressed by Mr Lilly, that it’s so  close to five years that we can both defend the general five-year policy and release them in the  next few months sometime--at the mutual convenience of the New York Times  But I think we  have to take very seriously your own feeling and argument  I would think the interpretation  could be put the other way, that we were trying to cover up something  But I can understand the     8/16/77 - 71 -           interpretation you put on, and I’m not prepared to say we should push and release the thing if  you feel strongly the other way    Does that letter say that he will get it in January?  Does  it pin it down to January?    [Alternative] four     Let me just interject a question here, Mr Chairman  I  think it’s true that the figures show mortgage outstandings going up very rapidly now, for the  reasons you suggest  I’m just a little puzzled, and I don’t know whether the staff would want to  comment on it, as to whether this is basically a favorable or unfavorable factor?  You’re  suggesting it may be favorable because the basic values are going up and therefore there’s a lot  of room to borrow     9/20/77 - 11 -    I don’t think there’s any question about that aspect  The  question that puzzles me a little bit--I just pose it in the form of a question against the  background of the consumer credit picture that exists--whether this is something we look to  basically as a sustaining factor to the economy through the kind of forecast period you have, or a  kind of danger signal, as something [sustaining] at the moment but, over the course of the next  12 months or more, might suggest that one element of support at present will be diminishing  because people will have borrowed to the extent that the borrowing figure gets too high  It may  be an unanswerable question  But do you have any comment on that?    I was surprised on this point just the other day hearing  [that] the New York bank economists [had] just met with our people, and apparently they were  rather consistently above what I would have expected in terms of more or less optimistic talk   And they were, as I recall, all around 4-1/2 percent for next year on the average, which is pretty  close to where you are    Just a few comments, Mr Chairman, mostly reiterating  what other people have already said, I suppose  I do think this somewhat more restrained view  of the outlook that the staff has presented this time is reasonable  We’re actually a bit more  restrained, but I wouldn’t argue about the difference between them  As I look at the outlook, I  think the favorable side is, it’s very hard to see stagnation or recession in the outlook; some kind  of growth ought to continue  So far as final sales are concerned, I’m not totally reassured when I  see personal income rising more slowly, as it has been, which may reflect back on final demands  at some point  But I certainly do not want to cast any doubt on the basic hypothesis--the  economy is going to continue to expand at a moderate rate of speed, which I think is what we’re  all talking about     The unfavorable side has already been explored--that it doesn’t do much for  unemployment, doesn’t seem to do much for inflation, either, if we believe all these forecasts   And you think pretty hard [about] what we can change in terms of the approach toward monetary  policy to [achieve] this sort of more favorable balance  I don’t think there is much which is  exercising your imagination anywhere in other directions, and that’s already been mentioned by  several people  If I had something really constructive to say in these other directions, I’d say it,  but I don’t think I do at this point     In terms of the kind of risk to the economy and the uncertainty--we’ve already explored  this debt situation  I just want to repeat from my viewpoint what has already been said by one or  two others, beginning with Alan Holmes--the foreign economic situation looks distinctly less  favorable  I don’t think we can forever be an island of expansion [if] the rest of the world isn’t  expanding  I think the rest of the world may be still expanding, but it looks pretty marginal to  me  I’m not quite sure [how much] foreign expansion is built into the staff’s projections   Therefore, I don’t know whether you fully allowed for the degree of potential weakness that I  see there, which could feed back on us directly through the trade picture; and that does not look  very optimistic in your projections, so I assume you’ve got a good part of [the] feeding-back  anyway     I think there’s always a danger in this situation of some exchange market unsettlement  when the current account deficit gets as big as it has been  We’ve been pretty well shielded from  that just because of the coincidence of our interest rates firming a bit, while in many European  countries they’ve been declining  I think one of the things as we move ahead, [and] we may  have to worry about it at some point--I think it’s worked out fine so far--is what weight we give  these interest rate relationships in terms of shading our own policy in one direction or another  I  do feel we’re somewhat vulnerable to what could be psychologically disturbing fluctuations in  exchange rates anyway  I’m not going to predict that’s going to happen, but I think we’re on a  little less certain ground than I would like to see when this foreign trade balance reaches the size  deficit that our projections [show will] continue    Well, I suppose what I see is [that] the immediate  circumstances are a little flatter than I foresaw  And I wonder what that portends for the future      9/20/77 - 23 -   I don’t see many sources of confident optimism about what’s going on abroad  I don’t have a  good feel, and maybe somebody in the staff does, for the impact of the German program    It’s true of the UK  I don’t think that was true of  France    Well, I was going to start with the comment that Mr  Eastburn ended up with  I think it’s easier to figure out what we want to do on the low side of all  these things than perhaps the upside  Although the general intention is clear enough all around, I  guess, to make the end as low as you can stomach for presentation purposes; and I certainly buy  yours--a little lower, if people want them  And I wouldn’t want to see the federal funds in this  period, I think, go below 6--so that [covers] all the low ranges  I think we ought to bias the  presumption of what’s going to happen against the current projections in the way you’ve  proposed initially     I can’t get too excited whether the upper end of the range is 7 percent for M1 and 8 percent  for M2, because the difference of 1 percent seems to be very small compared with the  fluctuations we have anyway, from week to week and month to month  I certainly could accept,  and I think prefer, the ranges you proposed initially  I feel comfortable with a 6 to 6-1/2 percent  range; I feel comfortable with a 6-1/4 percent midpoint there, too, implying you go there  relatively soon if nothing else changed  And I accept the personal corollary of that, that I feel  quite comfortable with a 6-3/4 percent high end of the range at this point, given the way we  biased this to go up within the range anyway, and saying we’re very likely going to then hit  6-3/4 percent  I’m not all that sure I want to hit 6-3/4 percent unless we had a really big bulge,  in which case we could reconsider  So I feel the upper end of that range should be 6-1/2 percent  I also am sympathetic, given what’s happened in the rather erratic movements of M1, putting  more weight on M2 somehow or another here    My problem is, Mr Chairman, I am not sure I would  take the same view in the long run  My comment is directed for the particular short-run  situation    No  I think that is essentially it    My one comment is perhaps along the line which Steve  Gardner already said  But where I balk with the 6-3/4 [percent federal funds rate], if that’s still  an open question--if you got an aggregate right on the margin of this range that we’re adopting,  6-3/4 seems to me to be inappropriate  It wouldn’t seem to me to be inappropriate if we had an  October the way we had a July and April, and I would be prepared to go at that point  But the  way we formulate these things, you can’t make that distinction  It does seem to me that 6-3/4  percent is clearly too high, given the projection right at the top where the ranges--    You’d almost have to say you go to 6-3/4 percent right  away    With a 6-1/2     On this point, how do you assess the competitive  position and the changes therein in the past two years or so?    You’re looking at overall indexes    There is no question  I just commented, you’re looking  at overall what, wholesale price indexes?    I don’t know what conclusions you would reach on this  basis     10/17-18/77 - 4 -          And ours showed more    Just a couple of comments on the international situation,  since you asked  I rather share the feeling Governor Coldwell already expressed--these export  figures look pretty optimistic against the background of the prospective growth trends abroad, as  I see them, and I think that points up the probability that downward pressures on the dollar are  more likely to appear than upward pressure  And I think that’s part of our problem  We’re  living in a world in which that can be financed, and maybe fairly readily financed  But while the  current account is so far in deficit, unless it shows decided signs of improvement, we’re  vulnerable to psychological weakness, which could be self-reinforcing until these figures turn  around  And I don’t think there is any clear prospect that they’re going to turn around in the  next 12 months    Well, I don’t think it will hold it down to the same  extent it has  It will tend to level off     10/17-18/77 - 6 -          I think that’s what’s been happening, might continue--if  not--    Well, Mr Partee has pretty much made my speech at  this point  Let me say that I think the staff forecast doesn’t seem at all unreasonable to me  But  it is higher than what my people have been forecasting in New York by about 1 percent[age  point] for calendar year 1978  And while I think it could reach the staff’s projection here, I think  there are grounds for being more cautious     And let me just state pretty much what Governor Partee just did in a slightly different way   Consumption is most of the GNP  Everybody pretty much anticipates that the saving rate is  going to go up, and the staff knows, as we do, that it has been pretty low  You’ve got to generate  income at a faster rate of speed and consumption to keep this thing going  If that’s correct, are  all these other sectors going to generate the income that’s necessary to reach that consumption  figure?  When you look down at the items that are crucial, you come up with the same ones that  have just been questioned  We’re particularly lower on housing, although I think a good defense  has been made of the housing projections here  That’s the biggest single difference we have   But we are lower in all these other things, marginally, right along the line     The investment thing, it seems to me, is being affected at the moment by about as sour a  business climate in relation to the political scene as I remember in a long while  And that may  not last--I think it’s being overdone  But I certainly get a strong feeling of discouragement  reflected by the businessmen that I talked to about what they think they see going on in  Washington, and exaggerated or not, I’m beginning to think it’s had some impact in what they’re  saying they’re going to do about capital spending next year  I still hope that that will evaporate,  but the stock market thing complicates the situation too  It doesn’t make anybody feel happy,  and I think both those situations may have to improve to get as good a business investment  picture next year as the staff has projected     You already mentioned  net exports, but in the short run I do think the key is inventory   The thing there is a little more mixed than I thought it was a while ago, in the sense that you can  read the retail figures at least as being a little high, mainly because the retail trade has leveled  off--not drastically so  The rest of the inventory picture looks pretty good to me, but I think we  are counting, even in our projection, even more so in the staff’s projection, on a pretty prompt  turnaround in the inventory picture here, and we haven’t seen it yet, and before I get too  optimistic, I want to see it take place  That, combined with the settling down of this political  thing, may bring us around to the staff’s view pretty promptly  But we’re not there yet       10/17-18/77 - 25 -         I might tell Mr Winn that the medallion price wouldn’t be so good if the taxi industry was  regulated by the SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission], I suspect, and they thought the  [unintelligible] was going to go out of business    He didn’t say he wanted a large appreciation--    --but that’s the way it was interpreted    He was making an analytic point and got interpreted as a  policy position    We obviously face the most difficult dilemma that we’ve  had for a couple of years in deciding what to do here  I must confess, as I look back just a little  bit, not understanding everything that’s been going on, I am not unhappy with the actions we  took over the past three or four months  If, in effect, we have to compromise between two kinds  of consideration, and that it was, in the end, correct to compromise between them, and we get  criticized from both sides, as Mr Kimbrel suggested--I don’t think that’s assurance that we took  the right path, but it’s not inconsistent with that notion     In terms of where we go, I think my principal point would be that we should not reduce the  upper end of M1 in these particular circumstances  I think if we did it, and we didn’t meet it, we  do have a credibility problem  If we did it, that really symbolizes--and we’re really only talking  about a symbol, I guess, when we’re talking about a 1/2 percent[age point] difference--but given  what’s happened, seems to me if we reduce it, it implies a very aggressive action in the short run  in terms of a new commitment to meet that lowered upper limit  Unless we’re prepared to take  it, I don’t think we ought to reduce the upper limit  And I would not reduce the upper limit     10/17-18/77 - 52 -         [because], pretty much paralleling Governor Partee’s reasoning, we don’t know too well what’s  going on; our best position may be to leave it unchanged     I would reduce somewhat the M2 and M3 ranges, and there seems to be a consensus on  that, and I suppose I can express my feeling that anything down to the B alternative here is all  right with me  What you suggested, Mr Chairman, is also all right at the other end, with a very  modest change  I find myself, preferably I guess, right in the middle  I put down the same  numbers as Governor Partee’s just recited--6-1/2 to 9 and 8 to 10-1/2  I thought Governor  Coldwell and Governor Wallich--particularly Governor Coldwell, I guess--had an interesting  argument on widening these ranges, and I would accept his numbers, too  And I guess I’m  happy any place in that area between the change that you recommended and the B alternative      We’ve all had a cookie    I expressed some happiness earlier about [our having]  compromised pretty well between different considerations  I am a little fearful, as some other  people have suggested, that alternative B, taken straight out a little bit, ceases compromising and  doesn’t give enough weight to the risk that the aggregates are going to be high and a sufficient     10/17-18/77 - 61 -         response to that  So I found myself preferring the aggregates numbers in B, as other people have  said, the expectation being that we are more likely to be in the upper side of that than the lower  side  The New York forecasts, for some reason, are quite a bit above the Board’s forecasts  I am  not going to attribute any more weight to them, but they are at least consistent with the suspicion  that has been expressed around the table     I had thought of combining that, maybe going to a kind of peculiar exchange here, to a  6-1/2 to 7 funds rate as other people have suggested  [Unintelligible]  I’d put the midpoint  firmly at 6-1/2 percent [unintelligible] at the extreme  But I would still use the aggregates  suggested because, if interest rates do go up, we’re in effect putting the onus on the aggregates   That’s the reason we’re raising it, and you can convey that message a little better with an  aggregates directive, but I don’t think that’s crucial     And I differ from what President Guffey just said only in not going off to 6-5/8  immediately; 6-1/4 to 7 percent [also] looks all right to me, and I’d still leave the midpoint at  6-1/2  If you really put the funds rate as in the B alternative, then I’d put the aggregates ranges  lower and bias it that way and kind of go for the C aggregates and the B funds rate  I could salve  my conscience in the sense of biasing a little bit in that direction that way  But I basically think  the 6-1/2 to 7 or 6-1/4 to 7, understood to be about the same [unintelligible] is the right way to  do it  I am not very anxious to see [the funds rate] get to 7, but I could imagine these aggregates  being high enough so that we might want to do even that during this period  It’s a pretty high  aggregate      I understand the sensitivity [unintelligible] because in  some ways I share it myself  But it would make me more comfortable, and I believe it would  make some other people more comfortable, recognizing that everybody’s first preference is for  the [alternative] B--almost everybody’s--for the [alternative] B M1 and M2 ranges; it would  make me more comfortable with that federal funds rate to shade down the aggregates ranges and  get a little bias in that direction while maintaining a 6-3/4 percent [federal funds rate] limit   Mostly symbolic, I suppose, but a little shading in that direction      I will make it a little more complete on the basis of this  discussion  6-1/4 to 6-3/4 with the C aggregates, and the money market directive if that makes  more people happy     Perhaps in the interest of speeding this--now my  inclination is very similar to yours in changing the directive  It seems to me, in any event, the  kind of subtleties that Mr Mayo is talking about, we can only determine in the light of what  substantive decision we make here today--    --and I propose that this be deferred until we arrive at  our decision and look and see how we want to word the directive    We’re renewing the swap--it’s implicit    I continue to feel that the staff projection is not at all  unreasonable, but I also think it’s on the high side of the range of probabilities that I  foresee--progressively so as time goes on next year  Obviously there’s time to still have a lot of  things happen and affect the latter part of next year, but at present I don’t think we see the kinds  of developments clearly in prospect in either construction or the business investment side to  make me think that the staff estimate, as time passes, becomes the center of the range of  probabilities  Governor Wallich already pointed out that the budgetary situation, barring any tax  changes, is running against, I think, renewed vigor in the latter part of next year  So I have a  somewhat more cautious view than the staff, although their figures are certainly in the ranges of  probabilities that I see    I continue to be quite satisfied with the compromise we  struck in recent meetings  And now, with projections, at least for the money supply, a little more  conservative, I see no reason to make a change  And the suggestions you made are certainly  along the lines of my own thinking  I do think we ought to not move off the 6-1/2 [percent  midpoint of the federal funds rate range] very readily, particularly in the downward direction  I  was going to propose 1 to 7 for M1, partly to reinforce the point of not moving down very  readily       11/15/77 - 35 -         Let me make a statistical point  An examination that we made recently of the range of  fluctuations of M1 as compared to M2 suggests that if the 4 point range for M2 is appropriate, a  6 point range for M1 is appropriate  That gives about the same chances of running outside the  range for both of them, according to recent experience, so that’s kind of an additional reason for  the 1 to 7, or thereabouts, proposal    I could take either, too, Mr Chairman  The only thing I  would say if we run an aggregates directive, I would like it interpreted as a rather sluggish  aggregates directive--that we didn’t move too fast     I don’t think I have anything to add, Mr Chairman     Well, except, presumably, the second decision would  come at a time when we would have otherwise changed the federal funds rate anyway, and they  would have seen it in the market  Now they will see it out of our mouths as well as in the  market, which changes it somewhat, but I don’t think it changes it from night to day      But this has--    We do it in recognition [that there] may have to be more  frequent adjustments    Just to put it pointedly, do we have to publish our  projections?  Which we haven’t    At this point, it’s meant quite literally, I think, to mean  at the point we’re ready    This strikes me as the perfect example, Mr Chairman, of  [unintelligible], we may say we want to consider [unintelligible] substantive issues, but we can’t  avoid getting into the substantive issues  And I’m not prepared to sit here and say we always  want a 1 percent[age point] spread  There may be times when I positively don’t want the interest  rates to go that far; therefore, I wouldn’t want to get locked in permanently to that large a spread  because of this publication need, which I think is why we came out the other way  We can  always change a narrow spread, but you can’t narrow the wider spread until the damage is done     It may not show for four months    [The Congress] might just say, you are a damn fool   You could have done something different--    I want to say a few words about the relevance of the  foreign exchange situation for our general policy probably later, but it does seem to me this  intervention has been something of a rear-guard action, necessary but still not very impressive in  turning the market sentiment  I myself doubt that you’re going to do that by intervention  You  never can tell in terms of the psychology of the market at the moment, but everyone does seem to  be confused about what the [unintelligible] posture of the United States is, and you’ve got to put  this in a context     It seems to me some coherent statement of policy, not just involving the Federal Reserve,  [is needed] if intervention, to the extent that’s desirable and necessary, is going to have the  maximum impact in reversing the psychology  There aren’t a great many things that can be  done, I fully recognize  I think there are some things that could be done and certainly some  attitudes that could be expressed that would maximize the chances of intervention having some  leverage  I don’t think that has been the condition under which we have been operating in the  last month, which has made it very difficult  Hopefully, that might change     You have touched upon a number of the points, the most  basic points, that I had in mind, Mr Chairman  There was some reference made earlier to  economic growth, and I think the feeling that this is a free ride for us or even positively helpful is  not right in the current circumstances--given the level of the dollar--in large part for the reasons  that you suggested, including the uncertainty about oil prices and the general economic  uncertainty     But more specifically, you get an inflationary impact on the United States which, I think, is  not measurable but undeniable  And partly psychologically as well as through its direct effects  in terms of the trade balance, I think this has certainly reached a point where the concern in some  of the other major economies, specifically Japan and Germany, may affect their investment  activity and economic activity, and that may have a sharper [negative] effect on our trade  balance in the short run than any [positive] effect of the change in the currency value itself     You referred to the political uncertainties and problems surrounding gold  I think the  decline in the dollar itself is becoming a political problem that can’t be ignored  And the  volatility of the market is presenting us with some unknown risks, harking back to [the closing of  the] Herstatt [bank] and all the rest, that we don’t know about  But it can make one a little bit  nervous when one sees the amount of speculative activity that has been spawned in recent weeks   And of course, for many US companies [with] operations abroad, it has a direct impact on their  profits  And it makes an already not-very-robust profit picture look worse in terms of reported  profits--     12/19-20/77 - 38 -          Hedge    I think this is not uniform  But you find a number of  major companies seem to be on the side that they weren’t assuming a big depreciation  They  were not fully hedged, and now they get hedged and it kind of multiplies the market impact  The  only other point I would make is, given all these other things, the threat of protection in these is,  I think, alive in the world, not just in the United States  And I really think this degree of  volatility and the degree of decline in the dollar makes this situation even more threatening than  it would otherwise be     None of this adds up to a great support for domestic expansion in terms of the situation  that exists  So I do indeed think it’s a situation that can’t be shrugged off in terms of our own  policy determinations  And the considerations are not all one way, to say the least, in terms of  economic growth as well as in other countries     Well, it seems to me, anyway, a very relevant question,  which maybe we should defer until we talk about the policy implications  I alluded to that  earlier when I said I wanted to make a comment connecting the two  But I think in logic it’s  probably better when you’re talking about how it affects our policy to defer it until we get to the  policy      --as opposed [to] the intervention policy    I’m not so sure a distinction can be made--    There hasn’t been much, I agree    You’re an optimist if you can say three policy changes  are going to take place    You haven’t got any specific recommendation at this  point--unless there are other matters--do you?     You’ve got that specific thing which we have to act  upon--    I think we just have to note this, but I would conclude  from the earlier discussion that nobody’s talking about any drastic changes, or any changes at all,  in the basic intervention approach, and we do have to approve, ratify, and confirm the last  transaction; can I take it that that’s done?  And that we have noted this renewal with the swap  business, and you are operating on the presumption that the basic approach is unchanged?      It opens another 300 without the subcommittee acting on  it--    Well, I don’t think we can predict the amount    If the subcommittee approves it    Well, I think that’s what we have been doing  I think  it’s a question of what’s overdoing, I suppose  But given the markets as they’ve existed, the  amount has not been very large    Well, that’s not purely a question of how rapidly, I  think; it’s where it is in absolute terms  You get down another 10 percent on the mark from  where it now is, you’re down to around to $185 or something, which raises some rather more  pointed questions    Well, I’d be surprised if you really wanted to quantify  this very precisely    It’s clear in the context that the general approach  remains as it has been, which certainly has been cautious and subject to day-to-day appraisal in  the market  And on that understanding I think we can go to the domestic side now    [Chairman Burns returns to the meeting]   [To Chairman Burns]  I got you up to agenda item 4    That’s right  There is some difference of opinion  I  really should have had New York balancing Texas  I could even add northern New Jersey   However, Fairfield County [Connecticut] is booming; Stamford has more headquarters than  Houston, I think  It’s all moving out of New York City  But in general terms--the staff starting  out by saying things look better now--I think they clearly do  In fact, I’m inclined to think the  numbers will come out higher than they have projected for the next couple of quarters  So I have  no disagreement with the tone of things there, maybe a little stronger     However, as you move out [further into the projection period], I guess I would still say the  staff case is not proven, and we think the likelihood is slower growth  They already have growth  tapering off slightly during ’78, mainly because we don’t share the optimism at this stage on  further increases in residential construction, and we are inclined to accept the survey evidence on  plant and equipment at this point  There’s a possibility of a considerably sharper slowing during  the course of ’78  As others have pointed out, that’s without the tax stimulus, and I think that  that is important  It could turn out better on those grounds alone     The only point I would make in this connection, when I look at some of the discussion in  the Bluebook and elsewhere, and anticipating a little bit the later discussion, looking toward  higher interest rates to keep the aggregates in line, reaching as high as 7-3/4 percent--if it is at all  true that the economy will show a risk of slower growth than the staff shows, as we think, and  you get some fiscal stimulus on top of that and a bigger budget deficit, it may be hard to take  action at that time to keep the aggregates down if the economy is both looking sluggish and you  have a bigger budgetary deficit at the same time  I just note that as a possible hazard for the  future [and part of our] not sharing the degree of buoyancy that the staff has as 1978 wears on   Although we agree that it’s quite buoyant at the moment    I saw something about buying copper but selling  aluminum, I think, which seems to make sense in the current situation    Well, my way of ending where you are, essentially, Mr  Chairman--I guess I do want to state for the record, or otherwise, that I think we should take  account of what’s going on in the international markets and the need to attract capital for a long  period of time to maintain confidence in that area  I can’t really separate domestic and  international in this situation, and I don’t think it’s at all antigrowth to say that we should take  the international into account  Because I think it’s ambiguous, at the least, as to what this  exchange rate decline is doing to growth, and I think the unfavorable consequences, viewed  broadly, outweigh the favorable ones  And it’s always very difficult politically to put it into this  context of taking account of the international, and I’ve had enough experience around here to  know how difficult it is  But I think we ought to face up to it and be aware of what’s going on  there in making up our policy, and I don’t think it’s at all inconsistent with the domestic     And most of the noises I hear around here are more optimistic on the domestic economy  than I personally feel as you get out longer  I personally feel optimistic in the short run  So I  share your feeling  I’d hate to see interest rates go down here  I’m not particularly looking for  them to go up, but if we got provoked by the movement of the aggregates or indeed provoked  enough by the exchange markets, I think we ought to swallow that, too     So in practice I’d come out just about where you were Mr Chairman  I would be inclined  to maybe even go half a point lower--that puts me halfway with Mr Eastburn, I guess--and make  it 2 to 8 percent on the M1, but that’s a marginal difference  I would urge that we do recognize  the international in the directive itself  There is a sentence proposed about taking account of  emerging conditions in the financial markets, and I would feel very strongly that we ought to  make an overt reference to international financial markets or the exchange markets in this  particular instance in amplifying that sentence  Because I think it is a relevant consideration in  our policy, and we ought to recognize it    The trouble with that is, if they come in low you are  forced to move it lower and we don’t want to--    I’d really like an aggregates directive on the upside and  a money market directive on the downside  Can’t have that?   SPEAKER(?)  I’d join Paul    If I may say, Mr Chairman, I think not the discount rate  itself but the approval of loans; but the whole thing is going to be very troublesome    We had a long discussion at our board meeting last  week, and I think there are a great many problems here that are going to need some discussion     I agree with that, Mr Chairman  This is Paul Volcker   I’ve looked at these figures and they are obviously fluctuating  They have tended to be on the  strong side [in marks], which is natural in a declining market, but I haven’t seen anything that  indicates positions of a magnitude or character that are at all threatening to the banks  There isn’t  anything that’s out of order with their normal trading instincts      Yes      If I can interject here, it’s Paul Volcker  I don’t think that  question is completely answerable by any means      Well, [we were] talking about banks in the earlier  discussion and I think maybe that gets this a little out of perspective  We’re talking about the  psychology of the whole market--banks and other people      You don’t know sometimes whether they are acting as  agents or principals  But we’ve had a great psychological wave against the dollar and we hope to  repair that      May I inject just one other thought, Mr Chairman?  I  think the success of this whole operation is not going to hinge on intervention entirely in the short  run, although that’s the motivation for the immediate change  I think all those things that we  worried about before--oil and even domestic monetary policy--are very relevant here and I don’t  think we ought to lose sight of that      We have accomplished quite a bit with what we had, Mr  Chairman       I don’t mean me, personally      Happy New Year      Compromise on 210       Well, just a couple of observations, Mr Chairman  I think   all the evidence we have suggests that this trade balance is going to be hard to turn around in any  short period of time  And all the evidence we’ve had since 1971 on the exchange rate changes  doesn’t suggest that changes come very quickly  The aggregate demand side is very important and  we do have a problem of changes in the exchange rate--in some key countries anyway--possibly  aggravating the prospects for expansion in those countries and [thus] having a bigger effect on the  trade balance short run than the price effects of the depreciation will     But, I’d like also to look through the other end of the telescope, as it were, in connection with   your observation  I think you’ve made a fair observation that if things aren’t done right, we’re not  going to have private capital inflow at present exchange rates  But I would hope that the converse  is also true  If people have a reasonable degree of confidence in what we’re doing--and confidence  has obviously been very low--and if they have some sense of stability about the exchange rate, it is  possible to get a private capital inflow that would finance the current account deficit at a reasonably  stable exchange rate  But it’s not going to come automatically  Things have to be done to inspire  the confidence that the exchange rate will indeed be stable      Well, if the figures I have in front of me are correct, we   had a positive errors and omissions of almost $10 billion in ’76, and a minus, which includes some  guessing, of $3-1/2 billion in ’77  That is a swing of $12 billion or so  Most of the year, of course,  had been exceptionally high positives in ’76, so I don’t know if we’ll go back to that      One man’s speculator is another man’s hedger     I would note that the Committee in between meetings   raised the aggregate limit on its exposure from $1 billion to $1-1/2 billion, as I recall  We’re now  within $275 million of that  I hope you don’t need [additional leeway] if the last two days are a  minor omen but when one looks at the perspective to the next meeting I raise the question of  whether it would be prudent to raise that limit to give us a little more normal leeway  That limit is  actually the binding limit now  We’d normally have a $500 million leeway between meetings, but  this aggregate limit would not provide us with a $500 million leeway between meetings      It would have to be canvassed in any event with the $500   million limit [on transactions between meetings]  But this overall aggregate limit that exists  “permanently” is at present closer than the $500 million normal intermeeting limit  My question is  whether they might be brought into alignment, so to speak      Even with the tax cut?     Do we now have the option, Mr Chairman, even if the   letter arrives, of replying to the letter and saying that in view of this note [indicating] that he’s  going to be inviting Mr Miller [to testify] after the next meeting that we didn’t want to make the  decision [today on the longer-run ranges]?      To a very minor degree     My reading of this, for what it’s worth, Mr Chairman, is   that I had not recognized some of the ebullience that has been expressed earlier around this table  about capital spending; it was not reflected in my business contacts by and large  I have not  noticed any distinct change but, if anything, I think there is some strengthening recently in that the  worst things that people expected to happen around the middle of [last] year have not happened and  the economy looks a little better  [As for] capital spending, [businessmen] seem to feel a little  more confident about it than they did last summer      December and January, I find difficult--     Well, when I listened to the staff, Mr Chairman, I was   going to make a very brief comment--and I’ll still keep it brief--that the overall pattern of the  projection is reasonable to me  And maybe that’s enough  [As for] modifications, when I heard  Mr Coldwell right off the bat, his modifications were in the direction that I would make them-- with perhaps more rapid growth in the first half and slower growth in the second half  I don’t come  away at this point with quite the same feeling of a threat of recession or quasi recession in late ’78  or early ’79 that he expressed, assuming this tax cut does come on stream as the staff has projected  So, while I would in my mind modify the pattern somewhat in that direction, I think it’s fair to say  that the overall pattern that’s projected here I don’t find at all troublesome      Just a word about the stock market and profits and plant and equipment [expenditures]  It   does seem to me that those price earnings ratios are so low in part because the stock market has  come to realize that the profits aren’t real when they are being compared there--that real profits are  overstated  That is another way of referring to the profits problem, which you already referred to   And much does hinge, I think, on the outlook for plant and equipment--not so much [over most of]  this year perhaps as the very end of the year and continuing into next year--[in terms of] the  sustainability of the recovery on improving profits  Again, the tax program we get obviously will  bear upon that  I’m assuming that that will be reasonably satisfactory [and I’m] thinking that the  danger of a recession at this point is not great      Well, I will be assisted by the fact that it has been long   enough since some of this technical stuff came up that some of the details will recede into my  unconscious instead of the conscious  I think the issues are simple enough here  We have  discussed the role of the Federal Reserve and these RP agreements at some length for foreign  accounts  This is a matter which is controlled by the Federal Open Market Committee, and  whoever does it--the New York Bank either acting for the System account or acting for itself--  needs the authority of the Open Market Committee  The issue that arose, you will recall, is that  there is some doubt about their tax status  A couple of months ago we got a ruling from the IRS  that the tax status was all right, assuming that the Federal Reserve is acting as principal  They call  these loans consistent with their earlier tax rulings  If the loan is made with the United States and  even more with the Federal Reserve in one form or another injected as principal, we fall under the  exemption that says that for a government instrumentality [such] transactions are exempt from  withholding tax  So, we are cleared on tax grounds and proceeding  We have had experience in  doing these with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as principal for the System Open Market  Account  The earlier practice was to do these with the New York Bank as principal when the  System account was not operating When the System Account was operating in the market anyway,  we’d do it through the System account When the question arose as to the tax status, all of them  were channeled through the System account and that has been the practice for the last six months or  so      I would summarize by saying that after analyzing the technical side of this I don’t think it   makes much difference which way we do it  There are very minor advantages and disadvantages  that seem to be offsetting  I don’t think that’s a distinction that we need to linger over, but the  question does seem to me to be one of what public posture we want to take, and that is related in a  sense to a legal question of what authority we think is necessary for the Committee to openly give  either the Bank or the System account  We can technically operate in a satisfactory way with any  of the options that are presented in the memorandum         1/17/78             38  The options, very briefly--there are four of them--consist of the following  The first option  assumes that we do them all through the System account and wouldn’t [involve] anything in terms  of changing the directive  The directive vaguely talks about international as well as domestic  matters and we don’t explicitly have to say anything  We can just do what we’ve been doing for  the past six months  The second option also assumes they’d all go through the System account but  it would explicitly change the directive to give recognition to that  The third option says return to  the previous practice where they would be done in the name of the New York Bank as principal--it  was as agent earlier--when the System account is not operating and do it through the System  account when the System account is operating  Explicit notice and authority would be given to the  New York Bank to act as principal in these transactions  The System account side would not be  touched And, Mr O’Connell, in looking at this [proposal prefers] the fourth option, which would  in effect make it explicit on both sides  That is, the Committee gives authority both to the New  York Bank and to the System account to operate in these repurchase agreements for foreign  accounts on the assumption that we would revert to the earlier practice of the New York Bank  doing it when the System account is not operating and the System account doing it when the  System account is otherwise operating     The questions that I think are relevant here are (1) Is there any substantive difference   between these approaches or technical differences in the approach to the market?  My answer to  that is there is no significant difference between any of these  (2)  Should we state the authority  explicitly and in effect give public notice?   My own feeling is yes--that that’s the clean and open  way to do it and we shouldn’t hide behind this very vague directive we now have, which does  vaguely refer to international developments, but I think in a different context  So, my own feeling  is that we should [give] explicit notice of whatever we do  (3) Should we run it all through the  System account?  My own preference is to revert to the earlier practice to avoid any question ever  arising that in some sense the System account is being distorted, not for pure open market  operations to affect the reserve base or domestic level of interest rates or for purposes of affecting  international markets in the most general sense  [Unintelligible] some question arising of whether  we are distorting what’s going through the System account in order to take care of this essentially  procedural and operational matter for foreign central banks  So, answering the questions in that  way, I do have a preference and I have recommended to the Committee that we take either option  three or four  I have no very clear preference between those two  Four is a little more inclusive in  that it ends any possible question about the authority of the System account itself to operate  I  don’t think that is necessary in the light of past history  Three just gives the authority directly to  the New York Bank  In either event, I would visualize that we would operate, as I said, through the  New York Bank when the System account is not otherwise engaged  When the System account is  otherwise engaged and, therefore, it’s a convenience for the System account also to handle these  foreign transactions, it will handle the foreign transactions  So, I would recommend that as the  substantive way to proceed--either option three or four does that--and it’s entirely a matter of how  inclusive you want to be in stating the authority  I don’t know whether Mr O’Connell wants a  word on the preference between options three and four      I might just add one further point, Mr Chairman  We had   some discussion earlier when this came out about the appropriateness of charging for this service   From my point of view, we would intend to charge in the future a 2 basis point charge  The market  practice--where private investment companies might do this for foreigners, including foreign  central banks--seems to be to charge either nothing or something up to 5 basis points, with some  obviously in between, [generally] a 1 or 2 basis point charge  A 2 basis point charge, according to  our analysis, would clearly cover our cost and more than cover our cost  The remainder I would  think of as perhaps a very minor charge for acting as principal in these transactions, and there is  some theoretical risk  I don’t think it’s more than theoretical; if the dealers on the other end don’t  deliver the securities, we would have to make good, and that is only theoretical  The securities are  there to margin the account; they do margin the account in effect, but for acting as principal I think  we can justify some charge  Part of the philosophy that would lie behind the charge, which I  interpreted the Committee as being in favor of earlier, is that we have no interest in competing with  the private market unnecessarily  and some little charge reflects that concept as well as making it  clear that we would cover any costs involved      Either way     Essentially that day, as [the Desk’s management] plans   their operations  If they’re going to be withdrawing reserves, this is a way of withdrawing them  anyway  This gives them an option  If they’re going to be supplying reserves, they might as well  supply a few more to take care of this      I think the earlier experience--if I remember correctly,   Peter--was that about two-thirds went through the System account and one-third through the Bank   Now, that is partly because of the tax and loan accounts; the Treasury accounts at the Federal  Reserve have been moving up and down so much  If that were steadied, that proportion might shift  some, I suppose      We’re just a pass-through except that we act as principal   for tax purposes this way     Mr Chairman, perhaps in January it’s worth a sentence or   two in looking back at the previous year  Governor Gardner referred to the ghosts that we saw   Maybe some of them were more than ghosts, but I know I found myself thinking that we had  produced the right compromise here repeatedly  I guess I’ve expressed that view in past meetings   Looking back at the year as a whole and looking at what’s going on now, I must confess as a  backdrop that I wish we’d been just slightly more affirmative on keeping the aggregates under  control on the basis of all that we now know  Just to come up to date in looking at our recent  action, which was clearly triggered by international considerations, I find myself feeling that that’s  not really inappropriate on domestic grounds either, against what we see as the current and at least  fairly near-term six-month prospective strength in economic activity The little boost that we see  now in M1, against the earlier overshoots, [is one reason for] the concern that I have that we may     1/17/78             43  face the problem of overshoots in the future     Our interest rate projections have not been good but they all go in the direction of [our] facing   the probability of needing somewhat higher interest rates as we move ahead  So, against all that,  I’m not unhappy even on domestic grounds with the action that was taken recently  I do think we  have a general problem, which Mr Roos I think referred to most strongly earlier, of credibility or  confidence in terms of what we are doing to the aggregates  So, qualitatively, I feel pretty  comfortable with one view of what we should be doing now--certainly not [move] lower as you just  said in terms of interest rates in view of the international situation and I would say even the  domestic situation  I do not feel that necessarily any further steps should be taken right now and I  don’t counsel that  But I do feel that if the aggregates show much sign of life here in the weeks  ahead, we ought not to delay a move and we ought to react pretty promptly to it at least in a modest  way     Now I translate that into the numbers  Boy, it’s hard sometimes to get these qualitative   thoughts into numbers and I have somewhat the feeling I expressed last time--that we [should] have  a money market directive on the downside and an aggregate directive on the upside  But instead of  proposing anything so radical as that, it seems to me that something like the “C” specifications on  the aggregates are in the right direction and express the view that we should be slow, very slow to  ease--in fact, should not ease in this period--but be alert on the upside  In fact, I would prefer on  the M1, not on the M2 I think, to even go a half percent lower--make it 1-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent  On  the federal funds rate, at the risk of being accused of fine-tuning, I think my qualitative view could  be best expressed by saying a range of something like 6-5/8 to 7-1/8 percent would be appropriate  with a 6-3/4 percent midpoint  So, in effect, I’d not give ourselves room to move down but give  ourselves a little room to move up  The alternative, I suppose, would be something like 6-1/2 to  7-1/4 percent  That widens the funds rate range  It bothers me a little bit in terms of the discussion  we had last month about keeping the federal funds rate range at the moment at a half [percentage  point]  Also, it may connote on the high side the possibility of going higher than I really mean at  this particular point in time, so I guess I would state, at the risk of a fine-tuning accusation, a range  of 6-5/8 to 7-1/8 percent with the 6-3/4 midpoint  And I think an aggregates directive under those  circumstances would be appropriate      If that’s the correct arithmetic  I’m not sure I know how to   do that!     It takes three decimal points to go in eighths; I know that     If there is any confusion about what I meant by 6-5/8 to   7-1/8 percent, Mr Chairman--     What I mean is Mr Partee’s 6-3/4 to 7 percent     Can Mr Sternlight assume in that interpretation that we   leave a phrase about the international situation in the directive?     Mr Chairman, if I may have a point of personal privilege,   as Vice Chairman of this Committee  I remember when I was first elected  When I arrived here  you told me--indeed you announced to the Committee--that the job wasn’t going to be very     1/17/78             52  onerous  And I think that prediction, as many others, was borne out  I did get the minutes accepted  a couple of times, I think  I may even have gotten some transactions that were already completed  accepted once or twice  It wasn’t more than twice, I’m sure  But you know in another way, I felt  this was a very onerous job, Mr Chairman, psychologically  Every time one thought one was  prepared to make a brilliant or even sensible point, the Chairman would make it more eloquently  and state it more effectively  He always anticipates you  He’s always better prepared  And he  brought an enormous experience in analyses of business cycles and a judgment that I think is  clearly matched by no one else around the table or outside this table  In a way, that was  psychologically onerous but it certainly made all our jobs much easier  And I have the feeling, if  this indeed is your last meeting, Mr Chairman, that we all are going to find it a bit more difficult in  the future  We are going to have to carry a little more weight on our own--not just in analysis but  in backbone  I can’t think of any greater tribute for this Vice Chairman to give the Chairman of the  Committee  I also might say, judging from some newspaper reports I have seen, that I have always  appreciated a Chairman who smokes a pipe  But we will miss you very deeply, Mr Chairman, and  I am sure I can speak for every member of this Committee  [Applause]       Let me just say for the record, Mr Chairman, if I may, that   there was a reference in the examination report to some custody control standards in the acceptance  division, which is a fairly small part of the operation  There were some differences of opinion, if  that=s the right [term], about the standards that had been followed there for some years, and some  changes are being made  I think it=s incorrect to leave the suggestion that there was some sense of  weakness, at least on our part  There may be a difference in the way this can be controlled, and  changes are being made in response to the examination report  But there should not be any  implication that something weakened during the year there  The procedures had been followed for  many years  The new ones may or may not be better; they=re different, anyway  I just didn=t want  to leave an implication that something had weakened during this period in that area      As of noon, or whenever it was on Friday, we had picked   up quite a few marks  The market was having a rally  Unfortunately, the market turned again  during the afternoon, but that was the specific instance when you got up to $85 million, I think      Just a comment on this loss question  I think this certainly   should be secondary to [the Desk’s] objectives  But my recollection is that whatever we do with  the German swap is going to be swamped by the continuing repayment on the Swiss swap  So, for  any relevant reporting period, we are going to show a loss whatever we do and, therefore, it=s not  going to appear as something special in terms of the overall reporting result      This is on the days we operated?     That=s correct, Mr Chairman  I don=t want to leave the   impression that our monetary growth has accelerated relative to the Germans, in particular  I think  in fact it=s the opposite       Their M1 is higher than our--     In inflation rates     It seems logical to me to go to the $2 billion, which is the   size of the German swap  We might have to use that whole swap     I=ll be very brief, Mr Chairman  I thought initially that   Mr Partee made four-fifths of my statement for me, and I think Mr Wallich just made the other  one-fifth  Maybe the proportions are wrong, but I generally do think that the forecast is very  reasonable, with all the qualifications that Governor Partee mentioned earlier     I am struck particularly by the continuing lack of buoyancy in plant and equipment where we   had some hopes that the earlier forecast might be raised  I don=t see any signs [of that] in talking as  I do with businessmen and otherwise it=s very unrealistic to think that the survey numbers are going  to be missed on the upside  The trade deficit remains a very large problem  I=m not as optimistic  about that as the staff is--and they’re not terribly optimistic, but they do have some reduction in the  forecast for the deficit  I think that is going to be very hard to achieve against the background of  what I see going on abroad  [The latter] has been already mentioned and that=s a pretty big sector  in the economy that we sometimes overlook and deemphasize, apart from all the problems that it  implies for managing the dollar in the year ahead     I think by far the most important [issue] is the one that Governor Wallich just ended up with--  inflation and the risk that it will accelerate during this year  I think this may create a severe  dilemma for monetary policy  I myself do not think it=s something that monetary policy can very  adequately handle by itself, unaided by new policies elsewhere in the government  I know all the  difficulties of that, which leaves me with a little tinge of pessimism about how we can make this  soft landing that Governor Wallich referred to  While the expansion doesn=t show gross signs of       2/28/78           25  imbalances and excesses, it is getting older; and maintaining a forward momentum against the  possibility of an increasing rate of inflation may prove increasingly difficult as 1978 wears on  I=m  not expecting a downturn during the course of this year--or a recession or real curtailment of  growth out of line with the forecast  But one can see problems mounting on the inflationary side as  the year proceeds, raising questions about 1979  And I think it is going to create a very difficult  problem on how to manage monetary policy should the inflation rate accelerate at this point mainly  due, as I see it, to cost pressures      This is purely at banks?     I thought this problem came up years ago and I thought  they did have to report [unintelligible]      Well, it seems to me that the most important number here,   in operative terms, is probably the upper limit on M1  And in terms of the mind of the market, and  I suspect my own mind, as to whether we really mean it and whether we will attain it, I don=t think  we can afford to lower that at this point against our past record  I think 6-1/2 percent against the       2/28/78           38  outlook that we have is not unreasonable  I don=t feel so casual about missing it, as some of the  comments earlier imply  And that gives me a little concern about what we do about M2 and M3  I  recognize the difficulties of reducing those numbers, psychologically and in terms of the audience  of the Banking Committee in particular  I=m a little afraid if we put in a high number there not on  the feeling that it=s prudent--if that=s the right word--to lower the number but in the expectation that  we will probably come in on the low side of that range, we may be kidding ourselves  I could  foresee a warm glow of satisfaction later on when we miss M1 on the upside and we say we came  in on the low side on the other ones, which we sort of expect anyway  So we congratulate  ourselves that among all the targets, we haven=t done so badly in terms of our objectives  I suspect  there=s a little trap there  So I would prefer, I guess, to be a little imprudent in the immediate  presentational sense and do a little something about M2, like a 1/2 percentage point [reduction],  and stay with the 1 [point reduction] on the M3 range      I=m not sure why we adopt that number     That does seem a very relevant question to me, Mr   Chairman  At the very least, it seems to be an indication that if the law isn=t changed, policy  somehow isn=t changed in another respect  I think it does take a change in law; we have at the very  least a very big yellow light on purchases of agencies--the net increase in agency holdings  I think  we probably ought to be going in the other direction      I don=t see why we can=t do it as part of a general sale when   we=re selling other things rather than doing it alone     We=ve just talked about a little modification of alternative   B, which I think is basically on the right track  I think there is a technical reason, as we discussed a  few meetings ago, for keeping a range of 6 percentage points for M1 if M2 has a range of 4 points   I think statistically that just reflects the relative volatility of the two series; it is more consistent in  that technical sense  But going beyond the technical, I would prefer to shade it down in the process  of widening it from the 0 to 6 percent  I think our experience shows over and over that when we  get into these little lulls in monetary growth--which are infrequent enough--if we don=t take       2/28/78           45  advantage of them, we just compound the longer-term problem of remaining within the targets  In  other words, I don=t think we should set these short-term ranges in a way that [threatens to] trigger  a relaxation of the interest rate target because we will only make trouble for ourselves in the long  run, even though the short run may look low relative to the longer-term targets  [So] the  substantive reasons for at least shading M1 a bit make it consistent with the technical consideration      I do think the interest rate constraint is much more important, substantively  You mentioned   the international reason, but for the reason I just suggested--thinking in general of the domestic side  in terms of keeping on our long-range targets--we can say the same thing, namely, that we wouldn=t  want to reduce [the funds rate] below where it now is Therefore, it strikes me that the most  straightforward thing we could do would be to put a lower limit of 6-3/4 percent [on the funds rate]  I wouldn=t want to move necessarily right away, so that also suggests that it be an asymmetrical  midpoint  I don=t want to go up all that much, which brings me precisely to the logic I think  Governor Partee had last time  And we=ve only got three weeks between meetings, so I think we  are talking about a range of only 6-3/4 to 7 percent  Anything else we might say would seem to me  to be a little bit misleading, depending on what other people have to say around the table  Does  anybody really mean that we should go above 7 or below 6-3/4 without something very drastic  happening?  I=ll be interested in seeing whether anybody does, but I wouldn=t want to  So 6-3/4 to 7  percent with a 6-3/4 percent “midpoint” reflects pretty accurately my feelings about the situation   In that context--I don=t think really inconsistently--I’d take an aggregates directive You can=t move  very far--      The question is what [triggers a] move within that 1/4 of   one percent     I don=t think your logic is inconsistent, but the nature of the   directive is not a major preoccupation of mine  The limits on the range--      [It depends on the] ranges     My interpretation of a money market directive in the   context in which people have been talking is that people really are very reluctant to see [the funds  rate] decline below 6-3/4 percent      That seems to me the substance of the thing  Is that   correct?     I agree with that side, too     With the other specifications?     Money market directive?     A 0 to 5 range with a money market directive?     In both directions, for [your] long service as well as for the   new Chairman     Well, I have just a couple of comments that have occurred   to me, Mr Chairman  I think they are implicit, or maybe explicit, in what was already said  As far  as what I might think of the Administration side of the package, it has already been described as not  particularly strong  In that connection I see it as kind of a step in an evolving situation and not the  end of the story  And I don’t think every step in that direction has to be accompanied by Federal  Reserve action, since subsequent steps and more fundamental steps are more in their hands  But I  think it is a step pointing in a constructive direction  So far as actual intervention is concerned, I  myself do not read into this extension of the swap agreement necessarily a different approach  toward intervention than has been our practice recently in [terms of what our] judgment has been in  the last couple of--      All these thrilling words are [lost]?     I don’t know at what stage we [lost the connection]    SPEAKER(?)  You were just starting     Well, I just wanted to make two points and I’ll make them   over again  When I look at the Administration side or what might be thought of as the more  fundamental side of the package, it’s not very strong, as was indicated  But I would like to think of  this as part of an evolutionary [process] and I don’t think every step has to be accompanied by fresh  action of this sort by the Federal Reserve, however important it may be in this particular instance  I  hope that the Administration sees it in the same way; I have a feeling they do  So far as the  implications for actual intervention are concerned, I see this as arming us with more money if we  need it, but it does not necessarily imply a change in what we have been doing in the scale or     3/10/78              5  approach toward the market  As you know, in this connection, intervention has actually been very  limited in most recent weeks  I think that reflected in good part a market judgment as to when it is  helpful and when it isn’t helpful  I would assume that we will continue to make those judgments  and we won’t just go in on a big scale simply because the swap is increased      I think that’s true, Mr Chairman, so far as the repayment   policy Governor Coldwell referred to is concerned  But I think the other items on his list can and     3/10/78              12  will be negotiated now as I understand it  Certainly the 50-50 [loss sharing] and the possibility of  paying [the drawings] off from a direct transaction with the Bundesbank could be concluded at  present      Those are the present terms      Yes, just in terms of the reaction there  Some of the   governors were briefed just before the announcement and the rest of them at the time of the  announcement  I would say that in general they welcomed the initiative  They didn’t know what  the market reaction was at that point  I think it’s too much to say that they were enthusiastic in  terms of the content of the announcement  There was a certain degree of skepticism as to what  result it would have  There was some concern expressed rather generally--concern may be too  strong a word  The observation was made repeatedly that it would have been nicer to have the  initiative less bilateral and more multilateral  They were somewhat satisfied by the comment in the  statement at the end, which you may recall referred to multilateral forms  And most of them took  the occasion to urge that, indeed, these multilateral forms be utilized  But I think, in general, the  statement was welcomed      The staff tried very carefully to put this in the context of a step as part of a continuing   process and not the end of all problems  And [those at the meeting in Basle] certainly viewed it in  that light and welcomed that it was viewed by the United States and Germany in that light                                                  indicated his own view that this represented some attempt at political  reconciliation and, of course, that was welcomed as well     3/21/78              4    Let me make one other observation if I may, while I have the floor, Mr Chairman, in terms   of this market  I don’t know what it means, but I find it interesting  This market has been very  depressed in tone, very uncertain, and technically in poor shape for some time  If one looks back to  early January when the US announcement was made, that triggered a little different intervention  at first but over the [subsequent] 2-1/2 month period the rates have changed very little  I don’t  know what that means, but I think it’s a fact, though [the dollar] has had some ups and downs of  course during this period      I don’t know about less intervention     In the previous 2-1/2 months     The comments were pretty general and it was the kind of   reaction you would expect in a multilateral group where some of them were left out  I think in  some specific cases--yes, the Swiss in particular--they would like us to be a little more active in  their currency  Some of the others referred very vaguely to the point that the sale of SDRs could be  spread around a little more than just selling in Germany  But it was not pressed, really   The  comments were fairly general      Let me just report one other impression at Basle that just   struck me personally, Mr Chairman  It’s not directly related to this package but it is related to the  fundamentals  One European country after another is making progress now on the inflation side   They are not doing very well on the growth side but their rates of inflation are coming down quite  decidedly  You can see this in the statistics but hearing [the European representatives] one after  another cite the progress was rather impressive as I was sitting there  And it’s at a time when we  are concerned about precisely the opposite  To some extent that is affecting the exchange markets;  it helps account for the present uncertainties      They don’t comment on it very frequently but it is clearly   recognized--though maybe not enough  But that’s part of the reason the Swiss talk about possibly  having an actual decline in prices this year internally      Well, I was just talking about the setting of that meeting   I don’t think anybody really pressed that point  There was a little discussion that it might be in the  background and some would welcome that, I am sure, in coming weeks  There was more  suggestion of the foreign currency bond idea, although that was not pressed strongly  But it was  mentioned by a number of people      Well, I’m sure that several of them would embrace it   with great enthusiasm if you gave them the chance  I didn’t encourage this avenue and they had  the statement in front of them, in effect  They knew the statement was coming out and knew it  wasn’t included  They didn’t want to queer the atmosphere by pressing and they did not press but  it was obvious that a few of them would like to see it       I might just comment very briefly, Mr Chairman    Among all the options that are before us, none of which will be very happy I think from the  standpoint of the Bundesbank, I would guess that the most practical one will be to follow the  so-called Swiss model  That’s where we would space out [the repayment period] a little and in  return, I hope, we’d get the Bundesbank’s agreement for direct purchases as necessary in paying  this debt off  It doesn’t really seem to me possible that they’re going to say that they want us to  pay it off with a direct transaction three months from now or six months from now  That would be  my only comment  Also, looking at the other side, I would prefer the Swiss-type arrangement to a  new precedent for the Committee of just extending swaps for 2 years  So, I find myself leaning in  that direction      I think there’s something to that politically, Mr   Chairman, but the fact is that the Treasury has a very limited capacity mechanically to take losses  with--      Just one comment, Mr Chairman  I do think the   emphasis here should be on consultation  I don’t disagree with the flavor of what this paragraph is  trying to say, but in the end we can only judge these things in specific circumstances  And I think I  can say--correct me if I am wrong, Mr Holmes--that the Desk has never come close to spending  $100 million in a day without consultation with the Chairman or the Committee or both, long  before the $100 million was reached      I’ll be brief with a couple of random comments, Mr   Chairman  I don’t think there is a great deal of informational content, as a number of people have  said, in the recent statistics so far as the future is concerned  My own presumption is that [the  economy] should be fairly strong after we get through this period, recognizing the possibility that  President Morris first referred to that it could be something else  [But] we have to be able to make  some decisions and my presumption would still be on the side that growth is going to be stronger  and that the risk of more inflation over these projections is greater than the prospect of less  inflation  That is a major part of our problem and I would hope the Administration comes out with  more credible programs  I would just say, after listening to this colloquy earlier, that I would rather  have them take a little more time and do it right  [I’d hate to see them] get so concerned that they  put out something early that is really not very credible  If they could really do something right   here--something forceful--and if they are willing to take the actions within government, including  on government pay, that seem to me desirable, it may be pretty useful      I was also struck, in terms of potential problems for the Federal Reserve, which have been   [alluded] to in a couple of different ways by what Governor Wallich said about time for a slow  landing and all this nomenclature that we have full employment someplace in the 5 to 6 percent or  5-1/2 to 6 percent area  That gets into the Humphrey-Hawkins bill  [Let’s assume] we get the  passage of the current congressional package on the Humphrey-Hawkins bill  If Henry is right, and  there is a good deal in what he says, how does one go up there and testify how we are on the path  and conducting policies toward whatever figure they have in there for Humphrey-Hawkins?  [It] is  not very far off  It seems to me that we are in a very awkward position  I don’t know whether that  bill is absolutely going to pass  It’s very hard to oppose it  But the awkwardness of our position  struck me, as I heard Governor Wallich speak      If I believe his figures?     I’m not sure I would go that far  But you don’t have to   [agree] totally with him to see the sizable discrepancy in that     Well, I agree with that  But what position are we put in   by this bill when we have to go up there and in effect say that our policies are--        3/21/78              38   We’ll have a division of labor     I’d just like to make an observation and raise a question    The observation is about the size of these changes in seasonal factors alone in the revised money  supply figures  It has been a long time since I’ve been in the business of calculating seasonal  adjustments, but I don’t ever remember year-to-year changes of this magnitude in seasonal factors   I think it just underscores the fragility of these statistics that we work with on a short-run basis  from meeting to meeting and to which we attach a lot of importance     The question is in connection with these various substantial statistical changes  Has any   further consideration been given to the thought of redefining the money supply figures--and if not,  why not--in ways that would seem off hand to make great sense [given] NOW accounts and  demand deposits at savings banks?      Yes, this is partly the difficulty you get into  Do we want   to project publicly a high rate of inflation now?  The Federal Reserve projecting an acceleration of  inflation!  Or at other times do you want to project a recession before--      I think there is a subtle distinction between your   expressing alarm, which is entirely appropriate and very helpful and encouraging, and the Federal  Reserve at some time, in its august majesty, saying this is what [inflation] is going to be      I don’t know whether I want to address myself to that   limited question at this time     Let me just [address] myself to where I would like to see   [the funds rate] go during this period  I feel very much the way I did last month in the sense that I  think it would be wrong in the foreseeable [future] to give an easing signal, for a variety of reasons,  maybe most importantly the concern we’ve expressed about inflation around the table  And I think  the international consideration is also very evident  I think both of those reasons outweigh any  doubts or uncertainties we may have about the economy [given] the fact that the figures are so  distorted recently     I would go beyond that and say I could conceive of circumstances in which some modest   tightening move--and I would say modest certainly--might be useful during this period, although I  certainly wouldn’t make it now  I say that against a background that was described to us by Steve  Axilrod about the outlook for the aggregates  I don’t think we can attach much significance to  what happens to the aggregates in the short run, particularly if they go down or remain rather  sluggish during this period against the high figures we had for quite a period last year and against  the outlook, uncertain as always, for the probable strength rather than weakness as we move ahead  and get through the winter period and through the coal strike  What we do now isn’t going to affect  what happens to the aggregates in the next few weeks but it will have some significance later in the  year  We ought to be thinking in terms of steady to possibly slightly up rather than any declines [in  interest rates]  I think the easiest way to express this, in terms of the directive itself, would be to     3/21/78              50  limit the federal funds range by putting a floor on it at [the rate] we’ve in effect had--6-3/4  percent  I don’t really want to see the rate going up much above 7 during this period without a careful  relook, so that suggests, as I proposed last time, a 6-3/4 to 7 percent range  And I still think it  makes some sense to move it up if the aggregates are running high, which would point to an  aggregates kind of directive      Some question was raised about this last month  So I   was forced to do some thinking about it this month, and I’m prepared to argue that the best way to  use an aggregates directive is to constrain the federal funds rate in this particular period   That’s  because I wouldn’t want to see an aggregates directive and have a wide federal funds range and  either have it go way up or way down  Nevertheless, I don’t mind moving the rate if the aggregates  are high; but I don’t want to move it forever  And I guess “forever” I define as really above 7  percent in these circumstances, which itself would get an interesting market reaction  I wouldn’t  want to risk a greater one by moving it above the 7 percent area      Now if you don’t like that idea, I think we ought to bias it differently and just move these   aggregates ranges down, depending on whether it’s [alternative] A or a B or C  I wouldn’t use A at  all  I would just move the aggregates ranges lower if you want a wider range [for the funds rate]  and then bias it in that direction but I prefer the other  I might say in that connection that New  York for some reason has a substantially lower estimate for M1 and M2 for this particular period  than the Board this time  I don’t attach great weight to either of them but it is true that that estimate  is substantially lower this time       If I may just add one further bit of clarification  You say  don’t put the rate below the 6-3/4 percent without consultation; that is certainly a point I would  agree with  Suppose the aggregates come in high?  Do you also feel we shouldn’t move it above  6-3/4?      In practice you’re precisely where I am     Not under risk     I would think the typical contingency--there could be all   sorts of [cases] where you might want to use this--is where we wanted the Treasury to join with us  in some lending  And they say we can’t do it because we haven’t got the money  And we would  want the facility to say we can provide the money; you take the risk, we’ll provide the money  It  would make possible an action we want them to take rather than that they’re foisting off something  on us that we didn’t like        Well, I don’t think we have to be very--      [Given] the period that we have gone through and the  amount of treasure and sweat we have expended in trying to get a more stable tone in the market, I  would be very cautious about giving the market the impression that we were ready to sit on any  increases in rates of the very small magnitude that have so far occurred  You might get a market on  a particular day that is going up in a kind of frantic and disorderly way so that it would be  appropriate to purchase some securities  I don’t think that was yesterday’s market, and I think it  would inflate it, giving a very unfortunate signal in terms of--      Well, they can’t be completely secret when you are going  into the market openly  That is why [the Desk] bought some [marks] from correspondents      Well, I have very little to add, Mr Chairman  I agree with  what the report said  I would only add that in thinking about this, I ran through the exercise in my  own mind as to what kind of number you would put down if you wanted a 3-year target, and I  found myself in the midst of a dilemma  If you make it too high, you are not doing much on  inflationary expectations and you may be able to make it  If you make it too low, you have a real  credibility problem  Therefore, my dilemma was consistent with the feeling that is expressed in the  report  The possible exception is a situation in which there was a concerted long-run inflation plan  on the part of the Administration that was also credible on its own terms in dealing with cost  pressures and all the rest; then I could see where this might be reexamined  As it stands now, the  Federal Reserve by itself, I can only second the comments that Chuck already made      And at this point there is nothing left to say, so I will just  make a couple of very brief comments  The exchange rate forecast caught my eye, as it did some  other people’s here  I didn’t like it much, both because I hope the forecast for the trade balance is  too pessimistic and because I have substantial uncertainty as to how closely the exchange rate  projection can be related to the trade balance at this stage, as has been mentioned  But I would just  point out, if I read it correctly, what the projection implies about the rate of decline in the dollar  against key currencies that we have had in the last six months  It depends upon how you weight  it--what you assume has happened with the Canadian dollar and all the rest  I don’t know what [the  staff is] assuming but it strikes me that that kind of depreciation would present very serious  problems of international financial stability  And if a projection of that sort did come about, I’d be  a little concerned about it  I don’t know how it is handled in these policy memoranda or whatever  they call them in terms of staff projections  But that is the kind of sizable decline in the exchange  rate that could have some self-fulfilling aspects to it      Well, I think the major burden here is that it is almost  impossible to project anything very intelligently in this area  I wouldn’t put any weight on any  particular projection  So far as more general comments are concerned, I share the concern that has  already been expressed about inflationary expectations in a sense hardening  I’ll give you my own  anecdote in that respect  I went out to hear Senator Proxmire give a speech to a group of  businessmen in New Jersey the other day which he entitled “Things for the Future” or some such  thing  He was making projections and the projection he seemed to feel most sure of and wanted to  repeat most frequently was that the inflation rate was going to be 8 to 10 percent over the next three  years  I am not sure that the audience thought that was an unreasonable projection  I do think the  dilemmas have been very clearly spelled out for us  I don’t think we have a problem that can be  handled by monetary policy alone, to say the least  We do have many of the classic signs of a  business cycle developing, as has been mentioned  The most serious part of that dilemma seems to  be the inflationary hardening of the arteries of expectations      I would be the last to say that it is not going to happen   Who knows?  If it does happen, it would be a very serious matter and I don’t think it is at all certain  at this point     [CHAIRMAN MILLER]  I think some of the comments, Ted, were that if one looks short  term, it seems that some factors may be distorting and [are being projected] further than they  should  If that is true, then we come back in the cycle  Larry, I think you had [a comment]      I would essentially support the same position, Mr  Chairman, particularly the point that David Eastburn just made  I think our priority at the moment  is getting within the targets that we have instead of trying to play around with psychology in  changing them  That has been the problem in the past year; in the past quarter we have been within  them and I think we ought to try to extend that record  The only thing I would add, Mr Chairman,  is that I think there is a kind of economic logic for us to reduce the M3 range and I would be  willing to do that if there is general support  I can also live with the present range so that you don’t  have to go through the torture of explaining all the implications of reducing the M3 target in this  particular quarter  We might have to end up reducing it if this scenario is played out, but I would  not be insistent upon it--although willing--at this time      There is something screwy between that alternative B and- -oh, I see, one is current      I feel quite clear in my mind, Mr Chairman, that we don’t  want a Committee forecast as such  We don’t want to try to get a consensus and say that this is the  official position of the Federal Open Market Committee  We probably couldn’t do it anyway I do  think there are some pluses and minuses in giving a kind of informal analysis of the range of  opinion in the Committee; I feel myself a little closer to John Williams and Mark Willes in that  circumstance  Particularly, I think there is some strength in showing some diversity on the  Committee in the outlook--a particular strength if they happen to agree on the policy despite some  disagreement on the outlook  There is nothing more deflating to the politician who wants to attack  you to say even the fellow that feels a little differently about the business outlook fully agrees with  the policy that is being adopted in the short run  If he doesn’t agree, it is on the record anyway so  you have--      I can imagine that happening  I don’t want to project  today I could imagine some difference in the rate of growth a year from now that isn’t reflected in  a difference of opinion on what we should be doing today  I would think that might happen quite  frequently, as a matter of fact  But anyway, I think the right compromise is that you probably  should emphasize your personal view but I wouldn’t be allergic to indicating in an informal way  that there is, in some cases, a range of opinion on the Committee  We do this now in the policy  record or whatever we call it and I think extending that same kind of qualitative commentary  occasionally to your testimony isn’t going to hurt anything; it may help  But I’d keep it pretty  informal      He is happier that it was on the upside than on the  downside, I guess, particularly--      Well, I fully accept the implication of the earlier  conversation and what you have just said--that we have to move here to tighten some  I guess my  reaction to what you [proposed] is that maybe we ought to tighten that down even further     4/18/78             44      Not necessarily in the size of the move, but in the way we  specify these things  We just did a lot of talking about keeping within the long-term ranges and not  changing them  I would much prefer to see these ranges set to straddle--they would be wider  presumably because we are in the short run--what we agreed should be the longer-term ranges    That brings me for M1 at least--I think the arithmetic and the statistical noise in the series suggest a  6-point range if we’re going to have 4 points on the M2 range--something like 2 to 8 percent   That’s the way the series is drifting; it is more volatile  And if we’re going to straddle, something  like 2 to 8 seems to me the right range  We had 6-point ranges for several months  The 5-1/2 to  9-1/2 for M1 looks a little high to me  We could go along too easily, I think, going above the  long-term range  The 6 to 10 also looks a trifle high to me  I would rather see that at 5-1/2 to 9-1/2  or even 5 to 9 and then just pinning down the federal funds a little closer  A range that I had in  mind was 6-3/4 to 7-1/4--cutting off 1/4 point from where you had it--and probably going up  toward 7 percent by the end of this week in view of the Treasury financing  I’d be very reluctant to  go above 7 percent but if the aggregates get high enough, I would go above 7, which suggests an  aggregates directive with some sticking point at 7 before going above it      I am just afraid of that low point and that high point  You  get too high an average  The low point is significant only if you get an average of 3      Excuse me  May I respond to that?  I have more or less the  same feeling that Chuck does, but what bothers me is that I think 7-1/2 percent would be a big  move  And I am not at all sure the Committee is ready for that move  You can tell me  I myself  don’t feel that we ought to make that move from 7-1/4 to 7-1/2 on the basis of only 1 percentage  point difference in a highly volatile series  That is almost meaningless  I would want to be pretty  sure that if we get up in that area--maybe go to 7-1/4--that another 1 percentage point [in growth of  M1] doesn’t drive me to 7-1/2  That is my problem  So I would stick with the 8 and stick with the  7-1/4 top      Close  [I’d be] unable to vote for it, depending upon the  interpretation  If the Committee would go casually--is really ready to go to the 7-1/2--I find that  very difficult  You are really saying that you’re putting it down for form  If you put down 7-1/2  [and say as] last time that there is going to be great resistance at 7-1/4, I guess I would vote for it   In that case we might as well say 7-1/4      May I make a comment on that, please?  As I heard it, Mr  Chairman, “gradual” to my ear just sounded very slow      Well, I thought of the word “moderate” in there  It doesn’t  sound quite so slow as “gradual” to me      You could say “slightly above the [current level]”       I don’t know why we didn’t [unintelligible] the need to  express, Mr Chairman  I do think the inflation numbers that were [released] for the first quarter  and the more recent information [are higher] than I really anticipated  And that’s an adverse sign  My own feeling is to stay at 7-1/4 percent but make sure the federal funds rate doesn’t go below  that  That might mean that on the average I’d rather have it come out a little higher than a little  lower, but if it stays right at 7-1/4 percent that would be all right  I suppose the only difference I  would have is that I’d like to see the discount rate [increase] before next Thursday to [indicate] our  concern without too long a lag  But this general [approach of raising the discount rate] 1/2 point-- coming in [with that] as our action before the next Committee meeting--I agree with       With the coordinating committee, [unintelligible] going  back further on the discount rate?      Ordinarily I would want to wait longer after a Treasury  operation to review the discount rate but in this case given what the [unintelligible] the  expectations, I’m a little afraid that if we wait too long it will be so anticlimactic it will--      I think that’s right  I agree with that       And there’s a net depressing effect on the dollar from these  operations because most of the issues are bought for dollars in the first place  D-marks have to be  purchased by the buyer of the issue in the first place      We ought to move ahead but cautiously      That’s right      Governor Jackson reminds me that we in New York are  living in a completely different world  We worry about the City going bankrupt and whether the  price of the cooperative apartments will go down  And the debate on wage increases is whether  they should be 3 or 4 percent a year  I hear of all this over-exuberance in the rest of the world and  maybe there’s some hope for New York business eventually--when banks get business loans  They  haven’t gotten any business loans  That’s right     My feeling about the business outlook has been more like the beginning of this conversation  than the latter part Things may slow down more rapidly in the second half of the year and more  abruptly  I’m not drastically different than the staff forecast, but a little bit on the lower side of that  and continuing into ’79  I think that would be a good thing if it happened, as was suggested earlier  I’m just thinking of a rate of growth of something like 3-1/2 percent--that’s too good to be true, of  course--in terms of the long-run potential  But I do think that, while our people forecast prices at  exactly the same annual rates per period of time as the staff here has, all the risks are on the higher  side  That is related to the fact that I think there is some risk of some boom psychology entering in  here, particularly with inventories and an inventory buildup of the kind that Chuck Partee  mentioned, although I don’t think you see evidence of it now  You just have the feeling that it  could happen and there’s some risk and that would be a major destabilizing factor looking out  further ahead into ’79     On this whole question of price increases, let me just report some very simple correlations  that someone in New York did  They suggest, if I recall them correctly, simple regressions You  have to get a 6-1/2 percent rate of unemployment; that was the only factor you were looking at, to  have any deceleration in the rate of price [increase] at all  And if you were going to get down to  something you call price stability--which isn’t exactly a zero rate of price increase--within a  decade, you had to have a rate of unemployment steadily above 7 percent  That was just a simple  regression coming out of what has happened in the last decade  You wonder how to deal with this  inflation problem, even with the kind of levels of unemployment that we have now  But I guess I  don’t come away feeling quite so pessimistic as at least some of our last comments suggested  I  think there is a risk of a more speculative bubble on top, coming out of what I think is a temporary  spurt here in the second quarter  But together with the price developments it could catch on into an  inventory, and beyond inventory, kind of spurt that I think would bode very poorly for business  next year if it happened  It’s not my central expectation      I’m just curious, after listening to Mr Axilrod’s  [description] of the dilemma between M1 and M2, which is readily understandable in recent data  My question is if you look ahead [at] the projections that the staff gave us, somehow they both fall  nicely within their ranges  I would think the implication at this time is that it would be somehow--   Well, what are the implications for the future when we seem to be suggesting that we can’t  accomplish that but the projections say we can?      All the other chances are on the other side?      The mode      Well, I am really struck, Mr Chairman, in listening to all  of this by the difference in semantics used by members of the Committee  They are not reflected  very much as differences in prescription        Virtually everybody is 7-1/4 on the downside of the federal  funds range and the whole difference in the range is split between 7-3/4 and 8 essentially and split  between 7-3/8 and 7-5/8, it would seem, for the midpoint The language sounded like a bigger  difference than that, somehow  My own feeling is somewhat reinforced after listening to all of this  I think at this particular meeting we are caught in the midst of a policy change, a federal funds rate     5/16/78              42  change, which I don’t think the market considers completed; I don’t really consider it completed   We are in motion a bit having let it go a little above 7-1/4  I suspect the market really thinks that  we are going to end up around 7-1/2 in this particular phase  And it would take 7-1/2 without any  very sharp impact either in the stock market or in the bond market  Now, that is a matter of  judgment  On balance, I would think that we would be well advised, given the risks that have been  alluded to on the inflation front and otherwise, to permit this to work out its natural culmination at  this stage which I see it as 7-1/2 [and] not very upsetting  I think there would be some question if  we stopped at right where we are; we might lose a little bit of that credibility that we’ve built up  here in the last month when they see the inflation figures coming in very badly and the business  picture as strong as it is now  So I would be willing to move to 7-1/2 as a midpoint--not necessarily  tomorrow or this week--not really seeing that myself as a new move but as completing something  that we started with the federal funds range of 7-1/4 to 7-3/4 percent     I think going above 7-3/4 would certainly bring us into a new policy area and I’d want to take  another look at it  I would agree with the logic that Governor Jackson presented on the ranges for  the aggregates  I don’t think we want to move down very quickly if for a few weeks the money  supply did happen to come in low  Our projections also show a low, along with Richmond’s, so I  like his 2 percent lower range  I also think we ought to be pretty cautious  It would be a new move  in my mind going above 7-1/2 so I’d leave that 8 percent at the top of the range for the same reason  that he did  And something like 4 to 9 or 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 on M2 looks fine to me  So I put this in a  context of completing what we started here, pausing before we make another discrete new move      I really interpreted it the way you said it as kind of a 7-3/8  to 7-1/2 midpoint      Okay      How immediate is immediate?      No, I understand we’re not going tomorrow      That may be true  But I think the concerns of the market  may be useful--      I’m not quite sure where we are, Mr Chairman  As I  understand it, with Mr Coldwell’s amendment the presumption is we go to 7-1/2 over the course of  the next week or so      So far as I’m concerned, you can have a consultation  whenever you want  If you want to have it at 7-1/2, I certainly am not going to vote against that      Well, I can certainly agree with Governor Coldwell’s  amendment--if it is an amendment  I suspect other people can, too, but I don’t know about that      If it’s really negative--       5/16/78              47    He has expressed his opinion      Aggregates      This seems to be a much more accurate description      I’m a little worried about that one  Right at this point  when you are going to [see] some intermediation--      May I make one--I hope modest--proposal of substance?  It  has nothing to do with what we are now talking about but I see that the directive has in it  “including conditions in foreign exchange markets”  We put that in rather explicitly in either  December or January because we were particularly worried about the foreign exchange markets in  influencing policy      I might want to put it back in next month  I don’t think it’s  all that--     5/16/78              52      I think it’s wrong when it’s not actively influencing the  direction of what we are doing      That’s the one word that jumped out at me in the directive   Sometimes we deliberately put the ranges at a place we don’t expect       First, I would just observe, Mr Chairman, that we see  more optimism--a better feeling on the part of businessmen that have reported to us--than we=ve  seen in a long time  I don=t have the sense that this is leading to great changes in spending plans,  though there may be some acceleration of what they were doing  Certainly they have no big  inventory plans but they do seem to be feeling better [about the outlook] despite the fact that  when I look analytically at the figures I think we=re in for a slowdown all right, along the lines  that the staff has projected  But I also think that it could be lower than that  It=s just hard when  you analyze these figures to see where much new thrust is coming from; and consumption  doesn=t seem to me likely to provide the leading edge  The investment surveys are certainly not  ebullient despite a little better tone of conversation of businessmen as I observe it  Home  building has no place to go but down, I suspect; it=s just a question of how much  And  government isn=t doing anything all that different from what it has been doing  So I share the  view that has already been expressed by several people that the staff forecast may indicate the  general direction of things or, if anything, may be a little bit on the high side     I would share the view that if the money supply were really going to be as tight as the  targets suggest, it=s then very hard to see the business picture being as strong as projected  I  assume that that practice [of using the midpoint] might be relaxed somewhat  We=d do well to  hit the top of our range instead of the midpoint over this period  Now, this outlook doesn=t  particularly disturb me, I hasten to add, if that=s all it is--a slowdown in this area  We could use  it on the inflation side and we could use it on the balance of payments side  It would concern me  a bit if, in the event, this kind of slowdown were to coincide with a slowdown abroad  I=m not  projecting that but I don=t think it=s impossible; and then we might be in trouble  We might begin  interacting at each other and our balance of payments isn=t going to improve under those  circumstances  That prospect does concern me  I think it=s worthwhile when we=re slowing  [unintelligible] to somehow or another get Europe rising faster and Japan continuing to rise  If  that doesn=t happen, I think we=re going to have problems  I hope it does happen  So I suppose,  on balance, I=m a little less than the staff [on GNP growth] and I=d be a little more pessimistic  than they are on the inflation figures  Maybe those two are related      [For] the second quarter to the second quarter, I=d be  closer to 3-1/2 percent or below in terms of GNP growth  For the GNP deflator, I think probably  you=re talking 7-1/2 percent, anyway, and for unemployment around 6 percent      Well, I=ll try to be short, Mr Chairman  Despite the  comments I made earlier on being skeptical about the longer-term outlook for business, I do think  it=s strong at the moment  We do have these inflationary pressures  We do have speculative  concerns that have been referred to  I think we have an expectation in the market of some Federal  Reserve tightening and I think we probably should meet that expectation or we would be feeding  some of the adverse speculative feeling  I do have some concern over the value of some tightening  in terms of the continuing stability of the dollar internationally as well  Therefore, I do think we  should move  The 7-1/2 to 8 percent range seems right to me and the B alternative, with some  implication that we go to 7-3/4 percent as promptly as the people at the Desk think that=s advisable I  would be a little reluctant to go beyond that but not absolutely allergic to it if that=s necessary--if the  aggregates come in on the high side  That raises the question of what ranges we should put there      6/20/78                30  Those ranges specified under the B alternative look awfully high in terms of our longer-range  objectives  I recognize that the projections are also fairly high  It seems to me that we could at least  widen the range on the downside, because I don=t think we want to ease very [readily], and I would  suggest a lower level of 5  And if we widen the range a little bit, we could leave it 5 to 10 percent   As I say, if it really got to the top part of that range, I think I would go to 8 [on the funds rate], but I  would do it with some reluctance  Perhaps the way to express that would be a money market  directive and the new language or some other kind of device to make clear that, while we might be  willing to move to 8, we’d do it with some due deliberation after a good deal of further evidence  comes in      The problem is really more fundamental  It says that we  have an objective for the year, which Mr Coldwell says we don=t really have      It seems to me that if we=re not doing it, we ought to change  the range  I mean that=s--     6/20/78                40     SPEAKER(?)  Yes      You really don=t deal with the problem by fiddling with the  sentence      I have an editorial [suggestion]  It says “weekly average  federal funds rate,” which just has a degree of precision that--      Just take out “weekly average”      I don=t want to eliminate the day-to-day flexibility but I  don=t like the implication  I don=t want [the Desk] to move on a Wednesday just to get the weekly  average      Leave average in  Maybe that would--      That sounds all right to me--if I may enter in here--but in  general I am [unintelligible] on the Axilrod side of this  It seems to me that we pay too much tender  loving care to these agency issues and treat them too much as a special case  If we=re going to use  them, we ought to use them flexibly on both sides as [unintelligible]  The market ought to get used  to that  Given the fact that the proposal is extremely modest in terms of any sales anyway, Mr  Coldwell=s suggestion is a perfectly reasonable, pragmatic approach      Are you saying never roll them over?  I didn=t understand  that it was never roll them over but when it fits in with some other--      Well, he=s not suggesting--again, as I understand it--that you  automatically not roll them over  If you happen to be liquidating at that time you might not roll over  some of them, or maybe roll over some small amount      We=re not--or at least I=m not--saying systematically don=t  roll them over  I=m saying, I think, what Steve Axilrod said  [Do so] occasionally if it fits the  pattern      We are buying on the other side, so maybe we don=t actually  go down on total agency holdings      Occasional selling      I think they should have the authority, but that doesn=t mean  that they should go ahead just to make a demonstration [in] the market      Let me ask, Mr Chairman, how good is this scrambler  now?  The scramblers that we’ve used in the past were practically impossible to understand      The old [scrambler device] was so annoying to use       I will not be a groundswell, Mr Chairman, but I can see  the day arising when a gesture in that direction may be entirely appropriate  I’m not sure we’re  right there      Maybe  In a small amount      Well, a small amount for the United States  It might be  part of a big program by Japan      I think the question is--and I don’t want to pursue this  forever--that the relationship between the appreciating yen and a change in their trade problems is  nothing very apparent in any event and could have, and has had, some unfortunate side effects  At  some point I think the rate ought to be stabilized  Whether we can contribute to that through some  gesture or at what level, I don’t know  I hardly discount in my own thinking a suitable gesture as  part of a more general program that is appropriate      Why are you so sure about a recession?      Because of the financial side      Well, I can give you a staff forecast, which happens to be  relevant in the sense that it is almost exactly the same in nominal GNP as the Board of Governors  staff forecast  There is a little difference in that the prices are higher and the real is lower--in each  case by about 1/2 percentage point over that period  In other words, real growth would be about  3-1/4, prices about 7-1/2, and the unemployment rate a little lower than 6 percent  I do think there  is some chance of more exuberance, if that is the right word, or more anticipatory buying--either by  consumers or by businesses in the form of inventory or conceivably a little bit in plant and  equipment--in the next quarter and the current quarter particularly     It’s very hard for me to see a recession before the end of the year  And if we get a tax cut at  the end of the year, it’s very hard for me to see a recession developing in the first or second quarter  Therefore, while I recognize the risk of a recession, it’s a little difficult for me to see one in this  time perspective  And I would think the risks in that sense are pretty symmetrical, where the major  risk is of the price increases having more momentum than the forecast suggests  I do think we are  going to get a  recession sooner or later, but I share Phil Jackson’s feelings that the financial  pressures have not built up to the point of producing one in the next year  Conceivably we could  get it by the end of l979 but that is too far ahead for me to foresee at the moment     7/18/78              18      I suspect this discussion, Mr  Chairman, suggests the need  for reviewing the definition of M1 that we have now       I would urge that that be done  I certainly have some  unhappiness about the general method of setting targets that we have  Frank distributed one  possible reform and [it’s one] that we had also looked at earlier and I am not sure that it is perfect   But we have had so much base drift recently, and the target we set is something of a farce recently  in terms of failing to deal with or recognize the base drift problem  I don’t know how we should go  about it but I really think we ought to talk about it before the next quarters  So far as the substance  of the decision this time is concerned, for all the reasons that have already been suggested, I am  among those who do not favor dropping M1 with all its difficulty now, primarily because of  arbitrary factors in M2 during a period of potential interest rate ceiling pressure  I can recognize  the logic of raising the range on M1, particularly the upper end of it  I don’t see how we can,  consistent with the kinds of concerns that Henry has ably expressed, think of going above 7, really,  on top of the base drift, on top of the automatic transfer, [and the] increase in velocity certainly  going in that direction  At this point, going above 7 would clearly give the wrong signal  I would  be very worried about going to 7  If we go to 7 on the long-term target, I think there is all the more  burden on doing something in the short run to indicate that we really intend to keep to that target  I  don’t know whether the Committee will be willing to do that or not      That’s right  I think we really have to balance an increase  in the target with some move that makes it credible that we are going to meet it  So I come out  thinking that kind of combination might be tolerable  I can’t see going above 7  I would prefer to  leave it unchanged for the reasons that have already been expressed by a number of others and I  won’t prolong it      Mr Chairman, in terms of what is doable and not doable,  my understanding of this morning’s discussion was that 6-1/2 is doable      The staff should believe it     SPEAKER(?)  Yes      I feel I could go to 7 but I’d hate to go to 7-1/2  The  argument just comes too close to saying we have had a lot of inflation and, therefore, we will  increase our targets       Move the question      Well, I think we have a timing problem here, Mr  Chairman  I heard an awful lot of talk this morning, both before and after the break, about the  inevitability of interest rates going up  It is an argument whether they are going up by l or 2 or 3  percentage points  I’m not at all sure that they are going up as much as l percentage point but if it  is all that much in that direction, I would rather have a little more of it sooner rather than later  I  think it would be a mistake not to move now, so I would certainly go to the 7-3/4 to 8-1/4 percent  funds rate criteria and I rather like Governor Coldwell’s specifications on the aggregates--moving  them a little lower  I actually had 3 to 8 on M1 and 6 to 10 on M2 but his were very similar  I  think I’d go to a money market directive with those kinds of aggregate numbers so we don’t move  too readily above the 8 percent  I would be reluctant to go above that      An 8 percent midpoint  I would use the money market  directive so that we would not move readily above that but I would allow that possibility  [And I’d  move] fairly promptly to give it a nudge      But it is already triggered  By the projections we have, it is  already triggered      [Unintelligible]       If I understand these current projections, with the ranges  we most recently discussed, you’re almost at the point where you would go toward 8 anyway,  unless instructed otherwise      Well, not quite but darn close to it      Our projection is already 9      We are in effect saying it’s going to be played around  7-7/8 to 8 in the very next period      That’s all right with me, I think  I assume we are going  with these lower [M1 and M2 ranges of] 4 to 8 and 5 to 10      That means you’re frozen for the next month      Can we try 7-3/4 to 8 on the understanding of 4 to 8 and 6  to 10?      Can we try 4 to 8 on M1, 6 to 10 on M2, and 7-3/4 to 8 on  the funds rate, conducted in the manner Mr Axilrod has just described?      That seems to be where we are      Well, I would prefer that but--      It doesn’t create a problem for me, but if most people  wanted to delay [a rise in] market interest rates--      It is not clear to me--it’s a matter of simplification--why  we need those lines 42 and 43 that say “shall be directed initially” at one thing and subsequently at  another thing  The ranges are narrow anyway  Why don’t we just say “during the period until the  next regular meeting System open market operations shall be directed at maintaining a weekly  average…”      That is what he intends to do!      It is workable, but I take it on the understanding that the  Committee recognizes there is a substantial chance you are going to end up at 8 percent in a week  or so      Why can’t you use [unintelligible]?       I am sure you can, but how vulnerable is it?  How much is  the difference between--  Let me state the question straightforwardly  As I understood from earlier  discussions, and as I thought of it myself after the previous meeting, the question that I have and I  think some others had is  Given the microwave is too vulnerable--we will assume that for the  moment--isn’t there a large difference in vulnerability between the microwave and the leased line  without going to the secure link?  And if that is true, is it possible to continue on the leased line  basis, possibly pending the secure link, which some people think may be worth it?  I would add if  the quality is good enough  If the quality is mediocre, forget about it, based on my earlier  experience with these things  If the quality is really good maybe it is worth the $800,000  You can  use it for a variety of purposes      You could use it for Committee meetings and--      Sure, but how “easy” is it on that line?  I don’t know      It would be an improvement to have leased lines  I think  everybody would agree with some improvement in the--       Sure      I’ve talked to quite a few of you individually about this  since the last meeting and many of you have raised it with me  Peter can talk directly on how many  Presidents ever say anything specifically  I think there is quite a different attitude among some of  the Presidents  Some of them do feel it’s important to stay in touch and keep their people in touch   And I think I can say from the standpoint of the Desk that it is a disappointment to them to know  they have to present their thoughts in an orderly way--and kind of pass scrutiny even--if nobody  says anything for three months in a row  On balance, I think it is a healthy thing for them to have  to present the program in an orderly way  But my--      No, the second part you’d get the Governor; the first part  obviously you can’t        My recollection of this, going back to the mid-1950s when  I was once upon a time on the Desk, was that it was supposed to be a Governor and a President on  the call  And through the years the Governor fell off      You cannot hook an ordinary lease in New York or  Washington--one that is secure  The garbage in between is the problem       7/18/78              57    I would think the most vulnerable link is between New  York and Washington  That is where everybody is looking      Even if it is unscrambled with one hand and transmitted  through a box onto the other speaker      You can’t connect them up electronically, then?       How many times can you talk, though?      I take it the revised GNP figures are going to come out  fairly shortly  Do you have any strong feelings that they're going to be revised upward or revised  in either direction?      I've changed your figures by about 1/4 point--3 to 3-1/2  percent on the growth, 7-1/2 to 7-3/4 on the inflation factor, and unemployment somewhere around  6 or a little below  The growth outlook doesn't look entirely unsatisfactory to me; the inflation  outlook does      What kind of monetary policy do you assume?      Measured by interest rates      So moved     SPEAKER(?)  Seconded      Let me say, as I heard the economic forecasts around the  table--and I had a much lower inflation forecast than some, although slightly higher than the   staff’s--that I also have some sympathy, or fear or whatever the right word is, that those with the  high [inflation] forecasts are going to be the ones who are right  Phil Coldwell's forecast was  [high] in particular and I don't consider that out of the realm of possibility at all  It's the kind of  thing I hope we can avoid; I'm not sure of it  And that affects my policy judgment as well as the  feeling that a slower rate of growth in business, while certainly slower, is not unsatisfactory      The kind of projection that I've had in mind does assume that interest rates would be up  some  I don't think monetary policy has bitten particularly hard on the interest rate side thus far and  I'm not concerned about some modest further increase in interest rates purely on domestic grounds  and would have been in favor of some snugging regardless of the international situation  But for all  the reasons you've already referred to on the international side, I do think it’s important that we  make some move now  There has been some confusion over what our intentions have been, rightly  or wrongly, and I think it's important particularly in view of the international situation that we  correct the misapprehensions about our lack of concern over inflation  I do think it would be wise  to put a specific mention of the international situation in the directive at some point  We can talk  about the wording later; I would just make that point while I think of it  We have a precedent for  that, of course      In terms of the specifics, you suggested 7-3/4 to 8-1/4, which seems quite reasonable to me  A week ago or even a few days ago I might have said let's wait for the aggregates to come along  and I would expect they would move it to 8 percent but I wouldn’t have felt it was urgent  Given  what's going on in the rest of the world, I would say let's move to that midpoint of 8 right away and  be prepared to move further if the aggregates so suggest  I feel a little more restrictive than you do,  Mr Chairman, about the ranges for the aggregates; at 5 to 9, the midpoint does put us above even  the high end of the range we've just decided upon  I'd like to get it within that range  It's rather a  rare instance--I say without checking the record--having set a long-term range a month ago and  we're still within it      I would just as soon stay within it  So I was thinking  actually 3 to 8 or 4 to 8 as a possibility, and I would also lower the M2 range a bit--say, 6 to 10   That's not much of a lowering but I would get it down more clearly straddling the long-term range   This one is basically above the long-term range; the midpoint's within it, of course, but the lower  end is right at the long-term range and the upper end is above it  I would rather straddle it with M1,  too, so that's the difference  I do assume in saying that--otherwise I suppose I would be more  aggressive--that there will be in view of the international situation now a 1/2 percentage point  increase in the discount rate  That seems to me consistent with an 8 percent funds rate, as you  suggested, and has more than ordinary importance in view of the announcement effect, given  what's going on in the exchange markets     8/15/78             22      It'll take a day or two for people to realize what you are  doing  I would at least state it this way  See whether there is a consensus on this and it shouldn't  be [implemented] any later than the international package  There is no point in waiting to move an  1/8 beyond Thursday or Friday if you're going to have an international package      I would prefer it in the latter one since it's more  operational      It would not put the federal funds rate down if the  aggregates were weak unless they get [extremely] weak      I think you might get them to agree that if we change the  others, they would change     8/15/78             35      Four billion on our end ought to imply $20 billion on  their end      Well, [everything] has been said, I suppose, at this stage  of the game, although not always in the same way or with the same meaning  Everybody  approaches it from a different point of view  You did emphasize right from the start the importance  of a bargain here, and one of the reasons we haven't intervened was that the bargain wasn't there  I  think that's important  I think people have implicitly been saying, and I just want to emphasize this,  that it's probably a matter of where the rate is  I think if we weren't interested in intervening earlier,  quite properly it was because there was a great fear that dollar rates would go down some more and  that it was against our interest if they didn’t  At least some people thought that way  If we still feel  that way, I think we shouldn't be intervening  I don't  It seems to me that this rate has gone far  enough so that further appreciation of the yen gives us more difficulty than benefit  I feel quite  clear about that in my own mind  And if one does not feel clear about it, one ought to be suspicious  of this operation      But when I look at the price of steel going up here, and the price of small cars, and the price  of RCA television sets and I look at the repercussions on the Japanese trade balance with all the  J-curve perversities and all the rest, I don't think it's in our interest to see a further appreciation of a  currency that has already appreciated by 50 percent or 100 percent, depending on which way you  calculate it  It's exactly half of what it was against the dollar now compared to 1971  It's twice  what it was; I suppose that is the way to state it  I think what the Japanese are interested in is a  signal and not just a signal of no benign neglect  They're interested in a signal that the United  States says it's okay for them to intervene at these levels forcibly  And that's worth quite a lot to  them  If you're not willing to give that signal, you shouldn't be intervening  I'm willing to give that  signal at this level      That suggests that the operation may have to be a big one to make it credible, as Phil  suggests  I haven't thought of anything nearly as big as his numbers for us because I would expect  that while the numbers could get quite big they should be Japanese numbers  What they're looking  for is symbolism from us and not money from us  Now, that remains to be seen, on the negotiating  side  But if they did $20 billion, I don't know that we’d have to do $4 billion over the course of a  year or so  That remains to be seen  But I wasn't thinking in those kinds of numbers  Initially, I'd  certainly have a much more limited number in mind, even though I think they ought to be forceful,  let me put it that way  We're giving them permission to be forceful  And I would hope that we  don't have to worry about a take-out from the Treasury  I would again worry about the whole  operation  I think the take-out ought to be from the Bank of Japan, after about six months  That's  what we try to negotiate here so we don't have to go to the Treasury  You get a clean-cut  agreement with the Japanese that after six months or nine months, whatever it is, you're out      So you don't need the yen  I'm saying that we ought to  get the yen to repay from the Japanese      We're going to get it from the Bank of Japan, not from  the market      But why wouldn't you rather have the Bank of Japan do  it?  What advantages are there for having the Treasury do it, assuming they will do it?      Well, they do that with a lot of their intervention anyway   The amount involved here, I think, wouldn't affect that volume significantly      The [ESF] would have to take the risk of their swap too  and I don't see how they're going to manage that  If they can manage one [unintelligible] they can  manage the other      I would not insist that the Treasury take any major part  of this for that simple reason--their financial capacity  We want their support  We want it publicly   All of these political considerations that have been raised are very valid and there's no point in  doing it unless we really have White House support and Treasury support      Yes  It's just a question of which pocket it comes out of       Well, I happen to agree with the logic of what Alan said   on the 50-50 business  I think it's always been something of an anomaly  I have the feeling that it  was a lot easier to sell, particularly to the US Congress, that way and that's a pretty persuasive  reason  But if that reason has relaxed in any way, I would support the notion of making the       9/19/78            6  agreement conform to the logic of the situation  In principle I think we intervene when we think  there's an expectation of a profit anyway and it should work out for our financial advantage over a  period of time  I recognize that if it’s too difficult politically, that has to remain the persuasive  element for the moment, but over time I would like to see this made more symmetrical      May I just interject a supplementary question for Mr   Kichline to comment on?  I had a vague feeling that the industrial production figure is looking  good relative to other figures and that they don't seem quite consistent  Is that vague impression  accurate or not?      Well, the staff forecast seems reasonable to me  It's   probably a trifle higher than I would come up with on real growth and a trifle lower for inflation  but it doesn't seem at all unreasonable to me  As time passes here our recovery is looking a little  more tired, as I suppose in some sense it should  It's getting older  It's getting a little less liquid       9/19/78            13  than it was but I don't see any very quick or strong pressures coming from that end, although it  could build in the course of the next year  I feel a little better that it may work out reasonably well  in connection with some signs of revival in foreign growth, which would help the balance of  payments, help the dollar, help everybody feel better, and also add perhaps to the direct strength in  the business scene through the export side  I don't think that change is big but we seem to be  entering a situation here that's not totally satisfactory--to understate it  Some slowdown seems to  be reasonable, even a little more than the staff projected  I think it's a tolerable kind of situation  here, given the inflationary problems      Well, I approach it from exactly the opposite order you   approached it, Mr Chairman--from the aggregates to the federal funds rate rather than the reverse   I must confess to some bias toward keeping the short-term targets in some relationship with the  longer-term targets  Obviously in the past year or more we have been missing the target on the  upside  After our last big increase in the base, for a couple of months we ran within the new target,  but we are now moving outside it again  And it rather reinforces my feeling that we should not  accept something on M1 as high as 6 to 10, which seems to me to be a confession [that] we are  going to accept what September hath wrought  If indeed it "wrought-eth"  I won't repeat that      On M2, I think we have a little better argument for going   above the long-term range because we are getting--for reasons we know--the reaction to the  6-month certificates  So I could see raising [the range we had] last month and going higher than  the long-term range there  I think I'd be happier with something like 6 to 11 or 6-1/2 to 11 than  what is there under alternative B  I would really be happier on M1 if we stick to 4 to 8  But then I  think I would constrain the federal funds rate just the way you did, Mr Chairman  I don't know as  I couldn't live with 9 at the upper end, but I can see where that might appear to be a fairly rapid  movement, certainly justifying a new look  And maybe you don't want to do it even if you had the  look--even if the aggregates [forced you] into the look  So I am perfectly willing to second the  motion on an 8-1/4 to 8-3/4 percent range  I just want to get the aggregates down from the level  specified in alternative B      8-1/2     I'd want to go somewhat lower on M1     Well, I'd like to go lower on both, but particularly I don't   like the 6 percent bottom     5 to 9     I agree with that, too     If you'll go lower on M1, I'll go with that     No, 4 to 8 is what I originally said     I would move immediately to the midpoint and [then]   move to the upper end and remain that way     I would support it     4 to 8       9/19/78            35     I was wondering about 4 to 9--approach it by steps  Say   4 to 9 and 6-1/2 to 10-1/2      It isn't quite clear, I think, [whether] the interest rates are  fully offset      I agree with that, Mr Chairman  I think that the analysis  was put pretty well in the memorandum and that it makes sense in the long run  But I recognize the  political problems involved, so I think we better defer to the Treasury in the short run      I'm in the happy or unhappy position of feeling just about  the same way I felt last month, which is--      I agree with all the comments that the risk is for slower  growth on the growth side and more inflation on the inflation side  In fact, I project a slightly  slower real growth rate and a slightly higher inflation rate  I don't know what the implications are  of these comments, which I suppose I agree with, that it's difficult to have this nice, gradual  slowing down  I don't think the easy answer is to speed it up under these circumstances  I think  we're just left in a difficult situation      I do feel a little more pessimistic about some of these [things]--well, optimistic in one  respect and pessimistic in another respect--on the external side  Anyway, I've been presented with  a forecast--I don't think any of these are very reliable--that would show more rapid improvement in  the current account as we get on into the next year than the forecast that Mr Truman had; they're in  the same direction  I'm not so optimistic about any convergence in the inflation rates; I guess you  didn't have a convergence, [Ted], but I would think there might be more divergence than was  suggested here, partly because of the dynamics of the exchange rate itself  I don't think it will work  through at all with the kind of exchange rate changes we've gotten recently  That will continue to  depress price performance and economic activity abroad and give us inflationary problems for  some time here--even if it stopped right now, which I'm not so sure it's going to do  But even if it  did, I think this would take a period of three to six months to work through anyway  And that tends  to work against any convergence of inflation rates internationally  I think that's unfortunate but  true      I just had a question of Steve  If I understood him  correctly, he's saying continue the present ranges of 6-1/2 to 9 and 7-1/2 to 10 for M2 and M3, but  go to 5 to 7-1/2 for M1+  I'm just asking for the technical consistency  If you look at the  Bluebook, it would say that the 5 to 7-1/2 would be consistent with higher M2 and M3 figures or  vice versa      What does a collateral item mean?      As the footnote         10/17/78 35               The question is how much weight it has in the operation      Are you saying the same thing then for M1?  Is that also  treated in this way?      But you're having M1 now in full parity with M2 and M3  in these long-term targets?         10/17/78 36               We are just talking about one quarter, too      I don't know where we are procedurally, Mr Chairman   I'm ready to talk about substance if you're finished with this      I don't think it's a major issue if [M1] is downgraded         10/17/78 40               You had a little discussion [before] the break that got into  the substance of policy, and I just want to say that I want to be prudent and cautious too  I don't  think we could be accused of not having been prudent and cautious and gradual  I do have some  question as to whether we pitched it at the right level in the last year  I suppose I answer this  question with a feeling, having looked back, that we've been a little too easy--not drastically so but  we’ve tended to be on that side  And meanwhile inflation has gotten worse, and that's the principal  problem that we face; it’s the major risk to the stability of the economy  If it does accelerate, I  think that's the thing that is going to produce the worst recession, not necessarily in the short run  but in the long run--by which I mean two years instead of one year  I'm not looking way out in the  future      I was thinking of a period of probably 15 to 18 months      There is something to what you say  But I also think  inflationary expectations have hardened a bit during this period even while the actual rate is going  down from 11 to 8 or whatever it is now  And that is a problem  I do think this is a critical period,  partly because the President's program gives us a little chance here maybe to change psychology  I  think everybody is going to look at that cynically  But it does offer the only opportunity we have--I  don't know of another--to change expectations a little bit  I think the principal reason people can be  cynical about it--there are many reasons and many fears--is legitimate  I think that it will squeeze  profits and that it will lead to controls and all the rest  But my first [concern] is that people will see  this as a substitute for monetary or fiscal restraint  And I don't think we want to feed that  expectation  We will legitimately maximize the effectiveness of the President's program, I think, if  we show that it's not a substitute  Hopefully he will say that it is not a substitute      I know we don't know what [the President’s program] will be, which gives us a little  technical problem  All I know is what I read in the newspaper  If what I read in the newspaper is  right, I think you can mechanically argue that our present targets, taking the midpoints of the  ranges, are probably a little too high  If he's really talking about guidelines of the sort that you see- -a price guideline of under 6 percent and a wage guideline of 7 percent--and we get the kind of  productivity that was being implied this morning, those are not inconsistent  Now, we can be  skeptical about whether he will be successful, but we are in a little peculiar position, I think, in  having an easier monetary policy in some sense in terms of the aggregates than the President's  program would call for  I don't know what it is, but this does leave me with the feeling that you can       10/17/78 41             justify the current ranges--I'm now talking M2 and M3--though they're probably a little high  But  they give us enough leeway to go down, and we don't know what the President's program is going  to be  I would prefer to see those slightly lower but I can live with the present ranges      The only problem I have with it is that I don't see why the  M1 is so high  It’s a degraded item, but--      You don't know in either direction      With the understanding also that M1 is substantially  downgraded in the language?      My inclination, more or less consistently with what I said  earlier, would be to move the federal funds rate to 9 now, and maybe provide a range of 8-3/4 to  9-1/2  The M2 range for alternative [unintelligible] looks to me consistent with what we just  decided for the long run  I don't know what you can say about M1 in particular  I think you can  say one thing--that if it was high, it would be significant  I don't know quite what that number is,  but I think we have to put the weight on M2, with the caveat that if M1 came in high--I suppose I  would consider 6 or 7 percent high--against the projections and the automatic transfers, that ought  to [carry] some additional weight  That's the kind of thing that would push us above the initial 9  percent that I would talk about  The projections say it wouldn't happen but if it did happen, I'd  want to react      That seems a little high to me  I was just mumbling to  myself      That 7 is a little high      No, just because the 7 is too high      Let me just argue the other side  The 7 is awfully high  when we're getting this automatic transfer      No  I don't prefer that 6 to 10 either      But M2 looks plenty high to me      Just to be clear, M1 is kind of meaningless unless it's up  toward the top of this limit  There's no weight really on anything below that?      No, we worry about it  [But] no matter how low it goes--      The idea of a meeting has problems, I think, which have  been alluded to here  I think Ernie has hit on a very good point as to the importance of this  program and its [implication] for monetary policy  But maybe the burden is the other way, I would  just suggest, in the sense of any announcement  [I say that] as one Committee member, anyway,  who hopes that in shaping this program they do not try to box us in our monetary policy precisely   But anything they would want to say about the need for a consistent monetary policy--in terms of  the growth of the monetary aggregates being consistent with a reduction in inflation--I think we  ought to applaud         10/17/78 56               That's precisely what I'm worried about      I sure wouldn't like to see them say that in the first place      That's right       You want a numerical estimate      Well, Mr Chairman, whatever numbers I have--the  [unintelligible] in my mind would be considerably greater than usual  I do think there's a chance of  a recession; it can't be dismissed  But I don't see why it should be large at this stage  And I don't  feel any more that way this month than last month  In fact, I think the program probably stabilized  expectations in a favorable way  I like the impact on the long-term bond market at least  But [I’d  expect] something for the rate of growth of not much more than 2 percent third quarter to third  quarter  I guess I would think the prices are going to be higher than the staff projected--maybe  around 8 percent for that period  The unemployment rate doesn't change much but it would be up  some--say, to 6-1/4 percent      You get a tax reduction      [Unintelligible]      Well, I guess I come out slightly differently than you do,  Mr Chairman  I really have one concern when I look ahead at the 4-week period until we meet  again, and that is that we adequately back up the program that has already been announced  I think  it has had a good effect internationally  I think it has had a good effect domestically in terms of--  "breaking" the inflationary psychology is much too strong a word but I think it has at least shaken  thinking of the inevitability of more inflation anyway  And everybody is looking to see whether  we will carry through  I don't think that implies a lot of tightening  But I do think we have to be  sensitive to what goes on in the exchange markets and sensitive to what goes on in the aggregates,  particularly on the high side, as Steve suggested      Just looking at the federal funds rate, I would not like to see it go below the 9-3/4 level  where we are, and I frankly would like the Desk to have a little flexibility to play it immediately,  depending upon the exchange market, somewhere between 9-3/4 and 10 percent  And I certainly  would be prepared to go above 10 if the aggregates got [beyond] those figures that you suggested   In fact, I would put the aggregates figures down, say, 1/2 percentage point from where you  suggested on the up side  And I'd be prepared to go somewhat above 10 percent if the aggregates  moved up in that area  I do think the outlook, as has been the basic pattern in the past, is for high  figures  Our own analysis suggests that they are going to remain high without higher levels of  interest rates than we have now, a little bit in contrast to what the Board staff is suggesting  These  estimates are very uncertain  I don't want to attach a lot of weight to them, but I think there is a  possibility that the aggregates could remain quite high, and we ought to be alert to it at this juncture  particularly  I suppose that means we should use an aggregates directive--at least a lopsided  aggregates directive on the high side      I do think we need more language in here about the  international business just to reflect what has been going on      Well, I have the other--     11/21/78              28      Let's move the top of M2 down to 9      I want to bias the result      And we consult if these aggregates get high      What about the language?      I have a proposal but I don't [know] whether it's--      Well, on page 14 it refers to [the international situation]      Well, I just wrote in a different phrase here [beginning  with] the “while” for the first sentence  “In the short run, the Committee seeks to achieve bank  reserve and money market conditions that are broadly consistent with the longer-run ranges for the  money aggregates cited above, while supporting the objective of stabilizing the foreign exchange  value of the dollar”  That is all I put in      No, I just left that out and put this in as a substitute      Well, stabilizing--      Well, that's what we just announced that we were doing      We said we are going to call it to a halt and reverse it   Now, you could argue that we are allowing some up--      I have no hang-up on the word “stabilizing”  I just wrote  that in there      It just seems too weak to me  I have no problem  [leaving] in domestic markets; I just wanted more prominence to the international  After all, this  program is certainly--      The trouble is we've used it when we didn't mean much   That's the problem      Well, you could say while “supporting” the foreign  exchange--or “strengthening”      Strengthening the foreign exchange value of the dollar or  giving due regard to strengthening it      Well, “while giving due regard to developing conditions  in domestic financial markets and supporting the value of the dollar in the foreign exchange  markets”  That's the way you have it, Mr Altmann?       It is also larger relative to our balance of payments,  which I think is the main--      [Unintelligible]      They are      Well, after that conversation I would just offer an  observation  It’s hard for me to see how you get down to this 7 to 7-1/2 percent range in prices in  the second half of next year unless you are putting an awful lot of weight on the President’s  program  But that’s not my question  My question is budgetary  I think you have by the full  employment measure of stimulus actually negative stimulus--if that’s the right term--in the first  quarter, which surprises me a little bit with the tax reduction, so any comment you would offer on  that I would appreciate  But also I get the sense at least the money market analysts in New York  for some reason are beginning to project a substantially larger budget deficit this year than the  official estimate      Well, it’s not early enough to have--  They also have a  very large one in the following year  That’s maybe a recession, but I don’t think a recession is the  full explanation this year  All I asked for is comments from the staff about this possibility      What surprises me about this is that some of them have  been ahead of the government in projecting a lower deficit in recent years and lower expenditures,  which has turned out to be the case  Now it seems to be reversed       Which is similar to the Administration’s figure       12/19/78          9      I understand that  Still that’s only half the tax reduction,  or a little more than half         Well, like everybody else, I see a little more momentum  in the economy than we anticipated  And I would anticipate that that would continue a while into  the new year  [So I see] not much short-term danger, though I do continue to think that there’s a  substantial risk of an actual downturn in the latter half of 1979, let’s say  But the question is where  that risk comes from  How we can best minimize it?  I think the risk of aggravating that chance by  tight money is very small  The decline in the money supply that I see looks very temporary to me  [based on] all historical experience--a temporary aberration when the economy is expanding as fast  as it is  I suspect it will show up in large part as a bad seasonal adjustment factor when we get all  finished with it      So, I’d want a lot more evidence before that figure frightens me into any easing of interest  rates against the background of a persistently high rate of growth in the money supply  I think a  much greater risk for the economy is a perpetuation of what we saw before November 1--the falling  away of confidence reflected in the feeling that there was no grip on inflation or on the exchange     12/19/78          23    rate  I think that is the kind of event that could not only maximize the chance of a recession but  maximize the severity of a recession if and when it appears  And we have the very evident fact,  which many people have commented on, that inflation is getting worse and not better      When one looks at those risks, I don’t think we have any choice  I don’t think we can  afford to sit here passively at this time  I think we are maximizing the risks of both inflation and  recession--and severe recession--if we aren’t alert to moving in a somewhat more restrictive  direction  I think, as other people have suggested, that we ought to be ready to move quickly if the  aggregates begin moving up again, but I think we also have to move if the exchange markets  suggest that necessity  I do not think we can hold this exchange market by intervention alone  I  think that’s purely a fatuous view of our abilities in these circumstances        When I look at this, I don’t know whether we absolutely have to move immediately  But  given the impact of the oil price and the effect that has on confidence, I would think a little  prophylactic move might be wise, in terms of moving before the exchange market gets any worse  than it has gotten in a very mild way  I’d be guided from there on with an eye both on the  aggregates getting too high or the exchange markets coming under pressure  And under no  circumstances would I give any sense of easing or backing away from what we have already  accomplished  I think that’s the worst possible action we could take at this point, regardless of  what happens to the aggregates in the course of the next month      He didn’t give a funds rate range      Well, these are my feelings  I’m nervous about any  decline here, as I said  But with the asymmetrical aspect, I guess I could live with it  I would  prefer having the lower parts of the ranges even lower  But I can live with it      Even the economy hasn’t gone down       Are you suggesting that you can take the aggregate limit  and put it under the procedural instructions?       I happen to have a preference along with Governor  Coldwell on this  This is the basic limit and I think the Committee probably ought to have one  I  would swallow the public relations disadvantage and make sure it’s big enough, but I could go  either way in the end        So moved       Many of these proposals follow directly [the  requirements] of the Humphrey-Hawkins Act; we haven’t got much choice  They’re presented as a  decision of the Subcommittee on the Directive but they’re really just translating the Act into what  we have to do       That’s not true of every one but it’s true of many       Chuck, you say you never do it  Almost all of the GNP  figures that are discussed at this time of the year are yearly figures        You can’t read the newspaper without reading that  number       It would be an annual base drift         The [second] Tuesday doesn’t come early enough in  February and July, I suspect       Maybe in this particular year, but it wouldn’t regularly        I don’t think it necessarily implies forecasting a  Committee forecast       We can take account of the future, but we don’t have to  say this policy will produce X GNP      But most of the time it will be in the range of uncertainty  anyway  Nobody can say with full conviction whether it’s consistent or inconsistent        That’s what we contemplate continuing       Well, this language “the apparent consistency or  inconsistency of alternative monetary growth rates with the President’s economic goals”--isn’t  quite clear to me, Chuck, just semantically  In the discussion I think we made clear that what we  did not want the staff doing is coming in and saying that X is consistent and Y is inconsistent   Then if we get asked, we’d have to quote that       I think that might be said about this recommendation,  Mr Chairman  We did look at this thing entirely aside from Humphrey-Hawkins  These last six  months, however, have reflected some considerable thinking by the Subcommittee on the  Directive, right or wrong, as to what the substance of this should be apart from  Humphrey-Hawkins       Well, I think this comment of Ernie’s makes half the  point I was going to make  I think there was a lot of sympathy, which should not be overlooked, on  the subcommittee for paying more attention to the long-term averages  I felt that and I think some  others did  That may not come through here very strongly because you read the [conclusion] of  rejecting the mechanical [link] and I think that is precisely what the subcommittee did  It had  sympathy for paying a lot more attention to the long range but it followed a different track in  saying any of the mechanical devices we fooled around with have flaws and we shouldn’t be bound  by a particular mechanical device  And that’s precisely where I came out  We should pay more  attention, just don’t have a particular mechanical device  And I would say semantically in this  proposal of Larry’s that I just don’t agree that the spirit of the new law clearly requires changes in  the present procedures  As a matter of fact, I don’t know of anything in the new law or in the  discussion that implies that  It may be a good idea to change them, but I don’t think we can refer  back to the spirit of the law        I don’t want to prolong this, but I think there’s a certain  confusion here  I agree that looking at the trend over a period of time is the only way to make  sense out of the way these numbers are moving  The question here, as I see it, is what you are  looking at in a particular decision at a particular Committee meeting  And what you are looking at  then is what will happen before you can make another decision next month  And I think the typical  question that you are asking is the one that Mark asked earlier, and which somebody asks at almost  all these meetings  Should we react to a 10 percent rate of growth in the money supply next month  or should we react in the other direction if it only goes up 2 percent?  What is that relevant range?   Now, mechanically these things come out the same  I just think it’s a little more confusing in the  communication among ourselves to obscure the next month by this long-term averaging the  chairman of the subcommittee referred to  Where we are discussing annual averages or quarterly  averages, the trouble with the averaging procedure is that it is so elongated that there is very little  time left to affect the average  That’s precisely the problem        There is nothing in this procedure that affects how much  information you have  You know every past month, you know half of the present month, and you  don’t know the next month  Whether you add it up together or not, that’s what you know        Why not even bring it right up into this text here?       We are going to look at the use of reserves as the  operational variable, are we not, Mr Chairman?       So moved   Well, so far as the economy is  concerned, I have been interested in whether the higher numbers of the  fourth quarter are being carried over into a mood of more business  buoyancy than we have had in recent months I have contacted [several  people in] the business community recently and they suggest that that  is the case I don't know whether that's just a lagging indicator or  whether it's significant One has the feeling that, without doing     2 / 6 / 1 9  -10-   anything very dramatic, people may be reaffirming their capital  spending intentions anyway and that there's a little less certainty in  people's minds that we're going to have a recession I continue to  feel that we could have a recession, but it's by no means certain I  wouldn't rule one out, by any means, in the second half of the year  But in terms of the recession outlook itself, I think the number one  problem continues to be the concern about the price level  greatest risk to the economy, as well as [to actual] inflation, is  people having the feeling that prices are getting out of control I  think the tenor of our policy should still be in the direction of  reinforcing and building on the degree of credibility that has been  gained in recent months, both in the Administration and in the Federal  Reserve That should be our first priority I don't think we can do  much about the uncertainty on the business side by a gesture toward  easing policy at this point; I think that would be a mistake It  would probably increase the risks of recession   The   When I look at these long-term ranges, let me say that there  is one influence on the aggregates recently that hasn't been mentioned  and that people at my Bank think might be quite important And that  is the increase in Federal Reserve float; it has been quite sharp and  unprecedented Whether it has had an influence or not depends upon  how corporations in particular look upon their bank balances and  whether they're operating in effect off their own check book or off  the amount of money the bank tells them they have in the bank If it  is the latter--and I'm sure that's true of a lot of corporations--the  increase in float has the perverse effect of pushing down the reported  money supply in a way that isn't real   The recipient couldn't have less He  has the same as he would otherwise have He cashes the check but--   The fellow who writes the check has  more and he spends the money   But they do to big corporations   Well, my staff pretty well convinced  me that it goes in this direction Nobody knows, but the change in  float has been so big that I think it might have had an [effect]  We'll see when float goes down what it is   Then we'll have the reverse effect if  this explanation is right   In any event, this makes it  particularly difficult We've had this big increase in money market  funds along the lines of a change in appraisals of cash balances  versus other media But, in looking at numbers for the long-term  aggregates, I come up with ranges for M2 and M3 about like those in  alternative A, but the M1 range in "A" looks too high to me Just  adding the 3 percent for ATS produces an upper limit that seems much  too high to me I would suggest something like 1 to 4 percent for M1  So, these numbers that I'm suggesting are about 1 percentage point  lower than what Mr Axilrod just suggested   Well, it's more like "B" for M1, but  I would go along with "A" for M2 and M3   That may not be the most reliable  projection   I like it   Well, I suspect that is the issue  more than any particular numbers we put down I would want to be  biased, so I'm on the opposite side of this from Mr Partee I might  just interject that I consulted very carefully with my resident  monetarist guru in New York and he assured me that he is not worried  about the money supply figures at all at this time; [this weakness]  would have to go on for several more months   He is absolutely purist He is as  pure as he can be He looked back at historical experience and these  one-quarter deviations don't mean anything   I think this is precisely the point  We have had a pattern where the deviations on the down side have not  been a one-quarter deviation but a one-cycle deviation And we now     2 / 6 / 1 9  -34-    have a one-quarter deviation on the down side and I want to be  asymmetrical   It’s going to have the long-term  ranges in there and it makes some reference to--   Not too well That definitely seems  a little too neutral I like that less than just saying that we’re  going to stick with [a funds rate of] around 10 percent     2/6/19 - 3 8 -    In practice, I'm not sure it makes a  lot of difference; obviously it's not going to be published for  another month anyway   My problem is that there is a   Because it tells me that--   Well, that's my problem My problem  is that it's tied entirely to the aggregates when I'm not indifferent  on whether [the funds rate] goes up or down I think the adverse  risks of [the funds rate] going down are greater, due to the foreign  exchange situation, than the adverse risks of it going up   Is the directive we have out now  symmetrical or is it written in this asymmetrical way?   I understand we've ignored the bottom  limit but it has some asymmetrical language     2 / 6 / 7 9  - 3 9 -    Okay That sounds all right to me  I’d want to repeat that performance   Right   Too high on the aggregate ranges   This says we don't do anything while  they are within the range but consult when [either] is outside   There is no mention of the federal  funds rate in here at all except it says we stay where we are   [I'd like to] get a little more  language in there about foreign exchange It's in there but as such  it says we look at the foreign exchange market   We might improve it just by  eliminating the words that follow the foreign exchange--those on the  domestic financial markets   Leave out everything except the  foreign exchange market   Where are we? Did we leave out these  phrases or what?   We have to look at this question; I  don't think this $500 million implies that we've answered it   We have yen and we don't have any  [yen] debt    Well, if I look far enough ahead, Mr  Chairman, meaning through the year, I think the odds are better than  5 0 / 5 0  that we‘re going to run into a recession by [year-end], and I’ve  thought that for some time I think the odds are being increased by     3 / 2 0 / ? 9  -10-   the oil situation and by what's going on in inflation generally  Having said that, I don't think we can change that much by any modest  adjustments in monetary policy I believe a real easing in monetary  policy is likely to make things worse My reasoning is that in the  short run--and I'm mainly impressed by the evidence of the last six  weeks or so--1 think we're much more up against capacity [constraints]  and growing shortages, caused in part by those GNP figures you just  read and the continuous upward revisions in those figures for the  fourth quarter I don't see that the economy has any real margin to  grow here without seriously aggravating our inflationary problem I  think the growth we had late last year is already aggravating our  inflationary problem And I believe an attempt to [induce] very fast  growth here would increase the odds not only of a recession but a more  serious recession as we go along   One doesn't have to speculate to see that inflation is a lot  worse In my view we'll be lucky if that Commerce figure stays at 10  percent for the first quarter when the final number comes out  Commodity prices are rising; through the latest information we have  them rising at alarming rates I suspect the oil price increase that  the staff has projected in a very uncertain situation is, if anything,  low; and it might be substantially low Essentially, I think we're in  retreat on the inflation side; if there's not a complete rout, it's  close to it And in my view that poses the major danger to the  stability of the economy as we proceed It's an obvious danger for  international stability despite the welcome respite we've had in the  last three or four months That remains a major problem not only in  terms of economic stability but in the dimensions beyond that if the  dollar stability should give way not just to an erosion but the  panicky situation we had earlier   So, without getting into any more details, there's no doubt  in my mind that even if we didn't look at the aggregates at all, this  is the time for some firming rather than the reverse I think we are  at a critical point in the inflation program, with the tide against  us ~f we don't show any response at all, we are giving an  unfortunate signal in my judgment I believe those concerned about  inflation would find no response during this period almost  inexplicable in terms of what we say regarding our worries about  inflation I do think there is some risk of a boomlet I don't think  it would go very far in real terms because I doubt the economy has the  capacity to meet it But it could add to those inflationary  pressures, lead to excess ordering, and potentially to excess  inventory building that would only make a recession worse if indeed we  are going to have a recession later this year or in early [19801 So,  without getting into the real complications caused by the money supply  figures, but noting that I pretty much share M r   Axilrod's conclusions  in that respect, it seems to me that the real factors point in the  direction I've indicated   I do think we need to make some move  in recognition of what has been happening on the inflation front And  I think it’s good for the stability of the economy in the long run, as  I said earlier In terms of getting back into the longer-range  targets, these figures on page 10 don’t look particularly frightening  to me in terms of what it would take to get back [into the ranges] by  the third quarter It seems fairly natural; it’s only a 6 percent  rate of growth in M1 I’m not sure we wouldn‘t get that, or maybe  even exceed it, in the ordinary course of events I don’t know I  don‘t think that target itself, though written in our records, is  written in heaven, given all the uncertainties that we had when we set  it But it doesn’t look to me as if we’re out of sight of it  completely when I look at what it takes to come back I also think  we‘re in a much better position in terms of any easing move that we  might want to make as time wears on If these concerns about a  recession, which I share to some degree, are true, we’re going to want  to be easing at some point; we‘re going to have to I would rather     3/20/19 -29-   make a small gesture now toward some firming and have a little more  credibility when the case for easing is clear without upsetting the  whole psychology of our basic anti-inflation program I think we’d be  a little better off Looking at it in terms of the funds rate, I  would be happiest going to 10-1/2 percent, which is a fairly small  move when it becomes visible I could live with the figures that Mr  Coldwell or Mr Kimbrel cited certainly, which would involve a very  modest move to 10-1/4 percent and putting the range at 10 to 10-1/2  percent   I’ve been sitting here thinking about whether the money  market or aggregates approach is better With that kind of range and  with some modest initial move, I could live with the aggregates  approach easily enough, although I was originally thinking of a money  market [directive] Any of the ranges that have been mentioned for  the aggregates seem a little on the high side to me except for the M2  range of 3 to I percent, which doesn’t bother me at all For M1, 8  percent on the high side does worry me and I’d rather go with  something like 2 to I percent and make sure we stay at 10-1/4 percent  [on the funds rate] or move slightly higher if M1 actually gets up to  the I percent area I recognize that we have the telephone conference  alternative at all times too, so the exact level of the aggregates  isn’t quite as important to me as the movement on the funds rate I’d  like to make some gesture there immediately   We don't actually know there's going  to be one   No I can buy the ranges for the  aggregates but the one for the funds rate I can't   A plurality--   And that means no change in the  prevailing federal funds rate?   I don't know that this is a religious  issue I can see charging a little more but it's perhaps a peculiarly  bad time, given the unfortunate profitability situation of government  securities dealers for some time now I wonder whether we couldn't go  along as we are now without throwing a rock in the bucket   If you can't, [then] you get the  Subcommittee or the Vice Chairman You could have the Chairman not  there and the rest of the Subcommittee [available], couldn't you?   But in the first instance if the  Chairman wasn't there and the rest of the Subcommittee were  available--   If $300 million is right for the  daily limit, and I think they need something like that flexibility by  the day, it's hard to see that three days of operations [could occur1  without formally figuring the--   I, for one, would feel that they need  the leeway because it‘s just too cumbersome to get the Committee  together when caught in the heat of battle We can’t get into that  kind of--    All I have is the GNP deflator in  your forecast, which I think is 94 percent this year What would  that be in terms of consumer prices?   We are going to have to have a pretty  low rate of price increase in the second half of the year to make  9-1/4 percent, given this first quarter   Let me make a couple of observations  I sit here listening to all this about the aggregates and it seems to  me that the only reasonable conclusion is not to put much weight on  the aggregates We see relationships that go way out of the range of  historical experience We haven't any idea of the validity of the  forecast [for the monetary aggregates], I'm afraid, and the  combination of those two events does not make me want to linger over  the aggregates When I look at the outlook for real GNP, it does seem  to me that the staff forecast of six quarters of approximately 1  percent growth in GNP per quarter is inherently improbable I don't  think that has ever happened   That is precisely the difficulty  The reason they have come up with this forecast is that one doesn't  know whether the 3 percent error will in fact be plus or minus I  must say in talking about projection errors that I am much more  concerned about the persistent errors in the projections of the  inflation rate than I am about the recent errors in the projections of  the monetary aggregates The inflation projections have been     4/17/79 -16-   consistently on the low side And I‘m not just talking about the  staff’s projections; I think that has been true of most forecasters  And [inflation] clearly remains our problem In any longer-range or  indeed shorter-range perspective, the inflationary momentum has been  increasing In terms of economic stability in the future that is what  is likely to give us the most problems and create the biggest  recession And the difficulty in getting out of a recession, if we  succeed, is that it conveys an impression that we are not dealing with  inflation I’m afraid that is the impression that we are conveying  We talk about gradually decelerating the rate of inflation over a  series of years In fact, it has been accelerating over a series of  years and hasn‘t yet shown any signs of reversing I devoutly hope  that it will in the second half of this year, but I think the staff is  probably being too optimistic on what it will show in the normal  course of events I think the economy is essentially at full capacity  and there is a real chance that the concern about a recession will be  justified But I also think there‘s some possibility we will have  more of a boom for a longer period of time than we hope I think it‘s  clear that real interest rates are falling and the rate of inflation  is up   That is right My observation would  be that the expected rate of inflation has increased somewhat in the  last six months and the nominal rate of interest has not Therefore,  the real rate of interest has declined I don’t see any reason why  the profitability of investment under present conditions would be  declining in Mr Axilrod’s terms, so I think policy has probably  gotten somewhat easier We may be one month closer to a recession  than we were last month and I think we are late [in tightening], but I  still am of the view that some greater degree of restriction would be  more appropriate than the reverse [and] more appropriate than standing  still   I think you were very eloquent, Mr  Chairman, and I agree with a good deal of what you had to say, but  overlooked was the fact that inflation has tended to get worse and  that the economy is very much at capacity and ought to slow down So  I find myself very much with Mr Coldwell in terms of the  specifications   I meant to mention those, too I  think that is correct   [Given] the fact that we've been  operating with a money market [directive], I presume we would continue  to do so almost regardless of what we say here today   I think that would be appropriate,  yes   That’s the M2 [you proposed]   I don’t feel very sensitive to these   I can‘t worry about a half percentage point on either end   1’11 go with your aggregates if you  go with my interest rate You can go another half percent--   Isn’t that right where we started  Out?   No   No   Do you have an April housing starts  figure for me?   Could we have some clarification of  the legal point?   Just government, right?   My assumption always has been that  [the authority to hold foreign government securities] was not put in  the Act originally because in those days there was not much deficit  financing; there weren’t many foreign government securities What  [central banks] held in those days were acceptances, deposits or some  other form Am I wrong about that?   It just wasn’t listed   Well, what I have to say is more or  less along the lines of what Henry was just talking about Let me  state it perhaps slightly differently I don't see this as an issue  at this point It may be a nice issue but I assume we're not being  asked now to go out and acquire a substantial amount of foreign  currencies to hold more or less indefinitely What I see as a problem  here, which is a byproduct of intervention, is that when we run out of  indebtedness--if that's the way to put it--if we don't hold any  foreign currencies, we can't intervene on the side of the market in  which we are now intervening That may be inconvenient if we're not  prepared to hold foreign currencies I don't think intervention     4/11/19 -41   policies should be controlled by an inability to hold foreign  currencies Also, it makes sense to be symmetrical If we’re willing  to go into debt, we ought to be willing to go long on the other side  And something like $2 billion may allow us a reasonable amount of  leeway around zero, but [I don‘t see that] as a permanent holding  That‘s the way I view this and on that basis I would support it I am  not ready to support a permanent massive holding at this point   Between the Treasury and the Federal  Reserve - -   Yes    Let me just say, so far as the aggregates are concerned, Mr  Chairman, that while apparently the staff up here doesn’t depart from the general outline of what     4I21l19 6   Steve reported, they do have substantially higher numbers for May than the zero that Steve has for  M1 growth In other words, they [estimate growth will be] down but not down that far, which  would give us a two-month figure somewhere above Steve’s projections I don’t know how much  this is worth but [our staffs estimates] are all off in that direction And, of course, we’ve got these  other numbers like the NOWs and ATS accounts and money market mutual funds continuing to  rise So I think we do have a pretty big bulge here, despite the complications of the tax date In  general, as you know, I thought we should have been a little tighter before so I’m not disinclined to  following the directive That seems to be a minimal [step]; I would associate myself with Mr  Coldwell and Mr Partee in that regard   Seems to me highly appropriate    What period are you talking about?   I have heard a great deal of wisdom  even without our getting around the rest of the table, Mr Chairman  I’m not sure it has yet resolved all of the uncertainties in my own  mind I do share a lot of the feeling that has just been expressed  about inflation; I think we tend to duck that issue Something was  said earlier about there not being much precedent for bringing down  the rate of inflation rapidly I’m afraid there isn’t much precedent  for bringing it down slowly over a number of years either, which is a  measure of the difficulty of our problem I’m impressed by the degree  that inflation is now built into thinking in terms of the business  outlook I’m also impressed--the supporting factor--by the degree  with which capacity problems and backlogs exist But certainly the  outlook is uncertain The recent news hasn’t been very buoyant So I  would conclude that the time is not very propitious for much of a  change in either direction There’s a fair amount of time before our  next meeting   I would think that with either new  financial or monetary data or business news, the Chairman might see an  occasion for at least a telephone consultation some time in that  interim   Well, I sometimes agree with that,  particularly if the Committee were to make precisely the decision that  I’d like; then, I‘d like to go home for 6 months, too I can‘t  foresee that Frank Morris said that we can’t casually assume the  recession will be mild I suppose we can‘t casually assume it,  although it looks that way to me now--if we’re going to have one But  we can’t always be looking at the worst If we’re going to balance  these risks of inflation and recession we have to run not too scared  that the recession is going to be worse than we expect So it is a  question of bringing about a balance A s  I thought about what to do,  I arrived at the same conclusion that Steve did up to a point--that  maybe for lack of anything better we should go back and look at the  aggregates a bit I certainly think we ought to widen the range I  just don‘t see how we can operate on a narrower range even with less  than the extreme volatility that Henry just mentioned My  disagreement with Steve would be that I was thinking of widening the  range mostly in the downward direction rather than widening it on the  up side But I do think that’s a reasonable approach as we watch both  the aggregates and the business news in the next six weeks   I just want to raise a technical  question and make a technical point You estimate that about 10  percent of the April growth was due to the tax business?   You have assumed that will be washed  out in the next month or so?   These numbers that we’re looking at  for May and June are really below normal in some sense   I wouldn’t be all that far from wheEe  Steve is On the funds rate, I have no problem AS I suggested  earlier, taking account of the unwinding of the tax effects, I would  prefer to see the M1 range go from a minus number up to 4-112 percent  and I’d keep the M2 range near where it is I would treat it during  the period very much as Steve suggested If [money growth] really  goes down, I’d lower the funds rate; and if it goes to the up side,  I‘d move up pending some dramatic business news  [at least] one piece of disappointing news Housing starts [are  disapointingl; durable goods are even more so   Each meeting we get   I could go either way on that   Well, I guess this is within my  limits of tolerance If we go down to 9-3/4 percent on the funds     5/22/79 -34-   rate, we ought to go to 8-1/2 percent on M2 That would make me a  little happier but you're right about the understanding on the funds  rate   Would the aggregates directive be  consistent or inconsistent with the Axilrod caveat?   I don't think it's quite as good, but  I can go along with it     We could invest in the Euro market   I’m not sure it is going to help  chuck, but it may help me I have no problems with the first  understanding, but I want to make explicit what seems to me implicit  here And that is that the balances we acquire we don’t acquire for  the sake of acquiring balances but mostly as the by-product of what we  want to do in intervention   Whatever [side] it happens to be   Yes, it is reasonable   May I come back with an argument?   Yes, I would like to give that  authority but we [now] have the limit so small   We are making an exception to the     5 / 2 2 / 7 9  -46-    Yes    Well, I have some scattered thoughts, yes I am  impressed by the fact that looking ahead for a period of time we are working in the context of an  oil-constrained rather than a money-constrained economy I think the oil situation is affecting the  potential for economic growth in a lot of ways at the moment, whereas I don’t see much restraint  from the monetary side And, of course, we have the inflation problem you just referred to  When I look at the aggregates, in the short run they’re high As Steve pointed out, in a 6-month  perspective, they’re pretty close to the target we set for ourselves, which at least at that level of  analysis is comfortable And obviously we have this extremely sensitive situation with the  dollar I can well see the case for, let’s say, a small gesture of the kind that you suggested in  view of both the inflation and the international concerns But in sum, given the general business  outlook, I would be reasonably content with standing pat for the time being, remaining in touch,  and watching this dollar situation closely    We're glad to contribute some people  to the Board   Well, I'm not inclined to raise the  question of whether the staff have overestimated the rate of price  increase; I doubt that that's the case But in looking at the general     1/11/79 - 8 -    scenario and listening to you, you have forecast a relatively mild  recession, as YOU suggested, at least by comparison with the previous  recession But it's a very unusual recession, I think, and you can  confirm this for me You get practically no change in the government  deficit and no increase in income coming out of the government in that  sense You have very little change in the financial ratios, very  little improvement in liquidity or debt positions, which leads me to a  very general question and may [involve your] repeating yourself What  keeps the recession so mild? And particularly what gets us out of it  when the saving rate doesn't change much? It doesn't go up and then  we don't have the room for it to go down What are the mechanisms to  reverse this process once it starts?   You haven't even got much of that   M R   ZEISEL True, we don't get much of that because of the  inflation effect, but we get some--possibly an $8 billion swing in  that direction in 1980 But, as I pointed out earlier, we perceive  this--other than the OPEC effects--as being a rather sluggish slide  into a softer economy without the kind of major distortions that were  in place in 1973, preceding that [recession] And it seems to us that  under those circumstances, there is the potential for not only a  moderate decline but the beginnings of recovery as well, in business  fixed investment for example We get some help also from the net  export side, as Ted Truman mentioned earlier I might point out,  though, as you are no doubt aware, that the recovery we are talking  about is about as sluggish as the recession we have predicted We are  talking about a fairly protracted period of very little growth; in a  sense it's what we were projecting a couple of months ago overlaid by  the effect of the OPEC price increases pushing consumption down and  bringing the level down to below where we had it before   Why not 1-1/2 to 4-l/2 percent?  That's what it is now   You said leave it unchanged, and then  you said you would--   Well, let me be very quick on the  business side A lot of people have talked about the risks of a  recession, and I think they are there There are also some risks of  financial disturbances arising perhaps out of some nonfinancial  companies I think there are risks in the balance of payments and on  the dollar side I just mention those to say that I recognize them  But I believe the overwhelming purpose we should have in mind now,  which seems to me to be shared from the comments that I have heard  around the table, is that [our policy] should in substance and  appearance be steady I might say in terms of the risk of a larger  recession, if some policy initiative became necessarily desirable, I’d  rather see it myself on the fiscal side than on the monetary side--  specifically on the tax reduction side, not on the expenditure side  I think that could have some long-range benefits despite an adverse  effect on the budget in the short run But I do think in substance  and appearance that we ought to be steady   What I’m disturbed about is that while the tone of many  people’s comments seems to say that, their precise recommendations  don’t seem to convey it I frankly think the numbers that have been  put before us by Mr Axilrod would be confusing to the market  market would only interpret this as an easing of policy We‘re  raising some numbers on the bottom side of our ranges and [growth is1  already running toward the bottom, so we must be saying that we want   The     1/11/79 -28-   to get easier The M1 number is clearly higher on the surface than at  present in any event I think it would convey the wrong impression   What are we trying to do here? As I understand it, we are  reviewing some projections we set forth early in the year Has  something happened to change our minds about what we thought about  then? It seems to me that the answer we should be trying to give is  "no" We happen to be within the ranges Why change them? And that  is the message we want to give And I would leave M1 unchanged, too  Now there is this technical argument about the NOW accounts and ATS--   Well, it's measurement But I have  this feeling that this is [only] one technical factor affecting the  measurement of M1 Meanwhile, money market funds payable by check are  going up $3  billion a month, which nobody anticipated at the beginning  of the year and must have had a bigger effect on M1 than ATS Well,  it must have had an effect, will you grant me that?   Well, you ought to talk to my wife  But you know, there are other factors--RPs and other things that Henry  mentioned And it just seems to me a mistake to react to this one  technical factor at the risk of confusing people, when the basic  message we want to give is We have looked at our targets, we are  within our targets, we are not changing policy at this point, and we  are reiterating our figures So I would urge that that be the  approach we take   As for next year, I agree with all the comments that it is  much more uncertain And I am happy to rest on the same figures but  with a more general comment of the kind that you made We do have the  ~1 legislative uncertainty even there If we want to widen the range  for next year, I have no problem with that I don't think we [should]  make a major change; we ought to signal essentially a steady policy  But I do think it would be a mistake to change the ranges for this  year; I think it's going to confuse the issue, if indeed we want to  convey the notion that I assume [we do, which is] that we are  basically holding steady   Same ranges as we have at present   Well, for '80 as well, [though] maybe  widening M1 to recognize those [uncertainties]--   Are you going to be that vague for  next year consistent with--   Mr Chairman, I’m just worried about  M1 But if the [Humphrey-Hawkins] Act does not require that we  specify in numbers--   Historically, the aggregates  virtually always come down--   Yes   Steadying the boat with a hope that  in time we will get [money growth] down   If that‘s really the explanation for  the declining retail sales--and there must be something to it--I don’t  think the remedy is monetary policy but rather fiscal policy My main  concern here would be that we not move right away on the funds rate  without some considerable provocation I think we have to keep in  mind the international situation but always against the perspective of  accelerating inflation It may yet require some action in raising the  fed funds rate, but that leaves me happy with a 10 to 1 0 - 1 / 2  percent  range--that will do--and I’d do nothing at the moment Probably I‘d  have the money market directive I am bothered by the ranges under  alternative I1 simply because this month our own staff’s projections  for aggregate growth are much lower than the Board staff’s They are  outside the ranges proposed here already on the low side, which will  be contrary to the idea of not changing the fed funds rate if those  [projections] came out to be right I don’t think one can put much  weight on either of these projections; this just indicates that the  money supply unfortunately is pretty much a random number for the  month So I would stick with the money market directive, and I would  prefer a wider range on [the aggregates] I would really prefer 0 to  6 or 6-1 /2  percent or 1 / 2  to 6 - 1 / 2  or something like that [on M 1 1  and  5 to 9 percent on M2   I think not   Is this a formal vote?   I find it very difficult with those  ranges that high especially It depends on how permanently fixed that  10-114 percent rate is or how much provocation it takes to move it   Yes, I think so   I can gulp and vote with it, if you  gulp several times before changing the funds rate   My conclusion happens to be the same  as Governor Coldwell's I think I would do it if it serves some sort  of positive purpose I don't know about just doing it without getting  some confirmation that it is some kind of useful signal I suspect  they have some real purposes in mind, along the lines that Governor  Wallich suggested They want an additional backstop during a period  in which they are borrowing very heavily I would not refuse to give  it to them if it serves some positive purpose from the standpoint of  U  S   policy   Maybe Treasury ought to--   I'm not sure I'd use the word  "overriding" but I certainly agree that there's no point in making a  gesture unless somebody knows we are making a gesture    If I can try to respond to that one, Mr Chairman In amounts they have been much more modest than we have been There is a little feeling in the market, I'm sure, of reluctance on the part of the Bundesbank but it has not been as evident as earlier And they did make a little splash in Frankfort this morning by spending right off the bat rather openly, which the market saw as a kind of signal So the answer is a bit mixed Now, as to the extent they    7/17/79  have been aggressive, and they haven't been terribly aggressive, Gretchen and others have been in pretty continuous contact with them telling them that we have been aggressive So it's hardly [an aggressive] response [in terms of] having responded to what they perceive as our attitude  Well, If you want me to begin, I guess I have a somewhat different opinion Nobody knows the future but I think there is a substantial risk of an iceberg here and in my view a little action earlier rather than later would be effective, particularly since I don't think the market is expecting it Observing this market for the last couple of days, I've come to the conclusion that now is the time to move on the discount rate and a bit on the funds rate in amounts unspecified for the moment I say that against [the background of] an additional element that I don't think has been mentioned--that the aggregates are running a bit on the high side Though not dramatically so, they are off in that direction I am extremely skeptical that intervention will be adequate to handle a situation of this sort The market has had enough experience with intervention alone that it gets to the point where one wonders whether it's helpful or harmful in some circumstances, particularly against the background where the Bundesbank may well get very restive very soon about the amounts of liquidity we're creating in their markets I think they've been, in their light, quite cooperative up to now but they haven't been doing very much and we are going to be getting complaints very soon Gretchen [heard] some grumbling [about that] this morning and it looks like it's pretty big So I think it's a bit of an illusion, if this continues, to think that we can rely upon intervention It seems to me that there is enough [reason] internationally and with the aggregates pointing in the same direction for us to make a modest move that I think could be reversed if things turned out well We would be better off in the long run [and would not inflict] any substantial damage or any damage at all, as I see it, to the domestic economy  The main comment that I picked up about the President's speech was that it wasn't really a bad speech--I agree a little bit with Nancy here --but that he didn't address himself at all to the inflation problem And indeed there is skepticism as to whether the Federal Reserve is addressing that problem  Excuse me?  I won't vote against it but my own sentiment is that I think that action may be built on an illusion that this is the answer to the problem   I basically come out with your intermediate position, Mr Chairman, as a logical course I could rather easily be talked into your last position but I don't think we should back down on the directive now I don't think we should do a discount rate change without a fed funds rate change I would think, given the domestic and monetary and foreign exchange objectives, that your intermediate proposal might be a reasonable position But I could be persuaded to do more  I might add one other point This question on the discount rate came up this afternoon, as it always does at our directors' meetings There was some concern expressed, which I share, that for this kind of action to be effective it shouldn't be a source of controversy with the Administration; it should look like an integrated economic policy Perhaps recent events have taken care of that But I just mention that [taking] some Federal Reserve action and then getting a lot of controversy about it may not be helpful, unless [the action] were bigger than what I'm talking about  I don't dissent, Mr Chairman, but it could be interpreted, I suppose, consistent with the directive that it's a rather firm 10-1/2 percent In other words, 10-1/2 percent is kind of a floor  Well, you are refining it anyway I'm happy  If I may just add a thought here The Treasury financing is coming up pretty soon So that is a reason, if there's going to be action, to get it done quickly  I certainly agree with what Henry says that the actions will reinforce each other psychologically to the extent that they come together  I would be happy to do it but I don't think it is necessary this afternoon  That's correct You are missing the San Francisco President and his alternate  Meanwhile, I think you are a glutton for punishment, Mr Chairman!  I don't think that Good luck   I might say for the benefit of those who have just come in that we had a little executive session to do some important business, the first item of which was to elect a Chairman I'm not sure whether it's entirely appropriate that I announce my election, but it proceeded  I should also say that this is the first time the new Vice Chairman of the Board has been privileged to attend an Open Market Committee meeting We hope it's a privilege, anyway! You can make that judgment some time later, Fred, but I know I am delighted to have you here Fred has made the point to me several times that as a Princeton graduate he's well qualified I know from personal experience that that doesn't carry you very far, Fred! You're going to have to stand on other grounds, but you have many other grounds upon which to stand--business experience, entrepreneurial experience, banking experience, and some political experience We like to consider ourselves apolitical in one sense, but I have found that in another sense a little political talent and understanding never hurts in these positions So from all sides we are delighted to have you join us I look forward to working with you and I'm sure the others do as well  [In our executive session] we did make some other personnel changes which I ask everybody in this room to hold in confidence until they can be completed After I don't know how many years of valiant service--13 or 14 years I guess--in one of the most harassing jobs that I can conceive of, Alan Holmes [will have a new role] He served first as Manager of Open Market Operations on the domestic side and then took over on both [the domestic and foreign] sides during some turbulent years, leading the System into a more active posture on the foreign exchange side and seeing that accomplished We thought the time had appropriately come to take advantage of Mr Holmes' services as an Adviser so he's still on board We're still going to benefit from his services for many years to come, I hope, both in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and in connection with the Open Market Committee--but without direct line responsibility  The other part of that process is that we have two gentlemen in Peter Sternlight and Scott Pardee ready to take over the full line of responsibilities on the domestic and foreign sides So the Committee has acted to make Peter the Manager on the domestic side, Scott the Manager on the foreign side, and Alan Holmes Adviser for Market Operations, looking over the shoulders on all sides in a constructive way I think it can be a very effective team in a slightly different alignment, and I'll be delighted to get this in place But it is all subject, as I'm sure you know, to concurrent action by the board of directors of the New York Bank by whom these esteemed gentlemen are appointed to their official positions And the directors don't meet until this Thursday so these changes cannot be put in place until Thursday I hope they can be put in place then I'm sure Mr Timlen can manage that assignment but there won't be any public announcement until the directors act, so I hope you will respect that And I do welcome all three of you to new assignments    8/14/79  With that I think we can proceed to the minutes [of the July meeting] Do we have a motion? Without objection the minutes are approved  We have a Report of Examination, which I believe has been distributed to you I am informed that Mr Farnsworth is ready to answer any questions you may have Are there any questions about the examination? Mr Wallich  Which account are you talking about, the domestic or the foreign?  Without objection, so ordered Foreign currency operations Mr Pardee  Any questions or comments?  I don't think there's much substance to that now, Phil, but I think it's a useful question to ask oneself about what might happen later in the year When I look at all these interest rate changes abroad, there's a pretty straightforward justification in terms of their own domestic situations--with rising inflation and strong economies One begins to ask what happens to their economies later this year or into 1980, partly because of the oil price increases I think there is some danger but I don't think we can really be critical of what's happened so far  The British is a change in policy but it's often stimulated by the exchange rate In fact, they don't like the exchange rate consequences, as near as I can read it Larry Roos  John Balles  We have to ratify the transactions, if you are willing to ratify the transactions Without objection, they are ratified Maybe we can take up this Mexican swap issue Scott has distributed a memorandum We had some material last month and there was a preliminary discussion Is there anything you want to say, Scott?  Let me supplement that a bit    8/14/79  inclined but I want to hear So I would be favorably  what other people have to say Phil  I agree with that wholly in substance and  I think it's as simple as that So while I agree with you fully in substance--and as I say I think they would, too, as a theoretical matter--in practice I do not feel that we can press them because I think their argument on the other side is    8/14/79  rather impregnable  This is an increase of $360 million, you said?  So it's an increase of $340 million; [I wondered] whether a more modest increase might do the job  I came to the personal conclusion that fiddling around on the amount--cutting it in half or something and ending up with $850 million or whatever--just didn't amount to enough to quibble about I think you have a very strong substantive point, but it just runs against the practicalities  Well, I think these things are probably routinely announced deadpan--by saying there's an increase period  I have worried about the precedent [issue] that Phil raised, too I think that is a negative; it is a question of weighing that Scott may want to speak to this, but we have the precedent of a swap with Mexico; and Mexico is a big trading partner right next door I think it is adequately distinguishable from any other Latin American [country]   Scott, do you want to respond to both the precedent point and this one?  Do we have a second? I'm just going forward here with an orderly procedure Henry  On every one?  I held the discussions  Well, on balance, yes, they'd like us to do it I think that's clear They have these other negotiations going forward and they think this would be constructive That is clearly [their view] How important it is in connection with those other issues is another question, which I can't really evaluate  I would think our problem is the reverse I'm just speaking personally There's no question that they like the idea, but I don't want to get either State or Treasury too involved in saying anything about it for the very reasons that Henry and to some extent you were suggesting  That's precisely what we're trying to do here  I think we have to look at that because I do believe it gives them a leg up All I can say is that I have looked at that and I think this is manageable in that context That isn't to say that I cannot imagine a situation where Mexico would draw part of the line sometime but I don't think there's any immediate prospect of that    8/14/79  You say on its merits Speaking for myself, that is in my mind I came to the conclusion that you've come to and I think that is not irrelevant in considering this If we never had any intention or would basically be unsympathetic toward Mexico ever using the line, I think it would be a mistake to approve this But if we do contemplate that in an uncertain world it's not impossible that we would accede to their use of the line sometime in the future, we can go ahead and do it  Not many of those Latin American countries have a convertible currency  Well, are we ready to vote? I take it we have to have a full-scale vote, Mr Secretary?  Well, my recommendation is to do it  Do you want to call the roll on this?  Mr Sternlight  Questions?  If there is no other comment, we have to ratify [the domestic transactions]  It was 4 to 6 years  I may not remember [correctly], but I thought that publicly held debt was getting up in the 4-year area  [We need to] ratify the transactions Without objection Mr Zeisel  I don't know whether you made explicit your assumptions [You have assumed] no changes in fiscal policy?  Right [And you've assumed] the present targets on monetary policy  I would appreciate it if you would confine yourselves at this point to questions and be as brief as possible We will come back and have comments on the economic situation John Balles  -14-    8/14/79  Governor Coldwell  Governor Wallich  I have three names on my list I hope the questions will be brief and that there won't be any more than three names I might just say--I can't restrain myself from saying--that these two uncertainties may be mutually related if merchandise trade does so well because the economy is in a recession that is generated by the inventory reduction If you don't get the inventory reduction you won't have such a good trade balance and vice versa Frank Morris  I refer you to an exhaustive article in the Quarterly Review of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York  It argues that there are many more families now in heavy debt bearing categories, and if you adjust for that and adjust for the credit card debt--which would be a different kind of debt--the figures don't look as high as they do absolutely  The conclusion of that article is that [the debt burden] is high but not so high as it looks on the surface It therefore moderates the conclusion; they still may be [unintelligible] Chuck Partee  Mr Axilrod You want to give us a survey of what are called financial relationships  Thank you, Steve I am conscious that without an egg timer time has been passing But I thought it might be useful if I just set out a few thoughts of my own at this point before we have a coffee break I don't intend to make it a habit particularly, but this is a meeting that is perhaps of more than usual symbolic importance if nothing else And sometimes symbols are important I thought I'd just lay out a strategy as I see it so you can have something to shoot at Take it in the nature of my thinking out loud I don't know to what extent it will reflect the general feeling of the Committee  In general, I don't think I have to go into all the dilemmas and difficulties we face for economic policy It looks as though we're in a recession; I suppose we have to consider that the recession could be worse than the staff's projections suggest at this time Once the inventories begin going, we don't know quite where they will end up In looking at the situation that we're in, among other things I don't think we can forget that energy is a sizable factor and that it's not very susceptible to monetary policy Nonetheless, we do have risks on the down side When we look at the other side, I don't have to talk much about the inflation numbers; again, energy is a big factor but it's not the only one And when I look ahead, nobody is very optimistic about the inflation picture One can add up--and we've been doing it for a long while--considerations that could point to some decline in the rate of increase [in inflation], most of which  -20-    8/14/79  have been disappointing as we've moved along I don't see any very convincing reason to expect much of a decline to come about naturally, so to speak, in the short run, partly because I don't think we're through that energy price adjustment So we've got to keep anticipating some impact of energy prices on the total  When I look at the past year or two I am impressed myself by an intangible the degree to which inflationary psychology has really changed It's not that we didn't have it before, but I think people are acting on that expectation [of continued high inflation] much more firmly than they used to That's important to us because it does produce, potentially and actually, paradoxical reactions to policy Put those two things together and I think we are in something of a box--a box that says that the ordinary response one expects to easing actions may not work, although there would be differences of judgment on that They won't work if they're interpreted as inflationary; and much of the stimulus will come out in prices rather than activity  On the other hand, a tightening action obviously has risks, too, when we're facing the kind of business outlook we have But to some degree the perversity of reactions can help us there I think there is some evidence, for instance--if a tightening action is interpreted as a responsible action and if one thinks long-term interest rates are important--that long-term rates tend to move favorably The dollar externally obviously adds to the dilemma and makes it kind of a "trilemma" Nobody knows what is going to happen to the dollar but I do think it's fair to say that the psychology is extremely tender And as Mr Pardee was suggesting earlier, we have all sorts of projections of great current account improvement; unfortunately, even those optimistic projections don't really show up in the figures until next year And with the normal lag of figures, even if the projections are right some time in the next year, I think it leaves us in an exposed or vulnerable position for a period of months, maybe through the end of the year or longer In saying that I'm not terrified over the idea of some decline in the average weighted exchange rate of the dollar or some similar measure The danger is, however, that once the market begins moving, it tends to move in a cumulative way and feeds back on psychology and we will get a kind of cascading decline, which I don't think is helpful In fact, it's decidedly unhelpful to both our inflation prospects and business prospects  Finally, I would note that the aggregates are running high; Steve just went over that We're lucky they're not so bad over a long time perspective, but basically the recent figures don't look so good And of course we've got this underlying question of what these traditional definitions of the aggregates mean anyway  In terms of our own policy and our approach, I do have the feeling--I don't know whether other people share it or not--that economic policy in general has a kind of crisis of credibility, and we're not entirely exempt from that There is a similar question or a feeling of uncertainty about our own credentials So when I think of strategy, I do believe that we have to give some attention to whether we have the capability, within the narrow limits perhaps in which we can operate, of turning expectations and sentiment I am thinking particularly on the inflationary side [Can we] restore the feeling that inflation will decline over a period of time and that that's a  -21-    8/14/79  prime objective of ours? I think that is particularly critical now domestically in terms of the discussion of a wage pattern guideline that's going on currently and the tenderness of the foreign exchange markets  Specifically, that suggests that we may have to be particularly sensitive to some of the things that are looked at in the short run, such as the aggregates and the external value of the dollar When we're sensitive to those things, there's certainly a perceived risk of aggravating the recession I'm not so sure that we're in the zone where monetary policy itself is all that restrictive in terms of real activity, but there is certainly a perceived risk Now, I don't know how we get out of that box but it would be very nice if in some sense we could restore our own credentials and [the credibility] of economic policy in general on the inflation issue To the extent we can achieve that, I do think we will buy some flexibility in the future If we're going to be in a recession, by all traditional standards the money supply does tend to be a little weak and interest rates go down I suspect that's a pretty manageable proposition for us if long-term expectations are not upset at the time by any decline in interest rates--an action we might actually have to take to or want to take to support the money supply But I don't think that approach will be a very happy one unless people are pretty confident about our long-term intentions That's the credibility problem [and the confidence] we have to establish as I see it And we haven't got a helluva lot of time as the recession comes along--if indeed it does come along--but particularly if it gets worse  So, I think we can't ignore the psychological problem that we have at the moment I don't know what the chances are of changing these perceptions in a limited period of time But as I look at it, I don't know that we have any alternative other than to try The other alternative may be letting things go along, and perhaps they will anyway And if inflation doesn't get better--maybe it will get worse --at some point it will be upsetting enough so that a much more forceful policy, whatever the consequences, will be required That's not a very happy process So I think we're in a situation that is not risk free but there are risks on both sides of what we do, and they are pretty balanced  In saying all that, I don't think that monetary policy is the only instrument we have either I might say that my own bias is, while I certainly think in the particular situation we find ourselves it's premature to be arguing for a big fiscal policy move, that such a move might be necessary If it is necessary, it ought to be through the tax side and it ought to be through a tax program that not only deals with the short-run situation but fits into the long-term objectives I would think the background for that is pretty good in terms of a tax program that might do something for both costs and investment But I don't think that's anything we are going to get or should promote right in the next month or two So we don't have a lot of room for maneuver and I don't think we want to use up all our ammunition right now in a really dramatic action; I don't see that the exchange market or anything else really requires that at the moment Certainly dramatic action would not be understood without more of a crisis atmosphere than there is at the moment Ordinarily I tend to think that we ought to keep our ammunition reserved as much as possible for more of a crisis situation where we have a rather clear    8/14/79  public backing for whatever drastic action we take But I'm also fairly persuaded at the moment that some gesture, in a framework in which we don't have a lot of room, might be a very useful prophylactic--if I can put it that way--and would save us a lot of grief later If we can achieve a little credibility both in the exchange markets and with respect to the aggregates now, we can buy the flexibility later  So, in a tactical sense, that leads me to the feeling that some small move now--I'm not talking about anything big--together with a relatively restrained aggregate specification might be desirable I don't intend to define the dimensions of that before I hear your reactions But that is the framework in which I came into the meeting anyway, and I will be interested in hearing your reactions  If we talk about almost any movement on the federal funds rate, however small, the discount rate question becomes a relevant consideration That I do not prejudge in my own mind but if any of the presidents in particular want to comment on that one way or another, I would be delighted to hear those comments, too I might only say that I'm somewhat allergic to the use of the discount [rate] as pure symbol--in other words move the discount rate and do nothing else because I think there's already some flavor of that in market thinking We do that about once and that means the symbol is pretty much destroyed for the future But other than that, I feel fairly neutral about [the discount rate issue] now, before I know how the discussion will come out this morning  Why don't we have a short coffee break When we return we'll discuss the economic picture and your general policy bias first, [along the lines of the procedure] Mr Miller introduced Then we'll come back [to the policy issue] and get specific about it  [Coffee break]  I'm not a clockwise, counterclockwise, or protocol man, so if you want to talk at this stage, get on Mr Zeisel's list--I mean Mr Altmann's list I'm sorry, I was looking at the wrong end of the table I know which way interest rates go even if I don't know which end of the table I'm at! Go ahead, Mark  Dave Eastburn  Mr Balles  Tom Timlen  Mr Black  Governor Wallich  Governor Coldwell  Mr Kimbrel  Mr Winn  Mr Morris  Mr Baughman  Mr Mayo  Good  Mr Partee  Mr Rice  That's not, of course, keeping the ranges where they are  Mr Guffey  Mrs Teeters  Mr Roos  You made one mistake at least, Mr Roos Vice Chairman Schultz has not yet spoken  He carefully husbanded his [remarks at his] first meeting He participated at the very beginning and this won't be the very end, Fred, unless you're so dramatically persuasive that we immediately--  In view of the hour and the fact that a number of people were very specific in their comments, I wonder whether it's not appropriate for me to try to put something quite specific on the table and let you shoot at it  First, let me make a couple of comments that occurred to me in listening to you--some points of agreement and maybe disagreement in some cases We work with these aggregate ranges; we now have two [sets] of them [depending on] whether we modify them for ATS and NOWs or not When I look at the modified ones in particular, the question that Governor Wallich raised keeps occurring to me--whether we were anticipating all the events that brought about the quasi-monies and near-monies that we got this year I certainly wasn't And I think there is a rather persuasive case that money in that statistical sense is much easier than either of the particular statistics we use suggests There were a lot of comments about our needing to move perhaps against a decline in the aggregates later on; I don't know    8/14/79  what's going to happen there, but I allow for that possibility I remain very concerned that to the extent possible--and we may have very little time--we do it from a position of strength in terms of our total posture rather than weakness That move which may become necessary may almost be forced upon us [and] will be taken unnecessarily amiss in terms of our longer-range concerns about inflation  Inevitably, all this brings up the question of fiscal policy Let me give you a more hopeful [view] on that Maybe I haven't been in Washington long enough--on this tour, anyway--but obviously if the recession turns out worse than now projected, let's say, there will be a lot of pressure on fiscal policy I would say--I'd say it in this room anyway, though I certainly wouldn't say it publicly now--that I'm not sure that's altogether a bad thing, given the way personal income is acting and given the direct drain on purchasing power that comes from the oil situation I do think there is a considerable risk, which some senators impressed upon me at my hearing, that if the Administration doesn't come up early with a tax program that they would like, they will have forced upon them a tax program of a kind we wouldn't like [I mean by the latter] the kind of pure "get out the purchasing power as quickly as possible" program I don't know what others who have been up [on the Hill] think about this; maybe Nancy [has some thoughts on it] I suspect when it comes right down to it, the Administration may have a fairly clear idea of the kind of tax cut it wants--and there was some Congressional sympathy still--which would be in a constructive long-term direction I don't know when the proper time is, if ever; I think it depends upon the business situation But I am not entirely unhopeful that if it comes to having a tax cut, (a) it might be a good thing, and (b) there is a reasonable chance of shaping it in a constructive short- and long-range direction Now, maybe that's entirely too optimistic but I'm in the business of being optimistic now Is that blowing smoke completely, Nancy?  Well, that is my hope too Nobody can project how it will come out, but I think they are in the same box--to return to that--as we are But it's premature to begin suggesting that kind of thing now until we're right up against it It's inherent in the position that we're in  I think you've got to give something to the consumer, so it may be some combination of that sort with some emphasis on the investment side Now, I've got a personal problem-- other people do, too--with the payroll tax pure and simple because of the linkage between the payroll tax and the benefits So, I don't know But we're not going to resolve fiscal policy here this morning I'm just not quite as pessimistic about it as some of your comments [implied]  The other thing that occurred to me--I don't know whether anybody mentioned this or not--is that any of these aggregates ranges shown for the short run in comparison with the short-run ranges we have currently could be interpreted as an easing I don't know how serious that is It is true that they are substantially higher than the present ones we're working [toward]  Well, let me try something here and just shoot at it On the aggregates, I don't think I can't bracket everybody's implicit or explicit comments, but there was a considerable amount of commentary that we ought to go below any of these ranges [shown in the Bluebook alternatives] The least we can go below them is 4 to 8 percent and 7 to 11 percent On the federal funds range--I'm speaking personally but I think it may coincide with some other views--I tend to think of it asymmetrically It depends on whether we think of the range asymmetrically or put the asymmetry right into the specifications We have another problem just in terms of the message issue Right now, while the market is a bit confused about the federal funds rate [objective], there is a substantial body of opinion that thinks we're at 10-3/4 percent, and at the least I think we have to confirm that Frankly, I don't know quite where we are because when I listened to people earlier I was changing my mind Maybe I ought to change it again I was [thinking] in the fairly immediate situation--I'm not talking necessarily tomorrow, but this week--of something like 10-7/8 percent or maybe even with a little flexibility, say, around 10-7/8 up to 11 percent That is consistent, I guess, with a range of 10-3/4 to 11-1/4 percent Obviously we can widen that out Or I suppose the alternative is something like the 10-1/2 to 11-1/4 percent that some people mentioned, which also gives us a 10-7/8 midpoint if I did the arithmetic correctly  Yes, and we would treat it asymmetrically low, I think The asymmetrically low [concept] reflects the fact that we really don't want to have a surprise in the aggregates and move lower too quickly for a couple weeks with some low aggregate figures My persistent problem with this is that I never know what those aggregates are going to show next month I hate to be at the whim of a really temporary move in the aggregates, which is why we always have this question of how wide to make the federal funds rate range But let's say, so I can elicit some responses here, 4 to 8 percent [for M1], 7 to 11 percent [for M2], and 10-1/2 to 11-1/4 percent as one version of the funds range Or if you want to tighten it up on the low side, 10-3/4 to 11-1/4 percent is basically the same starting point, maybe shaded in the second case to something like 10-7/8 percent or 10-7/8 to 11 percent Presumably we would go up to the 11-1/4 percent if the aggregates come in strong And if they come in really strong, we'd have to have a telephone conference If they come in the other way, presumably we'd have a telephone meeting  I don't have any strong feeling about a money market or an aggregates directive I suppose an aggregates directive would make me lean more toward the 10-3/4 to 11-3/4 percent range just in case of a fluke and the aggregates came in too quickly on the down side Governor Coldwell  John Balles  Frank Morris  I can understand that argument  Would you go down to 10-1/2 percent if the aggregates were within those ranges?  You could always make the ceiling higher I have no name on my list  Mr Mayo  Mr Timlen  I'm not sure with those specifications that we need the mixed directive  No other comments?  I will stipulate that a 1/4 or 1/8 percentage point move on the federal funds rate isn't going to have any pronounced effect on the growth rates in the next two months--if that's the only thing we're worried about I'm not sure it's the only  -42-    8/14/79  thing we're worried about [Unless] somebody else wants to say anything, all I can do is try again I'm not sure, but I think there is a little more sentiment for moving to 11 percent now than I had judged I'm going to give you two more alternatives We can stick with the 4 to 8, 7 to 11, and 10-3/4 to 11-1/4 percent with the midpoint [on the funds range] at 11 percent and move there Or we can go to, say, 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 and 6-1/2 to 10-1/2, which a number of people suggested--and it [moves] some distance toward other [suggestions]--and we can shade the 11 percent a little on the low side I'd still like the flexibility to play in that area--perhaps go after [something around] 10-7/8 to 11 percent [on the funds rate]  Well, shall we get a show of hands from voting members on 10-3/4 to 11-1/4 percent and the midpoint where it is, with 4 to 8 percent and 7 to 11 percent [on M1 and M2]?  Well, let me have preferences first  11 percent  Following Phil, here, the money market directive at the moment With that high a range, I'm a little worried about an aggregates directive Again, there's just some uncertainty about what will happen in the very short run I just looked over Tom's shoulder and New York already has a lower estimate for these aggregates; it might be triggered on the low side before we know it  Well, I don't attribute any great weight to that other than the inherent uncertainty in these things I have been watching those numbers enough that my discount factor is extremely high The trouble is my discount factor on all these numbers is extremely high in any short-run period Let me just ask the preferences first Well, let's go all the way and say acceptable  We'll try out another one, but let's try this one 4 to 8, 7 to 11, 10-3/4 to 11-1/4 [moving to the midpoint of] 11 and a money market directive  Well, we can try out another one if somebody tells me what to try Is it with slightly lower ranges for the aggregates?  Well, let's try them a half point lower, with the same federal funds and what--change it to an aggregates directive just to get a little variety?  Who suggested money market? Well, who likes that better? It's 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 and 6-1/2 to 10-1/2, and the same federal funds range but with an aggregates directive  Well, let's say acceptable That seems to have a smaller vote than the other  I don't know what other combination to try, so I think we'll just go with the first one unless somebody has an inspiration here  The overwhelming impression I have is that at this point the changes are not highly significant Let's vote on the original  Thank you It's 130 pm What other business do we have here? Oh, I had one thing I wanted to mention, the [lending of] Treasury [securities], if we can dispose of that in a hurry I take it there was one question that preoccupied the staff, which is whether we charge when we lend securities I find it difficult to imagine when [that authority] will be used, so it's not an absolutely central issue to me I take it that we've always charged, obviously, for the short-term extension of credit In this case, we're not really extending credit in the same sense We're lending securities upon which we continue to earn interest However, in the market would you like to charge or not?  If it will speed up things, I thought of a great Solomonic approach on this of charging an eighth, which is less than we charge--  SPEAKER(?) How about 3/16th!  Without objection, we'll charge 1/8 point  I'm really at the wishes of the Committee on this one I take it there's a certain amount of prevailing sentiment to charge Do we want to have a vote on this or just agree? Without objection, it'll be an eighth Oh, [do we need to talk about] swap renewals, Mr Pardee?  Okay I had one other item The House Banking Committee issued a report on monetary policy and there is a paragraph in that report which says "The law requires the Federal Reserve to report on its monetary targets to 1980 In this the report is disappointing The Federal Reserve merely indicates that tentative approval has been given to the retention of the present targets through 1980 No justification is offered This is particularly distressing in view of our committee's recommendations in its report of March 12, 1979 that long-term monetary growth targets should be adopted Our committee requests the Federal Reserve promptly to correct this defect by issuing a supplement to the report fully explaining its monetary targets for 1980"  -45-    8/14/79 -46-  I would suggest that I write a letter to the [Banking] Committee saying that perhaps you misread our report [I must admit] I haven't read it myself! In case you didn't get the message, we did say that the targets at this point were the same for next year as this year, but there is an unusual amount of uncertainty, statistical and otherwise, attached to [that decision] We did not mean to say that we were not suggesting a target for next year, but obviously we will review it with great care in February With your permission I will write such a letter  SEVERAL Hear, hear  Thank you The date of the next meeting is September 18 The meeting is adjourned  END OF MEETING       We‘ll come to order, if I can find my copy  of the agenda! I might tell you before we start that we will have a  small alteration in procedure after the meeting Instead of traipsing  over to the dining room for lunch, I thought we would expedite things  by bringing you a few sandwiches over here So, we’ll give you a  break after the meeting and then we will proceed [with discussions]  around this table while we’re being fed--adequately, I hope We will  experiment with this procedure and see how it goes But that does not  mean that we should not conclude our work before the usual lunch hour   If it has that effect, we’ll have another  change of procedure at the next meeting! [I need to] get approval of  the minutes [of the August meeting] Without objection, they are  approved Mr Pardee   Any questions?   Mr Balles   A couple of comments I don't think it's  right to say we're in an interest rate war or anything of that sort,  as some of the circus newspaper commentary suggests As near as I can  see, what the Bundesbank has been doing generally is well justified by  their internal situation and normal criteria that they would use  Their inflation rate has been going up, and they unquestionably don't  like that, and their economy has been doing pretty well And they  seem to be--ebullient may be too strong a word--quite confident about  the immediate outlook there By immediate I'm talking 6 to 9 months,  which is rather encouraging from our standpoint and I think from the  world's standpoint if it's true They seem to have a good deal of  confidence in it That does not say that they would mind particularly  if the mark appreciated, and that notion is fairly well imbedded in  market thinking On the other hand, I don't think the other Europeans  want the mark to appreciate because of the opposite side of that coin  from their standpoint and their own inflationary problems So they  are at kind of an impasse within Europe I think our concern, given  the psychological situation and the real situation that Scott  outlined, is whether we can have a moderate decline in the dollar  against the mark It's true that the dollar has been appreciating  against most other currencies But if the market gets in its head  that the dollar is really going down, would we be able to stop it  without spending a lot more money than we're already spending? That  is the question And let me say that it would make me very nervous to  try to control a depreciation at this point, given the underlying  malaise   Well, [you say] "does need to be" I  don't know what that implies     9/18/79 -4-   What can you say about that? In terms of  purchasing power parity, you can argue that if 180 was right six  months ago, something less than 180 ought to be right now But that  assumes that 180 was right some months ago, which nobody knows In  fact, I get the impression that many people here and abroad [thought  that 180 was really too low six months ago And I think you have to  argue that; otherwise the logic would follow pretty precisely But  there is this question of how to prevent the [decline] from getting  out of hand if it happens Just in case any of you are wondering,  this was not a great decision-making meeting in Paris last weekend  lot of it was devoted to [issues] on the IMF agenda, which are not  particularly relevant to current exchange market or economic policy   A   developments But there was an exchange of views about the business  outlook and about policy without any attempt to arrive at any specific  operating conclusion These meetings are a chance to exchange views  about the outlook and about policy postures, but [the issue] was not  pressed very far, certainly not in an opertional mode Have you got  any recommendations, Mr Pardee?   We have a proposal to provide for the  first renewals if and when necessary, I take it, and I assume they  will be necessary Any discussion? Without objection, I think that  is done Now we have to ratify the transactions, too I guess I  skipped over that Would someone like to so move? Without objection  they will be ratified Mr Sternlight   Comments or questions?   Would you like to volunteer, Mr Coldwell?  I think we can duly note that that's the unanimous view   I don't know how automatic it will be; I  know very little about it I know they're trying to hoist it off on  the budget committee and I don't know whether that's going to  [happen]    There obviously is logic in that, but  whether it's just going to make the budget resolution that much more  difficult, [I don't know] Mrs Teeters   That's the theory It seldom happens in  any very orderly way   Among other things, [they] have escalated  [the] social security [issue] It's fully escalated because it was  attached to a debt ceiling goal once when we sat there and wondered  whether it should be vetoed or not   We have to ratify the [domestic] transactions, if there are  no further questions   Without objection, that is done Mr  Kichline   I wonder if we can confine our comments  now to rather pointed questions Mr Coldwell   You have a pretty good decline in goods  consumption in that quarter Mr Timlen   M R   TIMLEN Jim, my question relates to the development of  last Friday, the apparent settlement of the General Motors  negotiations I was wondering if you had any hard information as to  the terms of that contract as signed and what implications it may have  for prices and as a precedent for other contracts or a possible  reopening of contracts in 1980   I don't have much better information but  what I have conforms with what Mr Kichline just said Mr Balles   Mr Winn   You say even "in the automobile area" I  take it you--   Well, I think what you say has some  validity looking backwards I don't know where to put the automobile  agreement; I have a little doubt about that That's a question we  have Looking forward, will that rather favorable record, considering  what has been happening in prices, be sustained? I think this is one  of the major issues we have here   I might say in terms of these guidelines  that I don't feel up-to-date on that and I don't know the details I  understand the argument has been whether to have a guideline at all,  with the alternative being this tripartite labor/management/public  commission to look at wage settlements and pricing behavior It gets  posed in those [unintelligible] terms because I take it that labor has  said that they will not participate in a tripartite arrangement with  any numerical guideline The Administration likes the idea of the  tripartite commission but has not been willing, so far anyway, to go  along with the idea of giving [the commission] absolutely no guidance  in terms of numerical guidelines That's where the impasse is   Well, that's a tempting course except when  you look at what I think Willis, by implication, was referring to  Wages have been fairly well restrained given this price behavior and  given the pressure for a catch-up S o ,  is it really wise to drop [the  guidelines] right now? That's basically the issue they're struggling  with--the fear that everybody will say they want a very sizable catch-  up I was startled the other day when the FAC was here At a dinner     9/18/79 -9-   --I think most of the Board members were there--the bankers were  arguing for some catch-up and some understanding They were arguing  in general terms until one banker kind of let the cat out of the bag  and said we want, for instance, 11 percent this year That is quite a  bit; he's talking about a nonunionized work force that presumably was  [getting] 7 percent Well, if you suddenly jump from 7 to 11, even  nominally--I don't know how typical that is but this is the way one  fellow was thinking--where does that leave you? That's what they're  worried about They say that's just a catch-up and it's only for one  year, but if you build it into your [whole] labor force what happens?  It's not an easy issue I was tempted by the position that you took  and the more I thought about it, it seemed awfully risky The  recession hasn't gone far enough to have any restraining influence  Any other questions on [the staff's presentation]?   A strange phenomenon, I confess, is that  everybody has assumed we are in a recession and we are getting an  increase in the gross national product I don't know That's still a  forecast, of course   If I may just add one question, Mr  Kichline How do you get an increase in output per hour in the fourth  quarter while the gross national product is declining significantly?   M R   KICHLINE We have a substantial employment adjustment  built into this forecast, so it's coming out of labor input   That would be unusual at that early  stage--wouldn't it--of a decline [in activity]? Can that adjustment  move that fast?   You have unemployment getting to where by  the end of the year?   Mr Axilrod, do you want to give us a  perspective on financial relationships?   Let me ask a couple of questions You  went over three reasons why the money supply increased more rapidly  over the late spring and summer It struck me last night that there  may be an additional reason I'll just comment on it You do all  these equations and everything else to get something called gross  national product, which is the gross domestic product And you have a  price rise in there, whatever it is, of less than 10 percent or around  10 percent In fact, we've had a big increase in the oil bill as  well, which doesn't enter into the gross national product It leads  to a considerable discrepancy on other price indices from the gross  national product deflator [What] if we said in some sense that the  additional money supply was financing the additional oil imports?   Or one would hope to get a leveling in the  import prices   I was confused last night when I looked  hastily at these flow-of-funds projections Maybe there is an obvious  explanation but we talk about short-term credit demands and commercial  bank demands being very heavy these days When we look at these  figures for the half year--we only have them on the half-year basis--  they show a decline in total credit demands There’s a decline in the  first half of the year and then a further decline in the second half  If I look at bank credit it slows from the first half to the second  half and the decline is a little steeper in business loans If I look  at demands for nonfinancial corporate businesses, they are declining;  the rate of growth in short-term debt declines significantly And I  look at the household [sector] and they have a rapid increase in  deposits and a decline in direct purchases of credit market  instruments I don’t know where money market funds are in there Are  they under credit market instruments?   Well, that helps explain it Even so,  [their growth] was fast in the first half of the year, too But this  column of figures seems a little inconsistent with what we talk about  happening in the market in the short run Is that because we got a  drastic change in the fourth quarter or what?   I haven’t looked at the quarterly figures,  but one reading of this is that it does [suggest that] we’re on the  verge of a rather steep decline in the fourth quarter Do you have  quarterly figures?   But the third quarter will show a big  increase in bank loans and--   My question is why it didn't show up in  these figures   It is down   I have a quarterly figure here now, which  shows a very sharp drop in the fourth quarter in the short-term debt  of nonfinancial corporations It's very sharp Mr Roos   Mr Axilrod   My feeling would be that you’re not out of  order in raising that question, Mr Roos We would be out of order in  having an extended discussion of it today, because I don’t think we’re  going to resolve it I presume that today, for better or worse, we  have to couch our policy in what has become the traditional framework  But I think it is a very relevant question, which has come up from  time to time, and I think we should be exploring it again in the  relatively near future And I would plan to do so   I think we do, and we‘ll consult with that  Committee Are there any other questions specifically directed toward  Steve‘s report before we open [the discussion1 up more generally?   Well, if there are no other questions--   I'm still confused somewhat by these  figures when 1 look at the quarterly flow of funds We have had  higher interest rates recently, which are normally accompanied by an  increase in individual purchases of credit market instruments, if I  remember these flow-of-funds ambulations correctly, and a decline in  deposits Instead, we had an enormous increase in deposit holdings by  individuals and a very big decline in the rate of growth of credit  market instrument holdings during the third quarter when interest  rates were rising We'd normally expect the reverse to happen   You just [reclassified them] between those  two quarters without telling anybody   And they're in deposits   You didn't reclassify them between the  second and third quarters; it's just that they've grown more rapidly   Well, let's proceed with general comments  on the business outlook and policy prejudices--or policy orientation  anyway Mr Baughman   It was up how much?   Governor Coldwell   Let me just interject, if I may, to the  presidents in particular We have a lot of discount rate proposals  in, and anybody who wants to comment on what has been proposed as your  turn comes up, [please do sol Let us know what course [you favor] or  what rationale you want to present or whether you disagree with your  directors   I think in a general way you could do it  now, but you may want to return to it more precisely when we get to  the specifications Governor Wallich   Mr Eastburn     9/18/79 -19-   Mr Mayo   Are you suggesting, Mr Mayo, that we  ought to think about some kind of moral suasion?   Do you have any concluding comment you  would like to make?   Some of this borrowing from abroad, I  think, is just borrowing back money that Americans put abroad in the  first place   I'm not sure how much, net, there is     9/18/19 -21-   Obviously, if anybody else wants to  comment on this question, I would be delighted to have the comments  My own feeling has been that it's probably pretty late in the day to  begin talking about moral suasion I don't know whom we would morally  persuade   We may do more damage, unless we see  particular speculative problems and takeovers or whatever I'm not  sure [how we can succeed in3 that process   My response would be a fortiori applied to  credit controls I don't know what we want to control at this  particular point in the cycle, but-- Mr Kimbrel   Mr Black   I'm not quite sure what target you are  talking about, Bob Maybe you can--   Did you say a 6 percent midpoint on our  range?   M R   BLACK That's what it would be pre-ATS   Pre any ATS   You are talking about a concept that isn't  portrayed on our nice little charts at all   Mrs Teeters   I’m not sure it is a fact that everybody‘s  paying more than the prime rate There are still some reports around  that quite a few people are paying less than prime   I don’t know why that should be--   M R   BALLES Well, the competition of the European banks is a  major factor   I’m not sure it’s all short term I think  it’s probably bigger--   There are reports that some banks are  still making fixed rate loans at something less than prime   Mr Morris   Mr Timlen   Mr Partee   Mr Balles     9/18/79 -27-   How much of that is the Susan B dollar?  There were $300 million of those going out beginning in July?   M R   BALLES Well, in addition to the Sunbelt, the area west  of the Rockies is not feeling very much if any recession yet  Aerospace, electronics, and agriculture in general are all quite  strong One indication is that the [volume of] help wanted ads in the  Los Ancreles Times is almost unreal The latest count that I heard  from someone was 98 pages [of such ads1 in a recent Sunday edition  So a lot of jobs are going begging We have had, of course, as is  true around the nation, some decline in auto sales and in housing  starts but considerably less percentage-wise than the country as a  whole   AS far as the national outlook, we don’t have any huge  quarrel with the Board‘s staff view We still expect the economy to  bottom in the first half of 1980 and quite possibly in the first  quarter There‘s always the risk that things could get worse than our  staff is now forecasting, but I’m reserving judgment on that until we  get some evidence that that’s a likelihood   In addition to the input that we bring to these meetings and  the usual sources of our own research staff and directors, last Friday  when Vice Chairman Schultz visited us in San Francisco we called in a  special small group of bankers, businessmen, and academicians for a  very frank exchange of views We sounded them out about their  feelings on the economy and on Fed policy, and I must say, Fred, that  I thought the reactions were quite candid and somewhat humiliating in  a way The bankers generally expressed the view that as yet there’s  very little evidence that the high level of interest rates is having  any significant total effect on cutting off credit demand Now, one  has to add to that the expressions we got from them in our usual go-  around with bankers and bank directors that these high rates are  having a cutting effect on the so-called middle market for business  borrowers--the smaller firms--and for mortgage loans and some small  farmers That’s where the incidence of the high interest rate effect  has been felt thus far in our part of the country But as a general  matter, even if the businessmen present were mostly from big concerns,  they simply indicated that the higher rates per se are not having any  effect at all on their capital projects If a project is worthwhile,  it‘s not going to get cut off by a one or two percentage point  increase in the cost of funds A minority expressed the view that  this is leading to some greater caution on inventory policy, which is  already being viewed as quite cautious One major real estate  developer present indicated that the higher rates are just built into  their projects and aren’t having any dampening effect at all   It was by the economists that we really got blasted They  came from Stanford, Berkeley, the University of California at Davis,  and from a number of major banks in town Quite frankly, they were  highly critical of what they called pro-cyclical Fed policy and the  extreme swings in the growth rates of money and credit that they‘ve  witnessed over the past year--the very low rate from, say, October to     9/18/79 -28-    March and the very high rate on balance from April to September The  clear majority view in that group--and the bank economists were quite  similar to the academic economists--was that it's vital that we give  more attention to that now than to what would be a more conventional  counter-cyclical policy My own view is that [we should make] an  attempt at the gradualism that we announced several years ago I  remember your predecessor twice removed I guess, meaning Chairman  Burns, [said] that the System's strategy would be to gradually lower  the rate of monetary growth as a long-run strategy for getting  inflation under control What happened, I'm afraid, is that while the  ranges have been brought down a little in the last several years,  we've seen a great deal of evidence of the actual rates of monetary  growth accelerating I continue to feel, as I expressed last month,  that we're going to get some automatic cushioning effect to this  recession from fiscal policy, perhaps supplemented--there seems to be  more and more talk about it [though I don't know] whether anything  will happen or not--by discretionary tax cuts So I lean toward the  view that we may have to use monetary policy as the principal weapon  to break inflationary expectations and to get some deceleration in the  actual rate of inflation   Our directors clearly voted to increase the discount rate to  reinforce what they thought should be a further snugging up in our  efforts to get the rate of growth in the aggregates down somewhat  Almost fortuitously we've had a counter-cyclical policy since spring  If in fact the first quarter proves to have been the peak of the  previous cycle, then in the second and third quarters we've had a  counter-cyclical policy of considerable magnitude given the rate of  monetary expansion that has taken place And perhaps it's a bit too  much to also get on top of the inflation problem Bottom line I come  out pretty much as Phil Coldwell, Henry Wallich, and Bob Black did I  think we should lean toward a little higher funds rate and a little  better control in linking our short-term targets with our long-term  targets if there's to be any success on the inflation front I think  it was last April, Steve--at just about the wrong time--that I raised  with you in front of God and everybody here the fact that you had been  overforecasting the rate of monetary growth You sure got that fixed!  Correct me if I'm wrong--1 don't have the exact figures with me--but I  think month by month the Bluebook forecasts have in fact understated,  and perhaps by a significant margin, the subsequent [monetary] growth  we've experienced I may again be raising that issue at the wrong  time, but the recession will take care of that   M r   Rice   Mr Winn   Mr Guffey   M R   GUFFEY Thank you, Mr Chairman With respect to  economic conditions in the Tenth District, we are enjoying--as others  have said regarding the agricultural area--probably the finest crop in  history And it's a reality; most of it is already [harvested] or is  ready to come into the bins The problem has been more real in the  sense that Bob Mayo mentioned; [producers] cannot move that crop,  particularly to the port facilities for export, because of the  shortage of rail cars as well as the Rock Island strike It is  putting some pressure upon the financial community to continue to  finance inventories that had built up a year or two years before But  it also is fairly clear that some weakness is developing, particularly  in retail sales--as affected by the auto situation--but also in  residential sales To my knowledge--and I have inquired around the  region--1 can find no area within our District where any speculative  houses are being built at the moment Everything is being built on  contract If there is no contract, there is no building   Turning to my own view of the staff's expectations for the  national economy, it seems to me that they are quite reasonable,  though maybe a bit bullish I would expect to have a bit deeper and  more prolonged recession from the actions that have already been  taken Traditionally, when consumer expectations turn, they turn and  don't come back very quickly   With regard to growth in the aggregates, as has been  mentioned, to be sure over the year [Ell looks very reasonable at  about 53 percent without ATS I believe that is the figure But  equally important, it seems to me, both last month and again this  month we've been looking at accelerating rates of growth in the  aggregates If you focus on M1, the staff projection is almost 10  percent for September But I would like to point out that most of  that has already occurred in the first two weeks of September And  two events have taken place, both the Social Security payment as well  as the anticipation of the September 15 tax payment date From here  on out the staff projections are essentially flat It would seem to  me that if the seasonals play any part in the first two weeks of     9 / 1 8 / 7 9  -31-   September--about which there seems to be some doubt--we may not be  getting the aggregates growth now that we tried to react to in August   Lastly, I would join with others who have said that we have  moved very rapidly So it seems to me time to pause now to see [the  effects of] what we've done We talk about the 13 percent not  cutting, but it hasn't been in place very long People either had  been committed before and haven't backed off or they haven't made  judgments as to whether they're going to continue to borrow in the  future I would say that in the financial area of the Tenth District,  the 13 percent rate has already taken a toll; several correspondent  bankers have told me that at a 13+ percent rate they are withdrawing  from requests to finance additional cattle operations simply because  the economics don't pan out As a result we could quite likely see in  the future a withdrawal of the inventory levels of cattle that would  have been coming on stream in the period ahead   In talking to staff and others and seeking advice, I would  note that one person characterized the situation we're looking at  right now as a situation akin to preparing a chicken for the table  That is, the chicken's activity increases substantially right after  you cut off his head If you react to that increased activity by  striking with the ax again, that greatly increases the risk of  damaging the meat That may be exactly where we are now So with  that, I would propose that we stand pat at the moment with respect to  the federal funds rate but use the discount rate for an announcement  effect As Willis pointed out, the discount rate has no real effect  on market interest rate levels and the alignment issue is beginning to  be a problem in our District Thus, I would propose that the discount  rate be raised at least 1/4 point, or perhaps 1/2 point   Well, I think we've had some barnyard  reasoning! Mr Roos, would you like to make a few comments?   Are you projecting a boom now for the next  6 months, Mr ROOS?   Have you any brief wisdom from the upper  Midwest, Mr Gainor?   M R   GAINOR I will be brief, Mr Chairman We feel a bit  behind the times in the Ninth District We hear in the national press  that the recession is half over and it hasn’t even hit us yet  Unemployment is very low in our District, less than 3 percent, and  labor markets are tight Industrial production is strong The only  questionable areas have been tourism, which was affected earlier in  the summer by the gasoline shortage, and [agriculture where] we have a  problem with the transportation of grain, as was alluded to earlier   With respect to the national perspective, we continue to be  concerned about inflation and about the international position of the  dollar We believe the Committee should try to get the numbers under  control while it‘s still politically feasible to do so Our directors  have recommended an increase in the discount rate change of 1/2  percentage point, which we suggested And we would favor further  limiting growth of the aggregates   Mr Schultz   I have failed in one of my objectives,  which was to get us out to the coffee break early Perhaps reflecting  my long experience in this particular chair, Mr Schultz, the  decisions don‘t get any easier from meeting to meeting If we have a  geometric progression, I’ll really be in trouble at the next meeting!   Let me just make a couple of comments before we go out for  coffee There is a very strong possibility of recession on the one  side We’ve had that possibility for almost six months now and we  still have the unemployment rate at a level that some consider to be  the natural rate I don’t know whether it is or it isn‘t, but we had  a lot of discussion earlier, which may be reflected in some of the  comments about labor markets still being fairly tight And,  obviously, we have inflation as strong as ever We have a difficult  timing problem Difficult or not we have a timing problem if the  business outlook develops more or less as projected, in that we don’t  have a lot of flexibility--at least flexibility in a tightening  direction--in terms of what we can do in the midst of a real downturn   As I read the recent business news, which is always  difficult, I feel a bit reassured by the most recent trends There’s  a little more stability in retail sales in real terms and some decline  in production What we [believe] is happening in inventories is  probably consistent with the type of outlook the staff has projected  of a rather mild recession I think the major risks are still on the  lower side, but what we see now is not inconsistent with that kind of  situation evolving In looking at the business outlook, it does seem  to me that the main problem lies in the area of income and  consumption I noticed on one of the [Greenbook] tables that you have  indicated an effective tax rate and it shows [a rise that] in one  sense looks rather gradual But in an historical perspective I  suspect there’s a rather sharp increase in effective tax rates, which  has been draining off income And of course we have the higher oil  prices draining off real income That does seem to me to be the heart  of the business problem we have   We‘ve had some questions raised about what monetary policy  can do about inflation I understand those questions, but there‘s the     9 / 1 8 / 7 9  -34-   other question about what monetary policy can do about this particular  conjuncture of adverse business developments--if they are adverse  The heart of the problem really lies in consumption and income That  suggests to me that perhaps the appropriate cyclical action when we  get to it lies mainly in a tax policy rather than in the financial  markets easing and the money supply growing In terms of what we can  do with monetary policy, we do have this question of what happens to  wages in the short run I don’t think we have a situation that some  of my friends in the Bundesbank think they deal with--that when the  monetary authorities say something, the labor unions jump I don’t  think that is quite the situation we face here! But we are in a  rather crucial period in terns of how much the probably deteriorating  inflationary expectations now get built into the wage structure In a  general way that has something to do with what we do It‘s awfully  hard to evaluate the significance of the gold price speculation, but I  can’t imagine that it’s very good in terms of confidence in either  inflation or the financial structure   Exchange markets remain in a very tender position, even  though--and this came out quite clearly at the meeting last weekend--  the expectation is very strong that if we wait a while, and we have to  wait some months, the current accounts are moving quite nicely  [toward] what is called equilibrium I don’t know whether one can  quite call it equilibrium if it’s achieved at the expense of a  recession The German and Japanese current accounts are both  deteriorating quite a lot, partly under the impact of oil Ours has  gotten better We expect it to get quite a lot better by next year,  although not in coming months And I feel reasonably encouraged that  growth is pretty strong abroad There are worries there about the  impact of the oil situation but that is not very visible yet It does  seem to have some momentum, at least in Japan and Germany, which I  think is a favorable background We don’t yet clearly face a  situation where the United States going into a recession tips the  whole world into a recession There are some areas of support there  that I think are quite important   Well, I don’t know where that leaves us precisely I share  the view that has been widely expressed that this isn’t the time for  any easing, in the visible sense, of interest rates I would hope  that that’s an ingredient of whatever we decide I also share the  view that has been quite widely expressed that we have to show some  resistence to the growth in money I would note that that remains a  source of political support for us It’s not every day that we get a  letter from the leader of the Black Caucus [in the House] exhorting us  to show more restraint on the money supply side So I‘m going to  carry that letter close to my heart, whatever we decide today And  [he was] speaking on behalf of the whole subcommittee, at least, of  the House Committee on Banking and Currency--the Subcommittee on  Domestic Monetary Policy So, I do think that those two ingredients  at least ought to be in whatever policy we decide here With that,  why don’t we break briefly and come back and be prepared to decide  what we will do   [Coffee break]   I don‘t think this gavel has ever been  used before in these meetings It’s not very tight Mr Altmann,  will you please take care of repairing the gavel?     9/18/79 -35-   Well, let me just try to get something on the table that  seems to approach most closely a concensus in numerical terms and you  can take whatever shots at it you would like A s  I listened, among  the voting members of the Committee at least, I think there was a  majority desire--but clearly not unanimous--to make a little move on  the federal funds rate So I would propose 11-1/2 percent on that at  this point I am not particularly eager to make a major move now or  in the foreseeable future, so I would suggest that we put a band  around that of 11-114 to 11-3/4 percent, which ought to [result in a]  reconsideration before a very major step on the funds rate There is  a desire by most people to constrain the aggregates and that may  require going [with ranges1 below any of these alternatives we have  [in the Bluebook] Consistent with the notion that we‘re not looking  for any easing in the immediately foreseeable future, it may make some  [sense] to broaden the MS aggregate [range] on the down side Let me  suggest 3 to 8 percent for M1 And in the interest of symmetry, I  think that means about 6 to 10 percent on M2   Are you saying that is consistent?   The current projection for M2 is what?   9-1/2 All right, let me modify my  suggestion for M2 to 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent Who wants to shoot?   For M2, with Mr Partee’s modification,  6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent; 3 to 8 percent on M1; 11-1/4 to 11-3/4  percent on the funds rate, meaning we would go to 11-1/2 percent And  I would interpret this to mean that we wouldn’t go above 11-1/2  percent unless the aggregates got to or above the upper ends of the  ranges that we‘re talking about   I think that probably implies a money  market directive but in a sense, if we give full weight to the  projections we now have, we’re starting out in the upper part of the  ranges   Well, I was talking about the two-month  projection     9/18/79 - 3 6 -    It's 7 percent, so we're within the range  but in the upper part of it In effect by moving to 11-1/2 percent  [on the funds rate], if we adopt this philosophy, we wouldn't move  further unless growth actually got to or above the upper ends of these  specified ranges I'm just putting this on the table Let's hear  what comments you have   Larry Roos   You're assuming in these calculations that  we know the second half of September, which we don't really know   As I observe these figures from week to  week, there is nothing one can assume about the last two weeks of  September   Well, I'm not quite saying that If the  aggregates were strong enough, I think we could use this whole range  here   Well, we're not so far from that on the  current projection It's just a matter of judgment At this  particular phase in the business cycle, should we be moving more than  that without at least having a telephone call? I don't think there is  any question about that   That's not what I proposed   We have had a little more experience going  over the top   Bob Mayo   John Balles   Now, that‘s a real difference I’m not  sure the other difference as stated is particularly significant as I  read it If we‘re starting off at 11-1/2 with a I percent current  projection, we haven’t got much room anyway whether we have an  aggregates or a money market directive I suspect they‘re the same on  the up side; they might be different on the down side Because we  haven‘t got any room in there anyway, you‘ve in effect taken the move   M R   BLACK I think, Mr Chairman, we could move [the funds  rate] to 11-1/2 percent and then wait a week and take another look at  the projections Chuck mentioned a while ago that October is going to  come in very low but I‘m not at all sure that is true I know that’s  what the projections say So, that‘s what I would do   Well, if that‘s the case, we’d have to  move up under either [form of the directive]   I think we‘re in the area of religion  rather than substance   Who else would like to get into this?   Well, let's hear from the others first  Governor Wallich, you didn't give ranges, or at least Mr Altmann  didn't record them   Governor Rice   Mr Baughman   Mr Eastburn   Mr Morris   Mr Winn   Mr Gainor   Governor Schultz   Well, there‘s no question that on the  aggregates 3 to 8 percent is the [best compromise for M11 It hits  both the majority and the midpoint of all the concerns; there are some  higher and some lower, but there is a majority for that It’s the  same for M2 at 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent The difference of opinion  lies more on where to put the upper point of the [funds range] There  was some dissent perhaps, but the great majority wanted to or are  willing to go to 11-1/2 percent now There is some difference of  opinion on the upper point of the range; there is one who disagreed on  the lower end of the range I count 5 who would like to go higher on  the upper end And there is obviously a disagreement on the  [selection of an] aggregates or money market directive   I would just make two comments, both of which have already  been made One is [that it‘s hard to] go much lower on the aggregates  ranges if we’ve got two high weeks in September already Even if the  rest of September comes out on the low side, it’s got to get pretty  damn low And if we go down very far on that aggregate, we would be  raising rates There’s quite clearly a possibility of raising rates  in the midst of a pronounced decline in the growth of the aggregates  from week to week I question whether we want to do that   The other comment is on the aggregates against the money  market directive There may be a difference; I find it hard to see  what the difference is on the up side I see some difference on the  down side With an aggregates directive we might [move the funds     9 / 1 8 / 7 9  -42-   rate] down more rapidly and sharply if the [aggregates] came in weak  But if we had 8 percent on the up side and we’re at 7 percent to start  with, then the difference [of opinion] may be, if it stays at I  percent, [whether] we go up still further I think that is the only  substantive difference and it is a substantive difference I guess I  contemplated in my proposal that 11-1/2 percent is in fact above the  midpoint, so we would already have gone above the midpoint and we  would not move any further if the projection remained unchanged It  would take a further increase in the aggregates projection to raise  the federal funds rate all other things equal, including the exchange  market and everything else that might influence what we do That‘s  what the argument is about, as I see it, apart from the difference on  the down side Do you want to go above the 11-1/2 without the current  aggregates projection for the two-month period changing? If it went  up as much as a percentage point, we might go up under either  formulation [of the directive] If it stayed the same, on my original  formulation we presumably wouldn‘t move If the people who favor an  aggregates directive mean that we should move under that circumstance,  you ought to say so I think that’s what they would be voting for I  don’t think this difference is enormous   M R   STERNLIGHT We‘d also appreciate some guidance as to the  Committee’s feeling if [the projection] went up something less than  that full percentage point I know these are fine lines to draw, but  we have to make those decisions   It‘s a very fine line as far as I’m  concerned   Well, does it make a big difference,  Nancy, whether we make it 3 to 8 or 4 to 8 ?    I don’t think it does A range of 3 to 8  says we really don’t want to move [the funds rate] down unless  something important happens Well, let‘s leave the money  market/aggregates issue open for the moment I guess I’m left  thinking--I’m reluctant to say this because it’s what I said before--  that the nearest thing to a consensus is 3 to 8 percent for M1, 6-1/2  to 10-1/2 percent for M2, go to 11-1/2 percent now on the funds rate  and make the range 11-1/4 to 11-3/4 percent Any discussion? I don’t  know whether these are all absolute preferences, but there seems to be  a majority for that The major difference among those three  specifications is whether [the funds rate range] should be 12 percent  on the upper side     9 / 1 8 / 7 9  -43-   My basic feeling is that I think we ought  to have a conversation at this stage of the game if we want to put the  funds rate up that high We shouldn‘t just put it on automatic pilot  at this point   I could think of a marginal circumstance  in which we might want to have a conversation but I could think of  nomarginal circumstances where if that is the directive, we would go  ahead I think you’ll just have to leave that up to me That kind of  decision also depends some on the economic news we get and to some  extent certainly [on developments in] the foreign exchange market--the  typical reservations we always put on these things Maybe we ought to  have a renewed expression of views; not everybody expressed  themselves Let’s assume those were the specifications How many of  the voting members would want an aggregates directive? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5  How many would want a money market directive? We’ll see how many  don’t vote! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 There is somebody besides myself who  didn’t vote   You don’t like either one   But the whole thing is [beyond] your pale  I would feel somewhat more comfortable with the money market  [formulation] under existing conditions I think we are very much  probing the outer limits of what we should do at the moment in terms  of the basic economic situation So I guess we’ll just put the vote  that way 3 to 8 percent, 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent, 11-1/4 to 11-3/4  with an 11-1/2 percent midpoint, and a money market directive   I don’t have a strong opinion on that one  Does anybody else want to comment?   I would judge that we may already have  stretched some people‘s tolerance in making the M1 range 3 to 8  percent, Bob So maybe we ought to leave it at that   Is there a strong preference for the  5-point range?   Let’s just have a quick expression of  preference on that Do most people want to join Mr Mayo on making  this amendment?   I don’t notice any upswelling of support   I wouldn’t have any great objection myself  but let‘s stick with where we were I guess we are ready for the  vote   We have one other item on the agenda, as I  recall We can cover it quickly, I think You have a memo, which I  assume you have all read, which concludes that we should continue the  practice of lending securities to government security dealers in case  they need them to make up for failures We would charge them roughly  three times as much as the market rate   Charging three times the market rate is a  practice we have been following for some years, and I take it we  review that practice periodically   Are there any questions of Mr Sternlight  or Mr Peterson?   Sounds like an easy transition I take it  there is no objection to the lending of securities The meeting is  adjourned, and it’s one minute before one o’clock   END OF MEETING    	790918meeting 	790918staffstatements     Mr Partee    Thank you, Jim Let's just go to Steve  and Ted and we [can] comment later   Mr Truman   Mr Sternlight and Mr Pardee   The answer is "not yet!"   Let me summarize some of this by saying  that late last week--actually beginning before then but particularly  late last week and in the very early part of this week--these markets,  by which I mean the gold market very obviously and the foreign  exchange markets, were “depressed” I guess that’s the right word  And the atmosphere was very nervous I think that has been largely  turned around by an expectation that there will be some action The  markets have recovered to a considerable degree on that expectation,  but I‘m not sure that there is much else that accounts for [the  turnaround]    The discussions abroad were very difficult in a number of  respects The feeling of confidence is not high, I should say, in a  number of directions and that increases the difficulty of restoring a  sense of stability One of the alarming things earlier, to me at  least, was the sensitivity and responsiveness of some of the commodity  markets outside of gold and silver to what was going on There were  some very sharp increases in prices of copper and other metals at the  end of last week and at the beginning of this week, a development that  has since subsided somewhat with the improvement in the gold market  and the exchange market But, quite clearly, we are in a very  sensitive period   S o  that is the background in which we will be meeting Any  comments that people at the other end of the telephone might want to  add--or any questions--would be in order at this point   By telegram or telex or whatever the  normal method is, so far as I know It’s on the wire You should  have it   I think it can be shared with one or two  of them I guess the message said one     10/05/79 -5-   Yes, one Now let me say in that  connection that there are a lot of complications that can be  introduced with this procedure and a lot of questions about precisely  [howl it can be done If we are going to go in that direction, I  doubt if we are going to decide precisely all these things for all  time In fact, I‘m sure we‘re not There’s going to have to be a  certain amount of discretion permitted the Desk and I suppose myself  in this, in conjunction with the people here who will have to make the  estimates as to precisely how this will work in practice I think  that is a practical necessity if we are going to move in that  direction at this time So, I wouldn’t encourage you to come in with  the idea that we can have a mechanical answer to all the questions  that arise from operating in this manner I think there would be a  very definite change in procedure and approach but I don’t think we  can identify every possibility that may arise by some mechanical rule  at this stage   That will be in the memorandum Just  roughly, the latest estimates are the estimates used at the last  meeting which haven‘t changed substantially Whatever you may think  of their reliability, which is another question, the estimates  themselves are barely within the ranges for the year   I don‘t know of anything at this stage and  I don’t think you should worry about that at this point I think  there is a need to come in here as inconspicuously as possible I  believe you’ve been working with Murray Altmann and [others] so that  you‘re at diverse hotels I imagine you do know that the Pope is  coming in [to Washington, DC], which may be good cover It may not  be I‘m asking for a Papal blessing of this meeting Murray suggests  that we‘ll have a large cloak under which to put the meeting! I don’t  know if there will be transportation difficulties--whether you are  going to have any difficulty getting to this building in the morning  We don’t think so but there may be a certain amount of congestion and  disturbance so if you’re anyplace close, you’ll probably want to walk   M R   MAYO Should we plan, Paul, for a meeting that lasts  more than three hours?   Yes I don’t know whether it will be  necessary but I would [suggest that you] not commit yourself [to  leaving by a certain time] I would hope that we can finish in three  hours but if you ask me whether that‘s a certainty, it is not It’s  about as good as the money supply figures; all this scheduling [is  difficult] Obviously we want to emphasize the fact that you should  be as quiet as possible I suspect you will get some inquiries as to     10/05/79 - 6 -    whether there is a meeting, so maybe you can make up a cover story f o r   your people so that there isn't any knowledge of this meeting If  there are no other questions, I will see you in the morning at 930  Thank you   END OF SESSION    	791005confcall      Well, gentlemen, I think we might as well  start I hate to start without Emmett but he seems to have been  incommunicado for 40 minutes now, so let’s begin Maybe we should  take a minute to hear Mr Kichline go over the latest business news  I realize you did that yesterday, Jim, but not everybody had the  benefit of your comments yesterday So, why don’t you do that   We might take just a minute to see if any  of the Presidents in particular have comments they would like to make  on the business scene from [a regional] perspective that would add to  the statistical information that we‘ve had on prices, production, or  other fronts Let’s hear quickly   M R   MORRIS Well, I think we’re seeing an amazing replay of  1974-75 We have declining final demand, with the economy cushioned  by very large inventory accumulation that produces big demand for bank  credit, resulting in growth in the aggregates And we‘ve been leaning  against that growth by pushing up the federal funds rate I gave a     10/6/79 -2 -    talk to my directors on Tuesday in which I overlaid the 1974-75 period  on the current period I assumed March '79 was the peak in this  period and compared that to the November '73 peak The behavior,  including the tracking of the federal funds rate, is amazingly  similar It seems to me that we have a very big inventory  accumulation; and when the inventory accumulation does stop, I think  the recession is likely to be bigger than we are projecting   Any other quick comments?   If there are no other comments-- Bones  did you want to comment?   Well, let me say where I think we are even  though Emmett is still absent I appreciate your all standing by so     10/6/79 -4-    patiently over the past few days, but we’ve had a few complications  putting this together, with some people out of town and so forth  Just in terms of the schedule for today, I think we have to assume  that the Board of Governors is going to have to meet after we get  finished And depending upon what we decide, the presidents may want  to meet too, to discuss any reserve requirement changes and what  kinds of problems that will create in the short run [Unintelligible]  and we may need to talk about straightening out mechanical problems  that may arise [when we implement] any decisions we make So we can  play that by ear as we go along   I don’t know how long we’re going to have to be here today  We will be here until we arrive at a consensus and proceed [from  there] I’m not sure when we would announce any decision that we  make--whether we’d do it late today or Monday morning Those seem to  be the two practical alternatives with the Pope here rather blanketing  the area [news] tomorrow and creating a little difficulty [for us1 in  terms of an orderly announcement   Let me say that I think there are several dimensions to the  current situation We wouldn‘t be here today if we didn’t have a  problem with the state of the markets, whether international or  domestic They were pretty feverish last week--or beginning in the  previous week, really Beginning about 2 weeks ago and carrying over  into the early part of what is still this week, the foreign exchange  market was in a situation that was clearly not amenable for very long  to such techniques as intervention The markets have turned around  some in the past few days, as you know I think that is almost  entirely explicable by the fact that at about the time I returned from  Belgrade Treasury officials and others were making some statements  that left hanging the possibility of some kind of a package, so the  foreign exchange dealers have retreated to the sidelines   That typically is the case these days I  arrived at the airport and there was a reporter accompanying me on the  plane I don‘t know when he got to a telephone; he couldn’t until we  got to London I have thought that one way of managing the markets  might be to ascend in an airplane and just circle, with a refueling  [plane] and no known destination! [Laughter]   I don’t think we can count on that [state of relative calm1  for very long In fact, as you know, while the markets have been  standing still or even declining, the gold market has not exactly been  in a calm situation And the phone calls have begun to escalate,  reflecting a kind of extreme nervousness in all directions I think  the rumors that were floating around in the market yesterday--first  that I had resigned and then that I had died and then that I was mad  at Governor Schultz--are symptomatic of the state of the market  [Market participants] are living with fragile expectations and  inspired rumor and all the rest from day to day I do think that the  psychology in that sense is ready to crack open, depending upon what  decisions they see coming out of here or elsewhere in a very short-  term time horizon     10/6/79 -5-   Now I turn to the economy and you know generally the  situation there We have had at least an Indian Summer, which 1  suppose raises some questions in peoples’ minds as to whether the  recession is all that imminent after all There is an inventory  problem potentially or actually without any question I myself feel a  little less--concerned isn‘t quite the right word I think the risks  of the economy dropping off-- [Secretary’s note Mr Rice arrived  at the meeting] There you are! I‘m sorry that somehow somebody  didn‘t get the accurate word to you on the timing here We really  just started I have described the state of the markets as in some  sense as nervous as I have ever seen them   In terms of the economy, I was about to say that my own  concerns about the risks of the economy falling off the table, though  they have not evaporated, have diminished a bit The possibility of  that occurring appears to be somewhat delayed at the least My own  judgment of this may change, but I think the risks certainly are a  little less than they were before That’s a judgment that may not  mean much if I don‘t tell you what I thought the risks were earlier  I thought they were significant But [the possibility of a downturn]  seems to me at least postponed   On the price front, expectations have certainly gotten worse  rather than better Even though the price news is bad, it does not in  my judgment as yet reflect a spreading of the whole inflationary force  into areas outside of energy We had a fluctuation in food [prices]  last month, but that [component of the price index1 goes up and down  If we look at the wage trend, so far as we know--with the exception of  the General Motors settlement--we haven’t had a real breakout yet  But we’re dealing with a situation where that’s an imminent danger on  the one side as is the possibility of a recession on the other side  Mr Schultz had an apt description the other day of where we are--and  I certainly share the feeling--in saying that Scylla and Charybdis  have now come together There is clearly no risk-free course for us  here; there are risks on both sides The idea that we can absolutely  thread the needle between the risks is probably a nice hope but it may  be an illusion At this stage you’ve got to place your bets one way  or the other and move   I certainly conclude from all of this that we can’t walk away  today without a program that is strong in fact and perceived as strong  in terms of dealing with the situation I would put that case into  context Ignoring some of the more feverish psychology for the  moment, we are in an interim period of sorts where if some of what I  think are quite reasonable--but never absolutely certain--projections  develop in a favorable way we’re not going to see that in fact in the  statistics The statistics are not going to be convincing to anybody  for a period of some months  price front where, if the present trends continue and we don‘t have an  excessive oil price increase from OPEC in December, energy prices  shouldn‘t level off in any absolute terms but should come down from  the enormous rates of increase recorded in recent months And if  other prices are held more or less in check, there is a chance that  inflation will at least come down toward the single digit level--and  if you want to get hopeful, within the single digit level--by the end  of the year or early next year   I’m thinking there particularly on the     10/6/79 - 6 -    If one looks at the balance of payments side, I think most  projections, given foreign growth and given the outlook for the  domestic economy, suggest that both the trade position and the current  account should look considerably better going into 1980 That‘s  simply because, ex-oil, [the external sector] has been doing pretty  well and should continue to do pretty well under these conditions As  we get into 1980 the burden of the increased price of oil imports in  the price indices should be [diminishing] So, we could get a  substantially stronger looking picture then, but we’re not going to  know that until probably well into the first quarter And, of course,  current account figures for the whole first quarter aren’t going to be  out until the Spring The trade figures come out on a monthly basis  and they should reflect [the improvement] to some extent, although  part of the projected strength is in non-trade areas of the balance of  payments The point is that there is a bridging or an interim period  here before the best news one can [reasonably anticipate] is going to  come about And in the present mood of the markets, I think it’s  going to take some time before they’re convinced So we have to fit  our programs into that interim period   The other element, of course, is that we are not dealing with  a stable psychological or stable expectational situation by any means  And on the inflation front we‘re probably losing ground In an  expectational sense, I think we certainly are, and that is being  reflected in extremely volatile financial markets   Let me give you a little background in terms of foreign  components or elements of the package of anything that we might do  here I want to make a couple of comments that I really consider off  the record I don‘t know if we want to keep the recorder going or  not I’d prefer not to Let me just say a few words about the  attitudes of foreign countries as I’ve experienced them first hand  This is not particularly new, although the depths of the feelings      [Secretary’s note The recorder was turned off while the Chairman  gave his assessment--based on discussions at recent international  meetings--of the views of foreign officials regarding a coordinated  package I   That does not reflect entirely a feeling that a package is  impossible, despite all I have said I think it’s clear that an  international package is impossible without strong action by the  Federal Reserve But when you look at the components of a traditional  package of that kind, there is a question of how impressive it is  going to be psychologically We could perhaps build up something like  a $10 billion further availability of marks through fairly obvious  techniques--increasing the swap lines, selling the Germans some S D R s ,   and drawina on the IMF -   I think, but I’m  not saying it‘s absolutely impossible--in a bind, I should say--if  people really thought it would be effective in terms of market  Dsvcholocrv But after a lot of discussion, bv aeneral consensus the - >  ~~~~ ~ --  feeling was that that kind of a package isn‘t-going to add all that  much to an announcement at this point, as compared to the other  possibility of indicating that resources are not really the problem,  which I think is true in the technical sense If the Germans wanted  intervention, they’d provide the resources And there may be some  merit in keeping some of these possibilities dangling over the market  for a period of time and perhaps announcing some of them as the period     10/6/79 -7   evolves  them all up in a package that may not be very impressive at the moment  anyway   That probably would be more effective than trying to wrap   The Treasury undoubtedly will be announcing a bond issue in  the German market, I suspect in a matter of days They have  flexibility in the timing and they will do it when they think they  will get some advantage from it That's not a big deal in the sense  that it has been amply leaked in Belgrade already both by the Germans  and the Americans But that will be coming along; I think we can just  assume that that is [a given] There are no specific swaps, SDRs, or  IMF drawings [under consideration] for the reasons I suggested There  was no desire to solidify any of that at this point   The possibility of gold sales has been canvassed up and down  That this is not a great question of philosophy is, I suppose, the way  I would word it This is a very practical question of what seems  useful and what doesn't seem useful The question has been debated up  and down and I think it is essentially unsettled There is a  possibility Iof gold sales], particularly if the gold market acts up  again, but there has been no firm consensus reached on that point  simply because in our mutual discussions some concern was expressed  about whether they are effective or not effective over a period of  time They might be effective immediately But if the gold sales  have a nice effect immediately and we test it a little while later and  the gold price goes up again, the question arises Is it confidence  inspiring or is it not? Or is it really better over a period of time  just to leave the [gold] market alone? I think that question has to  be left on that basis for the time being It is indeed an open  question and something that I think will depend upon the performance  of the markets over a period of time--not just of the gold market, but  of all markets So, that is essentially the background we are dealing  with in that area   We will have cooperation, I think, from our foreign partners  either on gold or on intervention to the degree that they feel that we  have done something here; that is an essential part of setting the  stage We will get that kind of cooperation, I suppose, with the  limitations of enthusiasm that are inherent in my earlier comments I  don't mean to suggest that that type of activity is "out" if we  mutually think it is advantageous On the contrary, it is '"in" over a  period of time with an appropriate background But it is not "in" in  the sense of announcing an international package of that type this  weekend   Now, when it comes to our action here, I think there are  broadly two possibilities One is taking measures of what might be  thought of as the traditional type That would include a discount  rate move on the one side and so far as this Committee is concerned a  significant increase in the federal funds rate--putting those moves  together The Board will be considering some reserve requirement  changes later today Let's assume that the package would include  that Also, we would go forward with whatever changes in the federal  funds rate we thought appropriate, which would be evident in the  market Or maybe we would say something about that in the  announcement of the discount rate change and the reserve requirement  change I think we ought to look at that possibility     10/6/79 - 8 -    The other possibility is a change in the emphasis of our  operations as outlined in the memorandum that was distributed, which I  hope you've all had a chance to read That involves managing Desk  operations from week to week essentially, with a greater effort to  bring about a reserve path that will in turn achieve a money supply  target--which we have to discuss--recognizing that that would require  a wider range for the federal funds rate and would involve a more  active management of the discount rate And of course the question of  reserve requirements and the discount rate change at this point are  relevant in that context too   As I look at these two approaches there are advantages and  disadvantages, obviously, to both of them I must say that the  thought of changing our method of operations germinated--in my mind at  least--before the market psychology or nervousness reached the extreme  stage it reached over the past week or so My feeling was that by  putting even more emphasis on meeting the money supply targets and  changing operating techniques [in order to do sol and thereby changing  psychology a bit, we might actually get more bang for the buck By  that I mean our having a more favorable impact on psychology and  perhaps a more favorable impact on banks by introducing a little  uncertainty per basis point of rise in money market rates than would  be possible through the traditional method I overstate it, but the  traditional method of making small moves has in some sense, though not  completely, run out of psychological gas Every time the interest  rate goes up by a small amount [bankers] say okay, we'll raise the  prime rate Whatever you do is inadequate--you, the Federal Reserve--  and we'll go along We have access to liquidity at a fairly fixed  federal funds rate--the rate isn't going to change all that abruptly--  and you're not having much impact on market thinking or on market  confidence in your ability to keep the money supply under control I  am not saying that that reasoning is correct but I think it is the  reasoning in the market psychologically   So we run a risk, almost whatever we do, that [in response]  to next week's changes they will say "It's not quite enough; the  interest rates should be a little higher The Fed undershot again"  And we won't get the psychological impact we are looking for So  there may be something to [be gained in] a change in the psychological  atmosphere that in some sense will give us more bang for the buck, as  I put it It's possible It's an easier political sale, and we are  obviously moving into an area that is sensitive, to say the least We  do have a background of some Congressional thinking that puts great  emphasis on the money supply targets So, to the extent that we  accept that emphasis one might argue that we will get more support I  think that it is a factor to be weighed, but there are those who would  say "The hell with all this theorizing about where the targets are;  when Congress sees the interest rate effects, that won't make any  difference" So it is not a black or white situation by any means but  I think it is something we can take into account   If we're lucky, this change [in our operating technique] will  improve our chances of reaching our money supply targets on the one  side On the other side, it has some built-in pressure to move  interest rates downward more promptly if the money supply begins  running low If the money supply were running low because the economy  was falling off more rapidly, triggering a faster response on the down  side clearly might be considered an advantage--and maybe an important     10/6/79 -9-   advantage A context where the decline in interest rates is being  related to weakness in the money supply should offer us some  psychological and real protection in terms of financial market  appraisals of why the interest rates are going down   Now, there are disadvantages as well, and they are important  To take one that flows immediately out of the advantage that I just  cited, some people may consider it a disadvantage that we get too  locked into [responding to] fluctuations in the money supply [That  might lead to] a prompt decline in interest rates at a time, let’s  say, that would be unsettling internationally or might be  misinterpreted domestically So there is clearly an opposite side to  that advantage There is a feeling that we can get stuck We are  going to have to constrain the [funds] range whatever we do; it should  be much wider under this approach but we certainly can constrain the  fluctuation in an uncertain world There is a danger that we could  get stuck at the top of the range if the money supply turns out to be  fairly strong; we‘d be back basically to the kind of operation we are  in now, bumping against [the upper limit of] a federal funds target,  which at that point would be at a higher level than we otherwise  really would have wanted I suppose there are two dangers out of  that We may get a little more restraint than we bargained for; that  is one possibility Another is that we will defeat the psychological  purpose if this puts us back into that kind of constraint   There is a feeling that by responding to the particular  situation we have now with a change in technique, we may get locked  into a technique that isn’t very suitable over the longer run,  including into 1980 The technique might have implications for  interest rates or other things that we wouldn’t be happy about in  other situations, yet it would be hard to reverse our ground I think  we also have to consider [the risk] of putting a lot more emphasis now  on the money supply targets, knowing that there is no technique that‘s  going to assure that we are going to [achieve] the money supply  targets--either because of the inherent lags in the situation, the  uncertainties of the money demand function and all the rest, or  because we would resist any absolutely extreme movement in interest  rates that might be necessary to keep [the money supply1 within the  target ranges We could well end up exceeding the targets for the  year, after making a hullabaloo about this change in technique And  we could run into a reaction that at that point would be adverse So  there are advantages, disadvantages, and risks on all sides of this  equation   I should report to you that obviously I discussed the whole  problem on the international side and inevitably on the domestic side  with the Administration I think I can say flatly that they are ready  for a strong program; they would have no disagreement with that  conclusion at all They shy away very strongly or have an uneasy  feeling about a shift in technique at this point because of the  uncertainties of the situation There‘s a rather strong feeling, I  think I should report, that that is the more risky course for a  variety of reasons that I’ve touched upon concern that the interest  rate may move in a contrary way at some point in terms of the  international situation; considerable concern about locking ourselves  into a technique beyond this year that might not be suitable in light  of all the circumstances; and concern that an immediate rise in the  rate might be excessive depending, of course, upon where the federal     10/6/79 -10-   funds rate ceiling is put But there’s a fear on the other hand that  if it is put too low we‘re in a box where we would be bumping against  the ceiling all the time   Finally a feeling that I think we have to consider too, if we  do make this change, is that there is no apparent encore for the  Federal Reserve; we will have in effect shot our bolt Now, I don’t  think that’s necessarily a minus, but it’s another factor we might  want to take into account It has been clear all along but it’s  particularly clear at this point that we cannot by brute strength of  monetary policy alone correct all the ills in the economy and in  economic policy generally I don’t mean to infer that I think  economic policy is bad I think fiscal policy has given us all the  support we could ask for right now and, in terms of general business  analysis, one might even argue more support than would be absolutely  desirable I don’t think we can [count on] the possibility of  changing fiscal policy in this psychological situation I don’t  believe it should be changed for that reason But if we change  techniques, I think in a broad way we have gone to the limits of what  monetary policy can really expect to accomplish and we can’t come back  with something entirely different a month from now and another  [change] two months from now or whenever   Now, I can go with either of these broad approaches because I  think, with regard to our immediate situation, that we can develop an  [alternative] package of measures that is basically equivalent in  terms of market impact or psychological impact or whatever we want to  achieve immediately I have told you what the instincts are  elsewhere; I have also told you that [the Administration] is ready for  a strong program I think it’s clear that the decision is one that is  within our province and we have to make it today We need a program  that‘s as convincing as we can make it In my view it’s also very  important that we have the widest possible consensus among us in this  kind of situation where there is no good answer I think we all do  recognize that there is no good answer, but there is strength in  diversity here, if you will So, to the extent that we have a  consensus, that in itself will help carry the program and help achieve  what we want to achieve I am prepared, within the broad parameters,  to go with whichever way the consensus wants to go so long as the  program is strong, and if we adopt a new approach so long as we are  not locked into it indefinitely If we adopt a new approach, I’d  consider it something that we adopted that seems particularly suitable  to the situation at this time We’d obviously gain some experience  either pro or con by adopting the new approach And I would say that  early next year or late this year in connection with considering the  new [money and credit growth1 targets for the next year we would have  a thoroughgoing ground up decision as to whether we wanted to maintain  this kind of approach, modify it, return to more traditional  practices, or whatever That should be a completely open decision I  was intending to have that discussion in any event at that time and I  just don’t want to prejudge the issue by whatever we consider suitable  at the moment   And finally I would say that I don’t think we can adopt a  mechanical approach on the reserve side While there would be a clear  change in emphasis if we decide upon [this new approach], inherent in  it is that we simply are going to have to leave a lot of discretion in  the actual operations to the Desk, to my benevolent oversight, and to     10/6/79 -11   ex post review [by the Committee] with whatever frequency you would  like, looking ahead on an interim basis But I am not prepared to  recommend or to accept a mechanical device that says nonborrowed  reserves or the reserve base or total reserves or whatever, are going  to meet x figure on a week-to-week basis come hell or high water  regardless of what judgments are about the outlook or regardless of  whether the interest rate is 17 percent or 6 percent We are just not  going to carry it to that extreme But if we go in that direction,  there is a real change in emphasis involved that would need to be  reviewed carefully as we move along   That is my analysis of the situation If you have any  reactions at a very general level now, let's have them And then I  think we ought to get into more detailed questions about the new  approach The traditional approach is obviously much more clear-cut  It is a quantitative question of where you want to go Many of the  questions overlap The differences are not night and day, but I think  we need the time for a little more exposition on what the new approach  would entail   Bank credit controls or any kind of  controls?   M R   MAYO Various types   Well, let me just say a word on that In  this situation we get more talk about that, and there are certainly  market rumors I don't know that I hear such strong rumors that  controls are a great possibility right now but there is a very large  segment of market opinion that says if not now we are going to be  driven to [impose them] later because the situation is out of control  My reaction--which on the basis of some earlier discussions I think is  shared by some other Board members and by people in the Administration  who at the very least would have to trigger the control mechanism when  we're talking about domestic credit controls--is that of all the  options one could think of theoretically, that is probably the most  dangerous in terms of the business situation That's because a  control program that really bites at all might lead to [undesirable]  reactions For instance, grave questions might be raised about  whether financing was available for some of the inventory that one  would like to see financed And all the anticipatory effects, with  people trying to protect themselves, would [put the economy on] a very  dangerous course at this particular juncture in the business cycle  The feeling is that there is some danger, on which people will put  different [probabilities], of the economy having a most severe  inventory reaction and indeed [that controls might1 even inhibit  planning for capital spending that we wouldn't want to inhibit   Controls in the international dimension have not been  discussed at all I personally cannot conceive of controls in the  international area Forgetting about philosophy or long-term effects  or anything else, I can't imagine--1 speak for myself--how one would  design them so they'd be effective They would have so many leaks  around them because the major types of flows that involve foreign held     l0/6/79 -12-   dollars [have] leads and lags or what could be disguised as leads or  lags Such controls just don’t have any prospect of effectiveness  that would make them within the range of possibilities   I’m glad you mentioned the commodities  issue I don‘t know whether all the Presidents have caught up with  this, though I presume they have Beginning a little more than a week  ago, late in the previous week when the gold market was gyrating,  there was some very clear evidence that this psychology was getting  into the metals markets in particular in a very forceful way and maybe  in the grains market very temporarily There were very sharp price  increases in some metals markets which continued into Monday or  Tuesday They have relapsed along with the gold market and the  exchange market fervor for the same reason and I’m sure they were  related psychologically But it’s worth mentioning that we have this  evidence of extreme sensitivity And the price increase was what--20  percent in the copper market in 2 days or something like that?   Lead went up 20 percent, too It was  frankly a bit of scary psychology to say the least That has also in  some sense relapsed for the moment in this [general] atmosphere of  nervous anticipation   No question   If I may just interject, Frank, I agree  with what you are saying and I think [the issue] has to be approached  in that light But presumably the guts will have a number on it--the  degree of our guts on the up side   I understand   Well, if we have a new procedure, I will  have a press conference Whether I have it today or Monday is an open  quest ion   M R   MORRIS [If you have it today], the markets will have  the weekend to absorb this   Well, I don’t know We have a holiday on  Monday and we may do the press conference Monday morning You can  assume that I will have a press conference if we go through [with this  change]   Well, I don’t want to accept that I  don’t think we can make that decision now If we [change our  operating technique], I do accept the fact that to some degree we have  prejudiced the discussion we will have at the end of the year We  will have to have a reason then to move back to the traditional  method But I don’t think we can really make that decision now, nor  should we Nor do I think this commits us that fully, though it  prejudices to some degree what we would do next year   Bob Mayo I’ll get back on course     10/6/79 -11-   Mr Timlen     10/6/79 -19-   Governor Wallich   Let me just make a couple of comments  I‘m not sure it’s self-evident that in interest rate terms the new  technique is stronger It may or may not be, depending upon what  happens to the money supply I think that is inherent in the new  techniqde It also depends upon a judgment on how much traditional-  type action we would take and I don’t think at this stage of the  discussion we know the answer to those [questions] We’ll never know  the answer, no matter how long we talk, to what the money supply  actually will do in coming months And until we get further along in  our conversation, we don’t know how strong our traditional-type  actions will be   We’ll get into that I’m just getting  general reactions now--and I think they should be rather general--of  the type that we have had so far   Let me just say, too, that on the issue of interest rates  coming down there probably are going to be differences of opinion;  there always are But I don’t think we can sit here today and say it  would be a terrible thing if interest rates went up to 14 or 15  percent on the new technique, just taking some numbers that are used  [in the staff paper] if they come down off that peak to the  neighborhood of where they are now, that may be inherent in the new  technique if it’s successful under present projections of the money  supply And I’m not sure it’s terribly alarming--to me anyway--in the  exchange market sense It’s a matter of judgment But I don‘t think  we can get ourselves into a position where no matter how high rates go  at some point with the new technique, any decline from a new peak is  in itself a disaster it might be great It might actually encourage  the feeling that we’re over the peak I don’t think we’re in a  situation where the interest rate differential vis a vis German  interest rates--whether it is 5 percent or 7 percent--is an important  market consideration That implies a little more stable psychological  atmosphere Let me say it is overwhelmed by the psychology of the  situation Who is next here on the list? Ernie Baughman   I don't think so, but that will come out  in a later discussion, I think   Mr Winn   I think some of those will come out later  in a more detailed discussion Mr Rice   M R   RICE Mr Chairman, I favor moving to the new operating  technique--the change of emphasis--at this time I believe our  current approach has not been working and we need to change our style  But in changing our style in this case we probably also are changing  our strategy at the same time I believe it's more than just a matter     1 0 / 6 / 7 9  -22-    of operating technique, though I could be wrong First of all, the  psychological impact of a change in operating technique will be  strong I think it will be strong not only in domestic markets but  also in foreign markets In my view the foreign markets will read  such an announcement as an expression of our determination to control  the money supply, and that will have salutary effects   It seems to me that up to now what we’ve been doing is  pushing up interest rates, largely in response to market expectations,  and we‘ve been assuming in effect that we know what the appropriate  level of interest rates should be And when the market wants high  interest rates, we end up supplying more reserves and the money supply  increases I think that if we moved to a technique where we decide  what the money supply should be--and we operate directly on the  reserve base to get as close to the level of aggregates that we want--  we would stand a better chance of producing the kinds of results we  would like to see The good thing about moving to this operating  technique is that, contrary to some of the views that have been  expressed, we introduce new uncertainty into the market I think  that’s a good thing The new uncertainty will have the effect of  cooling some of the speculative activity and perhaps have an impact on  those demands for credit that are based purely on inflationary  expectations and on the assumption that money will always be available  at any level of interest rates that the Fed tries to establish  Probably the first reaction will be a sharp rise in short-term  interest rates But I do believe that the rise will probably be  short-lived and that the period over which interest rates will remain  high is much likely to be shorter than would be the case if we  continue to follow our present approach of gradually ratcheting up  interest rates in response to market pulls   Obviously, there are high risks involved; these risks have  been outlined But in the current circumstances I think these risks  are acceptable And in any case the risks are less than we would be  accepting if we continued to follow our present approach I would,  however, like to have it understood that the money supply targets--the  aggregates targets that we set--are important here They are very  important for the success of the program I would also like to have  it understood that interest rates should be flexible downward as well  as upward Thank you   Mr Black   M R   BLACK Mr Chairman, Governor Rice has made many of the  points that I wanted to make, but I’d just like to say that I feel  better about what I‘ve heard around this table than I’ve ever felt at  any time since I’ve been attending these meetings I think we are now  on the road to formulating better monetary policy I often think of  our position as being analogous to that of a monopolist in the sense  that we control the money supply A monopolist has a choice of  controlling either price or quantity but he can never control both I  believe we’ve been trying to control the quantity of money by setting  the price and we have misjudged We’ve jiggled the price, in terms of  the federal funds rate, one way or the other, and we‘ve usually met  with less than complete success in judging what quantity of money will  be forthcoming from that So, I think this gives us a much closer  handle on the aggregates than we would have under any of these other  approaches, although conceptually we certainly could do it by the old     10/6/79 -23-   method if we had a wide enough band on the federal funds rate But I  don’t think we would know what federal funds rate we would have to  choose in order to get the desired rate of growth in the aggregates   Now, I do think there are some broad considerations--and  we’ll touch on some of these later--that we ought to address before we  close today The first is that the discount rate is going to play a  very important role under this operating technique If we have  greater or less fluctuation in the level of borrowing, that’s going to  make it more or less difficult to hit our total reserve target So I  think we‘re going to have to be very careful in choosing the  appropriate discount rate It will not necessarily be what we thought  was appropriate in the past   My second point is that I think in your press conference you  ought to state, among other things, that we would expect the federal  funds rate, at least initially, to fluctuate more than it has in the  past You should also stress that there are various slippages in this  mechanism; it is not a precise tool I think you should also say why  we have taken the action we have taken on the discount rate, because  it will be important to explain why we’ve put it where we have   Another point I would emphasize, as the staff did, is that we  are going to need a pretty wide range on the federal funds rate it  may mean that we have to let it move up sharply--or we may not--in the  beginning I agree with Henry Wallich that we need to watch it, at  least initially, on the down side I’d be inclined to put a floor on  the down side until we know what the market perception is on this  [approach] That‘s because falling interest rates very early in the  game, even though we appear to be controlling the aggregates might be  counter-productive But I would want to see that floor removed as  soon as the aggregates come under control If I’ve seemed hawkish to  some of you in advocating that we push up the federal funds rate to  bring the aggregates under control when I thought they were growing  too rapidly I think you‘ll view me as very dovish if I see them  growing less rapidly than I believe they should We have to be  prepared to let the funds rate go down   Another point I would stress, which is in the material that  was handed out by the staff, is that we have a problem in specifying  the width of this band--whether it’s for a day, a week, or a weekly  average and whether we take into consideration the settlement date and  that sort of thing My guess is that Emmett Rice has diagnosed  correctly what will happen to interest rates; they will go up  initially as people rush to obtain funds because they perceive that  the supply will not be as readily available But I think also that  rates are going to move back down, partly because of the elimination  of some inflation expectations and also because I believe we are  indeed slipping into recession, which would naturally cause them to  drop   Finally, as we get into the long run, there are a couple of  items that we are going to have to think about An example would be  structural changes that we ought to consider making to improve our  control mechanism One such change might be lengthening the reserve  period to maybe a month or we might want to drop the lag part,  although I’m not persuaded on that Certainly we would want to get  rid of the graduated reserve requirements to the extent we could     10/6/79 -24   And, if we lose the Merrill case, I think we’re going to be forced  into this kind of targeting technique anyway If we were to announce  on the day of the meeting what in fact the federal funds band was, I  think we could have some very disquieting effects in the market,  whereas the announcement of a change in our money supply target would  not really tell the market a great deal Only the most sophisticated  or lucky would be able to figure out the interest rate implications of  that   Mr Roos   There are one or two things that I didn’t  agree with here but that’s okay Do you want to take a little coffee  break or not?   SEVERAL Yes   Okay we will return to a more detailed  exposition unless somebody wants to say something at this point   [Coffee break]   Mr Coldwell is developing a computer for  forecasting the money supply, converting it into the reserve base,  nonborrowed reserves, borrowings, and the federal funds rate!  [Secretary’s note A s  the meeting was in the process of reconvening,  Mr Coldwell was demonstrating an electronic device of some kind]   Let me try to describe the so-called new system, as I  understand it, in an unprejudicial way Out of this discussion will  emerge some of the risks and dangers that have been referred to To  the extent possible, let’s avoid detailed technical exegesis that will  [keep] us here until Monday morning and not resolve the issues I  think there are unresolved issues that we are going to have to play by  ear The basic theory of this procedure is that the Committee would  decide--in this case only through the end of the year--on some money  supply targets There are two extremes, I think, that are practical,  though one of them may not be practical On page 3 of this memorandum  it says that if we met the midpoint of the present target we would  have [September-to-December] movements of 13, 15, or 53 percent,  depending upon which [aggregate] we are looking at If we aimed  basically for the top side of the targets or a bit inside them, we‘d  end up with [growth rates for M1, M2, and M3 for the fourth quarter  of] 46, 7  5 ,  and 73 percent The 75 percent number leaves M2 at  exactly the top of its range for the year   Those happen to be, I say with all deference, the present  projections of our projectors I have about as much confidence in  those projections as any projections, with all due respect to the     10/6/79 -25-   projectors I don’t have a great deal of confidence in them But  they happen to be the rates we have to achieve to come within the  targets That doesn’t allow any significant leeway if indeed we are  going to get within the target ranges, and that is one of the problems  we’re dealing with here We have practically no leeway to go wrong if  indeed we are going to be within the yearly targets we adopted  [unintelligible]    Now, our concept of the process is that those money supply  figures that were chosen would be converted into a reserve base  number The reserves for currency would be projected and that would  be subtracted from the reserve base, leaving us with reserves against  a deposit component of the money supply--and reserves against a few  other things, too, which is one of the complications Allowance would  be made for the growth in the non-money supply components; allowance  would be made for whatever we know about shifts of deposits among  banks and all the rest; and we would trace out a reserve path  presumably consistent with those money supply figures  compare that with what we thought was going to happen   We would   Suppose we happen to put a lot of weight on the current  projection of the money supply and pick figures that would closely  coincide with that We would then provide, making some assumption on  the level of borrowing that seemed to be consistent with the level of  interest rates that presumably laid behind the projection of the money  supply in the first place--we can‘t avoid interest rate assumptions  the way these things are done--nonborrowed reserves along that path  If the money supply actually grew faster, borrowings would go up and  presumably interest rates would go up; if the reverse happened,  borrowings would go down and interest rates would go down   We live in an uncertain world And in view of fluctuating  projections regarding the trend in the money supply, our first point  of judgment would arise--let’s say particularly in the present  circumstance--because we might get some ease in the money market  immediately if we did nothing but follow the path week by week If we  thought we were going to have trouble later because the projection  [has money growth] going above [our targets], we would under-supply  reserves in the current week to provide some assurance that we’re  going to cope with the fluctuation later and not have borrowings  running ahead of what we had assumed That would mean that total  reserves were running ahead of what we had assumed and the money  supply would be running ahead of what we‘d assumed Or in looking  ahead, if we were expecting some great decline in the money supply, we  might apply judgment and do the operation in the opposite direction  In view of the outlook, we might permit some easing prematurely from  the mechanical application of the [amount of reserves called for in  the path] That is, we’d let borrowings drop sooner because we  thought the money supply subsequently was going to come in below path  That’s one area of judgment we get into right away   AS the borrowings fluctuate, they would themselves be  reflected in interest rates But rates also would be affected further  by our subsequent decisions on the discount rate, in terms of whether  to follow the trend of borrowings in either direction In other  words, if the borrowings rose, we could increase the discount rate to  bring further pressure on reducing the money supply, the increase in  borrowings itself being a sign that money growth was running above     10/6/79 - 2 6 -    where we wanted it to run If it began running the other way,  presumably borrowings would decline; then we‘d have to make that  additional judgment as to whether to reduce the discount rate in order  to accelerate or facilitate a decline in interest rates The rates at  that time would also be reflecting the fact that the money supply was  running low compared to where we wanted it to be   It is firmly set, in my mind at least, that in this process  the federal funds rate is going to be constrained but constrained over  a substantially wider range than has been our practice Now we have a  range of about 1/2 or 1 percentage point in our directive, though  typically we do not actually operate on that wide a range We operate  on a day-to-day basis with almost no range at all Well, we let it  fluctuate on unusual days, but basically we are operating in an  environment where everybody in the market is looking out to see  whether Peter Sternlight intervenes at 1/16th of a point or 1/8th of a  point higher or lower than before In practice, the kind of range we  have is 1/8th percentage point, roughly And the market is sensitive  to changes in interest rates of that magnitude--at least when we are  in the market and not on a Wednesday or something like that  Obviously, with this technique we are going to ignore changes of that  magnitude and we are going to ignore changes of some great multiple  of those 1/8ths we‘ve been concerned about in the past Whether we  ignore them when they reach 2 or 3 percentage points or let them go to  whatever ceiling is put on the funds range is a matter of judgment, I  guess But we certainly are not talking about the type of operation  in which we’ve engaged in the past where the market is sensitive in an  extremely narrow range to where we operate   When I talk about putting a constraint on the [funds rate  range] on the top or the bottom, I’m not talking about a constraint  that applies every hour of every day The typical Wednesday situation  would presumably run its course; we might get an exceedingly high rate  of interest on a Wednesday or it might fall out of bed on a Wednesday,  as it sometimes does I think we’d let those kinds of fluctuations go  outside of the kind of range we’re talking about I think we would  attempt, probably not very successfully, to avoid telling the market  if we hit the [constraint] in more normal circumstances or precisely  what the range is But they‘re going to be smelling around for it  just as they do now and I don‘t know how successful we would be in  avoiding that entirely A l l  I’m saying is that perhaps we can try to  disguise the operations by doing them at a quarter point less or  letting the rate go a quarter point or a half point above [the  constraint] for a day or so But the market is going to be feeling  for where the top or the bottom of that range is if [the rate] goes  persistently in one direction or another And if it does, we can get  in a situation, as I said earlier, where it’s just going to lock  itself against the upper level or the lower level and stay there   We are working with a two-week lagged reserve requirement  Somebody mentioned that that probably isn’t the most desirable  [arrangement] in the world if we are operating on this kind of system  I think I would agree with that But we have it, and that’s not  something we can change overnight What it means in practice is that  we’re going to have lags with this system in affecting the money  supply, as we have lags with the present system We always know  analytically that we’re going to have lags; presumably with the new  system we’ve shortened them somewhat But we have a mechanical lag of     10/6/79 -27-    two weeks and on top of that a lag in the reaction of the banking  system because we don’t control borrowings from week to week How  much more pronounced effect on the money supply we will have in the  type of period we are talking about here is one of the risks or  dangers, I suppose We should have more control, I think, when we  look through the entire 3-month period By December we ought to have  a good deal more assurance that we‘re going to hit whatever December  figure we have in mind But we are talking about a quarterly figure  and we are already into the quarter, so whatever we do now isn‘t going  to have much effect on the October figure Fortunately, the current  projection for October, for what it’s worth, is pretty moderate anyway  but the month is basically gone, whatever technique we apply We will  probably have somewhat more effect on the November number with this  technique and I would think significantly more in December But there  is no assurance that we’re going to meet our target by using this  technique--given the inevitable lags and given what I at least  visualize as some constraint on [allowing fluctuations in] the funds  rate--though maybe more than with the present technique You know  what the errors have been in the present technique So we would not  be adopting a technique here that provides us with certainty--more  assurance but not certainty--that we are going to be able to sit here  at the end of the year and say proudly that we aimed for a  [particular] M1 number from September to December and we came out  [there] There is nothing in this technique that I see that permits  that kind of precision, even though it should have somewhat more  precision than what we now have   I just want to emphasize that because of the comments that  some people made about all the publicity we should give to this change  in technique There‘s an immediate advantage in the publicity; there  is a disadvantage not very far down the road if people read this as a  commitment and in fact we are not going to be able to live up to that  commitment That’s without even injecting into the equation that we  indeed might change our minds next month or the following month We  might say look, this technique is fine, but it may give us a 16  percent interest rate and we just don’t want a 16 percent interest  rate Or the reverse I think that’s a policy judgment we cannot  avoid during this period So I feel there are limitations as to how  much we can promise from this technique I don’t think that  eliminates, but it diminishes, the sense of psychological satisfaction  that one can provide   I don’t know what the current New York projections are for  this period and I don’t think it’s important specifically I know  some other people in town have a much higher projection for money  supply growth over the remainder of this year, given current interest  rates All I’m doing is emphasizing [the uncertainties] again  Nobody really knows what the money demand function will be over a  period as short as this, which reflects upon the risks in the  proposition   ought to turn to the mechanics and try to clarify that as much as we  can Steve can say whatever he wants to say When one thinks about  being committed to this kind of process over a longer period of time,  just put yourself back in the first half of last year I don’t know  how many people feel in retrospect that we should have been very  substantially easier in the first half of last year in terms of   Let me say just [one more thing] before I stop and then we     10/6/79 - 2 8 -    interest rates I personally think that would have been a disaster in  retrospect and I thought so at the time And we were not But  looking backwards I don’t see how our present situation would be  improved in any way by having followed religiously a money supply  target during a period in which none of the money demand equations  were working right There was vast institutional change going on at  the time, with money market funds, ATS, NOW accounts, a big surge in  RPs, and all the rest That’s the [reason] I’m not willing to make a  judgment at this point as to the long-term desirability of this  technique through thick and thin and in all possible circumstances   So, I would remind you that because of the particular  circumstances I am thinking of using this technique for the [coming]  3- or 4-month period This is a time when it may be particularly  important to our credibility and to the economy and to psychology and  everything else that we provide ourselves with greater assurance that  we will get a handle on the money supply I think it prejudices the  discussion that we will have at the end of the year but it doesn‘t  lock us in with respect to that discussion There is a basic  instability in the demand function for money in the kind of period  that we are talking about There is an instability in the  relationship between reserves and deposits that is inherent in this  system And in a sense those kinds of risks get translated into the  concerns [about interest rates that different members] have in varying  degrees I’m sure that interest rates will either go up too far or go  down too far, depending upon one’s preoccupation at particular periods  of time We can control that, to some degree, by setting these limits  around [the funds rate], which I think are essential despite the fact  that they have some disadvantages   I would conclude in the end that this is not a black and  white situation We are not--at least I am not--proposing that we go  to a purely mechanical reserve targeting approach There are elements  of judgment which I have described to some extent; there are  uncertainties in the estimates that we are taking into account We  are not adopting an approach that says Well, currency may be going  twice as high as we projected during this period but in the long term  that will wash out, so we will ignore it We are proposing an  approach where somebody--some human being--will sit down and say For  the period ahead I’m making a new estimate of currency and allowing an  adjustment for its impact on the total reserve base and, therefore, on  the nonborrowed reserves that are the immediate operating target  Somebody will be looking at CDs and if they are going up or down twice  as fast as projected, he will be making a new projection of the  nonborrowed reserve base to allow for the fact that CDs have moved  contrary to our expectations in the original projections We are  allowing some human being to sit there and [judge] that the multiplier  between reserves and deposits [used for the projections] is off and to  make some adjustment for that in conducting operations in the next few  weeks There are all these elements of judgment that enter into the  process That, combined with the constraint on the federal funds  rate, brings us to something of a hybrid Inevitably, we are merely  talking about where we are on the spectrum between a mechanical  reserve targeting approach and what we have been doing   I will make two comments, Mr Roos I  don’t think it would be more productive because I hope the Committee  as a whole, at this particular meeting at least, will not get into  that detail We will be in an absolute morass if we attempt to arrive  at some judgment as to whether the staff has made all these  translations correctly and on precisely how we should proceed If we  decide to go on this approach, I believe we are going to have to go on  it with the Committee indicating only broad guidelines There is  enough judgment involved that we can get a good sense of how the  Committee wants this process to operate in a very uncertain world  And even in a two-week perspective, I don’t think we can attempt to  have a technical resolution of all these detailed issues There will  be plenty of opportunity for that kind of [analysis] in the next few  months and it would be relevant in terms of any further decision at  the end of the year on whether or not to stay with this procedure   But inherent in the situation today, and I‘ll just put it  very simply, the Committee has to have faith that it can give some  general guidance and that we--basically the staff here at the Board  under Mr Axilrod’s direction--will translate that as best they can,  within these general parameters, into operational numbers And then,  it has to have faith that Mr Sternlight will use his best judgment in  taking the figures that are produced here [in Washington] and deciding  on precisely which day he will provide how many reserves to the  market   Well, any way we go we have to get into  the money supply number If we’re going to go this way, the Committee  is going to have to make a decision on the federal funds constraint  and what biases--if I can put it that way--we want to introduce into  the operations, particularly in the next couple of weeks A number of  people have referred to a point on which I fully agree After going  through this hullabaloo, if we have made some miscalculation here and  the federal funds rate drops by a percentage point, say, next week, we  are in a hell of a fix So, I assume we would want to bias it on the  up side However these calculations come out, we want to have some  sense of what the Committee wants to do in that respect     10/6/79 -30    I personally don't think that the nature  of the problems we have are susceptible to sitting down around the  table and saying "Do we use this figure or do we not use this  figure?" We can argue about that kind of thing if we are willing to  adopt this experiment in a fairly rigid way for a period of a year  I, frankly, am not willing to take the risks of [operating totally on  the basis of] some long-term equation or mechanical relationship that  we know can be way off in a period of a month or in any particular  week--or even in a 3-month period   No Well, inherent in this technique, the  Committee can keep it biased however it wants to keep it biased We  have to discuss that But in the mechanics of the process that I  described, let's say we biased it for the first two or three weeks,  quite deliberately, and we were wrong It turns out that in fact we  didn't have to bias it to keep the money supply under control But we  biased it in that direction because we wanted to make extra sure that  [the money supply] didn't rise The result would be a slower growth  in the money supply four, five, or six weeks down the pike than we  otherwise would have gotten Then, out of the mechanics of the  system, unless we made a quite deliberate decision to bias it in the  other direction, we'd have the expense of biasing it tight in the  first place and biasing it easy down the road Now, the Committee  obviously can make a new decision at that point The biasing is, I  suppose, where the Committee thinks the major risks lie Take [the  current] money supply figure It's already in the top of the range,  so we'd be much more sensitive to missing it on the up side than to a  little miss on the low side Particularly initially, we would bias it  in that direction, apart from the interest rate implications   No We would announce that we want to be  within the targets for the year   Well, we can go that route Maybe we   Why don’t we [discuss the specifications],  unless somebody wants to ask more about the mechanics That will come  out to some degree in the discussion anyway   Well, if we adopt this approach, that is  one of the issues I had in mind when I suggested that the Reserve Bank  Presidents might want to meet for further discussion this afternoon  One of the problems with this approach, it seems to me, is that the  administration of the discount window is very confused at the moment  Inherent in the way we have been operating--to put it bluntly--there  is no legitimate reason to borrow Banks borrow because of the rate  spread, but that's not really a legitimate reason Now, that ignores  computer breakdowns and that kind of thing Except for accidental  circumstances or late on a Wednesday--and here I'm talking about the  larger banks--under our present guidelines there really isn't a  legitimate reason for banks to borrow from the discount window, as I  understand it   I know I have had the experience in New York where the  discount officer happily comes in to tell me that he called up bank x,  which borrowed for the first time in six months, a few hundred million  dollars He asked them why they were borrowing And the bank  official cautiously says "What the hell, I hadn't borrowed in a  while and your rate looked pretty low" And the discount officer  replies "Well, you can't borrow for that reason" Now, if a Reserve  Bank really enforces that kind of discipline, it doesn't get many  borrowings But it's obviously not enforced evenly And I suspect  there are no additional guidelines we can give the discount officers  at the moment We have to let events take their course We have been  doing it for years, and I suppose we can do it for a few more months  It will raise this question in the bankers' minds I think we will  have to develop a more coherent policy in a few months and it might be  useful for the Presidents to think about these implications   Whatever they are   What I visualize happening--but it may not  if we move the discount rate frequently enough--is that with the  volatility in the funds rate, more and more banks will be tempted to  borrow despite the presumed guideline against it So the discipline  that now exists will break down, and the same level of borrowings will  mean something quite different than it means now But it's very hard  to measure that How do we prevent that from happening?   I think that is the implication of this  technique in the long run but not in the short run   Well, I haven’t thought about it a lot,  but I presume that the discount rate would be more flexible but not so  much more flexible [as to preclude1 a variety of requests from various  Banks in a timely fashion So there wouldn’t be any special problem  I think we are going to have a lot more requests for discount rate  changes But we’ll need them to provide a menu of choices in the  short run as to where we set the discount rate   I think we can do that, too   Oh, it can ultimately control it if we  make that decision Did you want to say something, Phil?   Let me comment Let's take what you said  about CDs as given without objection and reduce the variables by one  You suggested one particular way of biasing this and I would just note  that in some sense it depends upon what you mean by bias If you fill  in a money supply figure of 3 percent from September through December  against the projection of 46 percent, in concept you have already  biased it toward higher interest rates Then to specify borrowing  above the current level in the context of this operating procedure  would imply a double biasing, I suppose Aiming for 3 percent would  be biasing it in favor of higher interest rates and then you would  take out a little more insurance by raising the borrowing level I  think mechanically that's the way it comes out   Well, in the money supply sense you [can]  call that a bias That would be [a bias] for the quarter I guess  it's only a 2- to 3-week bias in the sense of higher interest rates   M R   PARTEE But if we put in 3 percent for the money supply  for September to December, Phil, given the fact that we can't affect  October--assume it comes in at 4-1/2 percent--that means we are  putting in a November-December growth of about 2 percent The demand  function is still there and we can affect the supply, but it would  mean that we would be moving toward a negative number for December  That's really a very tight bias   Growth reaches the top for M2   Well, these numbers are illustrative   I don't know whether this facilitates the  discussions or not Let's for the moment concentrate only on the  money supply and the federal funds constraint Those are enough  variables to consider And we'll consider any further bias later   We can come back to the question of  scheduling the next meeting My own instinct at this point is to  delay what would have been the regular meeting for a week just to  provide another week's experience  back We'd be coming back in less than 2 weeks   My own thought is why not delay it a week  so we would have another week   Maybe we can even change that   We may not even be having a regular  meeting then   Do you mean in terms of the actual  directive? I see two things that would be in the directive One is  the money supply target, however expressed, from now to the end of the  year And the other is the federal funds constraint   M R   MAYO But with the usual lag This would not be in your  press release Monday or today   NO   Let’s worry about that later I don’t see  that we have to release it before 30 days, but we will decide that  subsequently   I think the thing to do at the moment is  just to concentrate on the money supply     10/6/79 -31 -    Well, we have to sometime; let’s discuss  the whole bias issue We can [talk about] both the funds rate range  and the money supply   Well, I’ll let that go I won’t get into  that technical point of whether we bias the operation--since the  reserves of the forthcoming week are already in the bag--during that  week   No, I think the answer is that we [start  with higher] borrowings that first week We start, even though we  know we can’t affect the level of reserves that week   M R   BLACK We can affect deposits in that week, even though  we are addressing the reserve needs of two weeks hence   We might affect deposits in that week   M R   BLACK And that‘s really what we are after, so I don‘t  really think [money supply growth] is in the bag for October, Chuck   M R   COLDWELL I don’t either   Well, it’s a matter of degree We have  two proposals one for 3 percent M1 growth and one for 46 percent   M R   MAYO I would like to throw a third one on the table  I’d make it 4 percent I think we need to shade it, but I don’t want  to shade it as much as Phil suggested   M R   BLACK I’m getting confused here Are you talking about  the September--   Just compare the third from the right  column on the bottom table with the column at the left on the top  table The target ranges are given at the top of page 3 and the  growth for the year is given at the bottom of page 3   Well, there is a target range for M1, M2,  and M3 Just write them down along side the growth for the year in  the upper half of the target ranges They are 3 to 6 percent for M1;  5 to 8 percent for M2; and 6 to 9 percent for M3 So [growth for the  year] is right at the top of the range for M2 and somewhat below the  top, but in the upper half, of the ranges for M1 and M3   From September through December   The operational one is September to  December, even though that doesn’t assure precisely that quarterly  average   I think the only number we can concentrate  on operationally is the one for September through December, given the     10/6/79 - 4 0 -    figures that have been shown here in the memo We can make a precise  arithmetic computation at lunch if we want to, I’m sure Obviously,  the lower that figure is, the more it takes a little off the annual  growth rate   Just interpolate   I don’t think that’s right because a very  small change in the growth rate for the year has a very big effect on  the growth rate for the September-to-December period And it’s that  latter period that we are dealing with here   You just have to interpolate If you went  all the way down to 13 percent [for September to December] you would  be at 45 percent [for the year] So if you want to aim half way  between [the two figures shown], the annual growth is going to be  exactly half way between 4  5  and 53 percent   Let me note that we have other instruments  for biasing at the start, including the discount rate that the Board  is going to have to decide upon here If we raise the discount rate  substantially, we are going to get an upward movement in the funds  rate in the short run   Given a moment of hesitancy here let me  make a suggestion, at least tentatively Nothing is solid I just  want to move on Let’s assume 46 percent for the moment, or 45 if  you want a round number There i s  obviously a good deal of concern  that that is too high and a good deal of concern about what will  happen in the short run We can accept that But in the interest of  getting [the full] picture, if tentatively we say 46 percent, there  is a lot of interest both in biasing [the outome in] the short run and  in biasing the possible errors in the direction of not exceeding 46  percent because that indeed is getting pretty close to the upper end  of the annual target So let’s proceed on that basis for a moment and  go to the federal funds range   Well, I think that’s obvious   I didn’t want to get into that question  I would assume that if we take the discount rate to 12 percent--unless  we have a reverse bias in terms of the borrowings--that the federal  funds rate is going to go up in the neighborhood of 1 percentage point  under normal relationships   Now, whether any relationship is normal in  this period, who knows? But I think that’s the best guess one could  make and that would introduce the bias in the short run   I agree These things are very hard to  [separate]   Well, we have to discuss that Obviously,  all these things have to be decided But for myself, when I look at  this potential package, I think there is enough risk of confusion in     10/6/79 -42-   the announcement that an increase in the discount rate of 1 percentage  point would be highly salutary in terms of our immediate objective  Intellectually, though, you can argue the other point I just don't  know whether we want to take the risk in the initial announcement of a  possible interpretation that we don't really mean it That's the  problem that I see   Well, maybe it's easier if we [discuss]  all the [aspects] Let me tell you what the Board has been discussing  on reserve requirements What I would presume the Board members will  agree upon is a packaging together of all managed liabilities, with  all its difficulties That would include CDs, federal funds for non-  members, repurchase agreements, Eurodollar takings--this is all very  difficult technical business One proposal is to make a basket of all  those liabilities, establish a base date in September, and then  [impose] a marginal reserve requirement of some size--some size  meaning in a range of 5 to 10 percent--on any increase in the basket  We've discussed also [imposing a reserve requirement] on total  outstanding managed liabilities   For purposes of discussion, and to get the whole picture out,  assume a target of 45 or 46 percent for the money supply number  Assume the increase in the discount rate, which itself biases this  initially and has the announcement effect as well Also assume Phil  Coldwell's initial federal funds constraint and a moderate assumption  on the borrowings for 2 or 3 weeks of the nature he suggested, which  involves very little change from the current level of borrowings   Let's say $12 billion to $15 billion I  would feel quite differently, frankly, about that borrowing level  without a discount rate change I think we would probably lose too  much without the discount rate change Without the discount rate  change I'd put in a much bigger bias on the borrowing side initially,  in effect, to force the discount rate change very quickly But the  more I think about it, the other way of doing it--announcing a  discount rate change with the package--seems much safer With that  kind of initial discount rate change, I think we can be relatively  moderate in biasing on the borrowing It wouldn't immediately force  another discount rate change So, that's somewhat of a "family" [of  potential actions]   Yes, for purposes of discussion   Well, in those circumstances, I think the  probability of going to 11-1/2 percent is negligible   M R   MAYO Sure   Phil probably figured it out The 11-1/2  to 14-1/2 would probably make the range symmetrical around the best  guess of where the actual funds rate might go in the short run   M R   COLDWELL It‘s a 13 percent midpoint   Let me say again that if we adopt this  technique, I don’t think we can be at all sure where the fed funds  rate will go in the very short run   And it doesn’t matter all that much   M R   WALLICH It would disavow us   No   Well, that‘s an important point--not so  much for a decision today, but looking toward the future   Well, we have a real conflict here in  terms of the way we want to place our risks I must say that pretty  consistently in my own thinking I come down on the side of not wanting  to let this federal funds rate go out of sight by accident in the  initial stages Now, that’s a matter of judgment And the general  tenor of the plan, of course, is to take whatever punishment--if  that’s what it is--quickly and get it over with so rates can come down  and that’s an offset For once let’s get ahead of the market  expectation in a sense and get in a position to [move rates] down,  which is the other side of the coin But we are going into unknown  territory and there is a limit as to where my own sangfroid gives out  here   Understand that even with this kind of  constraint, on an individual day it might well be [outside the range]   SEVERAL Oh, sure   Let me ask a question Are we very  closely in the ball park here?   SEVERAL Yes   Why not stop for lunch?   I don't mean wander away for lunch Let's  take 10 minutes and come back to the table   SPEAKER(?) Where is lunch?   SPEAKER(?) Next door   [Lunch recess]   Let's try to reach some consensus on what  the proposal should be like if we do it [under the old method] And  if we have a consensus on both of those, we could just vote up or down  on which approach we like better, with as many people feeling  comfortable about [our decision] as humanly possible I think you can  assume there will be a discount rate of 12 percent I should say   A 1 percentage point increase Under  those circumstances, let me modify my proposal slightly We work with  a 4  6  or 45 percent target for M1, recognizing that people would  rather see M1 growth come in somewhat lower, certainly, than higher  But that to us is a satisfactory target In an uncertain world, all  other things equal, the money market nice and equitable, expectations  changing nicely, things settling down, it's possible we would feel  better if it came in below than if we were embarrassed by it being too  high We have a discount rate of 12 percent We have the reserve  requirement change, which I think will be 8 percent, on a basket of  managed liabilities That is about equivalent to an added cost of 1  percent on those [liabilities] That's the effect that has,  mechanically I don't know what that does to the prime rate, but [the  added cost to banks] is just marginal If the banks want to be mean--  I've got to speak to the MA--they raise the prime rate and say that's  our marginal cost of funds If they want to be reasonable, they don't  because that cost is only going to apply to a very small amount at the  margin I would be inclined to tell them at the ABA that they  shouldn't reach forever on the interest rate That sounds like a good  idea   In and of itself, I think [all] that means some increase in  the federal funds rate How much of an increase? Although this  scenario only puts the discount rate at about or slightly above the  current federal funds rate, it nonetheless, all other things equal,  puts some upward pressure on the federal funds rate In terms of the  range, Phil suggested 11-1/2 to 14-1/2 percent As I told you, it  makes me nervous to think of [the rate] going up and getting locked in  at a higher level But if you want to put the upper end higher, I  reserve the right to consult if the funds rate were to begin getting  up that high We could have that understanding I am not talking  about for a day; I think it would be fine if it went there for a day  or a bit beyond   Yes That's what would appear in the  formal record, whether or not we consulted later Then in starting  off, I would suggest a mild further bias I think the discount rate     10/6/79 -46-   in a sense is a bias to start with, at least to get the federal funds  rate up And there’s a bias in the sense that these projections, if  they mean anything, are based upon a lower level of interest rates  So by getting the interest rate up we’ve biased it some already I  would suggest a mild further bias--for about 2 weeks maybe--and I  could express that in one of two ways We just take the operating  flexibility depending upon how things develop  as a slightly higher level of borrowings, as we discussed before But  even that I don’t think is necessarily essential, if as things  developed it appeared that the federal funds rate in fact was settling  down around 13 percent plus or minus In other words, I’m saying  let’s bias it enough, if we have to, to get that kind of federal funds  rate originally if it doesn’t go up there by itself Or, if it goes  beyond that by itself, we probably don’t need any bias in the  borrowing component Now, that’s just going to be a matter of  judgment in this early period Peter is looking quizzical and  wondering how he can make all these judgments every day And he might  miss Inherent in this operating procedure is the possibility that  the rate might be much higher or lower   It could be expressed   We would be biased toward a slightly  higher level of borrowing unless we found the funds rate going to 14,  15 percent If that appeared to be happening, we just wouldn’t bias  it at that point That should be consistent with all these  relationships, though it would never work out in practice on a weekly  basis Doing nothing else should bring the federal funds rate to  around 13 percent, but who knows what will happen in this jumpy  market   I think that would be the initial  assumption But if the funds rate goes up well beyond the 13 percent  area, and if we still had time in the week, I think you would reverse  the bias   Don't forget, there is estimating in this  procedure We don't know from day to day what the level of borrowing  is going to be for the week, particularly when there's so much of it  on the last day So what we are looking at is some guess of what the  borrowing is going to be for the week Peter might be sitting there  without all that much borrowing initially in the week with the federal  funds rate very high but his projection could show that there are  going to be huge excess reserves accumulated by Wednesday and that the  federal funds rate should come way down on Wednesday What I'm saying  is that if he's in that situation, even though we don't have much  reported borrowing at that stage, if the fed funds rate is way high in  the range we don't bias it so much   Higher than 13 percent?   Yes, it might go the other way, in which  case we would retain the bias None of this is going to be cleared up  until the end of the statement week; that's the nature of it I think  you ought to have a better estimate than usual of what the borrowings  will be this week because you know what the total reserves are going  to be, given that they are based on deposits two weeks earlier But  you still [don't know] the distribution of reserves in the banking  system or what excess reserves are going to be   Well, you can't even tell what the  borrowings are going to be because you don't know what excess reserves  are going to be   Oh, I don't know what we do in these two  days   Play it by ear the first two days And  one of those two days is a Wednesday, so--   Well, we have a request for a [discount  rate] increase of 1 percentage point, so the Board can act And I  still don’t know whether we are going to be making this announcement  this afternoon or not If we are, I don’t know what you can do [about  contacting your directors] on Saturday, anyway If we are not going  to announce until Monday, I still don‘t know what you can do because I  don’t know whether we want to--   SPEAKER(?) We can get them on Sunday   M F t   MAYO We could probably get some of them, but with it  being a long weekend in Chicago--   Let’s come back to that at the end; let’s  finish this meeting Is that broadly agreeable as an alternative  package?   The aggregates are the ones on the right-  hand side of page 3, recognizing that we’d rather miss on the low side  than the high side   The alternative, it seems to me--though we  could fiddle around with the percentages--would be basically the same  We‘d do the same reserve requirement change We’d do the same with  the discount rate And then we‘d move the federal funds rate  basically to 13 percent, and put a 12-1/2 to 13-1/2 percent range on  it, say We could operate a bit more flexibly than we have before to  the extent that that’s possible, borrowing a little from what we’re  talking about in the new technique But we’d have a much tighter     10/6/79 - 4 9 -    constraint [on the funds rate1 relative to what we just talked about  on the new technique   Yes, the reserve requirement [change would  be the same] I think that’s essentially it I don’t think I left  anything out here [relating to the provision of] reserves   I think the same We’ve got to have a  money supply target, which I presume would be the same However, any  of those [targets] could be altered   No, the same as in package number 1 So  it‘s a longer time horizon [for the money supply target] than we would  ordinarily have And if that objective is stated another way, it  would have to be interpreted that if [money growth] were running ahead  of this track, we would use the upper part of the 12-1/2 to 13-/12  percent range we are talking about And if it’s running below, we’d  use the lower part of the range I say again that I think the  difference largely comes down to the constraint we are putting on the  fed funds rate That course of action would be very much preferred by  our friends elsewhere in the city, in terms of the general framework  I don’t think it makes a lot of difference, actually, as we modified  the other approach I don’t want to make a federal case out of this,  but it’s nevertheless true I’ve just tried to state here what I  think is more or less the equivalent in immediate market impact I  suppose you could say that we should be a little tougher in the  conventional package to [equalize] the psychological effects that we’d  get from the talk about the reserve target   Remember that one of the dangers of the  approach we have been talking about is that we may miss the target  anyway, and we are a little less vulnerable to that with the  conventional approach The problem wouldn‘t disappear if we missed  the targets either way But without going through the rigmarole of a  new dedication to [achieving] them we are a little less vulnerable  Maybe I ought to put that federal funds rate that I talked about a  little higher to make the [two alternatives] fully equivalent, say,  1/2 point or 1/4 point higher We could talk about that   These are basically the two propositions we have before us  What I want to know is if there is a strong preference--it doesn‘t  have to be unanimous--for one of them Let’s first take our famous  preference [poll] Let me say the second one would be a little  tighter on the federal funds rate than I suggested earlier--[by moving  it] at least to 13 percent or a little over 13 percent to make the  psychological impact equivalent How many would prefer the  traditional approach? This is a matter of preference   Well, we will take everyone now Raise  your hand if you prefer the present method Does everybody else  prefer the other or--?   Hold up your hands a little higher, even  if you don't feel strongly   All right HOW many would prefer the  other alternative? Is that everybody else?   There is quite clearly a great majority  who want the new technique Now let me ask the question slightly  differently How many feel strongly about this? I doubt that anybody  thinks it's a matter of life or death but I just want to see how  strong the sentiment is   SPEAKER(?) I think it's big   Who has a strong preference for moving in  the new direction?   You're in that camp, Nancy?   Now, let's look at the voting members  Who has a strong preference?   Did you count Nancy in or out?   Well, I guess that's strong enough that we  ought to go with it   I will just give you my interpretation of  a non-mechanical [application], as I put it from the beginning, of the  new technique The difference isn't all that dramatic There will be  more emphasis on [the new technique] in the press announcement because  it will be, in effect, a warning that the federal funds rate is going  to be permitted to fluctuate over a wider range Of course, we can  say that in either announcement, but it will be said a little more  strongly [with the announcement of the new operating method]   Oh, I said we would have to widen the  ranges on the alternative [technique]   Let me, for my [information], put it the  other way I just want to get a sense of this Suppose we used the  conventional approach; the range might be stated formally as 1  percentage point in width But suppose I also said that in practice  right now, as we usually say, we are going to aim for 13-1/4 percent  and we are not going to move that from day to day or week to week  unless there's a strong indication from the aggregates I mean  literally it's what we do now How many people would find that  acceptable or would prefer that? Maybe nobody, but I just want to get  a feel of that   M R   WALLICH You mean announce that rate?   No, do it just the way we do now The  market would be looking at Peter's actions over the next 3 days to  find out that he was intervening at 13-3/8 percent on the up side and  13 percent on the down side   M R   MAYO Ugh! We lose any--1 hate to use the word--drama   That's interesting Is everybody saying  that they don't like that?   We have a tentative directive written,  which is quite general as you can imagine [That is being distributed  to you now] We can vote on the directive   Specifications, too   The announcement will say that   Well, I’d be reluctant to fine-tune too  much here That is why I suggest 4-1/2 percent, recognizing that if  market developments permit and if there are opportunities to get [Ml  growth] somewhat below that without pressing the limits of our funds  ranges, we ought to take them   Let me just suggest this Why don't we  put in the directive at this point that we now estimate the ATS and  NOW account effect at about 1-112 percent, which would make the  equivalent range for M1 3 to 6 percent I'm going to have to say that  in the press conference, anyway   We could do that Whatever way, this is  not specifically in the directive is it?   That's the release that comes out about a  month [after the meeting]?   It's 11-1/2 to 15-1/2 as Nancy suggested,  with a clear warning to you that you may get a call for a consultation  if the rate gets up there   Why? Oh, because of the "around" 4-1/2?   I think we are dancing on a pin a little  bit here   We are going to be awfully delighted if we  come in any place within these ranges   By all means, that is kept strictly  confidential   M E   KIMBREL Mr Chairman, we seem to be getting close  together and I sure would hate to have my friend Mr Roos cast my vote  [as my alternate] but I have to leave and I just want to vote   I think we are ready to vote We are  voting specifically on this directive Those blanks are to be filled  in with 11-1/2 to 15-1/2 and I think we write in the sentence there  about consultation when the funds rate is "in the upper part of the  range" or something vague like "toward the top *'   Toward the top And I think what we mean  by that is something like 14-1/2 percent We are talking about 4-1/2  percent "permitted," if you will Obvious we'd rather have less, if  things develop so that we can do it without putting untoward pressure  on market rates And what we are saying clearly is that if this money  demand function collapses we'd be delighted to come in below 4-1/2  percent It is not going to collapse before we meet again   Well, let's just get this vote over with  I believe you understand this slight bias in the way we play that We  are thinking of a federal funds rate ideally in the 13 percent plus  range, initially That would be a highly satisfactory response, but  we don't have any close control over it--it could be more or less--and  that would affect our biasing decisions I think we are ready for a  vote   Well, I very much appreciate this  discussion I think it was important We do have a press release  prepared by Joe Coyne I would like to insert in the press release--  and I just want to ask your advice on it--that the Committee voted  unanimously on this   M R   MAYO I think you should   END OF MEETING    	791006meeting      Gentlemen, I think we'll proceed just by  having Mr Axilrod update us And then Mr Sternlight and Mr Pardee  can make any comments they think are appropriate   M R   AXILROD Mr Chairman, since the Committee set its  original objectives for the monetary aggregates [under the new  program] at its previous meeting, the basic aggregates have been  running very strong That is, the Committee set an objective for  [growth in1 M1 from September to December on the order of 4-l/2  percent at an annual rate; and the accompanying M2 growth that would  be the consistent with that was an annual rate of about 7-1/2 percent  Achievement of these objectives would be consistent, on our estimates,  with growth in the monetary base over that period of about 8 percent,  growth of total reserves of about 7 percent, and of nonborrowed  reserves of around 5-3/4 percent Based on data thus far in October--  that is, data through October 17, with the last week being  preliminary-Ml looks as if it's on a path where its growth in October  will be at an annual rate of about 143 percent and M2 looks as if  it's growing at an annual rate of 136 percent Growth in M3 is  somewhat slower but still high, at an annual rate of 104 percent  Those deposit figures, if they don't change, would imply growth in the  monetary base of something like 112 percent and growth in total  reserves on the order of 20 percent   In the face of that demand for reserves, therefore, to hold  nonborrowed reserves down in the short run would require a substantial  rise in borrowings from the levels that had prevailed early this month  and even from the $1-1/2 billion dollar level that the Committee had  anticipated when it moved to this new program   Mr Chairman, I won't bother the Committee with the various  technicalities that, of course, will be made clear in the Bluebook for  the next meeting 1 would just note that the implied level of  borrowing over the balance of this month needed to hold growth in  nonborrowed reserves for September to December down to a rate not far  from the 6 percent or perhaps even less that the Committee desired  would be on the order of $25 to $29 billion That level of  borrowing would depend on certain technical factors that we adjust for  in the paths We have moved some toward achieving that level of  borrowing already, with borrowing on Friday for all member banks at  $31 billion But, of course, that has been with a substantial rise  in the federal funds rate--to around 15 percent on average on Friday,  but with some trading at much higher rates This morning, as Peter  will undoubtedly note, the funds rate was much higher than 15 percent,  opening in the 17 to 18 percent range The implication of these  figures, Mr Chairman, is that it may be very difficult, if not  impossible, to achieve the objectives in the very short run for the  base and total reserves It is more possible in the short run to  achieve the objective for nonborrowed reserves But these  developments bring into question whether the informal 14-1/2 percent  funds rate constraint or the more formal 15-1/2 percent upper limit     10/22/79 -2-   adopted by the Committee at its last meeting are viable in this  situation   Mr Sternlight   Mr Pardee   Well, we have some obvious facts, the  first one being that the money supply ran much higher in the last two  weeks than we‘d contemplated at the time of the [October 61 meeting  And that has had a predictable effect on the reserve base that is  required during the current week and during the next week It implies  high borrowings in order to stay on the nonborrowed reserve track, as  Steve suggested One reason the money supply is so high may be that  business [activity] is doing better than we contemplated, which gives  us more demand for money than we were really counting on at this  point But those figures are high enough so that it does at least  raise the question about the feasibility of our targets   We have forced borrowing higher, as has been indicated And  on Friday we did have a sizable reserve miss, as Peter suggested,  which meant that [the funds market] was even tighter than we had  contemplated It seems to me that under the Committee decision we may  or may not face an inconsistency here shortly With the reserve miss,  it appears that we have more money to put into the market this week  And I would contemplate that that be done if the federal funds rate  stays above the area that we were talking about--the 15-1/2 percent  area or what Steve called the formal decision, which [in fact] was the  formal decision Whether we can expect the rate to go down to 14-1/2  percent I suppose is the operative question this morning, but we can  always take a new decision on the upper limit I would not  contemplate that at this point I think, at least for this week, we     10/22/79 -4-    cannot reasonably contemplate going down deliberately to 14-1/2  percent without perhaps undermining the efforts that we have been  making   So I would just leave this as a preliminary comment to which  you can react That we will not operate, at the moment anyway, on the  14-1/2 percent [informal] limit but will continue to operate in  general terms at the 15-1/2 percent [formal limit] That, as you  recall, is not interpreted as a daily limit but there will be an  effort to avoid something significantly higher than that for a week as  a whole And it will probably take us a couple of days at least to  find out whether we do have an inconsistency problem or not for the  week--for the current week, which will then be past We could face  the same problem for another week, given the strength of the money  supply two weeks ago Whether we are now passing through the peak I  think depends greatly upon what happens to the money supply figures  that we won’t have until Thursday We just have to wait and see on  that We will have a real problem, I think, if [money growth1 remains  high If it begins coming down, [rates] will begin easing off, at  least temporarily That is where we stand   Why don‘t I just let the rest of you comment, turning to the  people here in Washington first Governor Schultz indicates that he  has no comments   That completes everybody here Oh, Frank  Morris is sitting at this table, so we'll let him lead off as District  number one anyway   M R   MORRIS Well, what has happened confirms my feeling that  it's going to be very difficult for us to execute control of reserves  with a lagged reserve system I think we really ought to put our  minds to eliminating what seems to me an obvious and big handicap to  the successful operation of this new system And we also need to  figure out a greatly liberalized carry-over system to make the change  palatable to the banks It seems to me that reacting two weeks later  and having our reserve levels determined by deposits two weeks earlier  is continually just going to foul us up in this operation   If I may just interject a comment We are   The carry-over in effect is  looking at that I'm not sure it makes quite that much difference,  particularly if we have a big carry-over  a substitute for this lag we're working with now But I certainly  agree that psychologically it looks awkward--always dealing with a  reserve base that is predetermined from what happened to deposits two  weeks earlier   It makes for an awful tight market when we  do Why don’t we go through the Districts in order We’ve had  District 1 I don’t know [who is representing] District 2     District 3   Thank you District 4   There is one announced for Wednesday it’s  more than a little technical problem, I suspect   District 5   District 6     So what are we up to--District 7?   District 8     I will respond to that later District 9     District 10   Mr Baughman   No 12   Well, let me make a few additional  comments First of all, I think we have not had a [formal] meeting  here, as I understand it We have had a consultation and the sense of  the [discussion] is that the 15-1/2 percent [funds rate limit] still  holds in the absence of a formal decision to overturn that We may or  may not have to consult further, depending upon what happens over the  rest of this week We have no guarantee that we will hit these  [objectives] exactly, especially when we realize that [the funds rate]  may be over [our range] on particular days and if those days come at  the end of the week and the average is close to 15-1/2 percent, [the  higher rate on] those days might carry it over But I think that is  implicit in our decision already I suspect Governor Partee‘s comment  that the rate was below 15-1/2 percent for the first four days of the  week means that it’s at least possible to get through this week  without going over [the range on average] and without deviating, very  sharply anyway, from our nonborrowed reserves path I would remind  you of what both Steve and Peter said We are now a bit below it  Peter may not be able to do $3-1/2 billion [of reserve-supplying  operations] every day, but presumably if the numbers don’t change, he  can do something today and in the ensuing days He can do something  more today and have some [room] left over for the ensuing days and  remain within the general paths that we set for ourselves   So far as the discount rate comments are concerned, I  recognize their relevance I also recognize that if we raise the     1 0 / 2 2 / 7 9  -9 -    discount rate right now, that would push market rates up further and I  do not feel terribly [anxious to see1 that right at the moment It  obviously has to be kept under review But at a time when we are  threatening to exceed the upper limit of the fed funds range--if that  remains true without changing the upper limit--I’m not sure that a  discount rate change would be helpful at the moment in reconciling our  various objectives   There have been a lot of comments about credibility, which I  well recognize I think we also have to recognize that market  behavior, whether one looks at the stock market or the bond market,  has not ignored short-term movements in the fed funds rate during this  particular period Any presumption that the whole market does not  reflect day-to-day movements of the fed funds rate for this particular  period is not very valid because I think we are in a learning period  and all the markets have learned so far is that rates go up They  haven‘t had much experience on the down side as yet; presumably they  will get some at some point But it is those big money supply figures  that we are fighting at the moment and perhaps for a week or so the  markets won‘t have much experience--or at least very dramatic  experience--on the down side I do think that raises the possibility  of overkill as well as credibility We have to keep both sides of the  equation in mind and it‘s a very difficult period to steer through   Let me say something about discount window administration,  too There was a comment in the Wall Street Journal this morning  which I think carried to the typical reader the implication that we’ve  tightened up [at the window] That is not my understanding of the  situation at the moment It should not be the situation We are  getting more borrowing than we’ve been used to But I don‘t think we  want to convey a message at the moment that the discount window is any  more closed than it has been Rather specifically, I think one or two  or perhaps even three days of sizable borrowing is not something that  should provoke a phone call [from us to the borrowing bank] under  these particular circumstances This is also something that we have  to review, along with the discount rate, as we get into a little more  normal period   S o  far as the comments on giving the market more information  are concerned, I am not suite sure what the implications of that are  and what the meaning is Part of the difficulty of our operations at  the moment is that we have more targets than we can meet already For  instance, specifying a total reserve target or a total reserve base  target, knowing that borrowings are an important variable here, may or  may not lend a lot confidence to market participants I would think  there should be some sense in the market--and perhaps that can be  encouraged--that nonborrowed reserves are an important variable But  even there it is very hard to specify a target because presumably we  would want to be tighter, 4s was explained at the meeting on  nonborrowed reserves, if borrowings were persistently high So we are  kind of caught between the devil and the deep blue sea on some of  this And at the moment at least, I cannot quite see myself sitting  down and giving an explanation to the market that would be reassuring  rather than disturbing, given that we are playing with at least three  reserve variables Althouyh nonborrowed reserves are the immediate  operating variable, that in itself is not a fixed target depending  upon what else goes on So I’m not sure we can provide a lot of  reassurance beyond the kind of money supply figure that we’ve already     10/22/79 -10   given them It seems to me that a major source of uncertainty in the  market is simply that the money supply is running so much above the  more moderate rate of growth that we would like to see between now and  the end of the year That will cure itself or not, depending upon  what the next few money supply figures are At least that is my  present view-of this matter   To summarize, we will be aiming--hopefully consistently--for  the nonborrowed reserves path consistent with the money supply targets  that we talked about That leaves some leeway on the borrowing side  The fact that that path is so far below actuality is forcing a great  deal of borrowing and forcing a lot of pressure on the market We can  stop this session on the hope that the upper limit of the funds range  that the Committee decided upon will prove at least marginally  consistent with that target [path] and we can consult again as  necessary in a few days or a week if the inconsistency is more evident  than it is this morning   That I do agree with and it should have  been indicated at the press conference in New York on Thursday I  thought it was but I agree that it wasn't picked up much Was that  point made at the press conference?   Well, it's hard to make a special occasion  to announce that But I think all of us ought to have that in mind in  whatever comments we make to people in the market or otherwise   Well, I wouldn't exaggerate that too much  I think the fact that they are high and that it's hard to bend them  down is the principal factor rather than that [the increase] took  place on October 10 And we face the uncertainty that Governor Partee  mentioned He just said to me across the table What do we do if the  money supply figures are high in the next published week? I think two  points can be made The point that you made, Bob, can be mentioned in  any contacts we have And we ought to reiterate--as I have in my  public appearances or when the question has arisen or when I jarmned it  into the conversation--that whatever the technique we use, these money  supply figures don't respond automatically There is  leeway in the  borrowing, and in the long run I think it's probably good for the     10/22/79 -11-   economy that there is a certain amount of slippage even though it’s  awkward to us at the moment   Any other comments? Okay, thank you We may be consulting  again fairly shortly, but we’ll see how the rest of this week goes   END OF SESSION        The meeting will come to order We need  approval of the minutes for [the previous] two meetings If anyone  would like to so move--   Without objection, we shall approve the  minutes of the two meetings M r   Pardee   Do you have any recommendations with  respect to operations, Mr Pardee?   Any comments?   Without objection, we shall approve it  Now you have another recommendation?   Any discussion? If not, we need a  motion I guess we need a motion before the discussion   SPEAKER(?) So move   SPEAKER(?) Second   Any objections? If not, we will approve  it Having approved recommendations for the future, we better ratify  the transactions for the past Do I have a motion to that effect?   SPEAKER ( ? )   So move  If there are no objections, we shall   approve them I’d like to say that the question has arisen as to  whether the Japanese--the yen has been weak, as you know--may want to  draw on their swap [line with us] We have given them a preliminary  indication that in a moderate amount of, say, $ 3 0 0  million that would     11/20/79 -5-   be all right I don‘t know if they will draw or not because the yen  has strengthened a bit; I don‘t know whether there’s been any  subsequent strengthening It‘s the other side of the Iranian  situation; I suppose that‘s the reason it has strengthened So I  don’t know what sense of urgency there is now Do you?   They have something like in  reserves as I recall, so they’re not exactly out of money   Well, it has been offered; whether it  will be used, I don’t know Mr Sternlight   M R   STERNLIGHT [Statement--see Appendix]   Any other discussion? Is there a motion  to approve the transactions?   SPEAKER(?) So moved   SPEAKER(?) Second   Without objection, they are approved We  have Mr Truman and Mr Kichline on the economic situation today--the  [extended] horizons of the American economy Mr Truman   What are you assuming about the oil price  decision in December?   You said a 23 percent increase or  something from this December to next December   What are you assuming, say, in February  or March for import prices?   So you're not assuming much impact in  December?   We will be fortunate if it is that small   Proceed   M R   TRUMAN [Statement continued]   Let me ask a question You say the  current account is essentially in a zero position this year In the  way we used to calculate the current account a couple years ago it  would be what?   It’s a $15 billion difference   Well, I’m a little confused Are you  saying a 40 percent increase in imported oil prices will bring a 1-1/2  percent increase in GNP prices?   What percentage of the GNP is oil now?   m KICHLINE I don’t know The deflators in the energy  sector in GNP are about 8 percent   1 still don’t understand this oil price  business If the weight is 8 percent and you get a 40 percent [price]  increase, that’s more than 3 percent of GNP Why doesn’t it have a 3  percent impact on GNP?   You still haven’t included any indirect  effects?   M R   KICHLINE That‘s right And in our forecasting  exercise they carry well into 1981   You really have to get a pretty big  decline in consumption in November and December to make this come out  right, don't you?   M R   KICHLINE NO, I think our forecast is that if we get  zero to a 1/4 percent increase in retail sales in November and  December, we will hit this number   M R   PARTEE If you get what? What was the number?   M R   KICHLINE A quarter of a percent increase in total  retail sales excluding autos We have a separate auto forecast  That's nominal   In nominal terms   Perhaps we can have Mr Axilrod's  statement and then we'll have a coffee break   Well, you've given us something to chew  on other than a donut!   That's not saying that that couldn't be  changed   These all also assume we get a weak  number in the next published weekly figure, which we don't know The  preliminary figure shows a decline of $2 billion?   If it came out substantially above that,  all these growth rates would have to be smaller between now and the  end of the year   You're saying that if we continue that  rate--sort of--for February and March, the first quarter would be 6  percent above the fourth quarter?     ll/20/79 -11-   M R   AXILROD It might I don't know the exact February and  March [pattern] but it would be somewhere around there They could  be, depending on how the averages work out   "B" is the 4-1/2--   In the future, as we said yesterday, I  think it would be helpful to spell this out with a little more  precision over a longer period of time This is related to when we  next meet and we might just think about that a bit My inclination at  the moment is that we might as well meet again in December and  consider [our targets for] next year in a preliminary way--not all of     11/20/79 -18-   next year but I'd look at this in a context of at least through the  first quarter And we can't do that very well without some  preliminary notions about what that whole year should be But then in  February, we've got to decide about the year Now we could change the  date of the meeting and make it after Christmas and early in January,  I suppose S o ,  think about that   By that time I presume we'll have  complicated it all by having a new definition of the money supply   So it's going to be a little complicated  to say the least Well, let's have a coffee break   [Coffee break]   I would like to go around the table and  get some general discussion of the economic situation and at least a  preliminary statement of policy  specifics I remind you that Steve expressed the dilemma very well  One can argue that from the standpoint of domestic business activity  it would be nice to get some fairly early declines in interest rates,  to the extent we can do that consistent with the general framework of  the money supply decisions we made On the other hand, [that's not  the case] from the standpoint of inflationary expectations--which I  don't think have changed so much--and from the standpoint particularly  of the unrest in Iran adding to the possibilities of turbulence in the  oil markets and an oil price decision that we are not going to like  That is the major risk we are running and not just in a narrow sense  It's a major risk the country is running and the world is running To  the extent we can have any marginal influence on that, it points in  the other direction [for policy] So there certainly is a dilemma in  the next few weeks   Then we will focus hard on policy   Let me say that I think you ought to have in mind this  conundrum regarding the [next] Committee meeting The 18th [of  December, our next scheduled meeting date,] is the day after OPEC  meets, which is fine if OPEC has made a decision It's fine in one  sense, although it is obviously very early The chances of OPEC  meeting on the 17th and making a decision on the 17th are probably not  very high So it will leave us in a state of suspended animation on  that day Moreover, I don't think we will be in a position then to  have absorbed all the distinctions of new and old money supply  definitions and all the rest, looking forward to next year There is  the alternative of meeting on Tuesday, the 8th of January The 8th,  9th or 10th of January [are possibilities] If we did that, then  presumably whatever decision we make here--subject obviously to an  interim meeting--is not just for the remainder of November and     11/20/79 -19-   December but carries through to the early part of January, by  implication, as well We’ll turn to that again later but I think it  may have a little bearing on precisely what we do here The dates are  not ideal; at least the December 18th date isn’t ideal for the two  reasons that I suggested On the other hand it’s not at all  impossible; it is scheduled, so we can proceed on that basis, too   Let’s get any general comments you have on the economy and  the policy implications you see for it Would anybody like to offer  any comments? Governor Coldwell   Mr Willes   Mr Baughman   M R   BAUGHMAN M r   Chairman, I would say with respect to a  general economic forecast that I would subscribe to what Mark Willes  has said as to the probable low value [any forecast] would have in the  present circumstances It seems to me that the staff projection is a  reasonable one I would not be surprised if [the economy] actually     11/20/79 -21-   goes down more in the early part of next year than the staff has  projected, particularly in the measure of industrial production, for  example But I'm not sure [that prospect1 should weigh heavily in our  policy posture today   With respect to our region, of course, we have benefited in  terms of local activity from the oil and gas business; the level of  that activity is high and is continuing to rise  that, of course, domestic production of oil is declining and I'm  advised that the rate of decline will probably accelerate next year  because the Alaskan line will have reached capacity AS it has been  moving to capacity, it has given us an increase or has offset  reductions elsewhere this year So the outlook for continued growth  of domestic sources apparently is somewhat bleak With respect to  softening in economic activity locally, insofar as there is any  softening it seems to be traceable to usury interest rate ceilings  AS nearly as we can tell from fragmentary information, the banks are  doing a pretty good job of looking across the array of customers, as  you suggested they should do, Mr Chairman, in adjusting to the  current situation and they are trying to avoid just lopping off large  sectors of borrowers   Notwithstanding   Moving from the economic picture to the policy picture, I'm  [about] right on track with what Phil Coldwell has suggested I read  [the materials for this meeting] rather carefully, I thought, and I  listened rather intently to Mr Axilrod's comments Accepting the  proposition that we probably should continue the present policy for  the time being, it seemed to me that alternative C came a little  closer to that than the alternative B prescription Obviously,  there's not a big difference but on balance it seemed to me to come  out that way   M r   Timlen   M R   TIMLEX I must say that in my judgment the consumer has  been a great source of strength for a long time and I think finally  that is going to turn around I'm particularly impressed by the fact  that the impact of [the cost of] heating homes in the Northeast is  going to present quite a challenge to some personal budgets and may  affect spending plans I've talked to a number of savings bankers and  country bankers in New York and New Jersey over the past few weeks  And despite the Chairman's urgings, outside of New York City at any  rate there is no mortgage money in a savings bank or small commercial  bank The banks in New Jersey and outside of New York City are even  changing their terms on consumer loans and are not taking on new  business In the state of New York currently the thrifts are very  concerned about their loss of funds outright to other investment  outlets And where they are not losing the money to other investment  outlets, they are gravely concerned about shifting money from  inexpensive savings accounts into various certificates Generally  that clouds my picture as to the strength of the consumer in the first  quarter of next year   I must say that for the first time we are hearing concerns  in New York as to the possible implications for our banking system of  either short-term or long-term withdrawals of OPEC monies from United  States banks I haven't heard that too often, but it is a matter of  some discussion I would say that from my standpoint the focus should     1 1 1 2 0 / 7 9  -22-   continue to be on inflation until we get a better reading of the  fourth quarter And I do share the concerns about the position of the  dollar in foreign exchange markets Therefore, I would stand behind  some variation of "C   Increase the federal funds rate?   Let me just pick up on one comment you  made You talked about changing policy and I guess I'd ask you what  you mean by "changing policy" The question comes up all the time  What did you mean when you said that--measuring it in terms of the  money supply?   This question is going to plague us, I  tell you   In terms of the money supply   The reason I [raise] the point is that I  think it has some relevance unfortunately for this meeting and for  every meeting, I suppose When I appear in public or in private in  the first question I get is, "Are you going to stick with it?" So I  say what "sticking with it" means I go through my song and dance  about how, particularly with this present technique, we measure it by  the money supply and that's not inconsistent at all with a decline in     11/20/79 -24-   interest rates when the economy declines, particularly if the  inflation rate is declining I have done this a dozen times in public  and dozens of times in private I was at a lunch yesterday where  there were some presumably sophisticated people who have heard me say  this in public dozens of times, or at least a half dozen times, as  well as some unsophisticated types And an unsophisticated guy asked  me "Are you going to stick with it?" I went through my song and dance  [about howl we are going to stick with it in terms of the money supply  but that doesn't mean interest rates can't come down I no sooner got  finished with this 10 to 15 minute discussion when one of the presumed  sophisticates--a member of the Washington economic press--says, "Now,  what I want to know is when are you going to change policy?" I said,  "What do you mean by changing policy?" He says, "The first time  interest rates go down" There we are   Mr Morris   M R   MORRIS Mr Chairman, we are still more pessimistic  than the staff on the projection for 1980, but they are getting a lot  closer to us We are still looking for a recession, something on the  scale of 1974-75, as the result of the three shocks that we have  going the energy shock; what I think now can be called the interest  rate shock, which is showing up in Boston in the fact that [a  borrower] can get mortgage money from the Boston savings banks--   They can?   It's a modified "C"   Mr Guffey   There are different kinds o f  [auto]  credit, [do you mean] consumer credit or dealer credit?   I understand your international reason,  but after your recital on the domestic economy why do you argue that  [case] domestically?   It's a psychology [issue]   You still get a passing grade with "D"   M R   GUFFEY With regard to modifying "C," however, I'd  maintain the federal funds range that we now have--that's 11-l/2 to  15-1/2 percent It seems to me that it would be inappropriate to  change that range If my understanding is correct, the first time the  markets or the world will see that 11-1/2 to 15-1/2 percent range will  be when we publish our policy record after this meeting It seems to  me that it's important for stability purposes to maintain that range  S o  what I would propose is that we adopt "C" with an 11-1/2 to 15-1/2  percent funds rate range rather than the one listed for "C" Lastly,  I would hope that we would not take action, as "B" would suggest, to  try to validate the 4-1/2 percent growth rate that we set in early  October for the fourth quarter, simply to try to make that come true  if implicit in that is a drop in interest rates   Mr ROOS   m ROOS M r   Chairman, I think it's important at this  stage of our deliberations [to stand] back and again ask ourselves  whether we really are aware of what we have announced publicly that we  are going to do On October 6 we announced that we are going to  change our procedures to concentrate more on the control of money  growth Our experience in the Eighth District is that that  announcement was received with almost universal approval And the  question that my associates and I get is the same one you do Is the  Fed really prepared to stick with it? One of the things that  disturbs me today as I hear the comments is whether we really have a  common understanding of what "it" is My understanding is that "it"  does not entail trying on a monthly basis to adjust what we're doing  in reaction to what are really short-term economic problems I don't  even think that "it" means doing something the week after OPEC makes a  decision--to meet that immediate need For this process to be     11/20/79 -27-    successful, we've got to recognize that we cannot operate on a day-to-  day or "micro" basis   We have to set longer-term targets; we have to announce  those targets; and we have to avoid the temptation to be nervous  Nellies if one week something happens that might frighten us I don't  mean that we blindfold ourselves and blindly stick with [our targets]  but I think we have to set longer-term targets and be prepared to do  what is necessary to achieve those longer-term targets One thing  that I think would be devastating in this regard is to feel somehow  that we will follow this [new procedure] but also worry about whether  we ought to reduce the upper limit of the fed funds rate from 15-1/2  to 14-l/2 percent That sounds as though we have taken a half step  but we are not sure where we are going   Specifically, I would recommend that we choose alternative  B, because alternative B--if I understand the staff projections [and  analysis]--coincides with what we agreed last month to do And if for  no other reason than the therapeutic value of sticking, in our first  month's reactions, with what we decided to do last month, I'd like to  see us adopt alternative B and [stay with our plan1 to seek M1 growth  of 4-1/2 percent by the end of the year Then I'd like us to project  into 1980 a specific long-term target that will be consistent with  that I believe--and if I'm wrong, we're all wrong--that our primary  responsibility is not to waffle and to ask ourselves if the aggregates  can be controlled Y o u  said, and we ratified this publicly, that yes,  we believe the aggregates can be controlled That was why we did what  we did on October 6  In my view our job now is to get the best minds  within this System, which I think includes some of our Reserve Bank  economists as well as [Board] staff, to work out these processes we  talked about yesterday so that we can demonstrate that the aggregates  can be controlled If we fall--if we retreat from what we announced  on October 6--I think [it will be] the last straw and any credibility  regarding the Federal Reserve's monetary policymaking will be lost I  really think we're on a path of no retreat I apologize for the  length of that statement, but let's understand what we've bitten off;  whether it's right or wrong, we've taken that step and the fat is in  the fire Now let's find out the best way to make it work I think  that's our mission   Governor Wallich   They only buy it at $40 a barrel!   What did you say--"C?"     11/20/79 -29-   Mr Balles   M R   BALLES I don't see any basic reason for changing the  posture that we adopted on October 6 ,  Mr Chairman With respect to  the real economy, the obvious [areas of] weakness that we observe are  housing and autos, although I must say that on the West Coast the sag  in housing has been offset by what some builders describe as a furious  pace of activity in the non-residential construction field One  encouraging sign in the housing situation in our area is that the  state's largest commercial bank and its largest savings and loan  association recently knocked off a little on their mortgage rates--  coming down a half point, though admittedly from very high levels   From [14-1/21 to 14 percent?   Now that is an encouraging sign   Mr Mayo   Mr Black   Governor Partee   Mr Winn   M R   WINN To start I’d like to commend Steve and Peter  again for their performance yesterday I hope that we can have the  second verse of modulations on the theme, whether we meet in December  or January, with the same group I thought it was an extremely  productive meeting As I indicated earlier, I am still concerned  about the shock impact versus the economic impact   First, in the mortgage market I think there will probably  be more funds available; people are being sold on the idea of paying  the present prices because these mortgages can be refinanced Unlike  our long-term Treasuries, which have call protection, the possibility  of paying a high price temporarily or at least the prospect of [the  house] being sold may lead to somewhat more mortgage money being  advanced than we contemplate at the moment   If I were to guess on the outlook for next year--and we have  not talked about fiscal policy and what that may mean--I’d say the  prospect of our forecast, as good as it may be, [materializing] is not  a very high one I don‘t know whether changes will occur early in the  year or late in the year but I suspect we will see big deviations as  economic conditions unfold   Second, I agree with Bob Black that the Iranian situation,  the Cambodian situation, and others portend shocks that are outside  the energy area but could be quite significant as we look down the  road So I’m really uncertain as to what the outlook may be Another  shock we face is the fact that we are going to change the [definitions  of the] aggregates and that‘s going to introduce another uncertainty  into the picture In view of that, I would be inclined to go with  alternative C on the aggregates measures because of the phase-in or  transitional stage I’d stay with the present federal funds range, as  in alternative B, and keep the $1-1/2 billion in borrowing   Mr Eastburn   Mr Kimbrel   Governor Schultz   You've disappointed me, Governor If you  had come out for "B" we'd have among the Committee members an exact  split of 5 "Bs," 5 "Cs," and one in between "B" and "C"   SPEAKER(?) How about that!   Noncomittee members are irresponsible!  At one point in looking at this I didn't think there was much  difference between these alternatives But I think Governor Partee  and others are right that there probably is a real difference when you  compress this into a narrow period of time Obviously the consensus,  whether it's the whole group or the voting members with some  exceptions, is a weak "B" or a strong "C"   It depends on how you define "strong"  If you would prefer, it's a strong " B "  or a weak "C" There is a  question of how to phrase this and reach a maximum consensus here I  might say in a general way that it would scare me if the federal funds  rate went up toward the 15 percent area again, considering all that is  happening I don't detect any strong "sentiment," shall I say, to  lower that upper limit But I don't like it because I do think it  would be very disturbing in terms of psychology in the markets And  our chances of getting long-term rates down in an orderly way I think  would be damaged   I think that's right if we weren't in a  phase of declining economic activity Then we could get a little  excitement in this city of ours!   On the down side?   You object to what?   Now, I agreed with your whole lecture,  Mr Mayo, that we didn't have a revolution but an evolution   That remains to be seen, I think In any  event, I believe there is something to be said for not changing these  [specifications] unless there's a reason for changing them, just in  terms of consistency with what we did earlier That's a point that  several people have made And I think literally what we did earlier  is that we said what is the equivalent of "B" but that we would not be  very disturbed if it came in somewhat below that So we would not  ease [if the aggregates were coming in] between "B" and "C" in that  sense I think that's where the center of gravity is here It's just  a question of how to express it From the standpoint of consistency  in posture for a very brief period, I put to you a proposition that we  stick with the "B" specifications but with the clear understanding  that we had last time--namely, that if [the aggregates] come in a  little low because that's the way the cards fall in the next few  weeks, we don't have to exert ourselves too greatly to make it all up  in December, although we'd obviously be [leaning] in that direction  In that case we would presumably have a decline in the federal funds  rate of some significance   On the other hand, if November [growth] were high, higher  than is currently being projected, it would be a straightforward "B"  type of approach I would think And just what that means for interest  rates may be a little less clear but probably still the chances are  for a small decline if the overall projection is correct I guess "B"  and "C" should be split from the standpoint of M1 and M2, too M2 is  pretty much on target; it's just slightly high in terms of the yearly  target For M1 it looks as if we're going to make the yearly target  all right   Let me just try that out on you Mainly in the interest of  not appearing to fiddle around at this stage, the specifications would  be those of "B," as we had before But if [monetary growth] comes in  lower than "B" and between "B" and "C, that's not a source of  concern A s  for the initial borrowing, we've had suggestions running  from $15 billion to $18 billion Going along with "C," I'd be     11/20/79 -31-    inclined to put it somewhere in between, at $16 or $17 billion to  start with I think that expresses a bit that bias toward coming in  between " B 'I and " C   And let's leave the federal funds range where it  is, if that's the consensus I don't think we're going to hit either  end of that range The lower end, I think, would probably require a  decline in the discount rate, so that's a separate decision   Well, we can do that I think that's  expressing very much the sense of what I am saying, too But your  proposal has what I would see as a disadvantage--I don't know whether  it's a major disadvantage--of having to write a policy record that  says six weeks after we made the decision [on October 61 we're now  fine-tuning it for another six weeks It seems to me, to avoid a  sense of fine-tuning over a six-week period, we'd be better off  expressing it the way I expressed it But the substantive difference,  obviously, is close to negligible   For the two months But I think the  record would say that we're confirming what we did last time   If November comes in as low as he's  talking about   M R   AXILROD If November is close to zero If it comes out  at 3 or 4 percent, it's 6 or 7 percent [for December] It's that sort  of thing   Well I think the difference here is, as I  say, substantively a nuance   M R   COLDWELL Well, You [may] want to call a meeting of the  Committee if the aggregates did come in at that high a level, but I  think a 10 percent rate of growth in M1 in December would be  unacceptable   What I am saying is that if November  comes in as low as we're now estimating, we probably wouldn't hit the  10 percent in December I'm not saying we can't hit it because we  know we get these things   M R   MAYO We provide reserves   M R   COLDWELL Well, we would provide the reserves for 10  percent and that presumably would force the federal funds rate down  sharply   I'm not sure we'd provide [the reserves]  for 10 percent, as I see it I'd say we'd come in at 5-1/2 percent or  lower   Where were we before on the M2 rate for  the quarterly period from September to December?   76 and it‘s way up to 8-3/4   Simply refresh my memory I thought M2  was coming in more or less on track   Then why is your projection higher than  the track we estimated last time?   Because you're pushing M1 up   But M2 is only going to go off track in  the second half of the quarter   Well, I really think we are talking about  narrow differences at this point We just have to reach a consensus  on how we phrase this In listening to all the rest of you, there's a     11/20/79 -42-   slight predilection for my way of phrasing it I'd be perfectly happy  to phrase it the other way if that's the way people want to do it I  think it amounts to--   As I understand it, we have basically two  [alternatives] on the table And we have the Axilrod alternative,  too, so we have three options on the table We have one that is a  straight compromise between "B" and "C," and $17 billion on initial  borrowings That's one way of doing it Another way of doing it is  to specify "B" with the understanding that we're not unhappy if it  turns out to be "C," if November monetary growth is as low as  projected   I think there's equally little assurance  in either case And the third alternative is staying with "B" on M1  but lowering M2 to something like "C" That's a different compromise  between "B" and " C   I'   Well, let's not make any more--   M R   MAYO I'm trying to simplify it   One is a straight compromise right down  the line between "B" and " C     8 - 5 / 8 ,  I suppose, is a straight  compromise   8-1/2 and 7-1/4 percent, I suppose   M R   PARTEE M3 is not--     11/20/79 -43-   And $17 billion on borrowing   All of these leave the fed funds range  where it is The alternative is alternative B with the understanding  that [the specifications in "B"] in some sense are the maximum, within  the limits that we can maneuver these things anyway If November  comes in weak, we'd probably be satisfied with "C" And we'd also  start out with a $17 billion initial borrowing assumption Let's  just take those two at the moment   M2 I think would be 8-1/4 percent  That's a straight compromise   Well, he's not taking it literally to get  it within the target, I take it I'm just compromising between "B"  and "C" I suppose one could say technically--if the staff's estimate  is any good--that that is the most awkward one It's not going to  happen But their estimate may be no good, so--   We have alternatives 1, 2, and 3 The  borrowing level is the same in all of these for simplicity So all  we're talking about is these other numbers One is an arithmetic  compromise between "B" and "C, half way between "B" and "C" straight  out The other is a more flexible interpretation between "B" and "C"  and would depend in practice presumably on what happens in November,  which we can't control any more   M R   WALLICH That would probably protect better against  unexpected drops in the funds rate because we can go all the way to  the "C" specifications   It goes in that direction, certainly It  might depend, I think, on how low November came in   M R   COLDWELL And how rapidly we recognize it   Then we have this--instead of saying  bastardized version, I'll say "hybrid"--which is 5-1/2 percent for M1  and 8-1/4 percent for M2 I myself am not sure that M2 isn't going to  fall off My instinct is that it may fall off and [the 7-1/21 may  turn out to be consistent [with what we have for Ml] Now the only  trouble with voting on 3 alternatives is that you can't make a second  choice, apparently But let's see whether there is an overwhelming  consensus for one of these The first one, the arithmetic compromise  Just members, indicate if that is your preference Eight     11/20/79 -44-    The next alternative is two Four with  myself And the other one is the Axilrod version, which I guess is  not [anyone's first choice] Well, it looks like it's 8 to 4 [in  favor of the first one]   Yes I suppose the next question is can  everybody live with one, with its arithmetic purity IUnintelligiblel  but nonetheless pure Everybody can live with that?   I thought you voted for it in the first  place?   You people all realize that if you vote  for this compromise, this straight arithmetic compromise, and November  really comes in low, we're going to be much easier in December than in  the other alternatives   It would balance--   Well, have we got a consensus for the  arithmetic purity?   It's halfway between " B "  and "C" It  couldn't be simpler   M R   RICE Mr Chairman, how does this look when it's  written up? Does it look like--   Well I would suggest that we write it up  so that it doesn't It depends upon how one interprets what we said  before It's slightly tighter in some sense, if you interpret it  literally [compared with] the number that we gave before But if you  put it in the context that we said we weren't going to be unhappy if  growth came in a little below, we're accepting that [lower growth] as  we said we would accept it   Well, I think we ought to assume for the  moment--we'll decide about the meeting date in a few minutes--that if  we decide that the next meeting will be in January, obviously we carry  this forward into January That's the implication; it is until the  next meeting   I think what we're talking about is [the  period] until the next meeting   Okay, let's vote We are voting for a  straight arithmetic average between "B" and "C 'I   Until the next meeting, whenever that  meeting shall be   In the normal course of events I think  that's expected We will decide upon the meeting date in a moment  S O ,  it's until the next meeting   We have another action to take which, if  I understand it correctly, involves me delegating to Governor Schultz  and in his absence Governor Coldwell the authority to answer all  requests under the Freedom of Information Act, I guess   Is there a motion to accept that  delegation? Without objection, it is so delegated   The next meeting is the remaining item of business What I  would suggest is that we tentatively keep it on December 18, but that  you clear your calendars for whatever date seems best among January 8 ,   9, or 1 0   Are there preferences [with regard to those dates]?   It's a Thursday   Keep that on your calendars, with a  presumption that the meeting will be held on December 18th But I  want the freedom to move it to--let's say the 9th of January if we can  be that specific, which is Wednesday The meeting might be moved  because of various developments of an unforeseen character but  particularly it may be convenient in terms of the new money supply  figures and all the rest If nothing is happening that suggests that  we need to review things with urgency and if the [new] money supply  figures will be in better shape and clearer with two weeks more [of  work on them]--and we will have the advantage of knowing the OPEC  decision and we won't have that on December 18th--then I'd be inclined  to change it But if something comes up [and things are1 not going  according to Hoyle in some sense, I'd be inclined to keep it [as  scheduled]     11/20/79 -41-    M R   ROOS While we’re all here, could I address a question  to Bob Black? We have a Conference of Presidents meeting scheduled in  December   Only for Governor Wallich; I think that‘s  all   Yes, I wonder whether you could do it in  the opposite order, with the Presidents’ conference first   You’d have the Presidents‘ conference  presumably on the 8th and the FOMC meeting on the 9th instead of vice  versa   Again that’s my preference if nothing  goes wrong, but you know that seldom happens in this business So I‘m  not sure what the most likely [date] is I guess my preference would  be to move it later because the money supply numbers will be in better  shape and clearly we‘d have the OPEC business behind us But if  things get disturbed, my preference would be the other way around   Well, let’s state it the other way  around Let‘s have a presumption that we will have it on January 9,  but keep the other date open just in case things go wrong   M R   MAYO Sold   M R   BLACK Let me ask the subcommittee chairmen to get  their reports in as if it were going to be in December   That means they’ll be on time for the 9th  anyway! All right, let’s presume it’s on January 9th, but keep  December 18th open in case we’re hitting the federal funds [limit] or  something is going on internationally or whatever   M R   BALLES Does that assume, Mr Chairman, that we’ll  still meet on February 5 ?    Yes On February 5 we’ll still have to  make the final decision on the targets So I would expect to have a  preliminary discussion of them on whatever date we meet before then  It won‘t be until February 5 that we will know the budget and some  other things anyway, but we are going to have a preliminary discussion  whenever we meet next And that preliminary discussion will have some  substance because presumably it might affect what we do in the short  run Do we have a motion for adjournment?   We are adjourned   END OF MEETING    	791120meeting 	791120staffstatements1 	791120staffstatements2     Because I think it would lock in these  long-term rates and raise great concern about credit availability in  the short run    [That was the change in System holdings of securities] since when?  Steve, if you want to add something that bears upon the nature of the operations, this is probably as good a time as any to do it  I'm sure that's crystal clear! So, I think it's time to raise questions--not just on the details of Peter's operations, but questions that bear upon the operating techniques generally Governor Partee  He couldn't get in the total reserves  What plausible reason do you have for the funds rate staying as high as it has with borrowings as low as they are?  We would have seen what you are talking about if the funds rate had seemed to reflect this low level of borrowing  Governor Coldwell  I think that's true But I also think we're giving this an unfair test in assuming that we can be within 1 percent of whatever the money supply [target] is  By all past [measures] Governor Wallich  SPEAKER(?) If it wasn't a coincidence, it's wonderful  [CHAIRMAN VOLCKER] If it was far off, the staff would say it was a coincidence!  You didn't talk to the people at the Desk, did you?  How are you going to use total reserves as a guide without making some judgments about borrowing?  If they are not borrowing  Well, we have to make some decision and we might as well dispose of it now, if we can, as to how to proceed at least until the next meeting, but I would presume it is going to be for beyond the next meeting We are clearly open to modifications of the precise technique Unless we want to argue otherwise, I think implicitly we will proceed with something like the present technique until [we decide to] change, assuming the general technique has support There are certainly aspects of it that have to be looked at I think it's literally true that only in the last week or so can we really begin questioning why the market didn't respond in a way one might have expected And that's much too short a period to have any very [strong] judgments I also think there must be some element of coincidence in our coming as close as we came [to our money supply objectives] in the sense that even if these techniques are better than I think they are, I doubt that each quarter we're going to be within 1 percent or even, as with the December figure, off by not much more than 1 percent of what we finally--  If we hadn't had a nice little bulge in the money supply in the last published figure, December would have been a lot below [our objective], but I don't think it was entirely our good management that produced that bulge at that particular time  Well, let me return to that On the very general question, leaving aside modifications of the kind you're proposing, I just want to be explicit about whether we want to continue this general type of procedure Obviously, we're on it and it has worked; on the surface, anyway, it has worked The results are more or less in line with what was intended And I think it continues to have some of the advantages that were foreseen originally While we still worry about what the federal funds rate is doing when it doesn't go according to our preconception, we at least avoid making a concrete decision--  That's right We haven't done it in any direct way I'm not sure how many people are convinced they know just where the federal funds rate should be now Anyway, we avoid that explicitly On the other hand, I would remind you that nothing that has happened--or that I've observed recently--makes the money/GNP relationship any clearer or more stable than before Having gone through all these redefinition problems, one recognizes how arbitrary  -13-    1/8-9/80  some of this is It depends upon how you define [money] And the technique does, I think, make it a little more difficult in some ways, to say the least, to reconcile some conflicting short-run objectives we have regarding the domestic or international [economy] or money supply against interest rates, or whatever There may be a time when we really want to see interest rates lower or higher and they may not be behaving that way, and they may continue not to do so for weeks and weeks and months on end with this technique So, there are arguments on both sides I just want to see whether we have a consensus that we will continue on this until further notice anyway We need to make that explicit judgment  Well, at the extreme, obviously we can go right back to what we were doing before But I think it's fair to say, and I don't want to push it that cleanly, that there's a compromise every place along the line--on where we set the interest rate limits, on where we're operating, and on how much exercise of judgment we put into this even in making the kinds of adjustments that were made in the most recent period, which obviously were influenced by the fact that the money supply and interest rates weren't going exactly the way we might have expected So, there is not absolute purity on either side of this, and we can make various compromises But as a broad thrust, I think the question is whether or not to continue basically what we've been doing  There's no question  They both would be [unpredictable] in varying combinations  Well, I don't think this is absolutely black and white For purposes of moving ahead at the moment, [let's assume we will do] something like what we've been doing and let's get to Phil's question and maybe some others But in the broader sense, I take it there's a consensus at the moment  SEVERAL Right  Now, I don't know whether we want to deal with Phil's particular question It's a matter of judgment as to whether or not a big enough adjustment is being made that it should be brought back to the Committee I wouldn't anticipate adjustments as big as you're suggesting If we're going to meet as frequently as we've been meeting, because the Committee is [conversant] with the precise techniques we've been using, we can express some judgment when we're meeting I suppose it's theoretically possible--and I don't know whether you have any answer other than to leave it to my judgment essentially--to say that when the confusion gets great enough we would want a Committee meeting  Well, we could be very arbitrary and say that in some basic sense we are interested in something like total reserves now but the operating [variable] tends to be nonborrowed reserves We can make a path for nonborrowed reserves at the time of the Committee meeting and say we can't deviate from it by more than "x" without [further consultation] I don't know whether you want to do that  That's basically the way I interpret it now That is the presumption under which we're operating but, of course, the total reserves are not very controllable and the nonborrowed reserves are The question is how much we should change the nonborrowed to try to produce the total, which is the basic variable that affects the money supply  Well, you're making an assumption that the borrowings go up, the reverse of the present [situation], and that they go up without interest rates increasing particularly in the process Now they are going down without interest rates decreasing If borrowings go way up without rates increasing, just reverse the staff's judgment They presumably would be moving in the opposite direction if that literally happened If we have a big expansion in borrowing, it would decrease pressure on the market; and if the money supply were running high, the Desk presumably would make the opposite adjustment  Well, it's not the drop in borrowings itself The borrowings would come out where they estimated, assuming they have a correct estimate of total reserves with lagged reserve accounting; and [if] they got on the path of nonborrowed reserves, eventually the borrowings would be forced up But the borrowings were running low with a high federal funds rate That's the confusing--  I agree with you Well, is that a satisfactory way to proceed? I do think that we ought to put on the table, if not now--and this is under continuing review--any ideas about it It's all within the present technique, but we might change the technique a bit It's quite possible  Presumably the staff, despite Mr Axilrod's predilections, is busily working in a neutral and unbiased way to present us with some recommendations on lagged reserve accounting That will be before the next meeting or about the time of the next meeting  But it can't be The dilemma is that the relevant target is total reserves but it's not operational  Not in the short run It's operational in a larger sense, but we can't make that zero because we don't control it to zero  We'd have to shut the discount window; then it's controllable  Well, it's operational factors plus closing the window that make reserves--  Well, we don't know because Steve is saying that if he had, slowly or fast, the funds rate would have been down at the lower limit  Mr Black  Well, we obviously will be returning to the engineering problems as well as those of the physicists from time to time I think we have an understanding on how to proceed in the rest of the discussion  [Let's turn] to the question of the new monetary aggregates, on which a memorandum has been distributed Mr Axilrod, I presume, is prepared to make a few summary remarks on the subject, including telling us why the different measures have more substantial deviations from each other in the past than in the projections for the future  You probably were going to say this, but let me just make one introductory comment We ended up with the M-1A and M-1B [measures] to allow for [negotiable order of withdrawal] NOW accounts and [automatic transfer services] ATS As it turns out, in the current estimates there isn't very much difference But we still anticipate that there will be substantially more difference if Congress goes ahead and straightforwardly authorizes NOW accounts The theory here is that ATS, which has been legal for a year, has kind of run out of steam in terms of making any difference, but NOW accounts may well not have So, whatever we decide upon for the long- range targets next month, we probably are going to have to go back and readjust if Congress does permit nationwide NOW accounts We'll have to adjust both M-1A and M-1B, presumably in opposite directions We can do that, I think, consistent with the substance of whatever we decide By the time we announce them, Congress probably will have acted anyway  Every time we discuss this, I get very nervous about this great targeting Is this all comprehensible? Do we have comments or [questions]?  Mr Balles  I thought it was just finishing!  I don't think that is the reason that we're straddling We're not looking at an average It's just that we presumed at the time that NOW accounts would be enacted and that that would produce a strikingly high M-1B figure as it's now defined, which would have been very difficult to explain Indeed, from our own standpoint, we didn't know quite what its significance would be because a lot of [the NOW account funds] will come out of savings accounts So it provides us with both an easier explanation publicly, although it looks more confusing, and lets us know a little more about what's going on ourselves  We will have them at the end of the month, right?  But when the stock adjustment falls out, presumably we will drop M-1A  But M-1A and M-1B will be published on the same time schedule  It probably is a problem, and our only defense is that reality is complicated  We'd get a very funny M-1B if we got a big nationwide movement to convert savings accounts into NOW accounts  Well, down the road 3 months from now  If they don't enact that [legislation], then there's no difference between them, basically  I think a proportion of savings deposits moved in the present Ml--after M1 got squeezed so much  -24-    1/8-9/80  Oh, no I think the way it's going to work out may be slightly different If we don't have a nationwide NOW account bill, it's not going to make much difference As the staff shows in its estimate here, [growth in M-1A and M-1B] are within 1/2 percentage point If we get the nationwide NOW account bill, there may be a period of a year when M-1B is a little tough to interpret because we won't know how much is coming out of saving accounts  So will M-1A, but I would guess to a lesser extent  The more we discuss this, the more I hate to say we have a target for either one of them Maybe that is a note upon which to stop  I don't anticipate that there will be too much trouble with that But it is complex I think the complexity of this is inherent in the facts and the circumstances  I just don't know how worthwhile it is to try to guess whether it's better in a memorandum item or the table We may have the problem that M-1A will look very low And would we  -25-    1/8-9/80  want to keep publishing a figure that looks very low without having a figure along side it that looks relatively high? I don't know how we can outguess all this  The other two are kind of memorandum items in a column because they have some characteristics of a payments--  I'd prefer that you do that! [Laughter] Mr Axilrod is being modest because I remember he was vehemently on one side of the argment, the reasons for which escape me  Mr Axilrod felt that way Governor Rice, as I recall, felt the opposite It's basically a question of whether they are actively or passively managed, I think  Well, I think it's an important problem, and one with which we anticipate some real difficulties I take a literal exception only to your final point The effort to be as simple as possible may be misleading I come back [to my view that] the reality is complex That is the difficulty we are dealing with during this transition period But I think it is a major problem, and we plan to have press briefings and so forth beforehand so that we give as good an explanation as possible Now, as you can see, providing there is no change in the law--if the staff is right and I don't know whether they are or not--there isn't much difference between the two measures, which makes this all look rather unnecessary But if they are right and we have nationwide NOW accounts [authorized by] Congress beginning in March, there's going to be a significant difference between the two Therein lies the problem We're preparing the way If the law were going to remain unchanged, I'd say dispense with M-1A or M-1B We would go one way or the other and make it simple But we do anticipate a significant difference if we have nationwide NOW accounts  Well, if they don't change the law, we probably can I'm just talking offhand If they don't change the law, I think that argues very strongly for dropping some of them  Two years from now we'll probably drop it anyway, assuming they have a nice clean law and don't change it within a 2-year period  -27-    1/8-9/80  One can reverse all this and say that by exposing the problems that lie in these figures inherently, we're going to be better off in the end and people will understand it better But there is a hump to get over yet There's no question  As I say, the more we discuss this, the more uneasy it makes me  Well, maybe it's a net advantage if Larry Roos' third grader--his broker--doesn't understand it!  Have we finished with this subject?  You don't have L on here do you, Mr Axilrod? Do you have another table where that appears?  -28-    1/8-9/80  I guess we'll publish another [column] on that table, which is L  I was hoping to have a little discussion this afternoon on that subject--not necessarily on that aspect but--  But in practice, as we go along week by week in the future we're going to be on M-lA and M-1B because we won't have the data for M2 and M3 That doesn't mean we will get an [overlap] at the end of the month But when we're making some of these weekly decisions I suspect we're going to be biased, just by the availability of data, toward the Mls  Well, that can come up in the later discussion Let's turn to the long-range targets, again not with the intent of reaching any decisions but of having an informal exchange in a preliminary way of what seems to make sense here The first point I had was that, in fact, there's going to be a lot of confusion with the new numbers That point has already been made At a fairly technical level, this alternative 1 in the Bluebook is based upon some broad concept that 4-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent is supposed to be the same as the current target, which is listed there as 3 to 6 percent But that makes a 1-1/2 percentage point adjustment for ATS and NOW accounts and that would kind of reverse In fact, these are not equivalent, if I think it through correctly, [because] for reasons I won't attempt to explain in too much detail the change is small  I do want to raise the question of what we say--again we don't have to decide now--[for the period] beyond 1980 There are arguments on both sides of this The extremes are quite clear We could say nothing about beyond 1980 at one extreme or we could lay down a pattern beyond 1980 and say that cross our heart and hope to die we really intend to make it, just like we intend to make the 1980 one There is a strongly held body of opinion--perhaps in both  -29-    1/8-9/80  [Congressional] committees but I know particularly strongly in the House Banking and Currency Committee--that we should not only say what the targets are beyond 1980 but that they should legislate them So, I think it's an issue that will come up in testimony one way or another And if we say something, we should have some guidance as to how much it's a hope or how much it's a real expectation or something in between My own feeling is that we probably have to say something; but that leaves a lot of room between expressing it as a general hope or a solid expectation and intent We don't have to give an official FOMC position, but it is an issue that we ought to discuss a bit  Let me just mention a few considerations that occurred to me Given the position that we're in, for a variety of reasons, I think it could be hard to come up with targets that are in fact or appear to be higher than those we had for this past year I'm thinking not primarily of the fact that the staff, at least, is projecting a lower nominal GNP but that given the psychological and expectational state we are in, it would be a big decision to have a range of projections that in substance was higher than we have been operating with Secondly, and I go back to the discussion about the targets we had just 3 minutes ago, there is among other factors the arbitrary nature of the targets More importantly--well, it may not be more important but equally important--given the uncertainty that I at least perceive in the economic outlook for a variety of reasons, I think there is a question as to how wide a range we want We have been operating with fairly wide ranges of 3 percent We have to consider whether we want to narrow those ranges There are pretty persuasive reasons, given the uncertainties regarding both the definitions and the outlook, why it's wise to have a significant range As a part of that issue, there is a question of what we mean by the range whether the middle of the range does reflect some central tendency of what we think is appropriate on the basis of what we know now But there is a difference between attaching some very great significance to the middle of the range as opposed to saying that in the light of all the uncertainties we may well feel, as the year progresses, that it would be quite reasonable [for growth] to be toward the lower end of the range That's a decision, obviously, that can be reviewed as we go along But how we treat that is of some significance  I did not intend to discuss the economic outlook extensively right now, although logically [the agenda] may be in the reverse order That will be on the front of the agenda tomorrow when we actually have to make a decision about the short-run ranges As you know, for what it's worth, the staff is projecting a 7 percent increase in nominal GNP [for the year], but [the increase] is rather small in the first quarter and then it rises progressively That's not a pejorative comment [Laughter] I indicated my personal view There is a considerable amount of uncertainty about any economic forecast But it's interesting that there is in a sense a lull in terms of nominal GNP [GNP growth] is quite low in the first quarter; it's less than 5 percent And then it's projected to be about--in fact precisely--double that for the fourth quarter; it goes from 47 to 94 percent I'd just note that if we take that as an economic forecast and we attribute importance to historical relationships between velocity and interest rates and all the rest, if we have a steady growth in money demand the year, it implies a very different set of money market conditions early in the year as opposed to late in the year, assuming that those relationships hold true And there is a  -30-    1/8-9/80  question as to how we want to play any particular target during the course of the year in the light of that or other possible patterns of economic activity  In that connection, the Bluebook does suggest--and of course it bears very directly on the decision tomorrow about the short-run ranges--some alternatives [regarding] the question of strategy, which to some degree we do have to settle tomorrow, certainly for the next month It can worded in various ways [The issue is] whether we deliberately aim for a pattern of monetary growth [this] year that deviates on the average--whether we take our risks in various directions as the year proceeds--and how that meshes with anyone's view on the economic outlook, the interest rate outlook, the international side of the equation, and I think ultimately, too, fiscal policy considerations In other words, do we just want to set a dial at one extreme and say aim at the average throughout the year and see what happens? Or do we consciously want to take some of these other things into consideration as we see them from month to month within the ranges specified for the year? In terms of the particular setting that we're dealing with now, to make just a few points, we have had more strength in economic activity than we anticipated throughout the second half of [last] year Certainly it continued through the fourth quarter as a whole I don't know what you think about this, Mr Kichline, but I see that Ms Courtney Slater, the Commerce Department's chief economist, while she expects a recession this year has now decided that GNP grew by 2 to 3 percent in the fourth quarter instead of 1-1/2 percent I guess she's getting ready to publish a figure fairly soon and I don't know whether that's it  When is that preliminary figure due--in a few days? Well, I guess it's due out in a week or more than a week  I don't know whether that [statement by Ms Slater] reflects [the number they will publish] or not They will get some more information before they publish that number, won't they? Do they get retail sales?  Well, I don't know what that reflects, but it's in the same direction we've been seeing of [the economy] having more strength than was anticipated When one looks at the business picture one has to say, as reflected in the fact that the figures keep coming out better than the projections, that in a sense we're pretty clearly off econometric patterns and other patterns That's particularly clear in the saving rate, which has gone below the bottom of anybody's ranges And that's what makes things quite uncertain as we look ahead It seems to me that there are a number of explanations of why we're off the pattern It doesn't help much in projecting, but part of it must be a response to inflationary expectations And we've surely had our share of international disturbances recently that affect inflation and affect the dollar and are visible in the gold  -31-    1/8-9/80  price, the silver price, and commmodity prices Obviously, that leads into the oil situation, which has a very direct and pronounced effect both on inflation and what we think about the business outlook That situation has been highly unstable and I have the feeling myself that the next few months will give us--without overdramatizing it--a kind of important last chance to see whether we will get some balance in the oil market between consumption and production so that there isn't continuing upward pressures on prices that are going to carry us to some unknown level later this year So long as the spot price remains above whatever the OPEC official decisions are, which are rather mixed in themselves, we will get a very unstable situation And we don't know how far this upward momentum in oil price numbers can go  So far as fiscal policy is concerned, all that I know indicates that the present Administration is going to hang tough, if that's the right phrase, in terms of any sign of a tax [reduction] program at the moment On the expenditure side, I don't know anything more than has been leaked, which is that the total is up around the $615 billion level We have a higher level of real defense spending We are projecting some real increase in federal government spending which, if anything, I guess is a little low relative to what the Administration may be projecting It's either [about the same] or a bit on the low side But there is no proposal that I'm aware of for any tax reduction And I don't think there's all that much discussion of it, although that's a little more doubtful given the spate of reports that will come out on the federal budget and the Economic Report in a few weeks I don't think that means that the Administration is not aware of the case for tax reduction or necessarily would absolutely rule it out; it depends upon the evolution of the business scene But I think it does mean that they're not going to push it; they're going to resist it and resist discussion of it right now While one has to make one's own judgments about how Congress will respond, that certainly makes [a tax cut] less likely at the very least in the short run than if the Administration were pushing it  Looking at the period since October On the one hand, while all the financial data are within our immediate objectives, I don't think we've made as much expectational progress, if I can put it that way, as conceivably might have been hoped Indeed, in some sense we have not made as much progress on interest rates; one might have hoped that they would be coming down a little more clearly by this time Looked at from an October point of view, we haven't seen those developments that might have been anticipated It's fairly obvious why not, given the international turmoil and the lack of more visible progress on inflation In that connection, I might say that if there's anything I would feel relatively certain about in the near- term economic and price outlook, it is that the price figures are going to look worse rather than better for some months, particularly in the consumer price index where we will get both the impact of oil and the impact of interest rates from the last three months The mortgage rate has not been worked into that [set of rates] in anything like a full way So, when we look at expectational factors and disturbances, whether here or abroad, psychological or real, I think we have a hump to get over for probably three months anyway of higher [rates of increase in the] consumer price index And in one or two of those months I suspect the increases could be significantly higher than anything we have seen so far That is the situation with which  -32-    1/8-9/80  we have to live whatever questions we have or whatever we think of the longer-term prospects for inflation and business [activity]  With those general points, let me open the discussion to what people think is relevant with respect to these longer-term targets both on the one-year target and at least a little feeling, although that's more of an open question, about what people think we should say in presumably more general terms about the period beyond 1980 Mr Eastburn  What is strategy four?  Let me just say a word here and I'll shut up about it When I look at these different strategies, all of which come off the econometric equation from the base forecast, I must say that I have great doubts about these adjustments in the econometric equations I guess you're driven to strategy four because it looks [good] on all the numbers  Well, you're now talking about 1980 and beyond From your last comment do I infer--I don't want to put words in your mouth--that consistent with that you like the idea of not narrowing the range, anyway, in the short run? By the short run, I mean 1980  Do you have any feeling about where the range should be in 1980 as a very tentative [view]?  I don't think anybody should feel at all wedded to what they tentatively say today We have another whole month before we [need to decide] Mrs Teeters  It was a demand shift! [Laughter]  Mr Baughman  You're saying you wouldn't give numbers  You don't want to say anything about the level of the target?  Not the annual  Governor Coldwell  Down?  Governor Wallich  I really don't want to prolong this, but you say 68 percent [without ATS] accounts Is the implication that that's the part that came out of demand deposits?  But you have M-lB, which is the number with all of the ATS and NOW accounts, at 73 percent Are you saying that most of the NOW accounts came out of demand deposits last year?  Well, we'll explore that another time Mr Guffey  Mr Winn  What I don't quite understand, Willis, is that you say you would put your scenario out first, but then you say you don't know what the scenario is  You dismiss entirely the argument that the more firmly we set a range the more we might be influencing the reality?  Where would you stick the number today, subject to change tomorrow?  Mr Kimbrel  Mr Timlen  [Unintelligible] proposing making it for the last quarter  Governor Partee  But when you say "hold to it," you mean consistent with your first comments about using the range if necessary  Mr Black I don't know whether we will get through with everybody today, consistent with getting out at a reasonable time But if it's agreeable, let's go on a little longer  -41-    1/8-9/80  Mr Mayo  Mr Willes  You are not going to offer any numbers?  Well, we'll stay in suspense Mr Balles  A midpoint of 1 percent?  Well, I'm torn here between the hour and having only three more names left I'd rather like to get through the three names if we can do it with great dispatch Mr Rice  You'll have that opportunity tomorrow  By "leaning on it," you mean down?  Mr Morris, are you feeling brief?  Mr Roos  Mr Schultz has promised me he can pronounce an interim benediction in 30 seconds  I very much appreciate your staying here until 630 pm I didn't give you much choice, I guess, but nobody vocally objected anyway I think it was very useful to hear these preliminary expressions and to get this part of our agenda out of the way We will proceed with Mr Kichline's economic outlook when we all return tomorrow morning  [Meeting recessed]  -46-    1/8-9/80  January 9, 1980--Morning Session  I guess I, or we collectively, neglected to ratify the domestic operations Is there a motion to ratify the domestic operations?  SEVERAL So moved  Without objection they are ratified While we're in the process of ratifying, why don't we hear about foreign currency operations  Questions? Comments?  Would you like to ratify the transactions?  Without objection they will be ratified Do you have any recommendations, Mr Pardee?  Any discussion? Do we have a motion to that effect?  Without objection we will approve that proposal We turn to Mr Kichline who has the unenviable job amid all of this uncertainty of giving us a prudent, considered, forceful, accurate view of the economic outlook  Did I understand you correctly that you're projecting domestic energy prices up 60 percent?  What were they up in 1979?  You're just talking about domestic crude oil prices?  Why is that different index used?  Did I see someplace that nonunion wages are now rising faster than union wages?  Maybe I just picked up the idea  I was going to ask a question later but it's timely to ask [now] You have a prolonged recession or sluggish period here and you have no fiscal action assumed You make some assumptions about monetary policy Would you like to comment about an appropriate policy mix over this period, looking six to eighteen months ahead?  You have given us a scenario here of an $18 billion tax cut in social security taxes and something for business and you say, realistically, something for consumers, too So I don't know how much above $30 billion you are  It would bother you if it were higher, right?  Your budget deficit for 1981 is what?  What does the 50 cent gasoline tax do to the consumer presently?  Your assumption of the impact of that social security tax increase on prices was what in 1981?  Mr Mayo  Mr Willes  Let me just see if I understand what you're saying You're saying that a tax reduction of any sort will have an adverse impact on inflation and not too much impact on the real economy, you suspect  Mr Winn  Let me just add to Willis' question What are you assuming about special government measures or Home Loan Bank measures or whatever?  It doesn't mean, then, that they are cranking up the tandem plan?  Are there any further comments on the business situation? If not, we'll turn to the decision we have to make Just by way of background, and summarizing yesterday's discussion, I thought there was a good deal of skepticism expressed around the table about the idea of seeming too precise much beyond 1980 I do have some concern myself about the point Mr Baughman made that it may be a little hard to escape when [we are pressed for] some notion of what we're going to do after 1980 But the advice in sum seemed to me to be cautious on that side There seems to be a pretty strong consensus that a range of a few percentage points [for the growth of the aggregates] is about right As to possibilities within that kind of range, I don't want to prejudge where people are coming out on annual policy itself There was a fair amount of [sentiment] for [growth] between 4-1/2 and 5 percent; there were some for a little above 5 up to 5-1/2 percent I think virtually everybody was saying growth probably ought to be lower than what it was last year by some definition of what it was last year So I think we are in that general area; it does affect what we do in the short range to some extent It may be graduated in our individual minds anyway It should be That kind of background is useful to our short-run discussion Why don't you introduce that subject, Mr Axilrod  In turning to this matter, let me just mention a couple of things As Mr Roos said yesterday, given the new  -61-    1/8-9/80  technique we are using and all the complications of an annual and a short-term horizon, the Bluebook was put together admirably in my view It does take a quarter's time horizon for this particular decision That's arbitrary, and we debated as to what the right time perspective was If anybody has any comment on that, they could offer it  Well, it could be longer or it could be shorter, but it seems to be a tentative compromise anyway  Yes, presumably I don't know whether we thought this all through, but I guess the presumption would be that in February we will have the next three months, if we continue in this framework Now, that's--  It will always be related against the--  We thought of doing it for six months, but it's an arbitrary decision  December to March is the way you calculate it  What is the difference? I didn't pick up on that All these numbers you were giving here are the December-to- March figures If you have 5 percent growth December to March, what does that make the quarterly average?  Just a little lower  -62-    1/8-9/80  In Steve's comments he raised the question repeatedly about whether the Committee, in effect, has any preference as to how interest rates evolve during this period You can have different points of view on that That you don't care or that it's a very important question I would think comments on that point are relevant, if you think they're relevant The only other point--I put these points down here earlier--is that I think the most certain thing about the economic forecast is that during this particular 3-month period we are very likely to have a higher consumer price index, for all that means in terms of expectations and problems of various sorts So with that, we'll proceed Mr Roos  If I may say in this connection, Mr Roos, I think we've got a spectrum over which we can operate We used to operate with very tiny changes in federal funds rates from time to time, or between meetings certainly, and not very large ones even at a meeting There is no doubt that we have changed; in my opinion, the emphasis is quite different now But in some people's minds it may be different than in other people's minds That does not exclude necessarily some predilection about which way to bias this in the short run People may have some druthers one way or another without at all implying that we're controlling the federal funds rate the way we did before But one might want to lean in one direction or another Maybe other people wouldn't want to lean in one direction or another But we don't have to make it a choice between dismissing from the minds of everybody around this table any concern about interest rates and going back to what we were doing before, which was a very close focus on the federal funds rate within a quarter percentage point It's just that we've got to make some decision The decision is made in terms of the money supply, but that decision at any particular meeting may be biased in some people's minds by some guess, anyway, as to where they would prefer the interest rate music to accompany it--the treble to accompany the base or whatever that [expression] is  Perhaps we could combine comments on this conceptual and theoretical point with practical comments on where we should put the money supply target in the next month Mr Eastburn  -64-    1/8-9/80  You're not assuming too much on that?  Mr Coldwell  Just for purposes of clarification, Governor Coldwell, when you began talking about a range, is that merely a reflection of our frailties in achieving the number or do you have something in your mind about interest rates, let's say?  Mr Black  Governor Partee  Yes  Mr Kimbrel  Mr Mayo  Mr Baughman  Mrs Teeters  You did assume that the rate of growth in money would be slower in the first half of the year?  Mr Timlen  Governor Wallich  Mr Willes  Mr Morris  You hope to produce a more saucer-shaped than V-shaped one [and would] increase the money supply more rapidly in the first part of the year and less rapidly in the second part  You're on, Mr Rice It's just that you have to expand on your comment because you are next on the list  The consumer price index  Mr Balles  Mr Guffey  Mr Roos  Mr Winn, would you like to say something?  Mr Schultz, you're left; you are not volunteering  Well, we seem to have some differences of opinion, but they are not enormous So let's ruminate a few minutes and drink some coffee and see whether we can bring this to a conclusion  [Coffee break]  Gentlemen, ladies After great Solomonic perusal of the preferences expressed by the members of the Committee and others, and evaluation of those qualitative comments that were made--the acute ones and I discarded the others--let me make a general comment I think, as a number of people have mentioned, that we have an image problem or an opportunity--I don't know which to call it-- that is perhaps as important as the numerology at the moment I have sympathy for the comments that said we have to appear to be quite cautious during this period, particularly until the market gets a little more settled down in terms of interpreting our actions Substantively, I personally would not mind seeing some decline in interest rates; in fact, I think it would be desirable on the domestic side if we can get by with it on the international side It may be a little inconsistent with the energy problem, and this is where the compromise has to be struck Everybody was between "B" and "C" in one way or the other basically There are probably a few more on the Committee for "C", but [the margin] is very narrow, and for the non- voting members it is a bit the other way  Nobody talked much about the interest rate range I would say, consistent with the desire not to have a misinterpretation of our actions, since there is not very strong reason to change the interest rate parameters anyway, let's just leave the range the same In that respect we can say when this [directive] is published that there can be no misunderstanding about whether any change was made with regard to the interest rate parameters I'm not sure that the bottom or top of any of the [proposed] ranges is going to be relevant during this period, as a number of people have indicated, so I don't think there is a strong reason to change the range I would propose leaving it as is It was also implicit in the comments that primary, but not exclusive, emphasis is to be placed on M1 That is the measure basically used to construct the paths; we don't ignore [M2], but it's not exactly a 50-50 weighting proposition I'm not going to suggest what weight it has in any numerical terms I think the primary emphasis will tend to be on M1, but we will keep a weather eye cocked on the M2 figure  In terms of the range [for Ml], as I said, everybody was [for growth] between 4 and 5 percent, and I would propose that we just state it in the directive as "between 4 and 5 percent," which I think is consistent with the atmospherics of the [situation] That is open to an interpretation that I personally would not resist, but we would  -74-    1/8-9/80  draw a path on the basis of 4-1/2 percent consistent with that opening stance But let me say that we would be more concerned about a situation where [growth] was tending toward the lower side, 4 percent or below--we can't control these things that closely--and interest rates were rising; we would tend to get aggressive more quickly, providing more reserves And if it went in the other direction where it was drifting high, if interest rates were falling out of bed and giving us trouble on the international side we would be prompter about getting it back in the range, in terms of attitudes and judgments about the kind of path shifts that we have to make in the reserve numbers in the period But we would start out with 4-1/2 percent  Well, I may have said it wrong, but I think you--  No, either way In other words, if M1 [growth] were low and interest rates were also low, we would be slow about changing But if it were low and interest rates were high, we would change more quickly It's how quickly we move to make the judgment, which might have to be made It's just this judgmental issue, which we went through at least once, of changing the path in the view of what is happening  Well, Mr Altmann just wrote [suggested wording for] the directive which says "between 4 and 5 percent for M1 and on the order of 7 percent for M2" The latter happens to be the alternative B number It's another way of saying something around 7 percent So that's what I would propose for your consideration Operationally, the question arises as to what that means in technically constructing a path I suggest that it means 4-1/2 percent for the arithmetic of it, but we have to make this borrowing assumption in constructing the path That seemed to be an easier decision before last week than after this week This week has been somewhat of an aberration, where we had a high funds rate consistent with an exceptionally low-- inexplicably low--borrowing level All I can say--and I think we have to be prepared to look at it again after another week or two of evidence to see if this aberration seems to be continuing or if it seems to be reverting to the earlier pattern--is that I have a nice round number to suggest to you; that it is a round number may be its only virtue But it falls between the earlier experience and the present experience, and the number is $1 billion of borrowing Now, that is lower than anything we have been dealing with up until this past week The latest information on the money supply, as nearly as I can gather--I hate even to put this in your mind in a way, but having opened the issue I will put it in your mind--is that the tea leaves we have on the number for next week's publication would show fairly significant growth It's not inconsistent with this 4 to 5 percent range but, if anything, it is a bit toward the upper side of that range for January  -75-    1/8-9/80  It's not the number we are going to publish this week but the number we would publish next week It's a very unreliable indication, but for what it's worth, it is not inconsistent with this kind of range But it doesn't suggest that there is great danger of [Ml] falling way down in the range in January That's if that number means anything  So the proposal is for 11-1/2 to 15-1/2 percent, or unchanged on interest rates; between 4 and 5 percent on M1 with the understanding that I suggested about 7 percent in M2; and starting out--but looking at that very hard in a week or two in the light of this recent aberration--with something like $1 billion of borrowing  [The sentence] says "seeks" I don't know how--  "On the order of" is what I have for the second part I have the slight feeling that maybe "between" is a little better cosmetically, but it's no big deal Henry  I'm not quite sure that's right, Henry We are getting into this darn lagged reserve accounting again But in the immediate future, which is going to be relevant for judging this, we will know what the level of reserves is We are just judging the nonborrowed reserve path, saying we are putting the nonborrowed reserve path at $1 billion below what we know reserves will be next week That's for the first week anyway Now, it depends--and this is the uncertainty--but that would be tighter than last week in terms of borrowing when we had the market quite tight with a lower level of borrowing We just don't know the significance to attach to that You might be right, but it's not in accordance with the most recent experience  That's right Basically the $1 billion was arrived at--other than that it's a round number--by being halfway between the experience of the last week and the previous week  Well, you are going to have an argument, I suspect, with Governor Coldwell Let me repeat I think what we are doing is that we are aiming at a total reserve path and it's 4-1/2 percent [Ml growth] under this version The instrument that we affect is nonborrowed reserves What we don't quite know how to do is [how to determine] what level of borrowed reserves is consistent with the total reserves path that is really the objective That's engineering in Mr Roos' terms, I guess But I'm telling you what I propose for that element of engineering  From my standpoint, I suppose I'd be perfectly happy with what you suggested, Frank--just leaving it to the engineers, as Larry said--but I'm not sure the Committee as a whole is willing to leave it entirely to the engineers  No, but that is always the position we are in for any particular week Even looking beyond the week for which we know the reserve number, we know what level of total reserves we want to aim for to [support] 4-1/2 percent or whatever the number is What we really don't know in a sense is how to get there, because we don't control one element in the reserve base  -77-    1/8-9/80  Well, if I understand the comment made yesterday and this is combined with your comment, we have to get some kind of compromise We are interested in total reserves Our success or lack of success in reaching that target will depend upon, over a period of time, how much banks borrow and how much we put in as nonborrowed reserves Taken together it will depend on both of those things It is not an indifferent decision in looking at the outlook whether they borrow or whether we put in the reserves Frankly, I think we have to leave some room to the staff--or Mr Sternlight, Mr Axilrod and myself--in making those judgments as time passes Governor Coldwell yesterday raised the question as to whether, if we make a big change in assumption, the Committee [wants] to look a bit at the engineering, in Mr Roos' term Now, I don't know at what point you want to do that, if at all All I'm suggesting by throwing out this figure is that this is at least a chance to look at the initial [borrowing] assumption that goes in--we meet again only 4 weeks from now or whatever--and maybe that's enough But there was a question about that yesterday You don't even have to look at the initial assumption if you want to leave it to us But it's a matter--  The staff presumably would only reach that judgment in the light of their own assessment as to whether it's consistent with the total reserve path They have that constraint And if they keep being off the total reserve path, presumably we will get a new staff or something because they are making the wrong judgments But that is an inevitable matter of judgment inherent in the discount window that somebody has to make It's a question of procedure as to how much the Committee wants to get into that judgment I tend to agree with you, Frank, that the answer is "not too much" But at least initially, when we're meeting anyway, it's a question of how much we want to--  Well, if you want to proceed this way, I will tell you instead of asking you in a sense--and permit you to object--that the staff is planning to seek borrowing of $1 billion initially and they will use their best judgment as time passes If you want to object to that, object, but it doesn't have to be part of  -78-    1/8-9/80  the decision in any formal sense I don't think we need to prolong this unless somebody really wants to object to that Solomonic compromise between the experience of last week and the earlier experience  No Whatever we start with, if nothing else goes wrong and we are moving above path, the immediate manifestation of that is a rise in borrowing; if we are moving below path, the immediate manifestation is a decline in borrowing That's what happens  Let me say that the question of lagged reserve requirements, which keeps coming up here, and the discount window posture, which bears upon this question, are under review Within the next month or so I think we have to put both of these matters, certainly the reserve requirement issue, on the agenda Are we going to be ready in time for the next meeting?  What about the discount window?  Not before the next meeting?  The point I am making is mainly that any comment at the moment is tentative depending upon where we go on that But given the way we are now operating--the way I look at it anyway-- the amount of borrowing presumably will affect the level of market rates relative to the discount rate A couple of comments were made this morning Let's suppose borrowings [have to go] way down to achieve this path For a while at least the discount rate is going to constrain how far [the funds rate] can go down, so long as the banks  -79-    1/8-9/80  are borrowing Now, once they stop borrowing, it can go below the discount rate; but so long as they are borrowing significantly, presumably market rates will not go appreciably below the discount rate If it went the other way and borrowings tended to increase, one would expect interest rates to go up given this level of the discount rate In theory, I suppose, we could reduce the discount rate in those circumstances and at the same level of borrowing we might get lower market rates in the short run anyway than we otherwise would have So the discount rate fairly directly affects the market rate, all other things being equal  That judgment--I think I made this point before--seems to me to be more important than it used to be That's because if you propose either an increase or a decrease in the discount rate, we can basically say that the message, if we're all interpreting it the same way, is that we want market rates higher or lower We're not really saying we want borrowing to be greater or less, although that may be the ultimate implication over a period of time But the immediate effect would be to change market rates rather than borrowing Ultimately, [a new discount rate] obviously may affect borrowing because it has affected the climate in financial markets But the short view, as I look at it anyway, is that if you're sending the Board a message about the discount rate, you're sending us a message on where you think market rates should be, all other things equal Of course, this is why we didn't act in October and November when market rates were up wherever they were--14 or 15 percent on the federal funds rate--and a lot of people said we should raise the discount rate to close the gap It was our judgment that, at least in the short run, it wasn't going to close the gap but was just going to put the market rates up further So it was a question of whether or not we wanted market rates to go up further I think all that changes if we open up the discount window If we didn't have a natural restraint on borrowing, which we have had ever since the beginning of the Federal Reserve System, but if we operated [with an attitude of] borrow all you want if you find the rate attractive to you, then we'd have to manage the discount rate in a different way  In general  The market rate?  Well, Mr Axilrod has a nice econometric function which hasn't worked so well recently, but nonetheless reflects the theory Banks are reluctant to borrow Their willingness to overcome their natural reluctance to borrow depends upon how cheap the discount window is relative to market rates With a given reluctance to borrow, they will borrow more if the margin is 4 percentage points than if it's 1 percentage point So, if you put up the discount rate and change the existing situation in the margins but you don't change anything else including the amount of borrowing, market rates will go up And they are going to be forced to borrow $1 billion in the current example In the existing situation that's what we say We can control that in the short run We know they are going to borrow $1 billion We know, if this equation is right, that they will only borrow $1 billion when the federal funds rate is 1 percentage point above the discount rate So we now raise the discount rate from 12 to 13 percent; they won't borrow that $1 billion that we are going to force them to borrow until the federal funds rate is 14 percent  Now, the higher interest rates are then going to affect everything else, so we begin getting a different answer But in the short run I think that's what happens  If they change their liabilities, it will ultimately affect reserves, and that's what would occur from the higher level of interest rates It's not going to affect reserves for 2 weeks  I don't understand quite what you are saying It doesn't mean that we can't change the discount rate It just tells us to recognize that if we change the discount rate, the short-run impact is going to be to put market rates up, which may be what you want  I don't know about the small amount But there's no question that if you put up interest rates, the ultimate result might be to reduce the money supply, which might have all sorts of impacts and produce lower rates over a period of time  I'm talking about the immediate impact  Well, we don't have to wait--  Any other comment?  Any other comments?  Well, it's a pretty fine judgment when you get down to 1/2 percentage point differences But I would suggest to both sides that under my interpretation of this the degree of resistance to either end of the range is somewhat affected by what does happen to interest rates, which I don't think we know That is where the concern is on either side, and the concern is a reasonable one But I get a little leeway in there Now, one can argue that M1 can be put a little higher or a little lower but if there aren't any other comments, I guess we can vote Is this package understandable?  There were a couple of other things I wanted to mention, which I'm not sure I remember now  No, not on [the policy decision] I just want to remind you again that both the discount window procedures and lagged reserve accounting are relevant to what we are doing, and if we are really going to stay on this technique, they urgently need examination We are not talking about any easy change in either of those, if we want to change While the surface logic seems to say to change from lagged reserve accounting, I suspect it would not be easy to do that mechanically in the banking system, particularly before membership gets resolved I'm just not sure how easy it is to do If we are really talking about changing the discount window mechanism to something that seems to me logically more consistent with this operating technique, again on first blush, I suspect we are talking about overthrowing 60 years of Federal Reserve history, which is not an easy thing to do either So they are not going to be very simple questions to deal with, but they are inherent in this operating technique  We had an agenda item on release of the FOMC Memoranda of Discussion for 1974 I take it this has been read by the staff and--  Do we need a vote on this?  As a matter of procedure, these are checked with the foreign central banks, aren't they?  And they requested that this be deleted?  And they are happier  We need a motion on this  Without objection, that shall be released The next meeting is February 5 I would assume that the discussion on the long-range targets, having had [this preliminary] discussion today, can go reasonably expeditiously And on that basis I assume we can do it all in the morning We do have the lagged reserve accounting question We probably will not have a discount window question [to consider] by that point I would hope to get something on the lagged reserve accounting out to all the members of the Committee before the meeting and that discussion The meeting time doesn't necessarily have to be extended at this point We probably aren't at a point to make a decision right now  We have a problem You remind me I don't know whether it's particularly useful right now, but a precedent was created Perhaps it's a precedent; we could make it a precedent anyway The last time--was it earlier in the year or at the midyear meeting--?  At the July 1979 meeting a forecast was given by the Board of Governors in the testimony It was the Board of Governors [forecast] of GNP for 1979 and 1980, too  I don't think it technically requires that  Yes  It raises a bit of a question in my mind on whether it is worthwhile polling the Committee on what their economic outlook is We went through that exercise once or twice with Mr Miller Do people want to be polled on what their economic look is? Is it a useful exercise?  I know That particular [requirement] is for the Board, but I have no strong feeling one way or another on that  Well, I might ask you for that next time, but I don't know  Well, we also have a request from a member of the Committee Willis Winn sent me a letter raising all sorts of interesting questions on the international scene--I don't know whether  -86-    1/8-9/80  that letter was distributed other than to the Board members--and suggested that it might be a good idea to have a general discussion of the international scene Some of the questions are quite profound That raises the question in my mind whether [to allocate more time for discussion] While I think we can pretty clearly do the work we have to do in February in the morning, would there be any desire in view of that and perhaps a discussion of lagged reserve accounting and inter- related matters to begin the discussion the afternoon before? I'm not sure it would have to be a meeting; it could be a discussion the afternoon before How do people feel about that?  There's no great resistance to coming in the day before, if I read you right  Well, I'm not sure that we will do it, but let me keep that option open if we have some of these other [issues] to discuss I don't think it would have to be a meeting, for what difference that makes, but it might be worthwhile having an early afternoon discussion session So, let me review that  Okay, thank you I think we are finished  END OF MEETING  -87-       I will call the non-meeting to order We are not in a meeting at this point anyway; we may be in a meeting later I would just remind all of you that I sent out a memorandum on the idea of possibly changing the [FOMC] meeting dates It probably would amount to having fewer meetings on the theory that with the current operating procedure, I sense--maybe nobody else senses--that a meeting after only four weeks doesn't give us much evidence on which to change anything With lagged reserve accounting and with a lag in the numbers, we're hardly in the period that we were discussing before the next meeting comes along So there may be some logic in doing it a bit differently This is partly based on the idea, after looking it over--and I think we all agree--that we need a little longer perspective It seems to me better to get the longer perspective by sticking to calendar quarters rather than just always looking three months ahead on some kind of moving average basis If we take that as an assumption, logically we should meet somewhere around the beginning of a quarter and look at that quarter We can review it sometime during the quarter and also look ahead to the next quarter Then when we get to the end of the quarter, we will be looking ahead at the next quarter There seems to be a certain logical progression in that method of looking at it as opposed to meeting more frequently when the basic decision was whether or not to change the federal funds rate But I will return to the subject at the end of the meeting and then [we will decide] There's nothing magic about any particular time to change  Well, I had nothing invested in any of the particular dates or when we would change, if we change But I do have the feeling that every four weeks is a little frequent if we are operating in this particular mode I wouldn't feel that way if we were operating more on money market oriented criteria  Well, it's a little hard But look at the dates carefully As I say, I had nothing invested in the particular dates that were put on that proposal, particularly when we get near [the usual] dates, if there are problems in changing them For instance, for that proposed April 1, which looks logical except for April Fool's day, March 25 is almost equally logical And we could basically have the same pattern by meeting on March 18th, because I    2/4-5/80  understand [that date is on] everybody's schedule now, although that would leave a longer lapse before the next meeting But there's nothing sacrosanct about any of those particular dates  No, you can wait until later; it can wait until after the meeting tomorrow I just wanted to remind you to have it in mind so that if you have any strong feelings they could be adequately verbalized tomorrow  The first thing on our agenda today is lagged reserve accounting Mr Axilrod  We're going to get an issue pretty soon for which we just can't pull out the old memoranda  From Mr Who's research?  Well, you have not left a lot of doubt as to where you stand, Mr Axilrod Is there any dissenting opinion among the staff on the importance of this matter?  In the articles and academic papers and so forth that have been written on this subject, do they bring anything to light or make any argument that you have not made?  We would expect that! Well, it's just that the conclusion comes through a little more strongly than I read it in that memorandum itself I had a feeling that you saw some disadvantages in the degree of certainty with which the Desk was operating Maybe Mr Sternlight would like to comment  Mr Holmes, you were there before and after Do you have any comments?  Well, we're not going to make a decision this afternoon, but anybody who would like to comment on this subject should comment  How big a job is this for us internally as opposed to for a bank?  I am assuming going all the way to what is called contemporaneous reserves, which isn't quite contemporaneous; it's a one-day lag  Boy!  You say it will take a long time because they will--  I appreciate your caution about raising [this issue], but I did this morning  I think your caution is well taken and I did it with some hesitancy Mr Mayo  Have you looked at those, Mr Axilrod?  Mr Baughman  Mr Roos  Mr Black  Governor Wallich  Mr Winn  Why do you think we are running out of honeymoon time or however you expressed it, Willis?  We don't see it in the money supply figures  And they don't know--  I don't know how far the ingenuity of our staff goes, but we will get off bounds on one definition We changed the definition in the seasonal adjustment factor--fixed it up perfectly, I would say  Governor Partee  Mr Timlen  Governor Rice  -13-    2/4-5/80  It depends in considerable part upon what we do with the discount window issue  Governor Coldwell  I can't contemplate that possibility President Willes  I guess everybody has talked who wants to talk Is there anybody else who urgently wants to talk? Mr Kimbrel When I put the adverb in front of it, you're in trouble!  Well, those cautions seem to be rather unanimously felt I must say the other side of it is--I don't know how important it is substantively--that when we work with a two-week lag in the context of what we're trying to do now, one has a great sense of artificiality We are working to affect a reserve figure that we always know we cannot affect because it always depends upon something that happened two weeks earlier It leaves me at least with a very uncomfortable feeling over a period of time But I think it has been useful to get all these considerations on the table I don't know whether we have to look carefully at the reverse lag situation and so forth or not  -15-    2/4-5/80  You are in a position to talk pretty quickly about that I don't know where we'll come out, but--  That's coming up anyway, isn't it?  SPEAKER(?) You mean for Federal Reserve purposes only?  Well, the relevance of that comment is that one thing leads to another And there is this question of whether to make a whole bunch of changes at one time or to keep making changes, as I think we have been doing, that upset people  At the very least, obviously, there are a lot of arguments to delay for a while I think we ought to get all these things on the table; maybe we won't want to delay them all We can look at the membership issue in a month or two and see where that stands, but we ought to have at least a preliminary feeling of how we would want to go, depending upon the resolution of that issue Let's hope it gets resolved one way or the other Well, I don't think there is anything more to add on this unless the Desk people want to say anything in conclusion Well, it has been useful [to see] how uniform many of the views are about the theoretical desirability and the practical difficulties in this  Well, we're going to have a presentation on the international scene I think a variety of questions have arisen on this which may or may not be of any immediate relevance to what we [do]  MESSRS TRUMAN, SHAFER, and HENRY [Statements--see Appendix]  -16-    2/4-5/80  Let's proceed to a formal meeting and hear from Mr Pardee about the international [scene] in the last month now that we've heard about it for the next two years  Any questions for the zoo keeper?  When the Germans sell dollars and buy marks, they give some of them to us sometimes  They sell them to us  Because we're repaying the swap  You have a recommendation to make in that connection?  We have to ratify the transactions since the last meeting Do we have a motion to that effect? Without objection they are so ratified And you are asking for permission to renew $18 billion of swap debt maturing between now and the next meeting?  When are we going to meet next--March?  This goes beyond any feasible next meeting date I am sure Do I have a motion? I do and I have an enthusiastic second Have we any objections? If not, are there any other questions or comments on this?  He always feels under pressure I don't know--  Only his normal pressure  I forgot to ask for approval of the minutes of the last meeting Without objection, they are approved How long is your presentation, Mr Kichline?  We don't have time for questions There is no ground swell for wanting to hear that presentation tonight In that case, maybe we'll dispose of Mr Sternlight He's always very [brief]  Yes  Before I forget, maybe we can go ahead and ratify your transactions Without objection they are ratified I think we'll do no more than hear whatever comments or questions you have to Mr Sternlight  You mentioned that some people thought the new money supply figures would look higher Why should they have that idea?  The reason I asked is that they don't have any sense of this revised seasonal  We have a press conference scheduled for Thursday, I think, to attempt to explain these new figures, and that question is sure to arise I don't look forward with a great sense of anticipation to trying to explain either the substantial actual complications or the fact that the numbers look higher  But it doesn't have to go higher  We have lots of problems This M2 number is more like the old M3 number, but since it's called M2 and is higher than the [old] M2, we've got a problem Any other questions or comments?  We will adjourn until tomorrow at 9 am  [Meeting recessed]    2/4-5/80  February 5, 1980--Morning Session  We got through our agenda down to item 4 anyway, yesterday I suggest that we begin with the staff report on the economic situation and then perhaps take a little more time, if we want to, on the discussion of the economic situation and implications for the longer-term ranges in the light of the fact that this is the meeting at which we have to set them for a year ahead Mr Altmann tells me he would appreciate, for purposes of writing the minutes anyway, a fuller discussion of your views than we have had at some recent meetings But more important substantively is the fact that this is the annual meeting where we have to consider and rationalize what we do in terms of the longer-range outlook In that connection, I don't know whether all of you noticed that the President exercised his prerogative to relocate, I guess is the right word, the Humphrey- Hawkins objectives In the original Act they were 4 percent unemployment and a 3 percent rate of price increase in 1983, and he moved back the unemployment objective 2 or 3 years and the price objective--what, 5 years?  Yes, it was 3 years and 5 years It is the first time that particular prerogative has been exercised, and maybe it will make everyone feel more relaxed regarding how one reconciles what we do with the dictates of that Act I mentioned last time that it might be useful--I will not insist upon this--to quantify your feelings about the outlook I'd say the best way to do it in terms of the real GNP would be on a fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter basis In terms of prices, the consumer price index is the easiest one to think about And I suppose the unemployment rate would be the traditional one If you want to give some sense of your figures, you can do it with any appropriate qualification that you think is desirable That you feel reasonably confident about it or immensely uncertain about it or anything in between, because I think that is part of the flavor within which we must operate [We need] to take account of the uncertainties in setting our own policy Given where we're starting, I hope to have a great revolution and perhaps have the coffee break a little earlier, more toward the breakfast hour than toward lunch, after we finish the discussion of the economic outlook With that, you may begin, Mr Kichline  MESSRS KICHLINE, ZEISEL, and TRUMAN [Statements--see Appendix]  I'm a little confused by this last chart This shows a rising rate of inflation through most of the first half of 1981, or the first quarter anyway I thought your projection earlier showed a declining rate of price increase over that period  Now, wait a minute That's for the year as a whole, isn't it?  Yes it is  For the fourth quarter of 1980 you have what?  What is the rate of consumer price increase in the fourth quarter of 1980?  -23-    2/4-5/80  I don't understand What was it in the fourth quarter of last year?  And it's going to be 92 percent in the fourth quarter of 1980, according to this projection?  What is this change of 11 percent that you're talking about?  SPEAKER(?) Fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter  I just have to decide what figure I want here I think I want the fourth quarter rate of change, your 92 percent figure  The figures we are looking for, then, are the [counterparts] of your minus 22 percent--that's the fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter change in real GNP--the level of unemployment in the fourth quarter, and the rate of change in the consumer price index during the fourth quarter  Can you tell me what the consensus is of private forecasts at this point?  Well, for these three items or some approximations thereof  They may be using a different equation  Let me add one more item on the list that I asked you to comment on and that is the fiscal policy [unintelligible] Mr Roos  Mr Willes  You have expressed yourself eloquently on the wide band of uncertainty Would you care to express a view on the central tendency as you see it? Or are you so uncertain that you have no view on this policy?  Well, I think it is not unimportant that you say there's a great degree of uncertainty and I would like to get that--  Do you have any particular feeling about fiscal policy?  That is, without a discretionary tax decrease it is understated  Do you wish to say whether you think a tax cut is a good idea or not?  Okay, that's a clear view! Mr Timlen  What are you assuming on the saving rate?  Do you think there should be one?  I take it that you think there's a fair amount of uncertainty  Governor Coldwell  So you're not in favor of a tax cut, I take it  Thank you We're going to be left with your decision for the rest of the year! Mr Smoot  If I understand you, your forecast has a tax cut in it?  Mr Guffey  Governor Partee  -31-    2/4-5/80  Yes You wouldn't particularly push for a tax cut earlier  Governor Teeters  Mr Balles  A part of the question, if I may just interrupt, is whatever the level, how much does it change?  The [Board's] staff shows a decline in the consumer price index for this year  You're not advocating a tax cut?  Mr Black  -35-    2/4-5/80  Mr Kimbrel  You said 11 percent on consumer prices Is that year over year or during the fourth quarter?  Do you have a fourth-quarter figure itself, just for comparability purposes?  Mr Baughman  Mr Roos  Mr Winn  What was "this"?  Did you have an unemployment rate or a price [forecast]?  You're in the high uncertainty group?  Mr Morris  We'll get every hypothesis on the table! Governor Wallich  Mr Mayo  Governor Rice  Governor Schultz  Well, I have missed one personal objective of speeding up the coffee hour appreciably But since we're short of 11 am, let me make a couple of observations I do have the feeling in listening to some of the different economic forecasts and comments that our staff, which is sometimes accused of being Keynesian, feels more constrained by the money supply assumptions than more monetarist- oriented people And that accounts for some of the differences in view Assuming that we're all intelligent people around the table, [given the] differences in outlook that have been recited, I don't see how anyone can come to any opinion other than that there is a great deal of uncertainty in this forecasting business  In terms of what we have accomplished or have not accomplished in monetary policy in recent months, particularly as reflected in expectations as best one can judge them, we have to conclude that we've been [set] back very substantially and have suffered a grievous blow from everything that has been going on internationally--whether you're talking about oil prices, or Iran, or Afghanistan and concern about defense spending There's nothing much we can do about that, but I think in some sense we're back to square one or worse in terms of the public's concern about inflation So I tend to agree with those who see a risk of an inflationary breakout, in modified terms, on the up side as a real danger I also agree with Emmett Rice and a couple of others who said that we could get a longer reaction in the economy on the down side if that happened I don't know what we can do about that We can't deal with both situations at the same time In fact, I don't think we can deal with the risk of a downturn and ignore the inflationary side, because they're part of the same parcel in some sense  I feel rather strongly that it would be a great mistake to put much money on any particular forecast at this point I come back to what Mark Willes said at the beginning, and I think the saving rate question is a perfect illustration I can hear persuasive arguments around this table as to why it is going to go up and I can hear persuasive arguments as to why it is going to stay down; and I don't know of any criteria by which I can choose between those two choices at the moment In a direct statistical sense that will be the most important influence on the economic outlook in the near term There are a couple of other things that might be mentioned that haven't been touched upon We have some uncertainty about tax refunds in the near term, with some expectation that they may be very high relative to past experience--I am talking about [the time period] between now and April or beyond--and what that will do to the near-term timing of consumer spending What it will do to the near-term timing of the kind of forecast the staff has I think is an unknown If one assumes some lag in defense spending but also assumes that the option of high defense spending is going to come along [later], we could get a pattern of big refunds for a while, in a sense artificially holding things up, followed by a defense impetus coming late in the year and taking over after the refunds subside It only adds to my feeling of caution about any forecast  So far as the bond market and the banking system and the availability of credit are concerned, I'd just make two observations  -44-    2/4-5/80  I think the bond market people, who from the way they are behaving apparently are quite discouraged about the inflationary outlook, have concluded that money is freely available I see one side of it But also, in talking to some bankers, I think there is something to what Fred Schultz just said about a cumulative impact of restriction That's beginning to be felt by some bankers, who have talked to me, anyway, not only in consumer lending but in mortgage lending and in small business lending and other types of lending I think it is true that the last ones to feel that are probably the big companies that have access to the bond market and to the banks, too I don't think the picture is all one way There has been great confusion about--I guess it was John Balles who said it--whether the money supply is genuinely [or only] statistically under control I think it is statistically under control I am not sure the market thinks it is genuinely under control And it comes down in part to some confusion over our own operations I meant to mention earlier--and I don't know whether the presidents have seen it--that we put out an elaborate technical explanation of what we're doing, which Mr Axilrod authored It has gotten no attention in the press thus far, but it was an attempt in considerable part to meet the questions that have been arising about why reserves are going up 10 percent or 12 percent or 8 percent, depending upon which number you're looking at, while the money supply is going up 3 or 4 percent I don't know whether we will convince anybody as that seeps into consciousness But there has been great confusion engendered by the differences in growth rates among all these measures, including right now the various reserve measures going off in widely different directions I will leave you with that  Let's have the coffee break and when we return get back on these long-term and short-term targets  [Coffee break]  I think we can start Let me make a couple of preliminary remarks and just devote our attention to the long-term ranges at this point One preliminary remark is that, whatever we do, I am afraid that we inevitably are going to have quite a lot of confusion with the changes in definitions [of the monetary aggregates] coming at the same time as [the setting of our] targets We are going to have a press briefing, not to give the targets, but to explain the changes in definitions and the changes in patterns We have had to add to all our other complications the usual annual revision in seasonal patterns We can now go forward and talk about the new numbers but we are talking about them against the background of an increase of almost 5 percent in January, if we can switch our minds now from 1-3/4 percent or whatever was projected before on the basis of the old numbers The new M-1A and M-1B are growing at something like 4-3/4 percent in January, as I recall, which is pretty much on the target that we set for ourselves by the grace of a revision in seasonal adjustments If policy fails, we can always revise the seasonal adjustment factors for a while! [Laughter]  I do think this is going to be troublesome to explain, but we inevitably have to do it Another complication, which we don't have to face right now, but it is inherent in this  -45-    2/4-5/80  situation, is that basically the reason we have both M-1A and M-1B is to allow for growth in NOW accounts, and that [dichotomy] is a transitional device The staff's judgment is that growth in M-1A and M-1B will not be any different this year if the law legalizing NOW accounts doesn't pass But the high probability is that that law will pass, presumably sometime during the spring, and that we will have to re-estimate M-1A and M-1B to allow for that; I presume we would want to make a technical adjustment in the targets I don't think we have to worry about that now--maybe we can wait until midyear for our regular revision anyway--but I just warn you that sometime during the spring, I suspect, if the law does pass, we think there will be a significant difference between M-1A and M-1B and that some suitable changes will have to made, if nothing else, consistent with what we decide today  On the substance of the matter, if it is true that we face a wide disparity of views in what the outlook might bring and a high degree of uncertainty, I suspect we are on an approach--whatever other merits or demerits there may be--that will provide us with some fail- safe protection [By that I mean] that if the economy really goes down hill, almost any figure within the range of what we have been talking about should produce an easing in the outward externalities of policy, but if the fears of a stronger economy and an inflationary surge appear, the opposite ought to happen And I presume that in a very crude way, anyway, either of those results would be appropriate When we discussed this the last time, there was a consensus--and maybe for a variety of reasons it was not quite unanimous--or a strongly predominant view to maintain a 3 percentage point range, and all these alternatives are couched that way The ranges in the Bluebook fully encompass all that people were talking about last time, I think The differences in the ranges are not very wide, as you know, and nobody is bound by what he or she said last time To orient you a bit It was not true for everybody but the predominance of views fell between the alternative II and alternative III choices shown here; and there was actually some plurality if not a majority for alternative III But people were talking in a preliminary way and rather loosely My own feeling is that we probably [should] end up in that area, and I don't have enormous feelings that a difference of 1/2 percentage point is of great significance When we are in that area, the strength of my views is not pronounced among [those alternatives] But judging from the discussion last time, we are predominantly in that area So with that introduction, who would like to be more precise in stating their views about where we should be for the annual range in 1980? Mr Black  Let me just say a word You reminded me about M2, M3, and bank credit First of all, I'd just note that if people feel strongly about the weight to be put on those numbers, they ought to say so Secondly, in the normal course of events, given the way we are operating they may get a little less weight than they have in the past because we won't have those figures as up to date So far as I am concerned, I take on faith the staff analyses of the consistency of the particular ranges they put down for those numbers as compared to Ml I don't know of any strong reason why they should be different from what the staff put down, but I have a little residual suspicion that those are indeed more volatile numbers than the M1 numbers because quite a lot does depend upon the evolution of interest rates, and I don't know in which direction they will go  Governor Partee  Mr Balles  I don't think there's much difference between M-1A and M-1B, barring this legislative change; the difference is a small number  They both will The problem is that if we get the law change, M-1B will rise both because it's taking [funds] out of M-1A and out of M2  Yes, it will only rise because it's taking funds out of M2 M-1A will go down [M-1B] will rise because it's taking out of M2; and M-1A will decline because [funds will be taken] out of that aggregate  Governor Wallich  -49-    2/4-5/80  Mr Willes  There's a [trickiness] of these figures I think it's fair to say that M-1A was artificially high last year because we did get some transition [flows] into NOW and ATS accounts, part of which came out of M2 Mr Kimbrell  Mr Smoot  Mr Mayo  Mr Guffey  -52-    2/4-5/80  Mr Timlen  Governor Coldwell  That's [alternative] III plus  Governor Teeters  We're out of names  I happen to agree with that I am confused Were we going to present the comparable figures on the old basis? Was that your intention, Mr Axilrod, if I may interrupt?  I missed that in the Bluebook  -54-    2/4-5/80  I understand I think you have to leave that to us, but I personally have some sympathy for doing it this particular time and then maybe forgetting about it  What I think we will do is present last year on last year's basis and on this year's basis The question is whether to present this year's target on this year's basis and on last year's basis, [showing] what the equivalent target is  There's no difference for M-1A  Yes, that's right There's no difference for M-1A That's the same as the old Ml, as I recall, for the year as a whole  If I could just interject a comment I understand the longing for simplicity, but I am afraid the reality is complicated And M-1B is the figure that is going to be most thrown off by the uncertainty about NOW accounts It is just a fact of life  That's right, at this point  Well, we'd have to make an estimate, and the estimate that is likely to be most different is for M-1B  Yes, we'd have to change the targets, not the definitions You see, the danger is that we could get a big transfer from savings accounts into M-1B, and that's going to make that figure look very peculiar And we won't know it in advance  Governor Rice  Mr Morris  Mr Schultz  Mr Baughman  Mr Roos  There's obviously a majority for retaining a 3-point range, as there was last month I would defend that in my own mind by the uncertainty of the figures that Frank Morris and others have referred to and the real uncertainty in the economy, which goes in the direction of [our needing] a little leeway I would note in that regard that I don't know of another central bank in the world, however monetarist oriented, that has a narrower target than 3 percentage points  No They have a 5 percentage point range, as I recall, 4 or 5 Four, I guess  Do the Swiss have a pretty good record? They had something like a 15 percent increase in the money supply in some recent year, and they abandoned the target  Be that as it may, the greatest single view is for alternative III There is a certain amount of clustering at alternative II, and one for alternative I And there are some in  -58-    2/4-5/80  between alternatives II and III and between II and I One possible approach would be to adopt the Balles approach, which he justified in part in terms of the desirability of getting all the upper limits no higher than the growth we had last year He [suggested] a combination between alternatives II and III, using the alternative II ranges on the Mls and something like the ranges in alternative III on M2 and M3, if I understood him correctly I assume the staff judgment as to the internal consistencies of these ranges is not so precise that that becomes an impossible [combination]  Which way is the risk more? If interest rates decline, do you think M2 would balloon or not?  Well, these are in my judgment very narrow differences Let me just try, after everybody has listened to all of this, two alternatives alternative III straight and alternative II straight I might say it didn't make much difference in clarifying any strong preference to add the views of nonvoting members onto those of the members; they're split in about the same way So just for the voting members, after hearing each other, how many would want alternative III?  I am just talking about a flat "III"  Now let me try "II" Who would find alternative II "acceptable"? Four Let me try the Balles alternative and see how many would find that acceptable  SPEAKER(?) Read it  -59-    2/4-5/80  It's alternative II for M-1A and M-1B, if I understand it correctly, and alternative III for M2 and M3 Maybe that would be the nicest, if we could achieve a consensus on that  I've been implicitly assuming that bank credit takes a subsidiary role in this as it indeed has in the past  One could argue about that, I suppose  Well, that seems to be a bit in line with Mr Axilrod's suspicions, for whatever that's worth On the other hand, it doesn't achieve Mr Balles's visual purpose  That's what the staff says I have a little uncertainty about what that figure--  Well, I can't have too many proposals on the table at the same time I don't know whether Mr Balles wants to  -60-    2/4-5/80  retreat to Mr Schultz I am willing to try your original one and just see [what support it commands]  What we're talking about now is what is acceptable to the biggest group we can get, I think I can try the Schultz alternative, too, to confuse the issue further, but let me try the Balles alternative at this stage  Well, let's try the Schultz alternative This is exactly the opposite Alternative III on M-1A and M-1B and alternative II and M2 and M3  This means acceptable That is precisely right Are we really saying nothing is acceptable here?  The only thing I am convinced of is that we are in a range where the differences are very difficult to perceive  Well, I am a little reluctant to go to alternative III It is clear that that has a plurality, but whether it is the one that maximizes the satisfaction around the table is another question  Just looking at what maximizes satisfaction for all, I urge again the Balles approach with a more sympathetic attitude by people around the table  -61-    2/4-5/80  Well, theoretically, we are shooting for the midpoint, based on what we know now We may modify that in the short-run decision; we haven't gotten there But for the year as a whole the implication is that the best judgment we can make is that we're shooting at the middle of all of these, which gives us some leeway on [M2 and M3] presumably, if we're really shooting at the middle of the [target for Ml]  I would agree with that But as of now I think we are saying the central tendency is the midpoints of these ranges, which gives us some potential leeway in deliberately moving away from the midpoint and also gives us some leeway in the reconciliation among these various numbers I suppose the implication of that, to sell [this] alternative now, is that if we were literally aiming for the midpoints throughout the year and M2 and M3 prove to be a little tight relative to the Mls, we would end up with a slightly lower M1 and a slightly higher M2 and M3, relative to the midpoints If the staff estimate is correct and everything went perfectly, that's presumably the way [it would turn out] We would end up with the midpoint, theoretically, halfway between alternative II and alternative III  Did you say leave these where they are?  You're narrowing all the ranges  You obviously know [the area we're in] I really am resistant to getting down to 1/4 points If what we're aiming at for M-1A is halfway between [the midpoints of] alternatives II and III, [that difference is] 1/4 of a percentage point and I think we're really there with the Balles approach as a practical matter  Presumably these are the best estimates we have I will not vouch for the inter-relationships between them [They represent] an unbiased estimate of the consistent--  We're now unrounding them Let me urge upon you at this point the Balles alternative How many find that acceptable after this further [discussion]?  If I [add my vote], it's a majority But I can't believe that when we get down to a 1/4 point there is no combination of numbers that does not provide a happier situation  But there's no substantive difference between them  Well, I don't think we want to go in the direction of widening the range There are all sorts of ways we can get a quarter peoint difference between the averages  What are we talking about specifically?  That's the straightforward compromise, but I think we look foolish if we get into quarter points  If we do it the other way, we have a better chance of being within something  -64-    2/4-5/80  About last year's ranges?  Well, what we're going to tell them is that on M1, depending upon how you look at it, we were somewhere around 55 or 68 percent  All of these objectives, properly interpreted, will be lower It may take some interpretation  Well, we said 4-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent by one interpretation, with 1-1/2 percent ATS--  Well, I don't like this way of skinning the cat, but do you want to do these 2-1/2 percentage point ranges? Let's see who finds the 3-1/2--  Yes  SPEAKER(?) John, I assume you'll go with this proposal  Well, we get no more votes for that one than the other one  No, I don't think so  Well, the figures are supposed to be the same I don't know how to--  It seems to me that the logical thing, without getting into tiny fractions, is either to do the Balles approach or the reverse of the Balles approach, which is about as much of a compromise as one can get, retaining the wider ranges Now, that avoids quarter percents on either the midpoints or the outside [limits of the] ranges Who do we have reconsidering? Or who wants to make another proposal?  The trouble with alternative III--frankly, I have no particular problem with it--is that it's going to make some people more unhappy than any of the other alternatives  Well, I would recommend to you the Balles position But if you're bound and determined to go to alternative III, we'll go to alternative III Let's try Balles once more  SPEAKER(?) I'm not going to vote for it this time  How many did you get? What was the count?  With great reluctance, I will try "III"  It is a mistake  My reservation is not the substance of it, but that I don't think it correctly gets to the midpoint of the range of opinion  By the Schultz approach you mean just reversing--  Oh, I am perfectly happy to do that Let's try that one  Let's see whether that captures--  I think everyone is stuck on III; that's okay  Yes  SPEAKER(?) You would vote for it?  Well, I'll vote for alternative III if that's what everybody wants to vote for I don't see the significance in the 1/2 percentage point difference that some other people apparently see  Oh, I understand  I presume that in some sense that must be the implication  Well, that figure is a little artificial because we had the shift into ATS and NOW accounts  I can't answer that question It probably implies a degree of sophistication on the part of Congress that is beyond any generalization  We'd certainly have a tendency right now to aim for the midpoint, not knowing anything else That's pending further information  -69-    2/4-5/80  Yes, in the short run  SPEAKER(?) We sure did  Well, I was going to suggest the opposite If there's more of a concern about M2 and M3, maybe we should take a 1/2 percentage point off the top of the M1 ranges  And it leaves us a little more leeway on M2 and M3  Presumably they are, theoretically, a little more volatile anyway  [For M-1A] 3-1/2 to 6 percent--a compromise between alternatives II and III on both the Mls  It's 4 to 6-1/2 percent on M-1B, which is probably going to have to be revised anyway  And leave the 6 to 9 percent and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent [for M2 and M3, respectively]  They're the same as in alternative II  SPEAKER(?) There's something wrong  There's a bit of logic in it, I think  -70-    2/4-5/80  We lose that visual effect, but it's getting argued that the economics are a little against us in terms of the uncertainty and it gives wider ranges I think there's a certain sense in doing that It has the disadvantage that--  That's right [Unintelligible] mislead with that quarter percent  It's raising depending upon where we begin  You say raising on average Depending on what one is looking at, it's accepting the upper constraint of alternative III on M1 That's the one you're worried about  Well, let's try this one I appeal to you Anyone around this table who is good enough to know the difference between 1/2 point, with great [conviction], is pretty good  Does it have any appeal?  They are 3-1/2 to 6 on M-1A; 4 to 6-1/2 on M-1B; 6 to 9 on M2; and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 on M3 Who finds that acceptable?  SPEAKER(?) Here we go!  And I make nine  I think about the same  Seven, not counting me So we got one more vote out of this one, right? Let's go with that one then All the people who like narrow ranges ought to be enchanted by that 1/2 percent [reduction in the ranges for M-1A and M-1B]  I don't know quite what I will find at this point, frankly  Let's take a vote on the latest proposal Is everybody clear about what we are voting on?  Bank credit, I guess, is 6 to 9 percent  Well, I appreciate your swallowing all these 1/2 percentage point differences! I think it's probably more important to swallow the 1/2 point differences than to achieve the 1/2 point  Yes After all this time, we have a great decision How much problem are we going to have with our even narrower differences on the short-run ranges? Do you want to try to do this [before lunch]?  SPEAKER(?) Yes  Let's see where we are without going around the table Do you want to say a few words, Mr Axilrod--very few?  If I understand this precisely, your alternative B, at least for M1, reiterates the target we already set at the last meeting  And this can viewed as kind of a mid- quarter relook at that  But M2 is a little below, right?  We didn't set a target for that  That target was 7 percent; that's what confused me  But you think this 6-1/2 percent that you have here for the new M2 is roughly consistent with the 7 percent that we had on the old M2?  But it has been running higher than 6-1/2 percent, apparently, because you have the implied growth for January to March of 5-3/4 percent  There's a question of procedure we have to decide upon, which is whether to reiterate or change the targets that we had for the first quarter [We can comment on] any tentative feeling that we have about the second quarter but we don't have to put the second quarter into the directive, and I think it's probably inappropriate to put the second quarter in the directive at this point So, if people agree with this, the only thing we have to have in the directive is a number for the first quarter  Right  And in both cases--just slightly in the case of Ml and a little more than slightly in the case of M2--the rate of growth in January was above our targets [for the quarter]  Yes, after we translate them  So if we take alternative B, conceivably we could shade it a bit in the light of our earlier discussion But I think we're talking--  Well, that would be my inclination Looking at this in view of what we just decided, the second quarter figures may be a little high But we don't have to decide upon that now Otherwise, what you're saying is that "B" is basically reiterating what we said before, which does imply a little slower growth rate in February and March than we in fact had in January That's because January was high in M2--and M1 came out a little bit on the high side, but not very much--because of the money market fund bulge I would suggest to you, but I don't want to hasten you if there's some vital question that I am missing, that just for the first quarter "B" is reasonable I think it's not only in line with what we decided last time, but what we want to continue to decide  This is the central tendency, obviously Last time we worded it 4 to 5 percent on Ml We could raise the question again of whether we want to continue with that wording We said 4 to 5 percent on M1 and about 7 percent on M2 I suppose what we'd be saying here is that the Committee reiterated--if you want to  -75-    2/4-5/80  word it that way--the 4 to 5 percent range on Ml And on the new M2 basis, we'd shave the target a half point  Well, I don't feel strongly about that Even on the new technique we're not that close This is a pure matter of preference; we can word it either way I don't have any--  Particularly if we keep that same wording, we'd be a little hard pressed to [rationalize] changing it by a quarter percentage point, which one could argue we might want to do on the basis of the long-term range, all else being equal But that's such a fine adjustment More substantively one could argue, given what's going on, that we might want to be tighter or easier  I think "C" is clearly saying, given what we know now that we didn't know last time, that you want to be a little tighter  "B" says that we want to play it about where we've been playing it; "A" says we distinctly want to be a little easier I think those are the choices here  SPEAKER(?) I'd keep "B"  Are there any other comments? I really don't want to rush this, but I think we ought to go to lunch if we don't have a consensus here If there's a lot of argument that we should be distinctly tighter or if the differences are massive, [maybe we should break for lunch] In fact if we took "C," I think we would have to raise the targeted level of borrowing I don't know what is consistent, but I--  -76-    2/4-5/80  It depends upon whether you're looking at the long-term or the short-term rates  Willis  It's always a relevant policy variable But to some degree there's a choice We can be easier on the reserve provision and raise the discount rate We can be tighter on the reserve provision and not raise the discount rate  Well, the funds rate is theoretically not predictable under what we're doing But if we go toward "C," we are biasing it, presumably--  --on the upper part or for an increase from where we are Not knowing anything else, I don't know what would actually happen But presumably we would push the level of borrowings up a bit, which might or might not push the funds rate up In "B," we would not push the borrowings up, which might or might not be accompanied by stability in the funds rate  -77-    2/4-5/80  Initially And it's all going to be looked at-- The last money supply figures we have are weak, right?  Well, I don't know how to [interpret] the silence of most people But Governor Coldwell has expressed himself for wanting to tighten up a little here  Given the most recent behavior of the published money supply and given the value in some continuity and not wanting a feeling of too much fine-tuning when nothing is clearly going wrong, I would suggest that we reiterate the directive that we had last time which says 4 to 5 percent [on Ml] I think we have to change the M2 figure because of the change in the definition of M2  We could add M-1B into the directive, but I think it ought to be done the same way, with a range, whatever the consistent number is  You think it's 3/4 of a point higher I am surprised there's that much difference  Maybe we could say 4 to 5 percent for M-1A and 1/2 point higher for M-lB  And 6-1/2 percent for M2 That looks a little--  And we'd make it clear that these are the newly defined numbers  The borrowing figure has been very fuzzy recently, to say the least Whatever figure we think about now might be adjusted fairly promptly in the light of whatever numbers come in What I am saying, partly in the interest of consistency, is that we are looking for M-1A between 4 and 5 percent and M-1B between 4-1/2 and 5-1/2--or we could say 1/2 point higher I don't know if there's any preference between those Then there is somewhat of a technical problem in that we don't get the M2 figure as early, but I think it could be said that we believe this is consistent with an M2 figure, as newly defined, of about 6-1/2 percent  Basically, I think it does That's the issue Whether we want to take this opportunity to make a change in what we laid down a month ago  Well, this is the issue It involves not just what we want to do now but has some future implications as to how much we want to fine-tune these numbers at monthly intervals or the intervals at which we meet Sometimes we are going to want to change  -79-    2/4-5/80  them, I think, so I am not completely allergic to it This would be a very small change between "B" and "C"  Consistent with the decision we just made for the long run, "B" has a very slight amount of front-end loading, if you mean by front-end loading going below the--  In any event, we will get a slight amount if these numbers come out that precisely All these numbers imply a slightly slower rate of growth than what we actually had in January And I think we could say in the policy record at the very least that that implication exists  Yes, I think that is true for this period I have a slight preference for a range just because we are never going to hit the exact figure anyway--we're not that good--and it just indicates that there's a little [flexibility] But the implication clearly is that for now we aim for the midpoint Now, what we do as the period [progresses] if we get outside it in either direction and whether it's practical to get all the way back to the midpoint [is the question] There is some flexibility [with a range], but I don't feel strongly as to whether it's stated as a midpoint or--  Well, let's separate these two questions Let me just get a show of hands Who basically wants to keep the midpoint where we had it, with the modification that means [given] a change in the [M2] definition, but does not want to say that we want a different basic [objective for] money growth in the first quarter? This recognizes that that means a slightly lower rate of growth in February and March than we in fact had in January  Well, that seems to be the preference The subsidiary question--I think it is distinctly subsidiary--is whether you want to word it the way we did last time, as I suggested with the new definitions, or do you want to word it as 4-1/2 percent?  -80-    2/4-5/80  Could we have a show of hands on that?  Maybe we want to word it the other way then It's about evenly split, but I--  All right The alternative is saying about 4-1/2 percent and-- Well, I think the 6-1/2 percent ought to be worded differently because we don't have that number right away and we can't have the implication that we're following that week by week because we just don't have it So, with that change in language, it's 4-1/2 percent for M-1A and 5 percent for M-1B, which I notice is halfway between "B" and "C" And then "The Committee believes that is consistent with about 6-1/2 percent for M2 as newly defined"  I hate to introduce this again, but what we did once was to say 4-1/2 percent--it happened to be 4-1/2 [unintelligible]--and it was clear in the record, though I forget just how, that lower was better than higher  I think that's right  But I don't really think it makes any difference what instruction will be given to the Manager [initially] The [question] is whether or not to put people on notice that nobody is good enough to meet [a precise] target, and we may imply that by using a small range But I don't think it's a very significant  -81-    2/4-5/80  question Shall we vote? It's 4-1/2, 5, and 6-1/2 percent stated as "abouts"  Borrowing is at $1-1/4 billion, let's say Okay  I will take up the scheduling at lunch Thank you  END OF MEETING  -82-       I doubt that we have to be here for very long You know that in  general we've been putting pressure on the reserve positions of banks That is in effect the implication  of carrying out the Committee decision We're running high on total reserves, which is almost  automatic since we're running high on the money supply The path of nonborrowed reserves has been  reduced under the circumstances from the tentative path worked out at the time of the Committee  meeting Interest rates, including the federal funds rate, are up--both because of the pressure and  because of expectations, I think We have a wide range between the discount rate and market rates at  the moment We haven't acted on the discount rate for the reason I've suggested earlier We have had  to raise the limit on the federal funds rate to 17-1/2 percent, which we did as a tentative decision until  we had time to confirm it or change it this afternoon  I believe we are at a crucial point in market psychology and the effectiveness of what we are  trying to do I think people in markets are nervous enough so that policy, maybe for the first time, is  beginning to bite outside the mortgage and consumer loan areas and some other areas where it began  biting some time ago It's important that we not give a wrong signal at this point, and in my judgment  a wrong signal would be backing away from market developments in response to the greater pressure  on reserve positions And that's what has required the increase in the federal funds rate I have no  better idea than you do--or maybe you have better ideas than I do--as to how long this tension might  last or how much further it might go In line with somebody's comment earlier, I think it's important  that the job get done We all will be worse off if it doesn't get done now The side effects are already  potentially serious if things don't go right [The situation] could probably get more serious if there is  procrastination At the moment I have nothing better to suggest to you than that, at the minimum, we    3/7/80  maintain the 17-1/2 percent limit [on the top of the funds rate range] and be prepared to raise it if we  have to Or we can go ahead now and raise it to 18 percent, which will give us a little more leeway  We still may have to raise it afterwards I think I would, given the state of things and since we're  meeting anyway, provide us with a little margin and go to 18 percent But we can do it either way I  might say, too--I don't know whether all of you know it--that in 15 minutes we will be announcing a  decline of about $25 billion in Ml Let me have Steve give you the precise figures  The M2 and M3 figures seem to be running significantly above  their targets, even if we combine the months The implied quarterly figure would be what--2 [points]  above [the Committee's path]?  I might say, insofar as bank credit is concerned, that the January  figure was around 13 percent  Undoubtedly that February figure to some extent [reflects] the  anticipatory commitments and borrowing that we know have been going on for the last couple of  weeks  I can't help but comment that despite the diligence and  intelligence of our staff, that estimate is worth about as much as you paid for it, Ernie  SPEAKER(?) We paid quite a bit for it  [I meant] that he personally paid for it  What it means is that if money stayed somewhere around the  level now projected for the next week that we haven't published yet, we'd have a very low March  Or 18 percent, whichever you prefer  Well, I hadn't even thought of raising the floor I doubt that  that's going to be a binding limit before we meet [on March 18] But I share much of what you had to  say in substance Let me just make one point I worried about building this rate structure into the  economy, too But my sense of it both from the institutional standpoint--the strains on the institution--  and building a rate structure into the economy, which at this point I think is inflationary if [the rate  structure] doesn't bite, is that we better make sure that what we're doing bites at the moment  Governor Partee  We'll strike that last comment--[the "recession"] word in that  last comment    3/7/80  I don't know whether we should just go down the list here  Who has not spoken? Mr Guffey you spoke, didn't you?  Oh, Mr Roos spoke  Mr Morris I'm not sure what order I have these names in but  I'm going with the order that happens to be on the list I have in front of me  It's alphabetical I'm told, except with Volcker first  Governor Partee spoke Governor Rice  Governor Schultz  Governor Teeters  Mr Timlen spoke Governor Wallich We have to get [his  views] over the other telephone  Governor Wallich would prefer 14 and 18, if you understood  that Do we have John Balles out there at this point?  Oh, he's not a member  We're getting Mr Winn's conclusion  These are the new members of the Committee    3/7/80  Let's go to the nonvoting [Presidents] now Mr Balles Did  you all hear Mr Winn's preference by the way?  SPEAKER(?) No  He favors 18 on the top and is indifferent on the bottom  SPEAKER(?) John Balles is also in favor of 14 to 18  Mr Balles is 14 to 18 Mr Baughman  Mr Eastburn  Mr Kimbrel Bones has disappeared Mr Willes  Well, I would suggest that the only operative proposition really  is the top and we can discuss the bottom when we meet in a week Do we need a formal vote, Mr  Altmann?  Let's put that proposition to a vote  The top being 18  All right We'll be back in touch with you one way or another  when we get a little firmer fix on timing and anything else that's relevant  Yes  I think the record probably has to show both, but it will show  that the first vote was an interim decision made until we had a meeting I think it was clear that that  vote was for the day, pending consultation We'll make sure that's the way it appears  Okay Thank you very much  END OF MEETING  1/ Secretary's note Prior to this meeting, the Committee had approved by notation vote a recommendation by Chairman Volcker to raise the upper limit for the federal funds rate from 16-1/2 to 17-1/2 percent, pending a discussion of the situation in a telephone conference call to be held in the afternoon of March 7 Previously, by notation vote on February 22, 1980, the Committee, on the Chairman's recommendation, had raised the upper limit from 15-1/2 percent to 16-1/2 percent At the Committee's regularly scheduled meeting on February 4-5, 1980 the full range for the intermeeting period had been set at 11-1/2 to 15-1/2 percent     The meeting can come to order, gentlemen and lady We have a lot of business to dispose of at the start and I will try to find my agenda, if you will excuse me a moment We have the election of officers First of all, we have the election of the Chairman--I keep getting reminded that this position is not statutory --and we need a nomination  Do we have a second?  Is there an objection? I shouldn't put it that way!  Without objection We need a Vice Chairman  This can't take effect until he takes office, so it would have to be dependent upon his April 1 inauguration date Is there a second?  SEVERAL Second  Without objection we will have Mr Solomon become Vice Chairman upon his taking office We have staff officers to select As one of those staff officers, I would nominate Mr Altmann to be Secretary Perhaps Mr Altmann will read the rest of the nominees  Apart from the fact that we seem to have a plenitude of Davises--pardon me?  The selection of the Managers comes in a later agenda item If there are no objections to those officers, they will be appointed Now we need a Federal Reserve Bank to execute transactions for the System Open Market Account That has traditionally, as you know, been the New York Bank Do we have a motion to that effect?  SEVERAL So moved  Without objection Now we need to select the Managers The present Managers are Mr Sternlight, Domestic Operations and Mr Pardee, Foreign Operations Do we have a motion to [reappointment them]?  SEVERAL So moved  Without objection those appointments are made Now we need to approve the minutes of the last meeting Do we have a motion?  Do we have a second?  Without objection, the minutes are approved And I guess we are now to the report on foreign operations since the last meeting, Mr Pardee  We need to ratify the transactions since the last meeting Do we have a motion? Second?  SEVERAL Second  [Approved] without objection You have a recommendation?   in today's markets,  it's the Treasury who bears [the cost], and they want to bear it  It was the Bundesbank's decision to buy in the first place; but as soon as the Treasury heard about it, they wanted [to participate]  All this discussion took place when [the transaction] was at about the market rate It's just that with the lapse of two or three weeks since the transaction took place it's no longer the market rate  I think we probably wouldn't want them back  Well, this seems more technical to me than real The original transaction was at a market rate and what we are doing is back-dating in some sense--not literally back-dating, but it's no longer at the market rate The Treasury wants the marks and we are a conduit I don't see any big problem in this myself  Is there any real question about it? I think we just have to write the exception in such a way so that the circumstances are clear as to the fact that this was not an off-market transaction when it took place  No, I don't see that we should be committed I don't understand that part I don't see where we would want to buy them back If we have to intervene on the other side, the Treasury can use the [mark] balances [it holds] and it would take the loss I don't think we want to take them back at the off-market rate  It didn't automatically They've been giving us 50 percent of their intervention at our request and this falls into that pattern  They originated the intervention but they have been giving us 50 percent, and they will give us 50 percent of this It just happens to be a forward transaction which hasn't been [consummated] yet It falls into the regular pattern, but what is different about it is that it is a forward transaction  No, I believe they did it for liquidity reasons  They were doing a lot of intervention and the effect was to drain liquidity They didn't want to drain that much liquidity at the time, so they did a forward That's why they did it, as I understand  I don't think they have done any forward transactions recently This was all during a limited period Well, without objection we will provide that exception Mr Sternlight  Well, I think Mr Pardee has described our present posture We would certainly buy some marks, to the extent that the mark is at these levels and to the extent that it is strong in New York But as he points out, it hasn't been terribly strong in New York The Bundesbank has agreed to share with us their intervention, but we will pass it on to the Treasury at this point since we are out of debt and the Treasury is under water by whatever the number is now  Do we have any mark balances now? We have a few mark balances, don't we?  Essentially, we will pass along our share of their intervention to the Treasury until the Treasury gets balanced If the dollar remains that strong and indeed we do any intervention in New York, we will pass that on to the Treasury, too  There is a great concern in Europe generally about their currencies depreciating because of the internal inflationary repercussions, and everybody wants their currencies to appreciate at this point I think it's only that our interest rates have prevailed here at the moment But the danger is that they will raise their interest rates, which is one consideration we had in mind in handling our discount rate the way we did--not to give them such a strong signal for raising their interest rates I am not sure we are going to avoid it anyway, but it was quite clear when I was over there last week that they were not looking forward with any joy to an increase in the US discount rate They felt it would force them to raise their rates  Yes  There is no question that if new borrowers come in for emergency reasons or because they are new, we will have to make an adjustment to allow for that But I think this elasticity in the borrowing numbers is very bothersome whether we are on contemporaneous or lagged accounting The contemporaneous might help When are we going to have our report, Mr Axilrod?  We are going to be prepared to have a discussion of that at our next meeting?    3/18/80  What are they?  You are going to be prepared with all of this?  Let's try to do that I think it's a major hazard to introduce something that is going to be as difficult as this for the banks to handle on top of all this other stuff that we have been giving them  I understand that consideration Mr Roos  We know the required reserves; we can't change the required reserves for that particular week And the required reserves govern the total reserves    3/18/80  And even then we can't affect total reserves The banks are just going to borrow What we can affect is how much they borrow in any particular week  Mr Balles  Governor Wallich  It depends on what the multiplier is  We will have to have an exhaustive discussion of these questions when we put contemporaneous reserve accounting squarely on the table, so perhaps we shouldn't waste too much time now I don't think we are going to change [our procedures] at this meeting  Mr Guffey  I hope we can proceed here with some dispatch Mr Eastburn  Mr Winn  Let me just say on these questions on discount rates--I didn't hear the last answer Mr Axilrod gave--that I am not sure it makes a great deal of difference whether we move the discount rate or not, except for its signalling influence, which might have been considerable That's because we could adjust the borrowings, presumably, to achieve the same result The reason the discount rate was not moved--let's be clear about it--is that we were waiting for this program, and it seemed inappropriate to raise the discount rate when the Administration was trying to negotiate these pending changes The judgment was either right or wrong; but it was a judgment we made It certainly would have been disruptive to that process if the discount rate had been raised in the middle of it when we said we'd have a coordinated announcement Mr Kichline  Oh, we need the ratification of domestic operations  Second?  SPEAKER(?) Second  Without objection they are ratified Mr Kichline next and then I think we will go straight to Mr Axilrod We can then have the Committee discussion in which I would like to get as much flavor as you propose to give in the limited time we have of what is going on out there in the financial markets and in the banking system We get all sorts of complaints about the availability of farm credit or small business credit or mortgage credit It is very hard to judge, I think, [the degree] of total restraint we have and the kinds of problems, institutional and otherwise, that are arising The more flavor on that we can have, the better  Mr Axilrod  In connection with that distinction--the willingness or need of banks to borrow at the discount window--I think it is important that we all reiterate publicly or otherwise the fact that this change in the discount rate procedures does not imply any greater willingness on our part to tolerate borrowing I think your discount officers ought to make that point to borrowing banks rather explicitly We don't know how they will react One can argue it either way But any tendency for them to think that the window is open because the rate, at least the surcharge, is closer to the market rate, should be discouraged or we will get a perverse reaction from this action I think a little more than usual calling to borrowing banks may be justified under the circumstances to point out to them rather directly that this is no invitation to borrow  Let me just say in connection with setting the stage here that the Chase Manhattan Bank said it is raising its prime rate to 19  -16-    3/18/80  percent today At the same time it is instituting a small business base rate which remains at 18-1/4 percent, effective immediately They used some language [in their announcement] indicating that they think this is consistent with the philosophy of [the measures] announced by the Federal Reserve They said they have some special [concern] for small businesses and they're acting to ease the strains that small companies face in borrowing money The special rate applies to companies with assets of $1-1/2 million or below and bank loans of $1/2 million or below With total bank loans of $1/2 million, that implies that a company is borrowing one-third of its total assets The bank said the small business rate would apply to several thousand of its smaller customers  They don't have a lot of farmers in Manhattan  We can have a general go-around with comments But apart from the general business situation, any comments that you have about how far this restraint has gone and how far it needs to go and what the special problems are, as I said, would be very welcome  If I understand these inter-relationships correctly, the December-to-June figure you show has a monthly base, but if it were on a quarterly base the way the yearly target is, the implied 4th quarter to 2nd quarter figure for M-1A in alternative B, for instance, would be 5-1/4 percent  That's somewhat above the midpoint [of our long-term range]  And even alternative C is above the midpoint  Steve, even with alternative C, growth would end up in the second quarter as a whole running slightly above the middle of our range  Well within, but above the middle of it  Mr Eastburn  I think it's fair to say, in the light of history, that there is no feeling of certainty about any of these numbers  You have a big seasonal in April to take care of this in a normal way?  What is the normal?  Who would like to make some general comments?  Well, respond more generally, too  Yes, but it normally has a big seasonal  The country banks?  Mr Morris  What do you conclude from all this for our current posture? Tighter, easier, unchanged?  Mr Timlen  Mr Forrestal, what wisdom do you bring us from Atlanta in your first presence here? Welcome  Mr Black  Mr Winn  Mr Balles  Your area covers a not insignificant part of the national scene  I think we ought to have a coffee break now, but let's make it short  [Coffee break]  Mr Guffey  Mr Roos  Mr Mayo  Mr Rice  Governor Wallich  Mr Baughman  Governor Teeters  Governor Partee  Yes  Assuming we have a recession  Governor Schultz  Let me make a few observations that occurred to me in listening to all this First of all, it's clear that the economy is fairly level, so any month we look at these figures we're going to find some things down and some things up What that means for the future isn't very clear There's considerable strength and resiliency over broad areas of the economy or it wouldn't be holding level or a bit on the up side in the face of a decline in housing and a decline in autos and some other industries What stands out to me is that we haven't any room to grow here, given the declines in productivity and other pressures on the economy And if we tried to stimulate growth very much, we really would have no chance of dealing with the inflationary psychology; we'd in fact face a blow-off on the inflation side if we don't already have a blow-off  Secondly, in my opinion--and everybody can be his own psychologist--at this point we don't have many believers in the view that inflation is about to ease off or, indeed, that the economy is about to fall out of bed There is more nervousness than there used to be and some people are beginning to question whether they shouldn't change their views It was characterized for me in talking to some farmers from Iowa the other day, and I think their attitudes are probably similar to [those held by people in] other sectors of the economy A couple of them sitting near me said that they had bought some land last year at prices they considered exorbitant but they bought it confidently with the thought that prices would be even more exorbitant this year And they are wondering whether they made a good buy In fact, they're beginning to wonder whether they could sell it or should sell it, but they haven't seen any evidence of a decline in land prices up until now They were getting worried but they hadn't seen anything I suspect that a lot of industrialists are thinking the same thing in their own way The fiscal policy program--and I think it has been underestimated a bit in the public press for a variety of reasons, political and otherwise--I certainly don't think was strong enough to change these attitudes in any significant way It may be to the contrary in the feeling that if anything is going to be done, it's going to be done through the credit policy side  So far as the outlook is concerned, it seems murky to me I hear all these fears of recession and I even share them But if you ask me analytically whether they are any more certain now than they were a year ago when we began hearing the same things, I don't know I am pretty well convinced that it's going to start some time and that  -35-    3/18/80  there's a risk, when it starts, that it may be greater than anybody is projecting But I thought that a year ago, too Just when it will really start, who knows? I know we--all of us, I think--have misjudged the timing again and again I share the thoughts that some people have expressed, most recently Governor Schultz, that we better get this over with in terms of minimizing the total pain over a period of time I am worried about those financial institutions, and the worst thing that can happen to them is [for us to] fail to do the job and get the interest rate turn fairly soon But the way to get the interest rate turned is not by hastening it prematurely If we have another false start, we'll be in considerable trouble even though that clearly runs the risk of overkill That risk is greater in its inverse logic than if it's not killed at all; we'll be faced with the same dilemma later on  In that connection, in getting out of our dilemma as best we can, I put considerable emphasis on one aspect of the voluntary program, which is to get banks to begin saying "no" on some loans and not to put all the pressure on raising the prime rate If the loan demands come home to roost [and they take the latter approach], it will exert pressures throughout the money market as they go out and try to finance the loan increase If we accomplish nothing else in the next few weeks--and I think the time is very short--if we can get that message to the banks and they can get the message to their customers, we have some chance of at least moderating the short-run interest rate pressures I don't think we have a chance of dissipating them but we do of moderating them and getting some element of rationing in the area of the market where it does not now exist, namely among the bigger business borrowers I would urge you to move promptly on that voluntary program and get the questionnaires out and to begin on occasion, or maybe more than on occasion, a consultative process with the banks, particularly the biggest banks in your area very promptly  We have the April problem that has been referred to, and all of these things incline me toward resolving doubts in the direction of greater tightness in the very short run rather than the opposite The worst thing we could do is to indicate some backing off at this point when we have an announced anti-inflation program We have political support and understanding for what we have been doing People don't expect it to be too easy There is an understanding that a lot of burden has been placed on credit policy, and there's a willingness to be supportive for the moment in that connection I would not give all that much weight to the degree of support we're going to get if this is dragged out indefinitely and we have to go through this process once again  Where that leaves me in terms of "B" and "C"--I don't think anybody mentioned "A"--is that at this particular juncture I find the focus a little long, frankly, for me to come to any great conviction between "B" and "C" I share much of Governor Rice's feelings about those alternatives I do attach some significance to the fact that if we took "B" literally, while the numbers as presented on page 6 of the Bluebook look low, [they imply] running above our annual targets in the way we calculate those targets If we were going to be at the midpoint of the annual target, it would require a considerable decline in the second half of the year from the 5-1/4 percent quarterly growth  -36-    3/18/80  pattern implied by "B;" and even "C" is above the midpoint of the annual target for M-1A You are shaking your head "no"  "C" is 5 percent for the first two quarters, as I have calculated it, and the midpoint [of our annual target] is 4-3/4 percent It comes close to the midpoint but is a little above  Oh, there's no question that we have recorded a high number for February, which has contributed to that result But we have recorded it But again, I [wouldn't] worry too much about where this comes out within a range of 1/4 or 1/2 or even 3/4 percentage point on a February-to-June number, since all of those differences are within our normal range of error anyway That doesn't excite me terribly at this point Other people may have different shadings but whether we're looking at "B" or "C" or something in between in the four-month time perspective, I believe it catches the spirit of what a number of people are saying anyway, to say that in the next month or so--certainly before we next meet--we should be leaning toward taking our chances on being certain to be near those numbers in that very short-run period I am not saying we can guarantee that we will be within those ranges at any expense of interest rates or anything else But when we're making up the paths and deciding what the level of borrowing should be or whatever, we ought to be resolving doubts and making sure March is as low as projected and April is no greater than projected or that both of them are lower than projected because that's where our principal vulnerability lies--in this two-month period If April is anywhere near as strong as the New York figures suggest, we'll be above the "B" alternative I feel quite certain that we at least ought to be leaning in the other direction, and reasonably hard, during these next six weeks or so We don't want to give the market a false signal if the money supply comes in very low for a couple of weeks that we are relaxing too quickly during this immediate time frame, when we've just announced these new programs and there is the kind of feeling in the country that I think exists There is plenty of time before June to take account of any shortfalls we might have in the money supply if that happy event should occur in the very immediate future I don't know what the March data are going to show If March came in under Mr Axilrod's projections and we were facing--in terms of our seat-of- the-pants judgment or the pit of our stomach or whatever--the kind of bulge that is projected for April, we ought to be delighted with a low March figure So, I am suggesting that we lean in that direction And whether we come out between "B" and "C" over a four-month perspective concerns me less than [that we take] this posture I have suggested before the next meeting We could reconcile my longer-term concerns by making it someplace between "B" and "C" but in the end I could probably tolerate either But I do feel rather strongly about not giving any false signals in the very short run at the risk of any overkill that might be implied by that  I could, but it's probably going to take a lot of arithmetic here As I say, we're going to be meeting again in a month and we can fine-tune the quarter further then So that really concerns me less than an understanding about what our posture should be in the next month and how we will reconcile all the doubts and errors and fluctuations in figures that we're going to have during that time period Whether it's expressed as aiming at "C" or being extremely resistant to anything above "B" doesn't concern me so much because I don't think those differences are great I would put money in the bank if that happy day arose at the end of March or early April and the bulge that is being projected did not appear in that extreme form  Well, I don't feel terribly strongly about that because we obviously have a very flexible technique for changing that range if the occasion arises But in the spirit of what I am saying, if the Committee wanted to raise it--particularly the upper end--such a decision would reflect the attitude I am talking about I don't know whether we'd have to use [the full range] or not, and there's no implication that we'd go out and use it because it's there I don't have any particular expectations that the rate would have to [reach that upper limit] or that [raising the limit] carries any connotation at all that we will aim at it I do think that we should resolve the doubts on the borrowing number by putting it a little higher rather than a little lower And in that connection, I am not quite sure where we are specifically I have lost track of this recently I know borrowings are running over $3 billion on an average basis, but you were talking about a $2-1/2 billion figure as--  I don't know what the right number is, but assuming you judged those two correctly, I would be inclined to use the higher number I am talking about the very short run for the staff's initial planning Now, if the money supply came in lower, you would reduce it  I think the market is confused at the moment, understandably, about what all these recent actions mean One interpretation is that we would deliberately try to ease pressures on the money market [Market participants] are looking for the substitute in this voluntary program There's another interpretation that says that's not true The former interpretation would not be helpful at this particular point in time, although in a general sense what we're aiming at is partly to avoid the extremes, perhaps, of a further jack up [in interest rates] That's a little different from saying we're aiming to ease from where we are or [unintelligible] of easing from where we are But I have a concern that if things went the wrong way and if people were not over this psychological hump about inflation--which I don't think they are, although we may be beginning to shake people a little--and they relapsed and thought we  -38-    3/18/80  were easing, that would involve the greatest chance that we'd get a continued big loan demand, which would drive up the prime rate and give us higher rates I think we're in a perverse situation here If those commitments are ever drawn upon, the banks are going to be panicky and they're going to be putting their rates way up to protect themselves  So you can have something concrete to shoot at--and let me just say again that the least of my concerns is precisely whether it's "B" or "C" over a full four-month period--and to capture slightly the flavor of what I am saying, let me suggest the following For M-1A, use 2-3/4 percent for the February-to-June number; put the funds range at 14 to 20 percent, say, which again is no goal to shoot at obviously in either direction, but I'm trying to pick up the flavor of what has been said around the table; and aim at $27 or $2-3/4 billion or something like that in borrowings in the very short run And for this immediate period, and I am talking about a few weeks here, let's reconcile doubts in the path-building--which are plenty, given the performance of borrowings recently--on the side of being happier about an undershoot of the present projections for March and April than an overshoot  I missed a little of this Any of the borrowing figures we're talking about now are below the recent level, which raises a little question, I guess  -39-    3/18/80  Well, we just don't know I think that's possible But it's implicit in this that we start at what is a lower level of borrowing than we have had just recently And if the money supply figures were coming in a little high relative to the projections we now have, we might raise [the borrowing level] a bit I guess that's the implication of what we're saying  I find it very difficult to conceive that we're going to get to the lower end of the range before the next meeting anyway This is probably the least important number we put down And from that [perspective], it doesn't bother me  I think we're talking about the visuals of what is announced a month from now and I can't convince myself that this is an absolutely crucial decision One could argue that raising  -40-    3/18/80  the funds range is consistent and reinforces the notion that we're not backing off On the other hand, if we don't change it, it can be interpreted as an indefinite widening of the range  Well, we have a small mechanical problem It is small in one sense; I don't know that it affects anything The staff has written the directive tentatively to include a growth range for the whole first half of the year, which makes it even less sensitive to what we're talking about in the next month or two I don't know whether that's a good way to word it or not The only problem with wording it for the second quarter--and we can all convert this into a second- quarter growth rate--is that we don't know exactly what the [first- quarter] base is at this point The equivalent of what I suggested, which is 2-3/4 percent for 4 months, would be about 4-3/8 percent for the first half And that begins to look a little too fine We could say 4-1/4 percent The last published target we had was 4-1/2 percent for the first quarter, which I take it we will exceed  We can put in 4-1/2 percent for the half- year, which is right on "B" It doesn't capture the flavor that I thought [we might want to convey] of putting it a little below that But in very round numbers, it's not very different When we get down to the point of how to express it within a 1/4 of a point, it's difficult The 4-1/2 percent certainly implies no change It implies a lower growth rate in the second quarter than in the first, given what we know at the moment It's a little easier than I suggested, but I suppose we could take care of that by some language which says that at least for the moment--I am talking about the period to the next meeting--we want to be sure not to exceed [that growth rate]  Yes, maybe we can use that language I think it captures what I am trying to say, maybe better than I said it Well, let me review the bidding here Suppose we put the directive the way it is written [in the Bluebook] and talk about the entire half-year [target as] 4-1/2 percent or a little less For the funds rate range, we would move the upper end to 20 percent On the lower end there's obviously a difference of opinion, which is going to be resolved And in terms of the projections given to us, we will lean to being within those projections for the March-April period in setting the nonborrowed path target, interpreted as $2-3/4 billion of borrowings right now  Based upon the very recent experience, it does look a little low  I am not sure one day's borrowing is--  -41-    3/18/80  I know we don't I think we'd have to say that if we start off there and that level of borrowing appears--though it's never this clear--to be accompanied by a falling federal funds rate and an indication of higher money supply growth, we'd raise [the borrowing level]  What I am trying to get is some flavor We have to make a decision as to where to put [the initial borrowing assumption] I'd be perfectly happy to put it higher and resolve the doubt that way in the first round In any event [the staff] needs to know what we're aiming for I am saying that for the March-April figure together we'd be unhappy if [money growth] were not at that rate and we'd rather tolerate a shortfall Having said that, there's no promise we're going to confine [money growth] to that rate  Well, I don't mean to confine it All I am looking for is some assumption to go on If you want to forget about that, we'll solve it otherwise on the understanding that we're aiming for 4-1/2 percent or a little less [M-1A growth] for the first half of the year Now that brings us basically to "B" or less  We're not talking about minus tenths  SPEAKER(?) Governor Partee, that's a reduction ad absurdum  Well, nobody's talking about more or less being minus ten We'll resolve these doubts on the side of less rather than more And if that gets translated into the March-April number as projected, we'd be happy to come in lower than higher  I resist a little the precision that's implied that we can make it 2 percent less than an uncertain projection that--  Well, that's one way of putting it  I don't think we should kid ourselves, either If the New York projections turned out to be right and there were enormous upward pressure [in April], I don't think we're saying we would raise the federal funds rate to 25 percent in order to get [money growth] down to the plus 6 percent [upper limit of our long- term range for M-1A]  I don't think we're saying that I just wanted to [clarify that]  I think it is correct to say, as of now anyway, that we're not going to resist the April bulge, whatever it is, beyond a federal funds rate of 20 percent  I don't know how to interpret the silence, but maybe we ought to have a vote  The directive will be expressed as 4-1/2 percent for the first half of the year or "a little less," if you want that modifier in there On the funds range, there's some uncertainty here, but I take it the upper end is 20 percent And I don't know [about the lower end] You don't want a change at all, Nancy  Let me just see what the consensus is [One option is that] we don't move the lower end but put the upper end at 20 percent And that would be all that appears in the directive for this discussion, right?  I suppose the M-1B that is consistent would be 5 percent or a little less  "Somewhat less" Operationally we understand that And there would be some language in the discussion to reflect--though I'd hardly put it in these terms--that we want to take particular care not to exceed that rate in the period immediately ahead To remain within [the six-month target] is roughly the way to say it, I guess, as the March-April average would work out We won't put the borrowing [assumption] in the directive, but you understand what the implications are for that So, the precise specifications are only the first two numbers, but there will be discussion [in the policy record] about the importance, during the period immediately ahead, of resisting an increase in the money supply beyond this six- month target  What is the average?  Well, I think we can take care of that in the discussion I was just trying to avoid some wording that relied upon an internal projection  That seems to be the only element on which there may be some substantial disagreement Do you want to vote on the other parts and leave that open or vote on the whole thing? Let's do it the other way around and see how many Committee members want to move to a 14 percent [lower limit] as proposed That seems rather reasonable to me Let's look at two choices at this point Move it to 14 percent or leave it where it is Who wants to leave it where it is?  Who wants to move it to 14?  And I didn't vote I assume we have one or two [who didn't express a preference]  Well, do we have a consensus at 13 percent?  -45-    3/18/80  Let me just try 13 and see whether that--  Well, I just don't know the strength of conviction of the various sides here But if we make a Solomonic judgment--  Let me just try the 4-1/2 percent for six months and the formal specification of 13 to 20 percent, which has the merit of being a compromise if nothing else Is that generally acceptable? Okay, let's vote  Oh gosh, poor M2 got lost in the shuffle  We'll let that stand Shall we have the "about"?  Okay?  Can we say that for the first half of the year? I would agree with the thrust of what you're saying, that something here in the directive would be useful  It's already in for the whole year, but it's not--  I wonder whether we shouldn't try to get something in this directive Maybe we just can't put a number in at this point but we can say "taking account of the need for restraint on bank credit" or some language of that sort  Well, let's see if we're in agreement We'll try to work on some phrase, which probably has to be qualitative rather than quantitative for the six-month period, and get it in there And let's get some discussion in the earlier nondirective part [of the policy record] about the importance of bank credit, too  Yes Maybe that's the way to put it in "Taking account of the need for a slowing in the rate of growth of bank credit over the next few months, consistent with the objective for the year"  There are a couple of other items that we should be taking up, if I can find [my agenda] We have the [proposal] regarding the authorization for domestic open market operations To the best of my knowledge there have been no questions raised about that If we can get that approved, it would be helpful  Without objection, that is approved The same for the authorization for foreign currency operations No questions have been raised  SPEAKER(?) So moved  What is that, Mr Altmann?  Without objection Now we go to the authority for lending securities This is more substantive We've reviewed this at intervals, quite a few intervals I take it the proposal is to continue it unchanged If nobody has any problems with that, I would hope we could approve that with equal expedition  SPEAKER(?) So moved  SPEAKER(?) Second  Without objection, that's approved The warehousing of foreign currencies, I think, falls in the same category If you want to have a discussion of that, I would propose a very short-term approval of [the current procedures] and consider it at a meeting when we have time to discuss it But if it doesn't need any discussion, we'll approve it for another year  SPEAKER(?) So moved  SPEAKER(?) Second  -48-    3/18/80 -49-  Without objection, it's approved for another year The only remaining item we have is the date of the next meeting, Tuesday, April 22  SPEAKER(?) So moved  Approved without objection Thank you  END OF MEETING       Can we come to order, ladies and gentlemen? I am delighted to say that our Vice Chairman, Mr Solomon, who was duly elected in absentia last time, is with us today Welcome to your first meeting I am sure you'll find out about the wonderful ways of the Open Market Committee very quickly First, we have the minutes  Without objection, we will approve the minutes Mr Pardee  Comments or questions?  The consumer price index isn't going to come down for three months  What are German interest rates doing? Are they off their peak or not?  What were they at the peak?  It's not appreciably off the peak  Any other questions?  Mr Winn  What is the capital conversion situation now? Have the Germans stopped that?  But we're not getting any now  If they had them, presumably we would get them But they just haven't had any  The trouble with declines in the dollar is that they get a certain momentum of their own  We need a motion to ratify the transactions  Without objection As for recommendations with respect to operations, we took an action last month regarding these forwards with the Bundesbank, which we would turn over to the Treasury I would hope that we could still do that I take it that the Bundesbank is taking the position that if we have any swaps outstanding, we have to use [the proceeds] first for that I don't know if you can arrange to get the swap repaid before then, Mr Pardee If not, let's negotiate vigorously so that the Treasury gets [the funds]  Mr Sternlight  Mr Balles    4/22/80  In April 1975 we were just coming out of recession  Mr Baughman    4/22/80  Mr Black  Mr Roos  If there are no other comments, we have to ratify the transactions  SPEAKER(?) So moved  Without objection, they are ratified Let's turn to the staff report on the economic situation  Since we've identified with such accuracy past financial relationships, I think we ought to have our economist discuss prospective financial relationships  We can have some general comments about the economic situation and policy implications and we'll return to a more precise discussion after an initial go-around Mr Winn  I think it's fair to ask questions at this time, too  Let me say in connection with all of these confusing money figures and related numbers, that we took some actions in March that were unusual, to say the least, on consumer credit, on the voluntary program, on the money market funds, and all the rest And we had interest rates at levels nobody ever saw before I suspect this has led to some uncertainty and adjustments of a magnitude we can't quantify very well We may have had a lot of "money" held in the form of Treasury bills for instance; we just don't know It's not in our M2 and M3 figures I suspect there may be something to what    4/22/80  Fred said--and we will not find out until later--in that a lot of people may be scared about consumer credit, and they may now be taking some money out of the bank and repaying their charge cards or something else It's just a very uncertain period, too uncertain to reach conclusive judgments about anything Unfortunately, we only find out about these things later when we get more numbers and get some more perspective as to whether we are getting a rebound or not We just don't know at this stage Mr Roos  You don't want to express any judgment about the persuasive powers of the Chairman, Mr Axilrod? [Laughter] They are limited I would say  The only answer I could give you is that we would get a mixed reaction Some people will believe it People of monetarist persuasion will believe it more than others Some people don't believe the underlying theory, so they have no reason to believe it And there will be people in between But I don't know whether there will be more or less [confusion] There was certainly a lot of confusion in late November, December, and early January for a variety of reasons People saw the reserve figures going up, which was one confusing aspect The money supply figures weren't going up, particularly, but the reserve figures were; and interest rates were going down We get all different constellations of events But I think you are misled if you think that pure persuasion is going to convince people It may have an impact, but we are going to get mixed reactions  That's probably right People believe what they want to believe If they saw the inflation rate coming down, they would be more persuaded But we are in this unfortunate position where I suspect the consumer price index, anyway, is going to remain at or above--or maybe if we are really lucky a little below-- its current level for three months because of the extraneous question of the oil import fee and the way the interest rates get factored into that We probably will have three months of that, which will carry us into July Now, maybe if we are lucky, the producer price index will begin showing some declines; that depends partly I suppose on how they treat the oil import fee in the producer price index I don't think [the impact] is negligible We are far better off if we see the aggregates under clear control and a given interest rate movement than if we see the aggregates shooting up and interest rates going down; the latter would be the worst of all worlds Governor Wallich  Our present target is not 5 percent It's 4-1/2 percent or somewhat less  Mr Black  April is pretty well gone, I'm afraid  Mr Morris  Mr Baughman  Governor Partee  Mr Balles  Mr Guffey  Mr Mayo    4/22/80  Mr Eastburn  Governor Rice  Governor Teeters  No one else has volunteered but there are a few people [who have not commented], like Mr Willes  Governor Schultz  I guess we've left you the unusual privilege of going last, Mr Solomon  Well, why don't we have a break and come back to this and be more operational in our comments after the break?  [Coffee break]  Let me distill a bit what I think I'm hearing and what I'm thinking The big change we've had--though we've had a lot of changes since the last meeting--is that we certainly have some evidence of an economic decline that we didn't have before I for one still think it's a little premature to make very conclusive judgments about what kind of a recession we're going to have I'd say also that it takes a little while to meet the definition of a recession We've been fooled before I do think that in all probability we are going to have a recession What makes it a little riskier than before, and I thought it was risky before, is partly that special credit restraint program I think it did send a message to the consumer and others psychologically and we may get a more sudden reversal in consumer spending than in some sense we'd like Consumer spending was very high relatively, as you know; and if there's an attempt even just to make it normal relative to income, that would involve a big change in economic activity, which would then reflect back on the other sectors of the economy we've been reasonably confident about--inventories, and plant and equipment, and all the rest On the other hand, we've already had a substantial adjustment in housing and domestic car sales  You know, the car business is interesting The first-quarter selling rate was not bad at all, but a lot of it was imports The domestic car companies just can't sell anything other than four- cylinder front wheel drives, and that's not likely to change in a hurry But it's a little extraneous--not in its impact in economic activity but in its causation, although I'm sure it's complicated by the credit situation All I'd say is that there is some uncertainty, particularly when one looks at the other side and the inflation side Two months ago everybody was going for leather and wanting to buy in anticipation of inflation; I think that mood has changed  But when attitudes fluctuate as rapidly as they have, it's a little premature to say attitudes couldn't relapse the other way And looking at a longer-term perspective, there's no question in my mind that in considerable part inflation is what got us into this dilemma And it is recognized as a major problem Indeed, all things  -21-    4/22/80  considered--the amount of pain going on in the housing sector, agriculture, small businesses, and elsewhere--we have a considerable amount of support for keeping the inflation [problem] out in the forefront among the public at large and more directly politically We get a lot of criticism these days, and I don't want to underestimate that; but there's also quite a lot of understanding about what we've been up to and the importance of it Certainly the Administration has taken a cautious view and has gotten out in front on the credit program itself in terms of the extraordinary credit measures, and apparently it is willing to live with that All of this has given rise to an immense amount of confusion in the minds of the public, as nearly as I can read it, which may increase the risks of a substantial recession But it's entirely premature to think that [people] have forgotten about inflation, particularly when they're going to be faced with these high price numbers for a number of months ahead In that sense I don't think we're in a situation where there's any course of action that is risk-free or even in some sense a "winning" course of action because there's a lot to be lost by a resurgence in inflationary expectations and there's a lot to be lost by accelerating the recession; and I'm not sure that there's any real room between those two contingencies It has been implicit in everybody's comments that we have to keep our eyes on both [inflation and recession] as best we can All I'm saying is that I don't think there's any perfect answer or any right answer that goes between them  So far as interest rates are concerned, we ought to remind ourselves, as a number of people here have, that they were extraordinarily high and that there is some psychological feeling about [letting] them go down But they weren't all that low in January and February, and anything we're talking about in terms of a range of interest rates is still an increase over roughly a 6-week period Markets are always going to be more suspicious of our intentions when rates are on the way down But I don't want to lose all perspective; I suspect anything we come up with is not going to be, in a broader perspective, a very low level of interest rates The international [situation] is hard to figure Just in the past couple of weeks it has been perhaps typical that the dollar got very weak before interest rates really came down--or at least rates had only gone down a little--on the suspicion that they were coming down And since they actually came down the dollar hasn't been strong but it hasn't been under enormous pressure either, presumably in part because [the decline] was anticipated by the earlier turn of events I don't know quite what [markets] are anticipating now, but I'm sure in the end that that's going to be affected by a feeling of confidence about [our policy] more than a specific level of interest rates, within some limited range anyway It may be that changes affect psychology more than amounts; I don't want to discount that as being a very tricky problem, but I don't think we know just how it's going to break precisely  In terms of specifics, we started out talking to some degree in polarities here--whether we should keep to the targets or whether we shouldn't in some extreme It is easy to conclude in the early part, not so much in the latter part, that the extremes are overstated I'm not very happy just in a tactical sense--in terms of figuring out what to do next and the psychology and all the rest--that we had this decline last week in the money supply But we have to remind ourselves that that was one week and that April is one month    4/22/80  and God knows what [the money supply] will do next week and next month We just don't know If we keep this in any kind of longer- term perspective, such as what has happened since October, the general judgment one would come to is that we're pretty much on target If these money figures mean something over a period of time--and we've always said that they're relevant in a 6-month to 1-year perspective-- if we go back a year, we're above our present targets but we're pretty clearly in a moderating phase Even if we look at them in a quarterly perspective, the first quarter on a quarterly average basis was a little higher than our target but December-to-March was lower than our target Just how one puts these numbers together makes some difference I don't want to put too much importance [on one week], although I personally would have been happier if that last drop in April hadn't come about  I don't think we can throw everything out of perspective [because of] one week or even one month I would assume from what people have said, and I certainly agree myself, that we're going to keep with this general targeting procedure and keep with the general targets that we have It's a question of how to implement them We are very uncertain about the short-run projections, as uncertain as we have ever been, after just having gone through much of April where everybody was projecting a big bulge on the up side and instead we are getting a bulge on the down side And we're not only uncertain about the projections Unfortunately, we are probably more uncertain now than before--given the special credit programs, given the psychological confusion in the markets, and given the confusion more generally--about just what these fine new techniques we have that look all right in the 6-month perspective mean in a 2-month perspective Just where to set the level of borrowings and the nonborrowed reserve path is not exactly a science at this point And that is the real judgment I think we have to make  So, it seems to me, in general terms, we are sticking with the targets Alternative B is roughly what we have now I say roughly; I guess it is precisely the targets we have now except that we added the proviso "or somewhat less" [at the March meeting] As a first approximation, I would think something like that and maintaining the "or somewhat less" [proviso], particularly in the light of what I will say next, is appropriate It comes down to a question of how to manage it If we take literally what the Bluebook says--and I'm not sure how much money one should put on these precise relationships, as I implied before, but we don't have anything better at the moment-- we're talking about a general judgment based on the work we have done of a level of borrowing, at the start anyway, of something like $1-3/4 billion That in Mr Axilrod's judgment, around which I would surround considerable uncertainty, implies a federal funds rate of around 16 percent or maybe a little higher at the moment  Actually it included about $500 million of [borrowing by] First Pennsylvania, so one might say the equivalent is a little higher than that to allow for the fact that they are borrowing $600 million at this point But that's fine-tuning It's  -23-    4/22/80  not all that far from where we are There has been a lot of talk about interest rates I suppose what people mean when they say interest rates is the federal funds rate We've had quite a decline in market rates, particularly in the long-term rates relative to the normal fluctuation in long-term rates They've gone back three- fourths or more of the [amount] they went up in January and February Some long-term rates may be very close to where they were in January; the CD rates seem to have moved down faster than the federal funds rate The Treasury bill rate is down to 12 percent, plus or minus, depending upon which [maturity] you look at As Peter said earlier, that's down 3 percentage points or more from the peaks So in terms of the interest rates people are looking at in the market, there's probably room here for a decline in the federal funds rate that wouldn't even be reflected much in these market rates because it has already been anticipated in some sense I don't know whether that's fair or not We just don't know how it will hit the markets psychologically because people may then anticipate the next move in the federal funds rate  But I do recognize in making the judgment about where we set the borrowing level, consistent with our techniques and amid all the uncertainties, that there are some implications for interest rates There is a little danger, particularly in the short run, because we don't know what all these recent money supply figures mean Among the unfortunate things that could happen--and there are quite a few of them--if we propelled the funds rate to the extreme low end [of the "B" range], it could get low enough so that it affects the whole string of market rates If we began getting in May and June increases [in the money supply] of 9, 10, 11 percent or generally in the high area, which is what the econometric relationships would say, in a month or two months from now we're going to be saying that we have to pull back in the other direction And presumably at that point the recession would have moved somewhat further and I suspect we'd be in an extremely awkward position at that time of not being very eager to [tighten] Perhaps I've leaned too far toward the risks, whether in the exchange market or more importantly--and I don't think they're unrelated--of in some sense having given up and [seeing] inflationary expectations rise again, having been [unintelligible] to a degree And then, as I say, if the aggregates were really running high in a relatively short time period, having been through a rather futile experience in this difficult business, we will be sitting here facing exactly the opposite dilemma we are in today of saying to ourselves How much do we really want to tighten--tighten in the sense of interest rates or borrowing--at this point?  What I am suggesting is that I'm not sure we have to make a change in the basic aggregates decision we made last time Monetary growth is running short of that at the moment, which definitely implies some relaxation of money market pressures and the borrowing level We've already gone some distance in that direction; we'd go somewhat more We would expect to see the federal funds rate decline from its present level I don't know what that means for market rates I'd suspect, if anything, not much change to some further decline If Steve is right, that means 16 percent plus or minus on the federal funds rate in the short run I don't think we can be sure of that, but let's say he's right; I don't know what range to put around it But with a 4 percentage point range we can feel our way ahead on that perspective We meet again in four weeks according to  -24-    4/22/80  our present schedule; that's an unusually short period of time By that time we will know whether we're getting some reaction or whether the straightforward projections of the money supply are being borne out I do not mean that we would not in the normal course of events make some further judgment on the reserve path and the borrowing path if the money supply continued to be weak in the next four weeks The option is clearly open--I don't know whether I want to pin it down precisely but we can do so if you want--to consult, if in my judgment the degree of decline in the federal funds rate seems to be troublesome in terms of interpretations of our policy, whether those interpretations were manifested domestically or internationally We can always have a consultation, and I certainly would be prepared to do that But I think we ought to recognize that the probability is that there will be some decline in the federal funds rate Again, I don't know what that means for other interest rates, but the short- term outlook would definitely be for a decline in the federal funds rate as we see it today Now, if we suddenly get a burst in the money supply figures, maybe that won't amount to much [of a decline]; but if we had a great drag in the money supply figures, we would [expect] some decline fairly immediately I don't know what the funds rate is doing now Peter, but--  --with the high level of borrowings earlier this week and some softness in the money market today and presumably even more tomorrow, it will already have pointed in that direction because the level of borrowings currently is too high It's very simple in a technical sense, I suppose, [for the funds rate] to persist at a lower level next week That's what one would expect the market to do under these conditions I think that's a fairly clear outlook for the very immediate future It probably will be in the 16 to 17 percent area by the end of next week anyway, maybe throughout the week, just on this kind of decision which is basically an alternative B decision I think that's where I would leave it  One could argue either side of this You could say that you don't quite believe Mr Sternlight--and I would agree that there's a lot of uncertainty--and that the business scene is so uncertain you would push for more money [growth] and take a much lower federal funds rate in the process I suggested why I think that may be imprudent in the very short run You can take the opposite view and say it's too much risk, so let's not have the federal funds rate decline at all I think that would probably be a mistake in this period, too I'd play it in between, which happens to come out [to alternative B]  No, I'm just telling you where I think the funds rate is likely to be with [an alternative B] borrowing target  We won't know that in the short run, so I'm really talking about what we will do in the next two or three  -25-    4/22/80  weeks We're going to meet again in four weeks We will know more, obviously, two or three weeks from now, and we may want a consultation I'm just setting the dial at the moment and telling you what I think the result will be I say it with some temerity or some uncertainty because we don't know all that much about these relationships in the short run But that is my best guess The dispersion around the guess is rather wide I myself suspect that the risk, if that's the right way to put it, would be that the funds rate would come out a little lower rather than a little higher than what Steve has suggested All I'm suggesting is that we adopt this course and rely upon him for giving us the best single point estimate in a very uncertain situation  I'm saying basically that something like "B" looks right--or, more specifically, what we adopted last time, which is now "B" in terms of the December-to-June period as a whole, or 4-1/2 percent growth just looking at M-1A We said about the same thing for the others Technically we said "or somewhat less" for M-1B and M-1A And we said what for M2  So this alternative does have a lower figure for M2 than we had last time, reflecting the decline in M2 I think what has happened in M2, certainly in part, is that we just shut off the money market funds; and I'm sure there was some substitution between money market funds and Treasury bills, which are not in M2 So I'm not certain that involves a real or substantive economic difference It just reflects what we count in M2 and what we don't count in M2 If we look at M-1A and M-1B, alternative B with the proviso "or somewhat less" is precisely what we decided last time The difference, of course, is that growth has to be much faster than that in the last two months to come up into that range, which is why the level of borrowing is being reduced from $2-3/4 billion or whatever we had last time to $1-3/4 billion  That depends It gives a little feeling of how cautious we want to be about moving down the borrowing level I will say instead of the interest rate level If we say "or somewhat less," there's a little more room for being a bit more cautious in moving down the borrowing level  In any event, consistent with "B," we'd have to move it down There's no question about that  I think what we're really saying is roughly $1-1/4 billion plus whatever that emergency borrowing or seasonal borrowing or whatever happens to be  In that connection, Steve, remind me What has borrowing been ex this special borrowing situation?  Another thing is that if we had the regular discount rate at 16 percent, I think we'd be pretty sure the federal funds rate would not rapidly go much below 16 percent Whether our surcharge exerts any drag at all on the funds rate as it goes down to 16 percent isn't clear But there's very little borrowing at that rate except for the special situation My own guess is that it would exert a very minor drag rather than a really strong drag  By rates you're talking about the federal funds rate basically?  Yes I realize that, but you said your guess is around 16 to 17 percent or somewhat lower I guess that means 16 percent  But it also implies in the normal course of our operations that if the money supply in the next week or two continued weak, assuming for the moment that Steve is right, [the funds rate] would be lower [Money growth] would have to be quite a lot stronger probably [for the funds rate] to be much higher But I have no particular feeling about the federal funds rate range we have [in alternative B] It might be logical to reduce the upper end since--  Or 18 percent  I personally wouldn't like to see it go up to 20 percent again I'm not at all sure I'd want to see it go up to 19 percent  We're talking a little out of perspective In perspective, with this unexpected drop [in M1] last week from a level that was already running a bit low, we start from a lower base; but it's still one week's figure and heaven knows what the future will bring We can't all be speaking Mr Winn  Not beyond what I said But if you're interpreting what I said as "pumping," it is "pumping" a bit    4/22/80  Well, let's get some other comments  Mr Roos  Governor Wallich  Who else wants to say something?  It's one of those things you're better off not looking into too closely!  Mr Morris  The implication, in terms of a consultation, is that we would have a combination of two things We can make a formal decision on it if you want to, but we would have a combination of a weak money supply and a sharply declining funds rate If the money supply were not coming in very low, we wouldn't face the interest rate constraint so to speak So the consultation would basically be about the money supply coming in low or the interest rate coming in low, whichever way you want to look at it, because presumably it would be the same [phenomenon]  I think you're probably overstating the possible significance of what would be happening in a 2- or 3-week    4/22/80  period I think what you say is true if one looked at it in a long enough perspective But we're dealing with uncertain seasonal adjustment factors, uncertain week-to-week numbers, and an extremely uncertain relationship between borrowings and the money supply in a 2- or 3-week time period That is all we're talking about  I don't know who has not talked yet I don't think you have, Emmett  Who else has comments? I seem to have a number of Committee members who haven't--  Well, let me fine-tune this a bit further, if I can, after listening to people here What I would continue to propose is the same language in the directive that we had last time, which in some sense is "B" minus It's this language of "B" [Ml growth] or somewhat less, which has some significance I don't feel strongly about the federal funds rate, but there seem to be more  -32-    4/22/80  people who would like to knock it down to 19 percent, I guess, Murray In thinking about the borrowing again and listening to these comments, I would modify what I said to this extent I'd suggest that we start out with $1-1/2 billion with the intention, if in the next week or so the money supply were developing more or less as projected, of it probably being at $1-1/4 billion in the second week or the third week from now I'm just being slightly more cautious; if the money supply were kicking up above what we're now projecting, we'd probably stay at the $1-1/2 billion for a while  Yes, these figures all exclude the big bank borrowings So that's a slight modification toward a little more caution than has been suggested  I guess so, but the last two weeks would be affected by what happens We might move a little more rapidly toward the $1-1/4 billion if money came in low; or if it came in high, we would--  If the money supply were right on the present projections, we'd presumably get down to $1-1/4 billion  Two weeks from now, yes  Well, we have to have some flexibility here But it's useful to discuss this just to get some sense of which way the caution should be exercised in the short run What we're saying, I think, is that we want to see some increase in the money supply, first of all, to meet these targets We are willing to see some short-run decline in the federal funds rate to achieve that, and that is reflected in the lower borrowing figure But there's also a healthy feeling of caution about not moving so fast that we have to reverse ourselves So that caution is expressed in going down tentatively over a period of time on the borrowing number That's in substance the way I would interpret [this directive] That leaves Henry with some concern Does that help you infinitesimally?    4/22/80  There's very little borrowing at that rate now  That's a separate decision Obviously, it would raise the question at the very least How much pressure it will bring I suppose is a judgment as to whether we want to give that kind of overt signal at that particular point in time There's no doubt that the question will arise I'm not sure it would arise very forcibly at 16 percent, but if the funds rate began to go below 16 percent, then the question would arise  Well, I think we've accepted this kind of operation where the path is set consistent with the 4-1/2 percent but we have a slightly higher borrowing figure at the beginning than the one in the center of Steve's frequency distribution I happen to think that frequency distribution is a rather flat bell instead of a--  Well, are we ready to vote?    4/22/80  I think I have the message on consultation Don't hold me to an exact number If the federal funds rate drops to 16 percent on one day, on Wednesday afternoon or even on another day, don't stay right close to the telephone If there's a problem in that area, I'll let you know I have a sense that if the money supply is running low and interest rates seem to be going down below that level, people want a checkpoint And I understand that  I understand [the thinking] about the 16 percent But the real sense of what we're saying, consistent with these directions, is that if the money supply persists in coming in low, that is what is going to make the interest rate go down So we could state it as--  Consultation if the money supply doesn't seem to be coming up Are you ready to vote?  [To complete the agenda] I just have to remind you that there is a meeting set for Tuesday, May 20  We have a little time, and I won't take all of it But a memo was distributed to you and we thought we would have a discussion today, though not a prolonged one, of these different ideas of reserve --what do we call it, Mr Axilrod? It's not reserve management; that has the wrong connotation It's reserve computation, I guess  SPEAKER(?) Various reserve proposals  The Board, of course, openly will have to decide that That material has been sent out to all the Reserve Banks  -35-    4/22/80  and there is going to be a meeting of the Bank economists about it, isn't there, Steve?  Pending that discussion, any recommendations have been left out of that document That is my understanding; I have not read it myself  We've changed laws these days  This is just your opportunity, if you had a chance to read it, to convey any violent feelings you might have had about something left out of this or any tentative conclusions  No The final decision is going to be a Board of Governors decision That's right  Are we going to be able to have a discussion about it next month, in substance, do you think?  The schedule will be that first it will go through the Reserve Bank economists together with the Board economists    4/22/80  Then the document is going to be modified to reflect the discussion and it will presumably have some recommendations, or differing recommendations, at that point  Right So we will try to schedule a substantive discussion of this at the time of our meeting prior to the Board of Governors having to decide this  Yes My problem with this in part is that whatever is nice conceptually, given all the other burdens put on the Reserve Banks--or all of us at this point--with the membership and the special program and the seasonal borrowing privilege and the operational problems, this may create [problems] for the banks on top of all the other things they're doing now at our request We have a real hazard I think we have to make a pretty persuasive argument, particularly if we're going to do it quickly on top of all these other things I think one can draw the opposite implication That if it's a marginally good idea and we want to do it but [our desire is] not overwhelming, we might want to wait a while just to let the banks get out from under some of these other special things we're imposing on them now  I must say that is one view on the Board staff We're going to have to get these techniques out now They really are going to be tested But it's going to be impossible to run on our current method after September 1st--with all the phase-in, phase-down, sideways movements, [vault cash] counting as reserves, and not counting as reserves--because we won't know what we're doing  SPEAKER(?) Mr Axilrod doesn't fully share that view, I presume  We'll be no worse off to we'll be in an impossible [position] And some people think there's no difference between those two  SPEAKER(?) Well, at least we'll have better data I think that will be a big step forward  [Unintelligible] then the assumption is interesting enough Again, this may be a minority view But the    4/22/80  estimate of the nonmember banks is that the way we do it now will be better than if they were reporting daily for some indefinite period  SPEAKER(?) I have to mention the credit unions  Sure  I have a gut reaction, but let's see what Governor Schultz's gut reaction is first  Well, it's a little early to judge that, I would think And it's very hard to lay down any sense of rigidity about this But as a matter of common sense, take your case You have banks who probably are not unlike what we are finding in a lot of areas You say [loans] are increasing at an annual rate of 12 or 12-1/2 percent for the first three months or a bit more than three months  SPEAKER(?) That's an average So presumably half of them are well above that  First of all, that's not a figure that's absolutely out of sight And second, you say [that credit growth] is slowing down It seems to me you should have a consultation with those banks, as Fred is suggesting But you're not in a situation where you would jump up and down on the table or whatever and say they  -38-    4/22/80  have to be back within 9 percent by a certain date You say "Look, you were a little high or were quite high in the early part of the year; the most recent information we have shows it slowing down, and we presume it's going to continue to slow down You have a program in place and all the rest and we'll look at you again next month and see if it has continued to slow" But you don't tell them to stop making loans at this point to get within 9 percent in the next 30 days or 60 days or 90 days  Well, to the extent we have a regional problem-- I don't know if other people have a sense of this at this point Well, here's a question Suppose there is a 20 percent loan growth in a particular bank Is that something we should stomp on?  But if you had a bank with 20 percent [loan growth] and it's not in a priority area, I think you have to be tougher on that bank than on a bank that's way below and consistent with the program I don't think we can just say that the program [does not apply] for that banker when he comes in with a 20 percent figure That's in the interest of fairness, I agree  SPEAKER(?) I'd look foolish  SPEAKER(?) If our economic projections are correct, then we ought to be phasing out this program in about two months anyway  At an annual rate? That surprises me Well, you have no problem  I'd say this isn't the time to stomp on them the way we would if the economy were running away  Were there any other feelings on this, while we're on the subject? I was going to [bring this] up after lunch    4/22/80  SPEAKER(?) I don't want this analogy to sound too strange, but I think credit controls are little like the Vietnam war We need to decide earlier rather than later to declare that we've won and pull out And it seems to me that we have a particularly difficult problem with some regional differences that in a way are discriminatory As a consequence, the sooner the overall situation allows us to say "Okay, we've done it and we can now scrap it," the better off we will be because we are putting some institutions--through no fault of their own, really--through a harder vise than other institutions And that's one of the undesirable effects  I think that's right to an extent, and nobody is going to be [happier than I] to get rid of [the program] when the time comes It's just a question of when the time is [right] psychologically, which is difficult [to gauge] But given the situation we're in now, as opposed to two months ago before we had the program, I'd say we can afford to be a little more understanding of a bank that has a legitimate regional growth problem That was within the framework of the original program anyway; it was just a question of how it should be administered  SPEAKER(?) Well, that's very helpful  SPEAKER(?) It looks to me as if oil and gas loans ought to be priority items, too, if we can extend that priority list  MSTEETERS Not publicly  SPEAKER(?) Hang in there, Nancy  Of course the problem, I suspect, is that many oil and gas people are not getting the loans that they wanted But the language that we use to one bank--  SPEAKER(?) I know  --has to be reasonably consistent with what we say to another bank If a banker says "Gee, I talked to Bob Black and he told me I could draw all the oil I wanted in West Virginia" and then some other banker says "That's not the message I got from Willis Winn"--  SPEAKER(?) [Unintelligible] in Cleveland  By and large I think you can be tough on the qualitative guidelines [unintelligible] gas drilling, but I don't think you should be giving them any sense that this is an open season on takeover loans or silver loans or something like that  -40-    4/22/80 -41-  SPEAKER(?) We'll regard this as a dance instruction We'll tip-toe around it until it is demised  Any other comments on this program?  SPEAKER(?) Let's go to lunch!  END OF MEETING       Good morning, gentlemen We only met a week ago but the markets have moved and the money supply has moved Perhaps we better have Mr Axilrod tell us how they have moved  Would you like to add anything, Mr Sternlight?  he al  How would you characterize market gossip and attitudes?    4/29/80  SEVERAL We can't hear  Well, he can repeat that and answer my further question  Do you have anything to add from the perspective of the foreign markets, Mr Pardee?  I'm tempted to ask why they consider that a problem  Where is the dollar/mark now?  The only thing I have to add by way of any information is that I think it's very likely that we will get an increase in the German discount rates this week--not necessarily presented as a great tightening of money, but there it is  As Mr Axilrod described, we have a situation where, because the money supply and therefore the reserve need is even less than we thought at the time of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, the federal funds rate has already in the last day and a half moved below the range that we talked about as a checkpoint I suppose one could argue, if one were in that mood, that it has already gone further than it should, on a timing basis anyway We could leave it alone around this area but say that we would be disturbed about further immediate declines Or at the other extreme we could say that we would not be disturbed about further declines We do have an official checkpoint It is the boundary limit in the present directive We don't have to do anything here about changing the directive but I would appreciate any comments that members of the Committee have at this point  With an error range of plus or minus 10 percent!  I'm waiting for substantive reactions, yes  Okay Governor Wallich  Governor Partee  Governor Rice  Mr Winn  I'm a little surprised at all these comments that people agree with Governor Partee's analysis of the business outlook I don't, if I interpret him correctly I think the economy may well be declining rapidly now; I'm not sure what that means for the future I suspect we had a decline in retail sales The question is whether it will level off and go up again or whether    4/29/80  it will continue to decline and I don't see any evidence bearing on the issue I want to insert [that comment] here  Who has not been heard from here? Governor Schultz  We have a difference of opinion obviously, if we express it in terms of interest rates, and I don't think we should do that directly Let me just see how this situation lies I think we ought to talk about the level of borrowings--presumably that's consistent with the way we're going about [conducting policy]-- and not about a level of interest rates What did you say the current level of borrowing is?  I don't entirely follow that when the level of borrowings is so high this week, which I think is what Nancy is asking Why is the level of borrowing so high?  Your current path is based upon $900 million of borrowing?  Well, I'm thinking that the obvious thing may be just to maintain--in the short run anyway--that $900 million, which is what fell out anyway That is $600 million lower than we were talking about a week ago And then let's see what the next figures bring or whatever  I'm talking about a short time period here We'll get a new money supply figure shortly and we will get some other evidence But I think this is fully consistent with what we said We're going through the checkpoint In a sense we relaxed the $1-1/2 billion that we started with because it falls out And we're saying let it fall out I don't see any need for any specific decision other than that we're saying we should stay more or less on the path We're not leaning over backwards to push it up, along the line of reasoning that Steve suggested could be used, but we're not deliberately pulling back either  Well, the resistance still comes at 13 percent, of course, in a firm way I guess what we're saying is that we don't want to manage the rate in this area But from some points of view--it depends upon how you want to argue--the $900 million of borrowing could be considered to be too high if you really wanted to push the money supply with maximum force In that sense, we're taking account of it  By "floor" you mean [the funds rate] is not likely to go to 13 percent  Without allowing anything for the surcharge  Well, it's a fine judgment I don't think there is any obvious answer It will be wrong if the money supply very promptly goes up again in some sense It will be wrong in the other direction, I suppose, if the economy really is weak and the money supply turns out to be as weak as some of the more pessimistic views The funds rate seems to me a little high relative to other market rates Is that a fair conclusion? I don't think a decline in the funds rate in itself implies much change in other rates  It depends upon which rates one looks at, I suppose It seems to me a little high relative to the bill rate, and some government rates It may be not high relative to the CD rate and--  I think there's a reluctance by more than half of the members of the Committee to see that happen But we're saying we're not guiding it that directly  If it happened in the pursuit of a conservative path, we're saying it's going to happen But I assure you, from my listening to the comments anyway, that more than half the members of the Committee are not going to be joyous about it and would be much happier if it stayed someplace around 14 percent It's roughly a 50/50 split So I think we're reflecting that by not moving the borrowing as rapidly as it could be moved  Yes Okay, as I said, I don't think this requires any vote We're just confirming the [existing] directive Thank you  END OF SESSION  -10-     I think we should proceed, even though some of the Board members have not yet arrived, because I have very little time myself Mr Axilrod, why don't you proceed?  The general question we face here, to which no one knows the answer, is how forceably we have to push in reserves to get the money supply turned around or what influence that has on the federal funds rate We are operating in an area in which we haven't operated before under the present technique But it seems quite clear that if we do not change the federal funds rate constraint, we will simply be operating at a 13 percent level of the federal funds rate indefinitely without any assurance, and with a probability, that that will not in the short run turn the money supply around The question in my mind is how much additional leeway should be given I suspect that 12 percent [as a lower limit] will mean that we will operate with a 12 percent federal funds rate, so I would propose going somewhat below that My own hope would be that the funds rate won't necessarily decline all that much further with the necessary injection of reserves But we don't know, and I think we ought to give ourselves a little more leeway I would suggest 11 percent as a possibility, but people could talk about other numbers as well We meet in two weeks; whether that kind of adjustment will hold us until then I do not know It all depends upon what happens to the data, what happens to reserves, and what happens to interest rates during that period We could have a little more leeway if we moved it down to 10 percent, which is still consistent more or less with the present level of market rates for instruments other than federal funds But that presumably would also be consistent with further declines in those rates It would give us more opportunity to be sure that the reserve base was performing the way it's supposed to perform But that's a matter of choice I think we have to make some reduction, and it's a question of how much I will stop right there  Other comments?  I'm aware of that [risk] We've been pretty lucky in escaping it so far I think we've fairly largely escaped it I do not have a lot of time, so I hope the comments can be kept fairly brief Maybe we could hear from the members first  Do you have to take any action the rest of this week?  I thought it depended upon the reserve base  We're not talking about a lower bound that is necessarily binding every day Who else has a comment? I'll just go down the list Governor Rice  Mr Roos Is there no Mr Roos?  SPEAKER(?) He's coming in a second  Governor Schultz  Governor Teeters  Governor Wallich    5/6/80  Do others want to make a quick comment?  Well, we obviously have a somewhat split view Does anybody have any further comments?  Well, I think there is some question as to how credibility gets defined in these circumstances, which I suppose is what the argument is about In my mind, the one thing that bears upon this a little is that whatever we decide is going to be published fairly quickly I don't know what way that cuts, but it leads me to be a little more conservative than I would otherwise be And that lends some support to the 11 percent number On the other hand, I don't like the idea of just going to 11 percent and sitting there on a floor for too long, because I think it might be inconsistent--though we don't know what the money supply figures will be--in getting [money growth] turned around So I'm left in a bit of dilemma But we can always meet again And if it makes [Committee members] more happy or if we maximize the satisfaction and minimize the risk by taking an interim step to 11 percent, recognizing that we may have to come back next week, that's okay with me, too  We may be in a situation where literally in order to get the [money supply] turned around [the funds rate] has to go very low and then go right up again, which bothers some people, including me But I don't know how to avoid that either If we were only talking about the funds rate, it would be one thing But we're talking about dragging the whole structure [of interest rates], probably  That I don't think there'd be any argument with Well, the choice is between 10 and 11 percent, I think; and I don't know that anybody wants to change his or her mind basically It comes out with a slight majority for 10 percent, I think Well, maybe--    5/6/80  One, two, three, four I don't know how you get six  It sounds to me as if maybe we ought to do 10-1/2 percent  Let's vote on 10-1/2 percent  Did you get everybody? Did you get Mr Mayo?  Okay, I guess we're settled Thank you  Well, I don't have a few minutes I assume that we're going to remove the surcharge very promptly  Well, we'll have to decide that today, but I don't know quite why you say that  Well, we'll be considering that today   Let us proceed, ladies and gentlemen We need to approve the minutes  Do we have a second?  Without objection, the minutes are approved Foreign currency operations  Are there any questions?  Do we have a motion to ratify the foreign exchange transactions?  [Without] objection they are ratified Do you have a recommendation, Mr Pardee?  What are your reactions?  Are they making any arrangements with the Bundesbank or anybody else?  So long as they don't apply them to us  I was a little concerned on reading those memoranda that Sweden isn't in very good shape  It raises the question in my mind why they aren't borrowing in Europe, and whether we are to some degree conceivably--  Officially?  No, the Eurodollar I mean from European official sources  Yes  Why are they having trouble with the BIS?  Sweden is a member of the BIS, isn't it?  How big is their swap line?  If we do this, we have to announce it right away--meaning within three or four days--right?  What are they going to say when this is announced?    5/20/80  Well, we are going to have to say something, it seems to me  It's no problem for us, but it is a bit of a problem for them  This coming Friday  Well, this doesn't strike me as perfection in terms of a precedent, but at the same time I see no strong reason to turn it down I do think we need an understanding now that they are going to pay it off I don't have any problems between 60 days and 90 days or whatever and we can even exclude a renewal But I think they ought to be told that this is a temporary increase; we are just talking about a 1-year increase at the moment We can have a further discussion when they draw, but I think it has to be against the background of a clear understanding now  It's 90 days for the drawing  Well, with that understanding, are there any objections? It just looks to me as if Sweden may be in trouble before the end of the year on this  But the current account deficit is $750 per Swede  Do I hear any objections? [Hearing none], that is approved and we can go to Mr Sternlight  Mr Sternlight  Questions?  Not entirely Over a period of time that may be true But we are running into precisely that problem now, and that's what the debate will be this morning, I presume But the Desk provided nonborrowed reserves more or less on path It could have speeded that up, and we would have run into our federal funds constraint, and we will run into it now That doesn't mean that the [level of] reserves would have come up to the path right away  We went right through all the borrowings, so we are face to face with--  We are now in the rarified atmosphere--one we haven't operated in before--where we have no borrowings  It's possible  Well, it's a matter of judgment in between meetings; Mr Axilrod sits there and scratches his head and Mr Sternlight does and occasionally I do  We would have run short on total reserves, and certainly the monetary base in any [case], even this time But we don't escape, I suspect, all the dilemmas of the real world by whatever we said in October And we are there right now  [Interest rates] had a lot of flux in the last month  In the interest of facilitating the discussion, I think these issues will arise in a more practical way a little later  It depends upon why it speeds up Short- term interest rates are down this morning That's the long-term trend through 10 o'clock this morning!  It depends If the economy gets stronger and credit demands increase and the money supply rises, interest rates would rise If we're pushing up the money supply, then presumably they would fall  They might, yes  We have to ratify the domestic transactions Without objection, they are ratified Mr Kichline  I wonder whether we shouldn't pause for a little discussion of the economic situation [I hope] it doesn't go on too long because there are particular technical issues on the financial side that will need some discussion  Governor Partee  Mr Eastburn  Mr Mayo  Any other comments or questions? We will turn to Mr Axilrod  -15-    5/20/80  I [am tempted] to suggest that you might get into the more technical problems But maybe we will defer that and get whatever reactions we have at the moment to as far as you have gone Governor Partee  It makes a big difference which M one looks at It may be true of Ml; M2 and M3 don't look so bad  It's pretty good when you have a decline in M2 and M3 simply because people bought Treasury bills  That's why the analytic significance is high Governor Wallich  Mr Eastburn  Mr Black  Mr Morris  Mr Balles  I have a great vacuum of volunteer speakers here  Mr Mayo  Mr Baughman  Mrs Teeters  Mr Roos  Mr Schultz  Mr Forrestal  Governor Rice  Mr Solomon  Just to be accurate the phrase used in the release was "more emphasis," not "somewhat more emphasis"  Mr Guffey, are you the last one here?  Mr Gainor, do you have two words you want to say?  Okay, let's drink coffee quickly I won't deprive you completely!  -27-    5/20/80  [Coffee break]  Well, let me see if I can sort this out a bit We've done a lot of talking about the risks in the situation, and they undoubtedly exist The obvious risk is the presence of recession, and when that [occurs] one always has the feeling of being in a bottomless period Indeed, there is a certain degree of risk that we are in a more bottomless period than we would expect or like to be in We have the risks of the exchange market situation I will only mention that; those risks are fairly obvious I don't think we can deal with them I don't have any confidence that we can deal with them through intervention anyway I have nothing against intervention [in principle], but I have no confidence that we can sit here and escape responsibility or concern by saying that we can intervene because intervention is not going to take care of the situation fully if it really develops in an adverse way I repeat That is not a prejudice against intervention, particularly at the right point, which is probably about now--before [the situation] deteriorates, or earlier rather than later in an effort to maintain a feeling of stability [in the foreign exchange markets] And we have the risk of inflation that Fred Schultz talked of eloquently That's not a risk; it's here It affects psychology I think [the psychology] has improved somewhat, and it will affect how well we're going to do in coming out of this recession  I think we ought to recognize that we're in a situation that has impossible aspects to it There is nothing we can do here by fiddling around with either interest rates or the money supply, for instance, to reduce consumer indebtedness, which is very high And that is undoubtedly affecting consumer behavior at the moment, apart from all the [credit control] programs that we have And there is nothing we can do about the fact that the saving rate is very low and that there may be efforts to move it higher, and that's related to the indebtedness situation I'm not even sure in some longer-range perspective that there's anything we should do about it because we've been complaining about the saving rate being too low The car industry has problems of its own They couldn't sell rear-wheel drive cars even when credit was available and people wanted to buy cars All I'm saying is that we're not going to solve the world's problems by what we do here It doesn't mean our judgments are not important, but we're living in a difficult period with problems on all sides of us We have to evaluate how those various risks impinge upon each other When I look at all these risks, what impresses me is that the greatest risk in the world is not whether we miss our targets or not I don't want to miss our targets, but we have to put that in perspective of what is going on in the rest of the world I don't think we can avoid some judgment about what we should do to minimize those risks We can't escape them But I don't consider it a full answer to say we set down a target some time ago and we've got to hit the midpoint of that target, as much as I would like to do that in general  There has been a certain amount of discussion of the credit restraint program I think that program probably is having some effect; it's very hard to [quantify] I want to get out of it myself I've spoken to that point publicly It's a question of how to do it both substantively and, in terms of our general posture, gracefully I would expect some movement on that very shortly I would make one  -28-    5/20/80  other general point I get comments sometimes from outsiders and from insiders that if we take some action--let's say we remove all of the credit restraint program tomorrow and we drive the interest rate down to 5 percent--and if we explain to the market that that's really a tight money policy, then all the psychological implications will be gone I want to tell you that it just isn't possible I'm not going to cure in a speech what we do in substance There are concerns about the direction of policy and there's a lot of confusion I'm not saying speeches aren't important or statements aren't important But people who want to believe black aren't going to believe white when we make a speech A sense that we're giving up will contribute to higher interest rates rather than lower interest rates in the long-term area And what happens to the monetary aggregates may have something to do with that, too I'll just give you a case in point I did make a speech last week in which I said the money supply, I hoped, would go up I had expected it to go up; I had in mind that we probably would be pushing it up if nothing else happened And interest rates promptly went up  Well, I knew the money supply was going to go up for a week when I made the speech But I thought the reaction we were going to get from that increase in the money supply was going to be an increase in interest rates in the short run That's partly why I said it [I figured] we might as well get it in reaction to the speech instead of in reaction to the number All I'm saying is that the market is going to react in its own way to some extent regardless of what we say, however important what we say is Just don't be under any illusions that we can reverse attitudes by making a statement  When we look at the more specific decisions we have to make, I would just make a couple of comments that I think perhaps were not adequately reflected in the earlier comments Presumably these ranges that are set down and their accompanying federal funds rate ranges reflect our best professional judgment--I'm speaking in a corporate "we" now--as to what a consistent relationship is I have expressed before my underlying skepticism about the accuracy of these kinds of projections I have not lost my skepticism All I say is that we don't have much to go on in this area and this presumably is the best judgment that Mr Axilrod and his cohorts have made about what level of the federal funds rate is consistent with the targets that he's presented Secondly,--  Having made the best judgment, that's exactly right I yield to nobody in my skepticism about these things I am equally skeptical of anyone else's projections--maybe even more so, if that's possible The point has been made by several people that the ranges are in fact ranges Nobody has ever committed, at the extreme, to meeting the midpoint of a range The thing that preoccupies me a little here--and I recognize that this is also the staff's best professional judgment--is that the M2 and M3 figures are not as bad, in the sense of a decline, as are the M1 figures We've been putting an awful lot of weight on M1 because we get it weekly and it's a more immediate operating variable But we used to do an awful lot of talking about how important M2 and M3 were; and a lot of people  -29-    5/20/80  thought they were more significant [than Ml] I suspect, if we are relaying suspicions, that if have growth in M1 of the magnitude indicated in the Bluebook for either of the [alternatives], that growth of M2 is going to be higher than growth of Ml But they're [projected to be] practically the same I suspect, particularly if it does turn out that interest rates are lower, that there could be quite an inflow into savings forms that would produce a somewhat higher figure for M2 than for Ml And we don't have to do all that much better on M2 and M3 to be within our ranges In fact, M3 is projected to be within its range in May  Yes So, these may well be consistent under that kind of projection of interest rates But if interest rates in fact turned out to be lower, which is the gut instinct of a number of people around the table and a gut instinct that I can understand, I think we're going to find that M2 and M3 are running better than shown in the projection We could clearly end up in a situation where M2 and M3 are pretty much, let's say, around the midpoints of their ranges and M1 is running quite soft I don't know how one reconciles that even if our targeting allows for [differing] weights and all we look at is the targets We have to balance the desirability of meeting these targets against some sense of what the attitudes are toward what we're doing in the short run and over time That has been amply discussed by various people already, and we have come out with somewhat conflicting views about what that means for policy  I'm told that you have a revised first-quarter GNP figure, Mr Kichline, which you might as well throw into the conversation  I'm not sure that that really changes anything Maybe it's good that inventories are a little lower I do think, in making a specific decision, that we have a technical problem in the sense that we are in unknown territory when we are dealing with the possibility at least that we're not going to have any borrowings, which is about where we are at the moment In one sense, I suppose that could be an advantage If we don't have any borrowing, we know that the nonborrowed reserves are going to be the reserves And if we put out the reserves, presumably the money supply should follow-- overlooking a few multiplier difficulties and all the rest--in time But it also creates the problem that we may have a vacuum in the market for the federal funds rate between wherever we are and zero And the question arises as to whether we really want a vacuum between 10 percent and zero Nobody [has proposed] going quite that far    5/20/80  Well, Mr Roos came pretty close; we could at least split the difference  More than one may not have specified  The point of this is that there is a good chance that at least in some weeks--for more than an isolated week as some of you [have suggested]--the lower end of the federal funds range will become a constraining influence on the speed with which nonborrowed reserves are provided That depends in part, of course, on precisely where the path is set in the short run, and these tables on page 7 aren't very enlightening in that respect because the--  You know, I'm not even sure how relevant that becomes in these circumstances We just don't know I don't know whether or not $1 billion of excess reserves and a 13 percent discount rate will give us a federal funds rate of 7 percent instead of zero We really are in an area of unknown relationships at the moment I would judge that nobody is going to be very concerned if M1 or any of the Ms increased quite rapidly in the short run I'm thinking of the situation where we have a higher increase in the money supply than currently projected over the next few weeks and it might be incorporated in a path that ran through September or December, whatever point we picked If we began in the short run to run above that path and we mechanically applied [our procedures], we would drive the federal funds rate up in the short run As I interpret the discussion, [we would not want our decision] to lead to that kind of conclusion That is, if we can pick up some money supply in the short run without raising interest rates, nobody is going to be very sad about that I'm not sure that's going to happen, but if it does, I don't think people want [to see rates rising] I don't know what that says about the top end of the funds range But in that event I don't think people are contemplating that the federal funds rate would go up to 14 percent, the top of the range as set forth here, even though a very literal path approach might produce that result Maybe I just ought to pause and see whether that's a common agreement  Well, that's one way of putting it In a sense, that would make up [for] April and nobody would be much disturbed about it Putting it extremely, I would begin to get disturbed by an 18 percent increase in the money supply in one month  No, I'm not saying put it in regardless I'm just saying if it happens to arise now I don't think that's going to happen and perhaps we don't have to look at that extreme But in essence what I'm saying is that we would permit some of that $850 million to be made up without any concern  A rise in the funds rate of real significance anyway I'm talking about it going up to 13 or 14 percent or probably even 12 percent That's a--  Yes  Well, I'm not sure I have to argue that point at great length What I'm saying, approaching it from a different direction, is that we don't have to resist some recovery from the shortfall in the aggregates that we've already had  We'd have a different situation if we were within the target range or high in the range and the funds rate jumped up That's not the situation I'm talking about Then we might well say okay, interest rates have to rise But we've had a big shortfall  I think it has reached quite a few people But we have a skeptical audience out there Some people would say, if they saw the money supply going up and interest rates went up "Oh, your policy has gotten easier" They will pick whatever variable they want to pick at the moment to attack us if they're skeptical to start with I don't think we can completely win in this game I suppose nobody attaches a very high probability to the contingency I just described, but we constantly are surprised And I think Steve's conclusion from my general comment is probably what we would do mechanically We would just in effect start from a higher base,  -32-    5/20/80  feeding out reserves within some limit--in a sense within the $850 million that we're behind--should that happen  Before we get to the precise numbers, this does imply that if we operate on a path--let's say "A" or "B" at this point--and we don't have any borrowings, our [instinct] is that if the actual Ms come in below whatever path is set, we may have some excess reserves and may be pushing down the funds rate The question then becomes How far do we want the funds rate pushed down? The differences between "A" and "B" are not all that great in terms of the short-term fluctuations we [typically] have, or could easily be exceeded by random fluctuations The funds rate constraint may become much more important than which precise path is chosen in the short run But we are biasing the chances of meeting the bottom end of the funds range I myself would not want to bias it strongly toward constantly running into excess reserves of big amounts if we can avoid it at this point, so that we're constantly operating on a funds rate constraint Given that we're not forsworn to meet the midpoint of a range--and certainly given a feeling that if the funds rate goes down, M2 and M3 probably will be stronger than projected and they are not all that far below the ranges now--I would not set the short-run M1 and M-1B targets as high as in "B"  I'm just talking about May-June at this point As everybody has indicated, the critical point is going to be that funds rate constraint We have the opportunity for consulting on that as time passes but I want to get some general sense of what seems appropriate at the moment We've been operating at 10-1/2 percent; that's being threatened now Given a balance of all the risks and forces, I think we're talking clearly about something below the present constraint I feel that 10 percent is rather close to the present constraint and that we can live with a constraint lower than that Whether we want to go all the way to 9 percent is a question of how much we want to consult I would be concerned at the moment about going below 9 percent I'd feel a little more comfortable, at least for an interim period, if we could adopt a technique [similar to what] we used at the last meeting by putting in 9 percent or something like that with some understanding that if it went below the 9-1/2 to 10 percent area, let's say, we could have a telephone check to discuss whether, or at least how promptly, we wanted to go to 9 percent Nine percent doesn't bother me particularly, and we have six weeks until the next meeting That's a long period of time, and maybe we will want the funds rate to go below 9 percent before that next meeting But as a judgment sitting here at the moment, recognizing that we're at 10-1/2 percent, I think 9 percent would be a pretty big move in the market's perception It may not be too big in terms of the objectives for the aggregates that we want to reach over a period of time That may be a reasonable answer Putting in 9 percent now, recognizing that it can always be changed with some check in the form of a consultation when it's [somewhat] above 9 percent Every time we've had these consultations we have withdrawn the funds rate constraint I would think that is likely at these levels in the future, too, but it may be useful just to have the opportunity to check We really haven't had any [occasion] since last October where we have let the federal funds constraint persist for any period of time But that does not mean that there isn't a certain amount of comfort, I suspect    5/20/80  to all of us, in taking a look at it when it passes some point that is considered significant to some of us or to all of us  Yes That is what I'm suggesting on the funds rate On the aggregates target, you now have a projection for May and June of what specifically, Steve?  That comes close, in one sense, to alternative A That could be biased up a bit, but that's the actual projection now It may be consistent to bias that up a little in terms of the federal funds constraint that we're talking about--to have a higher federal funds constraint for a slightly higher target through December  Well, I can only answer for myself Everybody probably has his own opinion; that's how we get agreement on ranges That midpoint is the central tendency of what we're looking for when we set the range That doesn't say, now that it's five months later--and, of course, we'll look at these ranges again in July--how individual members of the Committee may feel in the light of what has happened in those five months They could feel more comfortable being in the upper half or the lower half or whatever There is no feeling, certainly in my mind, that there is something magic about keeping a precise midpoint as an absolute target throughout the year Otherwise, we might as well just set a point target and not even look at it in the middle of the year  I would say that, certainly, the month after we set the target almost any deviation would make one "a little nervous," in your terms But I don't think that's inconsistent with someone saying six months or eight months later that in the light of everything that has happened over those months, he might be nervous about hitting the midpoint He might prefer to be above it or he might prefer to be below it I don't remember the exact circumstances but I do remember that in October we said we wanted to come within the range At that point we had in mind the upper end of the range, but nine months had passed [since we set the target for 1979] And I  -34-    5/20/80  don't think anybody, if they felt nervous at all, felt that being in the upper part of the range was too high, even though it was the upper part and not the midpoint of the range that had been set nine months earlier I think that's natural  I'm saying that it's more than giving ourselves a safety margin We may change our emphasis as the year passes Let me try to be more specific, just for operating purposes I'm proposing setting a short-term range that is probably more consistent with "A" than with "B" for the next six weeks, but with a caveat which is more consistent with "B" than with "A" That is, if things developed in a way that Ml began exceeding that short-term range, we would not resist it We'd even go beyond the implied "B" in the short run without forcing a significant level of borrowing under those circumstances It's an upwardly biased "A," so to speak  Yes  Mr Axilrod will now interpret the instructions    5/20/80  We may have constraints that are inconsistent when we complete the story, and Mr Axilrod has just completed it in effect We're saying Provide enough reserves, which we can do reasonably accurately now because we don't have any borrowings, to meet the base objective; we will tolerate an overshoot of that When we get to the undershoot question, we're going to be constrained, potentially If the actual level falls below that path, the question is whether we're going to be constrained by the [lower limit of the] federal funds range On that I'm suggesting 9 percent with a check at 9-1/2 percent And it may well be that either an overshoot or an undershoot is going to run into a constraint that the Committee will want to resolve We do not have a set of specifications that permits the Manager to operate freely between the meetings without potentially running into an inconsistency I expect we will be better equipped to resolve an inconsistency later rather than now, should one arise And one could quite well arise  Do you mean by this statement week?  Well, in the coming week we might  Well, you're making a guess about what is going to happen That's not Mr Axilrod's conclusion but you may be right I won't say you're not right; it could well happen that way If it does happen that first week, we have the constraint and presumably at the end of the week we will have to face it If we operated a full week under the constraint, then we'd have to consider whether we wanted to operate another week under the constraint  Well, again, that's your presumption And it is the presumption of a lot of people around the table It doesn't happen to be the presumption of the people who [constructed] the table [in the Bluebook] I tend to agree that it might happen at least in a number of weeks, but I--  Yes, but we've just--  That, I think, is the substantive issue  No  It's a visual matter of which we want to put in It's implicit in what I said earlier Unless we have really explosive growth in the money supply, we're not going to resist it  It's going to be a while before it's the upper end if we adopt the bias that I suggested It has to be several weeks anyway, I suspect It would take a couple of weeks of $5 billion increases  The substantive issue is how low one is prepared to see the funds rate go, or how high--though [not] many people think the latter is a real problem--in the particular circumstances  It depends upon your view--whether you think we're going to look bad if the federal funds rate drops to 6 percent one week and goes up to 9 percent the next  I think I'm talking with historical accuracy when I say that since October it has not made any difference what the federal funds range was, in fact, except that it triggered consultation Consultation has been triggered either by informal understanding or by the actual range put in the directive  I'm not saying that it couldn't [make a difference] in the future, but historically it has not  I think at the 20 percent top it had some influence No consultation was called at one point [The directive] called for putting the funds rate up to 20 percent and we just left it there That's the clearest case, at the top, when [a consultation] was not called  We were [not] short of the path at that time, I don't think  I don't mean to suggest that these ranges never were a limiting factor for a few days I'm saying that as soon as they became a limiting factor for a few days we had a consultation and we changed [the range], with the possible exception of that 20 percent situation We would have had a consultation if the 20 percent rate had lasted for another few days, I think, but the rate turned [down] before--  As I say, we've gone a couple of days-- three or four days at times or maybe a whole week--where the range has had some influence Eventually we've had a consultation and the range has been changed I don't mean to suggest it hasn't had some influence in the short run All I'm saying is that when it has had a constraining influence long enough to [trigger] a consultation, we  -39-    5/20/80  have changed it It may well have an influence this time, but what we're talking about is an influence for a week and then having a consultation  I don't mean to suggest at all that these limits, if we ran into them, would not be effective for some days until we consult I'm just saying that every time we've had a consultation we have in fact changed the range The history is one of not sticking to these ranges between meetings  You're talking pure cosmetics--what appears in the record of this meeting We're not talking about pure cosmetics when we're talking about what the bottom of the range should be because that may become the effective rate and we're going to have a consultation to see whether we want to change it  We actually did specifically have that? Was it for the last meeting or the previous meeting?  I don't remember [if it was] this last meeting or the meeting before, but we were rather specific about it  -40-    5/20/80  I guess that is the difference When we did it the other time, we did not vote We had a consultation without a vote, right?  That's right, we didn't have a vote I think that is the difference  I think that's what it amounts to  We will unquestionably have a difference of opinion at that end of the table, anyway But I think we've got to resolve it  Well, we have a [draft] directive that is written in more general language I'm not sure I'm completely happy with it but I can't think of an alternative Mr Axilrod could not think of an alternative If someone has a bright idea, we can--  The presumption was that the specifics that Steve had in mind would be in the Policy Record The alternative was putting in at least 7 to 7-1/2 percent [in the directive] and some language saying that we'd tolerate some growth above that Now, we're talking about the period before the next meeting only  I suppose we could say just what you have here "In the short run, the Committee seeks expansion of reserve aggregates consistent with growth of M-1A" Maybe we should leave out the "over a period of months" And then we can say that in the period before the next meeting, or over the two months, the aim will be to achieve growth of at least 7 to 7-1/2 percent with some tolerance for growth above that  We might miss it and, of course--  What was your language, Governor Partee?  We'd have to put in some modifier about over what period of time, because otherwise it would sound as if in the next two months we are going to--  -43-    5/20/80  Maybe it ought to be modified  Everybody has a gut feeling My gut feeling is that we're going to find M2 and M3 coming up better than Ml in terms of the targets  M3 has touched the upper end and the lower end, but has remained well within the [band] on average, which is more than M1 has done Well, we have a substantive question to decide here I take it that wording of the directive is reasonable?  Well, no I didn't  I'm saying 7 to 7-1/2 percent, I suppose, but with tolerance on the up side  I'm just working off Steve's numbers You had what--a little less than 8 percent for M-1B?  This is broadly consistent with alternative A, with a willingness to overshoot  At this point I don't know what fortune  -44-    5/20/80  We're talking about figures for the actual path That's not quite the equivalent of the figures [mentioned here], which are for a longer period We're just talking about now through the meeting date in July  In a completely symmetrical world, but I'm not playing in a symmetrical world right now  With "B" That is correct  Yes, [we'd consult] before we get there, figuring that that's more than a full [percentage point] drop in the federal funds rate It may well come next week I don't know for sure whether it will It will depend on what our money supply figures show, so we don't know yet And the significance of what rate we put in there is probably what Roger said--it [determines] when we need a formal vote of the Committee to lower the rate as opposed to a consultation Well, let's just try it out  Yes, a show of hands on acceptability is what we're looking for at this point Are the specifications clear? These do not appear in the directive, [except] the one for the federal funds range On the others, we have the general language in the directive We have a reserve target which we expect is almost certainly consistent with no borrowing, with tolerance on the up side because if some borrowing developed, we presumably would raise the path So unless we have an extremely strong rebound in the money supply, we're talking about no significant borrowing during this period--only frictional levels of borrowing Let me just try the 9 percent [lower limit for the] funds rate I don't think the 14 percent [upper limit] is real, but let's maintain it for visual [purposes] What is the range now? I don't even know  We still have 19?  SPEAKER(?) We lowered that  -45-    5/20/80  Well, we're making this tremendous 5 percentage point drop in interest rates, Larry! It's an enormous tolerance, which we really--  How many find that acceptable? One, two, three, four, five I thought it was you who proposed it, Emmett?  You want a higher path?  The [problem] is that [a higher path] is inconsistent with this funds rate  We're not talking about this September/ December question We're talking about the rest of May, June, and the early part of July  That is correct Well, who has an alternative?  Everything is the same with an 8-1/2 percent [lower limit on the funds range] instead of 9  Well, that's about as far as I can go Let's try that one  SPEAKER(?) Chuck's was 8 percent?  Should we put that one to a vote?  We'll see whether Mr Axilrod's judgment here is correct  Okay  END OF MEETING  -48-       We don't seem to have all the Banks on the line but why don't we proceed I think we can have a rather brief meeting I wanted to touch base before I go off to China and also we certainly are running into our checkpoint constraint [for the federal funds rate] if not the other constraint Perhaps Mr Axilrod can just fill you in on the situation  Well, I think we have a general picture [of weakness] Contrary to the weekly estimates we seem to get early every week continued weakness in the M1 categories and in bank credit M2 and M3 look more like they're returning to target but largely because of money market funds rather than any really rapid growth in either deposits at the thrift institutions or the time deposits of banks Although they should be improving they have not improved dramatically in the latest figures we have, despite the [market] rate declines Everything that Steve says points to a drop in the federal funds rate, but in fact the federal funds rate so far has been more or less comfortably, in terms of our checkpoint, above the 9-1/2 percent level But it surely looks as if it will go through that I don't know whether at this stage our account managers in New York have anything to say  What do you have to say?  What does our foreign manager have to say? Our foreign manager isn't there?  When is the OPEC meeting?  Monday, Mr Truman says Well, I suspect we are in a difficult area in the exchange markets, [with a] psychological reflection of the same factors in the gold market and elsewhere Ordinarily I would think that we wouldn't necessarily need this consultation today, but I'm not going to be here [for a period of time] and all the present indications point in the direction of slippage, at least in the M1 targets, from where we were Bank credit is weak, as Steve said, and all the paths certainly look like they will threaten and conflict with a 9-1/2 percent funds rate, our checkpoint This doesn't take any vote, but I would suggest that we take this as that checkpoint and pass [through] it if the market develops that way  -3-    6/5/80  I would not propose at this stage that we anticipate the need for dealing with the 8-1/2 percent [lower bound on the funds rate range] We've been a fair amount away from that I would visualize that that could well become a constraint before too long and it will have to be dealt with one way or another when it does But I see no reason to prejudge that this afternoon I would let it happen and my guess would be, unless we get a radical change here, that it's going to happen before very long But we can bump up against it for a few days anyway I don't interpret these contraints as saying we have to avoid the rate falling below [the lower limit] on a particular day The general understanding has been a weekly average kind of [constraint] and it has to be judged in part ex post rather than considering the limits as an absolute constraint on day-to-day operations So that would be my proposal If anybody would like to comment, I think it is timely to do so at the moment  Has everybody outside of Washington been heard from? I have a silent, surly looking group in Washington Strike that adjective It's not true Governor Wallich  What does postponing as long as possible mean practically? We really haven't hit it yet, Henry You're saying do what we would normally do except that if we run into the 9-1/2 percent, let it stick there for a few days anyway?  While I think of it, if anybody out there at the other end of the telephone has any particular insight they want to offer as to what's going on in the economy generally or whether you see any revival of home building or anything of that sort, you may as well take this opportunity to report it I don't want to interrupt what comments the Board members may want to make on this particular proposal at the moment, so let me ask who else wants to comment here?  What happened to this loan demand that was supposed to result from a decline in consumer spending leading to a build-up in inventories which would lead to a temporary increase in borrowing? In other words, what is happening to inventories? Mr Axilrod is looking at Mr Kichline  They're living off their fat in part, but you said you think inventories are going up Can you quantify the order of [magnitude] of the rise compared to what we were getting? Is it very much faster or about the same rate of speed?  I am concluding, rightly or wrongly from what you say--concluding is too strong a word--that there may be some inventory buildup but it's not very great because production is declining very rapidly  Well, let's return to the specific subject What other comments do we have? Any other comments on the Washington end?  Let's get a little more precise about where the aggregates are I'm not talking so much about M1, which I know is way below the target, but it is correct that M2 and M3 have come up into the target range in our present June estimates?  That's almost in the middle of the range, or a little below the middle of the range  -6-    6/5/80  The M3 growth is less than M2? No, I'm sorry, it's [a little] higher Now, both of those figures allow for quite a big increase in June as I recall  And M2 was over 10 percent?  What other comment do we have here?  Are you basically joining Henry and Lyle?  In any case, we're not saying in our initial comments that we aim below 9-1/2 percent; we're just assuming that the path will bring us there  Yes, I think we want to be clear on that point though We're just dealing with a contingency here which Mr Axilrod and Mr Sternlight think is a highly probable contingency But nobody is arguing--at least the question was not posed this way-- that we deliberately aim below 9-1/2 percent It was just a matter of a fallout from the other operating procedures The opposing view is that if that contingency arises, the checkpoint is held for a few days or longer Governor Rice  Did you say something, Governor Schultz?  I'm just wondering where this leaves us We do have some voices of caution and I'm wondering how best to incorporate perhaps a little more caution than was implied in what I may have stated initially  Well, I think the substance of this problem--  I think the substantive problem we have here is that nobody much cares about what happens to interest rates if that didn't affect some other things--like the exchange markets or inflationary sentiment--and cast doubts about our intentions and all the rest If I were sitting here alone--it's a little more difficult when you're in a committee--I would say this We've got an 8-1/2 percent floor and if we begin approaching that in the midst of great concern in the exchange market and the declining dollar, I'd be a little more cautious under those conditions than if we approached it without that Now, I don't know how to translate that [into precise operating instructions] We don't have to write a directive here, but I'm perfectly willing to be left with a basic decision that 9-1/2 percent is not the floor we have in the sense of a floor We do have an 8-1/2 percent floor in the interpretation that we gave earlier There is a certain cautious note that a number of people have struck which should be reinforced tactically depending upon what was going on [elsewhere], let's say in the exchange market In other words, if we can get by with it, I'd go right to 8-1/2 percent--we're talking purely about contingencies here--if that's where the path brought us I might be a little more cautious in precisely when I time my operations if it were a bad day in the exchange markets or whatever  Maybe we can leave it that way  If there's some kind of understanding, which leaves some discretion with the Manager, I think that's broadly consistent with what I said initially His day-to-day tactics may be affected We give him some room for [judgment in] day-to-day tactics if disturbances are arising or imminent elsewhere that [our operations] could perhaps calm down And that could benefit us in the long run, given that there is some concern on the Committee about [the deline in rates] being too precipitous--in going below 9-1/2 percent anyway  No, I'm not thinking of massive disorder If we really had massive disorder, we would have to reconsider this I'm thinking of a pronounced movement that seems to be requiring a lot of intervention--that we have an atmosphere in the market that seems to be cumulating or threatens to cumulate On the other hand, if the dollar is strong, who cares if the rate goes to 8-1/2 percent? I'm just talking about this as a day-to-day tactical [consideration] but not a floor--specifically removing the floor at 9-1/2 percent to the extent that there is a floor there now But if we had a day, as sometimes happens early in the week--if it happened on a Wednesday it wouldn't be bothersome--when the federal funds rate seemed to be settling at 8-1/2 percent or below, and as I said earlier we're talking about weekly averages, I think maybe I'd step in on that day if the exchange market happened to be weak on that same day I would do that so as not to give rise to an impression in the market that the federal funds rate could go to a wholly new level on that particular day That requires a little fine-tuning if the exchange markets are in fact under pressure If they are not under pressure, it doesn't require any I see some nodding of heads in Washington and I think this is broadly consistent, but somewhat more cautious in at least one contingency, than the flat proposal I made earlier If that is satisfactory, I think we can stop for today We may need another consultation in a week or so depending upon how this develops We may even need a decision We won't need a decision unless we're at 8-1/2 percent, but if we are that question will arise  Well, if I don't hear widespread objection we will leave it at that We have consulted  Before you get away, does anybody have anything useful to say on the business scene or on anything they're picking up in their Districts? I'm not interested in doing a mechanical go-around, but if anybody has some insight that they would like to offer, please do so  Where would you say mortgage rates are now in California?  -10-    6/5/80  Nobody wants to borrow at 12 percent?  That's in Ohio, not in California, Willis! Anything else?  SPEAKER(?) The discount rate is still pretty badly out of line with the federal funds rate Our Bank for one has sent in a recommendation on that today and it's for moving down another point I think we're going to have to come to grips with that problem  Well, that will be a continuing problem, I suspect If we do a point [change], it will still be out of line, so we've got lots of room If there are no other comments, I thank you  SPEAKER(?) Have a good trip, Paul  Thank you  END OF SESSION  -11-     We may have a long day ahead of us If we don't use it all up with the Open Market Committee meeting, we'll use it up [discussing] monetary reform legislation With that in mind, we will have lunch around the table in a convivial atmosphere I am told that people worry about food and drinks being spilled on the rug We'll see whether we can have lunch in the august Board of Governors meeting room without spilling anything on the rug; if we do spill, we won't be able to have lunch around the table again  I'd like to welcome Governor Gramley officially to this august body in a new guise He is completely unfamiliar with the table; I believe we literally have a new table since you were last here So we welcome you to the table literally and figuratively  We have several First Vice Presidents with us today because of the absence--for various reasons--of some of the Presidents, and we welcome you I don't think we have anything else of that order of business, Mr Altmann We need to approve the minutes then  Did I hear a second? Without objection the minutes are approved  Mr Pardee  When are those first Carter bonds due?  That's a little more than a year away  That $30 billion was theoretical in the first place  What do we have left in the swaps now?  One billion out of how much that we have in Germany?  And what's the limit with Germany now, $6 billion?  It's $6 billion, and the Treasury has $1 billion  Our current account, of course, looks relatively good compared to other countries' current accounts In round numbers, the deficits are $12 to $15 billion in Germany, $15 billion or more in Japan, and $5 billion in France There's a small deficit in the United Kingdom, despite their oil, whereas our projections are for close to balance this year and a surplus next year Some people [expect] a surplus this year If one just looks at current accounts, we don't look too bad; in fact, we look very good But people obviously are looking at other things, too Of course, it's affected by the recession  I think a major question is whether or when we can expect some interest rate declines in the rest of the world [Foreign officials] are a little ambivalent about it They're in the same position we are They want to maintain this psychological posture of getting on top of inflation and not appearing to yield to it And they haven't had much improvement on the inflation front, although in some countries they've had a little On the other hand, they're becoming a little worried about a business slowdown and perhaps a world recession and [there is] some sentiment that easing might be a good idea But nobody wants to be first Nobody wants to show the white flag on the inflation front So they're quite ambivalent  No, the other countries don't do it  We changed a few years ago, presumably to get on the same basis as other countries But we have so much more foreign investment It's much bigger for us than for anybody else  I think that's right Common wisdom in the market, however, is that the [noneconomic factors] on balance probably have helped us a little so far There is some political instability in Europe particularly, but not with so much [unintelligible]  No, the real difference this year is these other countries with current account deficits Even the Swiss, the Germans, and the Japanese have advertised the availability of their government securities to the Saudis in particular, which they never did before; and they are selling them The French also are selling a fair amount of securities to the Saudis I don't know [whether they are selling] to other people too, though they probably are, but they are selling to the Saudis and they didn't do that before The Saudis had great difficulty getting investment outlets Now they have more open to them  Oh, I don't think so, necessarily I don't think it's a political problem in the sense that you may be suggesting It's a question of whether it's very useful or desirable at this stage [If we sold gold], we'd have to do it alone; I think    7/9/80  that's pretty clear It isn't anything that's ruled out a priori, but it's a practical matter of whether it's a good idea  I should say, in connection with the political problem, that I don't think there are any great political constraints so far as the thinking in the Administration is concerned There are politicians who would make a noise that would reflect upon the credibility of the action If we sell some gold and then immediately get some congressional opposition, the market would say "Well, they're not going to sell very much because there's too much opposition" And, therefore, it might not be very productive in terms of the impact we'd want to achieve  Perhaps I spoke a little misleadingly because that kind of opposition, I think, does reflect on the credibility of the action It raises questions about whether it could be sustained and what the [total] amount would be and whether it's really an accepted technique or not, even though in some sense I think it's not a political deal for the Administration except in terms of appraising that reaction I can't quite see the Congress opposing it in a formal sense but there would be a lot of noise by these limited groups  We have to ratify these transactions  Without objection, they are ratified Do you have any recommendations, Mr Pardee?  We presumably will renew those as necessary--if necessary Hope springs eternal Mr Meek    7/9/80  Let me interrupt you just a second for a clarification It may be that I was up too many hours yesterday, but did I read the Bluebook wrong? On the first or second page, where the paths were shown, I thought it said we are marginally above the minimum targeted growth If I look at the figures, it looks as if we are marginally below Then there was a footnote on page 3 that said we changed the target [for total reserves] and made it a little higher; but it said the original target was $43,377 million and the subsequent target was $43,293 million, which is lower  But the footnote seems to be wrong on page 3 I'm just gratified that I read this correctly I found something the matter with it  I just wanted to demonstrate that I was wide awake when reading your report!  Mr Meek  You were supposed to absorb reserves [to remain on] the path, right? I thought you absorbed less reserves than the path called for  Comments or questions? These actions in the last six weeks do not provoke any questions?  We have a proposal to raise the intermeeting limit [on changes in System holdings of securities] What is the intermeeting period?  I take it the limit is normally $3 billion [and the proposal is to raise it] to $4 billion because we are getting a decline in reserve requirements that is going to have to be offset in the normal course of events  What is the decline in reserve requirements?  We can always change it again; fine-tuning this figure doesn't have much significance But if you are convinced that $4 billion [is appropriate], is there a motion to that effect?    7/9/80  Without objection, we approve until the next meeting a $4 billion limit We need ratification of the transactions Can I have a motion to that effect?  SPEAKER(?) So moved  Without objection, we approve your operations since the last meeting  [Before] we turn to the economic situation, I might just [raise] another point here so that you are aware of it You might already be aware of it; I believe you have been sent a copy of the resolution that Mr Proxmire and Senator Garn have introduced about Federal Reserve policy This arose essentially out of the report by Arthur Burns' Committee to Fight Inflation, which is made up of an ex- Secretary of the Treasury, an ex-Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and a few distinguished ex-Congressmen Among other things the report said that Congress, as Mr Burns had suggested in a speech last September, ought to support the long-term thrust of monetary policy toward restraint against inflation and ought to reinforce that commitment by a Congressional resolution That language was in the Committee's report and apparently Mr Proxmire read that and thought it was a good idea So he has introduced a resolution, the language of which I have examined in its present form word by word It seems fairly unexceptional but I have a little concern, frankly, about the whole exercise It starts off with all these [whereas phrases]-- whereas the Congress has the constitutional power, and whereas the Federal Reserve is an agent of the Congress, and whereas the Congress can tell the Federal Reserve what to do, whereas this and whereas that--[and then says] we support [the Federal Reserve] in this general long-range intention [to restrain inflation] It seems to me the kind of language that could easily be converted in some other circumstances to say whereas we think interest rates are too high we direct you to lower interest rates So, it may not be the most desirable precedent in the world, but I'm not sure there is anything we can do about it I just have a little worry about it We have not been active in supporting this but we have not been active in working against it either My own [instinct] is to let events take their course But there may be an effort--and there's danger in this--to put in some different language in the operative paragraphs that could give us a little difficulty We will wait and see, I guess As it is, I think it's unexceptional I don't know how helpful it really is, but you ought to be aware of it Maybe it is helpful; I don't know  It worries me a little, frankly I'd just as soon it didn't come up I discussed it with Arthur and I'm not sure he's so happy himself that this [process] has started I'm sure he's convinced that he thought it all through, but I don't know what we can do  A couple of weeks ago  Well, the main difference between [the current version] and what was initially introduced is that the first sentence talked about the long run anti-inflationary policy and so forth--I can't remember the language--but had a phrase in it about long-term interest rates It said, in effect, that [such a policy] could bring down long-term interest rates in the context of dealing with inflation Arthur got them to take out the specific reference to interest rates In fact, the reference wasn't bad because it was in the context of bringing down inflation But it's illustrative of the kinds of things we could get in a resolution of this sort some time in the future that would be very difficult Looking at this, my own feeling is that we can't go out and say we don't [favor] a resolution that says Congress supports our long-term efforts to deal with inflation But I feel a little nervous about the implications of this for the future Indeed, there may be an attempt to modify this in the present What I am saying is that if it just died quietly, I wouldn't shed enormous tears; there may be some other aspects of this that aren't apparent Undoubtedly, I will be asked to comment about it in my testimony I suppose I am forced to say it's a fine resolution  SPEAKER(?) What else can you do? It would be like talking against motherhood to oppose it  Yes, I could say that I don't think it is wise for these resolutions to be all that specific but that a resolution with this kind of general sentiment is [fine]  I did ask if there had ever been a resolution quite like this, referring to policy And I think it is  -11-    7/9/80  true--well, at least nobody was able to tell me off-hand--that there has not been The nearest thing to it was the concurrent resolution, adopted in [1975], which in part gave rise to the whole monetary targeting exercise In some of its initial versions that did talk about interest rates; [those phrases] were pretty much extracted, so the resolution became largely procedural instead of referring to the objective of policy except in the broadest way But there have been many attempts to introduce resolutions like this There has been a resolution circulating in Congress in recent months about bringing down interest rates It never got anywhere, but it had some signatures on it There have been other attempts of that kind, which weren't pressed very hard We weren't able to find any precedent for this kind of thing actually passing in Congress I don't know if there is anything else to be said about it but I thought I'd ask for any reactions you had And you ought to be aware of it  Well, Mr Kichline and Mr Zeisel, it's up to you  MESSRS KICHLINE, ZEISEL, and TRUMAN [Statements--see Appendix]  Let me interrupt you If I remember correctly from the Bluebook, this is an artificial 4-1/2 percent in a sense because it doesn't allow for a depression of M-1A from NOW accounts and so forth  So, if I understand correctly, the target doesn't fully allow for what is going on this year  So you're just saying that the 1/4 percentage point allows for that  That was a very complete and very comprehensive presentation I'm sure it leaves a certain amount of questions in peoples' minds I have two or three myself, so I might start We will spend a little time here on the economic outlook before we get to the aggregates discussion Your forecast, obviously, has a very low recovery in disposable income in '81 by historical standards You also have a low increase in productivity When we have a low increase in productivity somehow we have to have a low increase in disposable income But there's a certain amount of chicken and egg involved; if we had a faster recovery, we might get more productivity I guess I'm groping for a question here How low does the rise in disposable income have to be [to reflect] the fact that productivity is not performing the way it used to and how much is [related to] a sluggish recovery in some sense?  Well, how much of it is the other way around? I'm asking how much [reflects the fact] that anything is going to look less buoyant than it looked before because we get less productivity growth, all other things equal  I'm sure this has something to do with the chart you've labeled "Prices II" There's a striking difference here In '75-'76 [the percentage rise in] the gross business product  -13-    7/9/80  deflator went down, my word, from 12 percent to 4 or 5 percent Now you say it can't go down much Of course, it had gone up very sharply But how did we manage to get it down 7 percentage points or thereabouts in only a year or 18 months and now we can't get it down?  You have a 4 point [swing], if I understand you correctly  We had an 8 point swing in productivity during that period, so we must have had a 4 point swing or so in compensation?  In some sense it could be argued that you are rather pessimistic on both compensation and productivity  -14-    7/9/80  Because real wages are declining?  All [I'm talking about is] this pessimism relative to earlier cycles It's pretty deeply related to the productivity picture one way or another  To the extent it came out in lower prices, with the same money and fiscal assumptions you get more output  Let me just ask one more question On these charts of econometric exercises with and without tax cuts, is there a lower real GNP in '83 with a tax cut? If I understand it correctly, you also have a lower unemployment rate Offhand that somehow seems inconsistent  Okay, you still have a slightly higher level of [real GNP]  Mr Balles  That includes the off-budget agencies, just not the sponsored ones, doesn't it?  It depends upon how one defines off- budget My understanding is that it literally includes the off-budget agencies but it doesn't include the [agencies] not owned by the government, [such as] FNMA and the Home Loan Banks  Governor Gramley  Is this firm?  Mr Mayo  Mr Black  Mr Eastburn  In 60 seconds  I wasn't clear on that Let me make sure I understand The Humphrey-Hawkins targets are the Administration's forecast in the terminology you're using?  -21-    7/9/80  When you say Humphrey-Hawkins targets do you mean the Administration's projections that are in these charts?  All this depends upon one's judgment of this 3 percent shift in M1 demand What was that shift in the past year, say?  I was thinking of the past 12 months    7/9/80  Governor Wallich  Governor Rice  Governor Teeters  There will be a few further complications if the LDCs don't get financed Governor Partee  Mr Morris  Mr Winn  One can't beg, borrow, or steal space, but with the rent control laws and all that does anybody want to build?  I thought you were going to introduce some animal spirits to overcome the animal inventories! Well, one of the difficulties of having so comprehensive and able a presentation is that it provoked a great deal of discussion and [consumed] a great deal of time Nothing looks very happy, except Mr Winn's last interjection As I judge this, we have a problem in that if we base our analysis on any kind of traditional analysis, econometric or other, we run into all sorts of dilemmas And it makes one wonder how all this can be reconciled except by saying "Let's have a more expansive budget and a more expansive monetary policy and then everything will look all right on these traditional grounds" That's if we ignore the inflationary implications, which I take it we can't ignore That is the dilemma we have We don't have a situation where we can play the game the way we have played it traditionally I don't think we can, anyway Well, if we are going to have any coffee break at all, we can go chew on that physically as well as mentally for a few minutes and come back and enter into the policy discussion  [Coffee break]  We spent a long time on the business outlook; I think we should have spent a long time because [the staff presentation] was interesting and illustrated some of our problems very amply But I don't think we are going to get beyond the long- term ranges before lunch, so I suspect we will [continue the meeting] after lunch We have to consider these forecasts a little, in preparation for the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony We have some figures, as you know, from the Presidents and from the Board members, and we ought to have at least a little discussion about how they came out and how they should be presented Let me defer that for later I guess it could be argued that we ought to do that before the policy [decision], but I won't be that logical I'll do it afterwards But I do think we need some time to discuss non-monetary policy matters So [the meeting] may run a fair amount of time this afternoon I won't try to finish before lunch; our meeting will have to continue afterwards anyway I hope to finish [our work on] the long-term aggregates before lunch at the very least  I have the sense, as I suggested before, that this presentation of the business outlook, which is based upon past relationships and past performance of the economy, does point up very well our dilemmas and the basic issue we face It's a philosophical question almost as to how we approach a system which in some sense has run out of steam in terms of the postwar presumptions, if I can put it so grandly The economy has been getting less liquid for 30 years We have had rising inflation for 15 years, I suppose Both of those factors, and I'm sure some others, have changed the nature of the economy and the nature of expectations, and they have implications for cyclical analysis If one assumed that expectations were stable in some sense and weren't affected by inflation, the overwhelming thrust of what comes out of the business analysis is that we should have a big tax cut, an easier budget, and a substantial increase in the monetary aggregates, and everything will go along happily on past cyclical grounds We'd have room for a bigger recovery and everything would move as it did in previous cycles We could look ahead, if not  -27-    7/9/80  happily, on a more or less even course [consistent] with past history I doubt that it will be so simple because expectations will be affected We will get financial market repercussions from that kind of policy that are probably inconsistent with that [historic] evolution We'll get exchange market reactions that would be inconsistent with following that course I don't think there's so simple an answer It's not the answer that our policy to date, anyway, has suggested On the other hand, the opposite view--that if we just keep clamping down on the money supply all the problems are going to disappear nicely and the inflation rates are going to come down much faster than these projections show and the various dilemmas will be reconciled in the next year or two in a very happy kind of way--doesn't leave one feeling entirely comfortable in the pit of one's stomach At least not me  I suppose it's a matter of raising the questions; it's not only what we should be doing, but what we think the analog should be in other public policies, whether fiscal policy or wage-price policy or otherwise Those are appropriate questions, particularly for me I think they are always appropriate for the Committee but there's a certain spate of testimony we have to deliver in the next couple of weeks on a whole range of economic problems, from monetary policy to fiscal policy, to wage-price policy, to silver, to the Monetary Control Act and everything else So we do have to think implicitly or explicitly about complementary policies as well as about our own policy and approaches With that very general introduction, maybe Mr Axilrod can set out the more specific considerations with respect to where we go on the aggregates this year and next  Let me just say one other thing in that connection We obviously have to review the aggregates and announce a rather specific conclusion for this year We also have to say something about next year, but the degree of specificity with which we state [our objectives for] next year is quite an open question We can go all the way from saying these are our preliminary ranges--we wouldn't say final in any event--for M-1A, M-1B, M2, M3, and bank credit in a manner similar to what we would do for 1980 to the other extreme of indicating a qualitative direction Or we can alight anyplace in between those two extremes It is an open question we should resolve regarding whether we want to go with one of those extremes or some place in between in terms of what we say in the Humphrey-Hawkins report I think it's useful to be as specific as we can be in the first go-around here--as specific as we can in getting individual views, however generally we want to [cast it] as a consensus for the Humphrey-Hawkins report  You did not consider the possibility-- maybe it shouldn't be considered, but let me raise it--of correcting, in a sense, the M-1A/M-1B relationships for what has gone on so far  But that's not reflected in the ranges you are proposing  Theoretically, we have the option of--  Just to put this in context The charts that you have drawn later [in the Bluebook] for the short-run ranges are based upon what we know through June M-1A and M-1B are both below the cone [for the year thus far]; in fact, they're below the channel If we took the estimate you have for July--which may be in a state of flux, but just so the Committee can appreciate it--M-1B would be just about at the lower end of the cone, whereas M-1A would still be below the cone You have M-1B almost back in the cone--not quite, I guess, but very close to it  Projecting M2 into July--June is already [plotted on the chart]--it looks a little more clearly above the midpoint  Do you have an M3 estimate for July? I don't know whether you do or not  What you basically have for the July projection is M-1A below the cone, though probably within the channel; M-1B just about at the lower side of the cone; M2 higher in the range; M3 a little low in the range; and bank credit--what, below the bottom of the range?  Yes, one of the considerations--to repeat what Steve just said--is that for this year one might take the point of view that M-1A particularly should be reduced If we do that, just  -29-    7/9/80  keep in mind what we might want to do for '81 and what visual appearances we want to give of--  I will remind you in that connection, as Fred just implied, that we got some criticism last year--I don't think it was serious--that the logic was to reduce the width of the ranges at [the midyear review] I don't suggest that we should necessarily do it, but we should have that in mind That is, we ought to reject it consciously if we don't do it, because one can make the argument in pure logic that we ought to be a little more certain now about where we are going to end up at the end of the year than when the year began Let's hear what you have to say in general about this matter, Mr Eastburn  One might argue that anyway  Mr Roos  -30-    7/9/80  Well, I don't think we ought to associate a change in the ranges--if we think we have good grounds for a change --with playing games or horsing around All "B" is arguing is that a technical adjustment is required  I think there is something to what you say, looking at history And I'm not arguing for changing the ranges; but I just don't want to associate any change, particularly in this case when we could argue that we have a technical reason for making the change, with playing games We said a certain range was valid at one point; I don't think we can say that it's valid forever just because we happened to say it [once] Don't change the ranges lightly without a good reason is what I think you are saying Don't revert to changing them automatically because we change them every quarter to take account of what has happened I just don't want to overstate the case for not changing Mr Baughman  Pardon me for interrupting you, Ernie, but you reminded me I would appreciate it if people, when they are making their comments, would express any assumption they are making about fiscal policy or wage-price policies--as you have just done to an extent--and say what they think is appropriate Your comment on wage-price policy just reminded me of it  You assume a tax cut next year or the desirability thereof?  Mr Mayo  -32-    7/9/80  One problem you remind me of--it is more of a potential problem--is that if we put more emphasis on M2 and also say qualitatively that we are going to reduce its range, my impression is that we may maximize the tension between the economic projection and the monetary projections  Mr Morris  Despite the fact that it's inconsistent with the economic outlook as presented? It's only 1/2 percentage point more inconsistent than the present range  What would you say about taxes and wage- price policy?  Do I infer from what you are saying that you are much more optimistic about the wage outlook than the forecast suggests?  Mr Black  Governor Wallich  Wages, prices, and taxes?  Governor Teeters  If I can just interrupt, I meant to ask-- and maybe you already said this Steve, though you don't have it this way in the table--if we keep the ranges unchanged, is the technical case intellectually, in the sense of your best forecast, overwhelming for changing bank credit or not?  That's fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter?  That's consistent with these--  Wages, prices, and taxes?  Governor Gramley  Are you talking about '80 and '81?  If I understand you, for M2 for 1980 you would--  Mr Winn  -39-    7/9/80  Mr Balles  If I may just make clear my own position at the moment, which is always subject to change, it is not to resist it or to support it In other words, if I get asked "Is this a good resolution?" I'd say it's a fine resolution But I'd try not to be out there in front  Mr Schultz  Governor Partee  Mr Solomon  I would just note in connection with that last comment that it is not a question of my dancing around and answering the questions That is one thing But in our lovely staff report we have to put in black and white what we believe the prospects are for next year, however vaguely that is stated The official distillation of our intentions for next year is going to be there in a sentence or two or three sentences or whatever It's a little harder to waffle without being obvious about it  Have we heard from everybody except our First Vice Presidential associates?  Mr Forrestal  Mr Gainor  Mr Czerwinski  I think the First Vice Presidents' position on wage-price policy is related to their dislike of wage- price policies by the Federal Reserve Board  That's a big surprise!  Well, let me try to summarize so we can conclude, if feasible, before lunch On taxes, first of all, let me just say that I [expect] to be asked to testify formally on taxes, as  -46-    7/9/80  it will be coming up before other committees In a sense, what I say would be my personal testimony, but the question is to what extent I can speak for a wider group if asked There seems to be a consensus, though not everybody spoke to the point of what we want as opposed to what we expect, that there is no eagerness for moving on taxes immediately in a broad-brush way There may be differing degrees of sympathy for a tax cut eventually I think everybody would say it depends partly on conditions But the idea of trying to [delay its enactment] is certainly widely accepted [by this group] as nearly as I can see [as is the view that] the cuts ought to be gauged as much as possible in terms of their direct impact on prices and costs and productivity There is considerable sentiment--I don't know what I think about this frankly--[for reducing] the payroll tax I recognize the benefits but I also worry about the future of the social security discipline if payroll taxes are [not imposed] directly But I recognize that it is a major avenue to look at in connection with the tax cut program I could probably speak pretty broadly by saying that there is a desire for this to be looked at later and not right now and not be too definite about the later The later could conceivably mean at least September but preferably after the election  On the wage-price issue, there's a greater difference of opinion, obviously I don't have any set view on this at the moment but I have a feeling that the pessimism [about the effectiveness of the program] that has been expressed by the staff is widely accepted in our thinking in terms of the difficulty of [making progress on] the wage side of the [equation] I'm not sure there's anything to be lost, frankly, by saying that if you people in the Congress are talking about a tax cut, a pre-requisite you ought to think about among other things, is a concord between labor, business and government on a guideline that's substantially below the present guideline [This has to be done] in the context of all the problems we have, including the potentially inflationary implications and all the rest I don't think it does much good to talk about guidelines in the present area But I'm not sure there's anything the matter with stating that as an objective at the moment And to the extent we raise the issue, it may even slow down the immediate drive for a tax cut until we all see how things develop over the remainder of the year Now, that's purely a personal reaction at this stage, but I'm not sure there's anything to be lost by it I'd go all the way by somehow relating it more specifically to wage increases but I don't know how to do it If anybody had a bright idea on that score, it probably would have been thought of already Not that your idea wasn't bright, Henry I don't suppose I could speak more broadly about that approach but I have some sympathy for putting it that way as part of an argument for deferring consideration of the tax cut at the moment  On monetary policy itself, the consensus is pretty clearly to keep the ranges unchanged for 1980 I basically agree with that in terms of simplicity in presentation It bothers me a little because some things are going on that would justify a change, and in ordinary circumstances they ought to be recognized Even on a technical level, on the relationship between M-1A and M-1B--which is a pretty darn technical matter due to the NOW accounts--ordinarily we would say we [now] have more experience and we ought to adjust that relationship But I recognize the arguments that were presented pretty fully around the table for taking the simple approach Most people suggested, and  -47-    7/9/80  I would certainly agree, that consistent with that approach we would not be disturbed if, as is likely, the M1s came in at the low end of the ranges We might also say that it's possible M2 will come in at the upper end of its range and that M3 will be in the middle or lower part of its range But the ranges are there and we are not changing them partly because they are ranges Nevetheless, we don't consider it undesirable or inconsistent with our intentions if we have that kind of pattern among the ranges In fact, if we don't say that, we're almost forced to change the ranges because of the apparent inconsistency in the relationships among the different Ms On bank credit we may be able to finesse along the lines that have been suggested That's a little harder to do than if we hadn't put so much emphasis on that measure in connection with the credit control program, but let's suggest that bank credit may come in even below the lower end of its range However, due to the rise in commercial paper and so forth that does not disturb us so greatly that we have to take it into account  Let me just stop there Does all that express the consensus for 1980 clearly enough? We don't change the ranges, but explicitly in my comments we say that we are satisfied with a low M-1A and also recognize that M-1A probably should be low relative to M-1B in terms of the ranges but that this is a technical matter Thus the M1s generally might well come in quite low in their ranges and that would not disturb us M2 similarly could come in high in its range and that would not disturb us, and M3 may be near the middle of its range And that is the basis upon which we are reaffirming the ranges this year  We can reopen the question of '80, but at this stage before considering '81, have I captured the consensus for the staff and the writing they have to do for the testimony? In a very formal sense the numbers are the same, but the interpretation is of some considerable importance here  Okay For '81 I think we are in much more difficulty, frankly We have a real dilemma, inconsistency, tension, or whatever you want to call it between the projections and what we'd like to see happen in the economy If the staff estimates mean anything, in a very straightforward way what they imply for the aggregates--I'm not saying we should accept it--is higher [rates of growth] On the other hand, we can express the conflict very directly by looking at this resolution that Mr Proxmire has prepared, which I was urged to accept and I'm prepared to accept The final clause of that resolution says we are going to gradually reduce the rates of growth in monetary and credit aggregates in a firm and stable manner If we accept that resolution one day, that presumably means we should be reducing the monetary and credit aggregates in a firm and stable manner, including in 1981 I take it that virtually everybody--there were one or two contrary opinions--in resolving this dilemma said [we should express our targets for] 1981 in qualitative terms and in  -48-    7/9/80  effect waffle a bit I think I agree with that I will just tell you that it's easier to say it around this table When we say that in public, people will ask "You've been putting more emphasis on numbers and you've said you were going to reduce the ranges, so why do you now refuse to say more straightforwardly that you are going to reduce them even by 1/2 or 1 percentage point or something? You couldn't possibly have been suggesting that you were going to go more slowly than that" I attach great significance to that [argument] and I think there will be a market reaction, too The market will attach some significance to the fact that we are not willing to go up [to the Congressional hearing] and say we are putting forth a lower number It's not that I really disagree with the fact that we had better be qualitative But it's not as easy [to carry out] as the comments around here suggested; that in itself will have some implications for how our actions are interpreted Dave?  I don't think that avoids the problem, but I agree with what you are saying Whatever else we say about '81 we ought to say that there is a lot of uncertainty about the M1s and particularly about the relationship between M-1A and M-1B Somebody here put it very dramatically with zero on one and 7 percent on the other or something like that I don't know where we will come out at the end of the year when we have to make those projections, but there ought to be some discussion of that problem and the fact that those particular numbers may look quite different but in a meaningless way in a sense When we actually put forward the numbers they might look different--both of them--from what we had in '80 One may be significantly lower and the other may be significantly higher  What do we have to say in the directive, Mr Secretary, about 1981? Nothing, do we? This isn't a directive question, is it?  In what [part of the] directive does that appear--in the operating [paragraphs]?  Why do we need it in there now?  It calls for a decision, but I don't know that it says how it has to go in [the directive] We have to put down some language in the report anyway, but I don't quite see why it has to be in the directive  Steve has some [suggested] language Let me just try it out in terms of the tenor of it "Looking ahead to 1981, the Committee decided to work toward a further slowing in monetary growth rates that is consistent with an orderly reduction in the rate of inflation, while taking into account the impact on individual aggregates of the introduction of NOW accounts on a nationwide basis, a change in public preference for deposits and closely-related assets and emerging economic conditions" I suppose it's that last phrase that--  I just looked at this language a minute ago It takes the approach of saying we would like to get them lower but then putting a caveat on it I suppose the question is whether we want to say--  -50-    7/9/80  Well, it probably will be for M-1A; M-1B is going to give us the trouble, I think  That's right, only because of what is--  Well, we can get a certain amount of leeway in the M1s because of the technical problem I think we just ought to say flatly that in the case of M-1A and M-1B, NOW accounts are likely to have a big influence So M-1B could well be above what it was this year and M-1A might be below But that's just taking account of the shift between the two categories; it somewhat obscures whether in fact it's lower on the average, if we want to take that approach  Because of that complication for next year, which we can explain without quantifying, we in a sense get off the hook The real bind is M2, which isn't changing in concept, isn't subject to these distortions, and isn't subject to the same so-called demand shift as M1 I'm not sure we can say this, but at one point I thought we might say that in general we are moving these ranges lower and we are going to move as fast as we can but it may not be possible to do that next year for M2 That implies it's possible for M1, but nobody will ever know what M1 is because of all these shifts But it gives some warning that we may not reduce the M2 range  No, I'm saying we would tell them we may not reduce M2 and leave every implication that we're reducing M1 Then when they ask by how much and we have to give them some figures that are affected by NOW accounts and one can't tell--  It will be We would explain that M-1B will go up because of [the NOW accounts], but it's not a real increase; it's only a statistical increase  We can target on M2 but of all the aggregates it's the least easily controlled, and we're going to have more misses  One way we can resolve this target for next year is the way Fred suggested I don't know whether we want [to or not] It's fairly straightforward to say the [1981] targets are going to be at or below [the 1980 targets] I think it's a [choice] between saying that and saying in effect what this other statement says, which is that we'd like to be a little below [1980] but we are not sure we can be  There are two conflicting forces working It's less directly controllable in one sense, but it has a much more stable relationship with the economy than--  Well, for '81 the consensus [though we're not unanimous] is that we have to be qualitative rather than precisely quantitative about it Nobody wants to propose an increase I would suggest, and it seems to capture the majority but not the full consensus, that we make subtle noises about how we'd like to get [the ranges] down but heavily qualify it The alternative is to be more  -52-    7/9/80  neutral about it and say we're either going to have [the ranges] the same or lower  Well, we are relating it now to the targets, which I think is part of the difficulty Where we would want to come out in terms of changing [the ranges] and the actual number we would want next year does depend upon where we come out this year If growth in the M1s comes in very low this year, as is possible, certainly we might want [their growth] to be higher next year And it would not be inconsistent with this gradual deceleration notice But we really are talking now about the imagery of target against target rather than target against actuality  Let me suggest that whatever we decide we put a footnote, in effect, in the report--I don't know that it literally would be a footnote--noting that we are talking about a target here We don't know where 1980 will come out but if M1 did in fact come out very low in 1980, [our] target in 1981 may in fact [be consistent with] a higher M1 in 1981 than in 1980 So we would encompass that possibility, which I think is very likely to happen  Well, we can resume with that as the subject of our agenda immediately after lunch I think we agree, at least tentatively, on an unchanged range [for M-1A] this year and for expressing the view that it might come out in the lower part of that range  We can only answer that question with a subsequent discussion [in which we characterize our views] with precision It's a little difficult because we don't have precise words in front of us I suppose Steve's formulation of words, hastily done, is one option in which we express a hope but not a commitment to get [growth in the aggregates] down next year But the approach that Tony just supported seems to be consistent with what a lot of people said Let me ask How many people would rather do it that way?  SPEAKER(?) Which way?  That we say in general terms that we'd like to see the aggregates lower but whether it's possible or not depends upon a reassessment at the end of this year in the light of all the circumstances, and we are going to look at it [then]  SPEAKER(?) That's really the point  Yes  Well, let me worry later about whether we put anything in the directive The [policy record] is going to include a discussion of the difficulties surrounding M1 next year anyway because of the NOW accounts problem All that should be in there in qualitative terms in any event But just in terms of giving the thrust, our basic policy over a period of years is to reduce these [ranges] We're not exempting '81 from that approach, but we're not committing now to saying that it can be done We'll decide more precisely six months from now in the light of all the circumstances at that time  -54-    7/9/80  In that particular respect, it does not differ It's the same as what he used to say four years ago But I am assuming that the Committee is not prepared, which I think is the question you asked, to say right now that tentatively the ranges [for 1981] will be X, Y, and Z and that those ranges are lower than the ones for this year I excluded that [option] because there wasn't much support in the Committee for it  Well, I think we have lunch approaching  Has my waffle been recorded?  SPEAKER(?) Just put a little syrup on it and we'll--  Was somebody listening to that [closely] enough to try to [put some wording together] after lunch?  I'm not quite sure why we need anything in the directive It's not a decision This kind of vague statement isn't going to affect what we do before the next meeting anyway  Well, I can't remember why either Unless somebody can think of a reason, let me propose that it be in the report but not in the directive I don't see off-hand what purpose it serves in the directive since it's a vague statement anyway  Completely neutral? It's not neutral in the sense of raising the range, but neutral as between changing it or not changing it  That makes you suspicious of it?  Well, that is not the language that I would use I would suggest, particularly since it's 2 o'clock, if there is a willingness to work in this direction--and that seems to be the consensus--that we see if our staff can come up with a formulation before the end of the meeting that incorporates words that we can look at a little more specifically We can't resolve it just--  Not at this stage, no Why don't we have a few sandwiches for the time being  Well, we have sandwiches right next door, I believe  -56-    7/9/80  We are going to have waffles for lunch!  It does? In the directive?  Well, growth may [not] even be to the midpoint in September [but] then it would have to slow down after September  SPEAKER(?) Is that what it says? I didn't recall that  No, at least to the midpoint [by the] end of the year But [alternative B] brings us to the midpoint at the end of year If you're satisfied with [ending] up below the midpoint--  SPEAKER(?) Then you are between "B" and "C"  I can't make a subtle [technical] statement without you here, Mr Axilrod  Well, I assume you've been waffling But let's leave the waffling until a little later and go to the short-run decision, which may confirm or not confirm the decision on the long- run for 1980 When I look at the alternatives put down for us [in the Bluebook] for these ranges on the monetary aggregates, I would reject alternative A on a number of grounds, including the immediate implications it may have for the market But perhaps even equally important is the consideration that Governor Schultz and others  -57-    7/9/80  mentioned about going full speed ahead with a high aggregate figure at the moment and a low interest rate only to have to screech in the opposite direction in a relatively short period of time I have some of the same reservations about "B" But "B" brings us, if I understand this correctly, arithmetically to the midpoint of the existing M-1A range--  --or just a hair below the midpoint of the existing M-1A range by December It's not much, if at all, above the July figure, I guess It would surround the July estimate, so that doesn't change it much Alternative C would bring us inside the range but not to the midpoint by the end of the year, if I am correct  It's not below the range  The chart shows a September plot  I would reject "A" myself If I do that, I can see two ways of proceeding, though I would have a rather strong preference for one of them, that seem consistent with what we've just said about the longer-term ranges--namely, that we won't change the ranges this year, but we would not be disturbed by being in the lower part for M1, particularly for the M-1A number Consistent with that approach toward the longer-term ranges, it seems to me we could theoretically operate on "B" And if we didn't like the results we were getting in one direction or another, we'd accept the shortfall I say in one direction or another, which operationally in the short run might mean running into the lower federal funds rate constraint Alternatively, we could adopt "C" for the initial path-making exercise, [using] the same approach as we did in June when it worked out, maybe by coincidence, to everybody's satisfaction That involves setting a minimum growth path, which is again consistent with what we just said about the long-term, but if the number comes up higher-- consistent with both the growth path and the federal funds rate constraint we set for ourselves--we'd accept the higher growth, for awhile anyway Presumably we wouldn't accept it forever if it gets  -58-    7/9/80  too high But in the short run, presumably until the next meeting, we'd accept it unless it was very violently high If we look at the period since May, that's what we did It happened to come up, although we may have had some recent [revisions] so it's a bit higher than what we were projecting at the time It certainly came up higher than we projected it for June Essentially we did not permit the federal funds rate to rebound up to the point it would have rebounded had we held June to the number we notionally had in mind for that month The results that were achieved, both in terms of the interest rate pattern and the aggregates pattern, seemed to me to put us further toward our ultimate objectives than we might otherwise have been It worked out very well  I would interpret "C" in a modified way as a kind of minimum growth path we'd set, should we adopt that It's not really "C" in a sense; it's an indication of the minimum growth path, and we'd accept in the short run any upward deviation in that--within some reasonable bound--by readjusting the path consistent with the interest rate constraints of the type we now have That's what I would feel most comfortable with We may achieve the same result, but with different kinds of risks, by starting with "B" and saying in effect that we would undercut "B" if we ran into the interest rate constraint on the down side We would be more likely to run into the interest rate constraint on "B," assuming we have a constraint in the general neighborhood of where we now have it It seems to me that those are the two practical choices to focus on, consistent with our present stand on the long-run ranges Let me put them on the table and see what your reactions are  Let me say what I think is going to be relevant here, whatever [route] we take The proposal I made for "C" suggests we'll probably exceed the 6 percent [shown in the Bluebook for "C"]; the suggestion I made with "B" is that we wouldn't be above the 8-1/4 percent [shown] so, therefore, we might be below it  I just mean in terms of a frequency distribution I don't know whether we would exceed it but presumably we bias [the outcome] in that direction Let me just say that in either event, I think it's crucial where we put the federal funds constraint, if [we have one] at all That is a variable that will be prominent in our discussion for the next few meetings, I suspect  I didn't mean to imply--maybe I did--that wherever [growth] goes above "C" we would accept; I just meant within some reasonable range If we had a 10 percent growth rate in one month, we might well accept that Ten percent in two months we might not At least it would raise a question; we'd have to decide that  We'd accept it  I cannot deny that we'd begin running to some degree on the funds rate  We have a blended proposal here I just want to make sure I understand you You're clear on the funds range at 8-1/2 to 14 percent and clear on the numbers, which are basically halfway between the numbers [shown in the Bluebook for alternatives B and C] What is not clear, for instance, is whether you would accept right now that 87 percent or whatever is projected for July In other words, would you allow a little tolerance on the up side should the figures come out that way? What we're talking about is from now until August--when is the next meeting scheduled?  August 12 We are talking about the next five weeks literally  Actually, the latest data tend to shade that down, don't they? The data ordinarily are not very good but they are worse than usual today because of July 4th, as I understand it But [the recent information seems] consistent with a somewhat lower estimate for July, I take it  Well, we can do what we want to do, but the [practice] has been to give a single point We've often said "about" or "around" or we've given a percentage rate and said "or above" Consistent with what I said, certainly if we took "C" we would say at that rate or above, which we've said on a number of occasions I don't think we've ever given a range  Yes, we need a number to construct a path And in a way a range sounds as if we're being very precise in that we're not going to accept anything below or anything above So I react a little adversely to a range But we have often used words like "about" or "above" to convey some [sense] of that  I just presumed that if this table was logically put together and we compromised on the others, we'd end up compromising on M2, too  No, this is the staff's projection of where it will run The projection may be wrong, but I assume this takes account of the staff's best judgment of what is consistent between these numbers, looking ahead  Well, Bob proposed 7, 8, and 8 percent I suppose we would say "about" 7, 8, and 8 percent consistent with that I take it that doesn't give us any great problem in July; if anything, those July projections are going to be reduced at the moment you have to go make up a path  I would suggest that we have a real problem in lowering that at all significantly now, in view of both the domestic uncertainty but more precisely the exchange market uncertainty at the moment My own feel for this situation, though one never knows, is that if the exchange market begins running--and it's  -62-    7/9/80  on the verge of it now--that will raise the question and force it to our minds I'm sure we'd have differing opinions about whether we have to make some overt "tightening" move to deal with the exchange market situation; I think that would be more inconsistent with what we're trying to do than accepting this delicate business of trying to skate through this period without getting the psychological screws loose And they're very close to being loose  I might say a word about the discount rate, too, because I think it's relevant here The logic is to get it down for basically two reasons I don't see any reason why we should in concept have the discount rate impede reductions in the prime rate, which at some point it may do psychologically Beyond that, as somebody alluded to this morning, if and when we get a reversal in interest rates, the question is [whether] that might occur in a time period we are worried about The discount rate then does have operational significance because it tends to put a ceiling on the funds rate or at least slow down any increase in the funds rate And since presumably we don't want a big reaction upward in the funds rate from a fairly technical and maybe passing change in the money supply numbers, it would be nice to get the discount rate lower It would be more than nice; I think we ought to try to do it  The problem we run into again involves domestic and international psychological problems We've done a little exploration among the foreign central banks in the last few days to see what the chances are for taking the curse off a further movement [down in interest rates] If [such a move] is interpreted as an easing, whether it's the discount rate or something else, what are the prospects that this would be hidden or submerged in other rate changes? The answer, I think, is ambiguous at the least It's another dimension that can be thrown in here It is not an irrelevant consideration in the framework of the next week or so because I can't say there is no possibility If it doesn't happen pretty soon, I think [our foreign colleagues] will all go away on vacation and it probably won't happen until September But it is a matter that is under consideration in a number of countries--so far with a negative answer The situation is such that if one country moved, everybody probably would move; but nobody wants to lead the parade  SPEAKER(?) Would they follow us?  No I think we're irrelevant to this We're not totally irrelevant, but they consider us off on a course of our own and somewhat irresponsible anyway Whether we move or not doesn't have the same bearing as somebody important within Europe moving, or even if the Japanese move I don't think there's much chance of the Japanese leading the parade, although they might  There are all sorts of conflicts involved They are in the same dilemma as we are basically They'd like to move  -63-    7/9/80  in terms of the business outlook but they don't want to give any sense to their own public, externally or internally, that they've given up on inflation They're very sensitive to that And the Germans are in a peculiar position because they're at the bottom of the EMS exchange rate [band] So they ask how they can go first when the DM is already weak in their terms The currency that is strong in the EMS is the French franc The trouble with the French [making a move] is that they have a rising inflation rate at the moment They're about the only country left where inflation is still rising And while they have a sluggish business situation, they also say How can we give a signal about inflation when the inflation rate is still rising?  My own feeling about the discount rate is that we ought to move as soon as it's--I was going to say "safe" It's not going to be safe; as it stands we can't be sure there's going to be no reaction But as soon as we feel there's enough protection somehow and that the risks of setting off something in the exchange market are minimized, we ought to go I don't know when that will be  I don't think we ought to debate that precisely, but those are some of the background considerations to where this federal funds limit is set What we have on the table is 7, 8, and 8 percent [for the monetary aggregates] and 8-1/2 to 14 percent [for the funds rate range]  Well, I don't know about the proponents but I would operate this [along the lines of] what I said on "C," which is that we would tolerate some increase over 7 percent--just to look at that particular number--in the short run before the next meeting without pushing the federal funds rate up to anything like 14 percent Now, [the interval before] the next meeting is so short that I really can't conceive of these numbers getting to the point where we'd want to exert very strong restraint, but I suppose they could To try to be specific, suppose we got a fairly big July--significantly bigger than this [projection]--and we were coming into August, but [before the] meeting, and the August projection was for a 12 percent increase I suppose we'd let the federal funds rate begin to go up and we wouldn't fully adjust the path to take care of a 12 percent increase, say, on top of a 10 percent increase--just to pick two numbers out of the air  I think we'd probably accept 9 percent-- I'm just giving a qualitative judgment--provided the federal funds rate is behaving as expected If growth began getting above 9 percent, I think we'd probably have to consult  And we'd be operating at the constraint; that's why the constraint is important  My general answer would be that whatever influence [our actions] have on that is going to be related more to what happens to interest rates than to what happens to the money supply in a very short-run perspective  I think the various considerations have been pretty well laid out Let me see what the sentiment is for 7, 8, and 8 percent--using the word "about" in the directive--with these numbers for the federal funds range, which are unchanged from a month ago  I think it means something It doesn't mean [anything for the path]; the path is not set on that number But for purposes of an example, suppose M2 came in very high relative to this [8 percent] number and the M1 numbers came in significantly low I think that would affect our judgment as to how hard we pushed on M1 because we would be running high on the one and low on the others  Let me say there's an approximation here  One might argue that if money market funds were going up, that ought to be weighed because they have some of the characteristics of a transactions balance  Squeeze down harder on the others  We haven't been this precise recently; we used to be But let me further amend the motion and say as an approximation that we will put some weight on M2, maybe 50-50  It's much less M1 used to be half of M2; it's not anymore  Then interest rates would go down more slowly  Well, we may be a bit inconsistent in saying this I have to amend this motion further The conflict comes between saying equal weight and saying we are going to tolerate an overrun And I guess I've said both So in a sense we wouldn't tighten up, even if consistent with tolerating an overrun the M1s arithmetically came out on target We'd let them go for--  Yes, I know  We probably ought to avoid trying to be technical about equal weighting But [M2] is a consideration Let's just end it there So with these [nuances], the directive would say about 7, 8, and 8 percent, 8-1/2 to 14 percent [for the funds rate] and there's an understanding of some tolerance of being above [the growth rates cited] And we don't ignore M2--that is the way to put it--when we're judging how much above to tolerate  I just have no basis for doing that The staff tells me that this is the most likely relationship, and I don't have any independent--  I think what the staff has said is that M2 has been rising relatively rapidly compared to these others, but they don't expect that to be the case in the future  We don't have to push so hard  Well, how many people find the proposal that is on the table acceptable?  SPEAKER(?) Voting members?  It looks nearly unanimous, doesn't it? I think enough hands were raised that we can vote We are voting now on the short run  Well, after that display of unanimity, let's return to the long run I would interpret that vote as consistent with what I said earlier about the long-run targets for  -70-    7/9/80  1980, if we can call 1980 long run at this point I don't know whether I can repeat what I said [with regard to] keeping the ranges unchanged numerically We will explain that there are technical problems with the M1 relationships, but that's not central We're not recognizing here that the ranges are [unintelligible] We understand and accept that and we even think it's likely that the M1 number will come in toward the lower part of the range we have targeted We think M2 will probably come in toward the higher part of the targeted range and that M3 will be someplace in the middle We think bank credit may come in low and we'll explain that I think that's the substance for 1980 Since we're just reaffirming numbers, maybe we can have a vote on this one part  Well, let's have a little discussion about that whole issue It's going to be even more relevant for '81 In substance that is what we're saying  I'm dividing it into two pieces just to make it manageable, I hope It's not really a Solomonic tactic; it's a manageability tactic Can we have a vote on '80? Do you understand what it is? Numerically it's just where we are, but the discussion implied [nuances] which will appear in the report  For 1981 we have a more difficult problem I don't know whether you have any language for us, Mr Axilrod Have you had a chance--?  Of language or anguish?  Before we get to the language, [let's return to our earlier] discussion about what [needs to be] in the directive In substance--but the lawyers may want to talk to this--I don't see why we need any [elaboration] in the directive And therefore, I would say we're talking about the language that will provide the core of the report for talking about '81 But [the directive] could be further elaborated with language, particularly with some mention of NOW accounts and all that business and why we arrived at this conclusion  I don't think we necessarily have to take a vote on it, frankly On the other hand, the argument for taking a vote is that the law specifically asks us to state--I forget the [precise wording of] what the law asks us to do It asks for a Committee judgment--  We must give the Committee's statement of its plans and objectives, so I lean slightly--but I don't think it's compelling--toward having a vote on it as a Committee statement But we have to have some method of indicating it's a Committee consensus Maybe we can just indicate that this is the Committee's consensus without arguing over it  I don't know why it was in there before I may have had some very persuasive reason myself; I don't even remember the discussion But it doesn't seem to be operative in terms of anything we're doing now  There's no doubt that I have to be able to say it's a consensus Now, I don't know if we have to take a formal vote to say it's a consensus  Well, [not having] a vote doesn't say it wasn't a consensus [Whether or not] we're voting, that's what this is  That's right I'd like to stop short of that, frankly  I'm happy to accept that view without even introducing the complications that can be quibbled about If it is the consensus that it can be left to the staff and myself and the understanding is that it's--  Yes, but that's saying almost nothing  No, I don't think so We'd like to have it all the time but if there's a real difference of opinion, I think we're stuck and we just don't reflect unanimity  I [suspect so], too I don't think this [draft language] quite does it, Steve It talks a lot about the technological complications, which I think should be in the statement someplace, but it doesn't seem to me to reflect adequately the views of all the members of the Committee in that there is a real uncertainty involved in the economic outlook itself And that's going to affect--  Well, I would hope that that's a minimum we could agree upon The real [problem] is that I am not sure that's right I'm not sure that goes far enough for some people I admit the difference isn't very large but I suspect it's real And the only way I can see going further--just to try again out loud--is to say it is the general policy and intention of the Committee to seek lower growth rates over a period of time consistent with countering inflationary forces The Committee will be examining 1981 in that light specifically, but the extent to which progress toward that objective can be made in 1981 will have to be evaluated in the light of all the circumstances at the time  Well, that is part of it The other part is how much one is persuaded about monetarist doctrine in general I think those two considerations are entering in here, which makes it difficult  Well, it's easy to be influenced by the short run, and I recognize the trap that we can conceivably get into next year But I feel uncomfortable right at this stage It seems to me that it's perfectly illustrated by this [Proxmire] resolution, which presumably I have to support, however lukewarmly If we come out with a statement for '81 that somehow seems inconsistent with that, there will be a lot of explaining to do that seems troublesome to me in terms of questioning our whole outlook [and] modus operandi  -75-    7/9/80  Well, I'm willing to go so far [and make] the kind of statement I just made That while this is our general intention, specifically how far or whether we can do it in 1981 remains to be seen Nevertheless, our bias is in that direction  It must be lower than what we've had  Just to get to the substance, whatever the exact words are, my own feeling is pretty strong that we have to say something about a bias toward lowering the ranges next year I'm willing to put in an escape hatch that says in the end it may not be possible But there has to be some minimal expression of a bias in that direction--looking at both sentences in effect--or we will get ourselves in a difficult problem in the short run We will anyway, I think, with the escape hatch, but it would be moderated I recognize that when one looks at these projections of the economy and all the rest, one has to wonder how the hell we can do it But I'm saying  -76-    7/9/80  we've got to face up to that question Put off the problems of tomorrow until tomorrow, right?  I know, but it's still all a projection too, and--  I'm inclined to think that we're probably going to have to--or maybe should--end up with a vote What I would propose is that we put together what you describe as the middle ground, indicating a bias but with a caveat I can circulate the language and get a reaction to the precise language If you don't want to bias it in that direction and feel strongly that you want a much more neutral statement, vote against it And if asked whether this was unanimous, I'd say "no;" some people were doubtful and enough doubtful that we were going to make progress in that direction next year that they wanted to allow themselves, in effect, a bigger escape hatch That may reflect the reality I think we're better off doing that than trying to waffle on the whole point of [consensus]  Sure We can do anything in February we want to do in the end This obviously biases what we do in February I'd just like to get a showing of hands on this and maybe [consider] some kind of voting procedure We don't want to take a formal action, or a final action anyway, right now I will circulate some language in any event I will attempt to reach the widest area of agreement [along the lines of] what was described as the middle course Some bias about [lower targets for] the long term, which encompasses 1981, with a statement that whether that will be possible specifically in '81 is going to depend upon an evaluation not only of all the technical factors but also an evaluation of economic conditions and the relationships between money and the economy when we have to make a final judgment in February or January or whenever it is  -77-    7/9/80  Sure, that can be implied, too  Well, let me worry about the precise language It will be circulated Do I capture a sufficiently wide area of Committee opinion to make this the likely candidate to be worked on, subject to fiddling around with the language?  Well, you'll have to judge that in itself in the end Some people may want to [express] a different opinion I'm trying to say something here, though not very much I'm trying to express a bias without locking us into it That's the intention  I think it's clear that nobody is going to be faced with something like "I promised to do it" But I still want to maintain the bias I sense that that's likely to capture the biggest number and come as near to a consensus as we can get It may be a complete consensus Is that right? Is that near a consensus?  That seems to be the case, so let's operate [on that assumption] We'll get some language out before the end of the week and have some form of assent or vote or something so that I can say that it's a consensus of the Committee Okay Does that complete the meeting?  It was not intended to downgrade M2, I take it?  Up until the last meeting it was done that way?    7/9/80  I had the same question Tony did when I glanced at it But if it was just a reversion to what was done in all the meetings up until the last one, I don't think it's a--  We're going to give it some weight, yes I can do it either way I don't think it's important that we've always done it the other way I would go along with that; it's probably slightly better This is just a question of whether we list M2 along with the M1s Is that agreeable? Okay, the only other item on the agenda is that the next meeting is August 12th  Oh yes, thank you--the forecasts Do you want to hand those [tables] out? I don't know that we have to spend a lot of time on this but we'll see  SPEAKER(?) You're just trying to get the range, right?  I'll show you Do you all have copies?  What we've done, as you will see, is to take the numbers that you submitted and that the Board members talked about The Chairman exerted his prerogative of not putting down precise numbers But we've divided it up to give a little sense of [the views of] the Board members, the voting Presidents, and the non- voting Presidents My overall impression is that, for some reason, not voting may breed irresponsibility or something But the ranges are very similar and fall within the range of the Board staff's projections for the major variables in both '80 and '81 There were a couple of outliers among the non-voting Presidents We are not committed to any particular treatment of this in the report What we did in the last two reports, I believe, was to show a range for Board members I was asked the last time why we didn't include all Committee members I didn't commit myself [to a change], but I acknowledged that that was a reasonable question So my presumption is that we might as well show the range for all Committee members this time I'm not sure there's any particular point in dividing it up between Board members and others We could include non-voting Presidents or not, but the specific request was "Committee members" so my [suggestion] would be to combine the Board members and the Presidents and say this is the Committee's range We've never tried to narrow the range very far We've had among the Board members some discussion of whether the more outlying [views] couldn't converge someplace There were some problems that arose when we discussed this among the Board, which relate to the problem that Chuck just raised, and I think we ought to discuss this a bit We decided on the ranges  -79-    7/9/80  We're a little vague about next year, but we have to discuss their consistency with the forecast of the Council [of Economic Advisors] Mr Kichline says on the basis of his scientific investigation that they are consistent, with a low order of probability What do we say about that? How do you feel about the way we present these forecasts? And do any of you want to change your mind about the numbers you've already submitted very tentatively?  Excuse me, Nancy, but while I think of it, the most important question presentationally seems to me whether we present these forecasts with no tax cut, with a tax cut, or both I am afraid, frankly, of just presenting a projection which says "with a tax cut" because I don't know how to avoid the implication that the Federal Reserve takes it for granted that there will be a tax cut and that it's desirable The only argument against presenting it at least both ways is that the numbers look so sour without [a tax cut] There's the problem of presenting a very sour economic forecast How that gets resolved is beyond me But that's the most important presentational issue  If we do it both ways [the questions is] why not have the tax cut It's as if all these projections surely show Mirabile dictu! If we have a tax cut, we get more growth and no more inflation, and anybody except a damn fool would have a tax cut In fact, instead of a $30 billion tax cut, why not make it $60 billion because then we'd get still more growth and--  Well, I would prefer to approach it the way you are approaching it But how does one handle this question? It sticks out even more sharply than it otherwise sticks out that our projection is for an extremely sour business picture and a very high unemployment picture for another 18 months, so why aren't we using policy--?  Is the CEA assuming an easier monetary policy or do they have a different assumption as to that wonderful demand shift that's--  They have lower interest rates How do they get them?  Another question that arises in our projections, now that I think of it, is that they show very little improvement on the inflation side--  --from year to year In fact, for the non-voting Presidents the range is exactly the same and for the voting Presidents it's exactly the same  No, I'm looking at the wrong comparisons here They're not exactly the same, but there's little difference; they show a decline [in inflation] of a quarter percentage point from year to year  I'm looking at the wrong numbers again; they show a difference of one half percentage point  Look at the unemployment rate under any of the projections for next year I don't see how we can talk about a tax cut without, in effect, saying we should have a tax cut  -81-    7/9/80  [But their question would be] Why do we have to wait, if that's your--  Well, this is filled with booby traps, but we can't avoid them all Along the same line, we used the CPI the last time For technical reasons the CPI comparison from '80 to '81 will look less good than the other [measure], theoretically; I don't know how it will come out We just thought tentatively that we'd not give the CPI [forecast] even though it's very good at the end of this year in some people's opinions Well, we don't have to resolve this finally today but if anybody has great suggestions--and particularly if anybody wants to change his or her projection in a way that would affect any of this--let Mr Kichline know in the next day or two I suppose you just have to leave it to us as to how they're presented Also, please convey any bright ideas on what we should say about the consistency of our whole approach to the CEA's [projections] They say our computer tells us it's inconsistent, but we know it's consistent  I take this silence as assent that we will work out the problem  SPEAKER(?) It seems it's late in the day  Now where are we?  Well, let me say in that connection that I thought the presentations this morning were very good The Bluebook was well developed I shudder, as I do every time, when I look at that Bluebook and all that stuff coming out of these computers about the more increase in money supply we have and the more tax cut we have the better everything looks!  It may not be what the language says, but if one looks at those pages with all the alternatives, that's the conclusion--  I understand that [the outlook is worse] if one looks at a long enough period and all the rest, but I still would hate to see that Bluebook get into the press  I think the Bluebook always should have a paragraph in it saying that there are those who think this is all a lot of baloney and that everything is going to work out much better with the more restrictive policy  Well, I've had a little discussion about that I asked Carl Scheld to look at that Frankly, I find the Redbook less useful than it might be--not in the sense that it's not a very good idea to get these kinds of comments fresh from the market, but in its organization It goes District by District and it's awfully hard for me--I never get through it, frankly--to get some sense of what is happening in a particular sector of the economy or what the latest feel is, which is what the Redbook is supposed to give, because the information is so dispersed I'd like to see some reorganization, maybe only in the summary, so that it comes through a little more clearly What should be clear, looking at all these reports, is that this is the latest feel we have for residential construction or for business investment and that these are the nuances in different areas or sectors of the economy It's just a matter of organizing the material  Well, let's pick up these papers with the projections; people are worried about these [getting out] I worry a lot more about the Bluebook, frankly, than these wide ranges but--  If it's all right, I don't think we need a break unless people want to break just for a minute or two We want to discuss the Monetary Control Act a little and questions that arise with respect to that  We can have a seventh inning stretch We'll have a 5 minute break and come back for other [non-FOMC] matters  END OF MEETING       I conclude from all of this, gentlemen, that whatever people say about our monetary policy, our technology is worse! We will see what we can do to improve it [Secretary's note The Chairman was referring to problems with the telephone communications equipment]  The general question that I wanted to review with you is the reaction to this targeting [or] nontargeting that we went through for 1981 I think it's apparent after going through several days of hearings, not only with the Banking Committee but with other committees, that we have contributed to a lot of confusion about what our intention was in not presenting targets [for 1981] Of course, the testimony and the statement and the report were couched in terms of working toward some reduction in the targets But I am afraid in the [interpretation] that came through that was not at all clear because otherwise we would have said something about the targets So they doubt our conviction as well as our good will in following what they conceive to be the law This leaves me troubled somewhat--not in [regard to the] substance--but that our trust and good faith have been questioned by a large number of people And I think it could lead to some continuing problems It will certainly lead to a very adverse Committee report, but that in itself was anticipated What disturbs me is this underlying sense of a lack of trust in our good faith  I have a specific request from Mr Proxmire, which I am now fulfilling, to review this situation with the Committee [The Banking Committee] challenges us on legal grounds, I think, as well as on substantive grounds I think the legal position is perhaps a little fuzzier than we thought it was at the time [of our decision] What they point out is that there is a Senate committee report that has fairly specific language It's just a Senate committee report, but nonetheless it's there, and it speaks of "numerical" monetary targets for a fixed calendar year Of course, by coincidence that was precisely the language that I used in the testimony--that we didn't choose to give them precise numerical targets So they found some language that spoke precisely in terms of numerical targets That committee report isn't absolutely conclusive but it surely had some coloration to the effect that we would have precise numerical targets for both years So I think our legal ground is still valid, but it's not quite so one-sided as the presumption that we had at the time we were discussing it at the Committee meeting But more fundamental than the legal question, which our legal counsel is still sure he could win, is that the issue is just a little more clouded, as I understand it I'm not sure there's any merit at all in getting into a legal argument In the end they can change the law, obviously, if they want it clearer There was no support for our position by anybody, and there was bipartisan concern up and down the line in the Banking Committee And, as I say, [the issue] was mentioned in some other committees  This leaves me personally with the feeling that we probably ought to go ahead and give them some quantitative idea as to what we are talking about The substantive problem is that, with all of the institutional changes, [numerical targets] are likely to confuse them I told them that 19 times, to no avail I am in the process of    7/25/80  preparing a letter that will go to both committees, if we want to go this way It starts out by saying "It's apparent to me from the questions and discussions in the recent monetary policy oversight hearings that confusion has unfortunately arisen over the intent of the Federal Open Market Committee in characterizing monetary target ranges for 1981 in general terms I was, for instance, disturbed that some members of the committee apparently seriously considered that the Open Market Committee was somehow signalling a reluctance to provide numerical targets for 1981 at any time--a thought that I can confidently say has never entered our discussions" The letter then explains why we chose to do what we did But it goes on to say that it's going to be terribly confusing if we try to give all these targets But the key sentence would say, if I can find it "Abstracting from institutional influences and the questions cited above"--and all those questions are about the fact that we don't know what the impact of NOW accounts is-- "we find it difficult to gauge the continued significance of the money market fund growth and we need to learn more about this apparent shift in M1 demand" So abstracting from all of those things, "the general intent of the FOMC at this time can be summarized as looking toward a reduction in the ranges for M- 1A, M-1B and M2 on the order of 1/2 percent next year" The letter would go on to say that if we translate that into specific targets, we have to allow for all of these shifts And then it gives them some numbers, but it says don't take these numbers seriously--they're all illustrative and we will have to look at them again All we are trying to say is precisely what we already said and I repeat the language that we have already used in the report and in the testimony That's what should come through and not all of this arithmetic, and we hope the arithmetic doesn't confuse you We fear that it might, but since you insist upon asking for [numerical targets] we are giving them to you  That is the way I would propose going I could send out a draft of this letter to you this afternoon We don't have to take any formal action right now, but I wanted to relay this concern, the formal request of Senator Proxmire, and my sense of how it should be handled I basically don't think we have much to win in this game by sitting on our present position, because I think genuine confusion has arisen among some of those who are most supportive of our general policies and approaches It's unanimous in that sense So that is [my recommendation] in substance Now, I had tentatively put in this letter a sentence that speaks of a reduction "on the order of 1/2 percent" [on the ranges] for M1 and M2 But also there is a sentence saying consistent with that, at this very early stage we think there probably shouldn't be any reduction next year in [the ranges for] M3 or bank credit, because in a recovery period those measures tend to be a little higher relative to M1 and M2 than in another kind of period So the letter just speaks vaguely of [those ranges] being unchanged I don't think that's necessarily essential, but that's again talking somewhat in the abstract Also, the letter in great tortuous detail goes over how it would look, not in the abstract [but] on the basis of arbitrary assumptions as to NOW accounts and money market funds and so forth That is the essence of it, and I [would be interested in] any reaction you have at this point to the general idea  If we want to go ahead in this fashion, I can send this [draft letter] out I don't think we need further conversation if it's generally acceptable, but we would need a formal vote at [some]    7/25/80  point, since the [decision] is being put in numerical terms I don't mean a formal vote this afternoon, but when you see the actual--  It says that at great length I could read this to you and--  The draft as it is now goes on about five pages And the reason it goes on is that it keeps telling them how arbitrary these assumptions are on NOW accounts and--  --and how we are going to have to look at it all again in February It says that in three different ways  Yes, this talks about on the order of 1/2 percent, so that's the presumption It is not meant to convey rigidity on those kinds of questions because the tone of the whole letter is not to convey great rigidity But it specifically says nothing about that point The key sentence is the one that I read  Yes I think in the absence of saying anything else that's the clear implication  Well, we have had a little discussion of that informally here--not with the Committee but with Mr Axilrod and others We could do that for the M1 ranges very easily in my opinion because they are 2-1/2 percentage points [wide] now To make a range wider than 3 percentage points for the others I think would look a little peculiar I just wonder whether it would undermine the exercise a bit I have, as you know, traditionally been in favor of wide ranges But there's a point at which I begin gagging a bit at their significance if we make them too wide  I don't know I puzzled over that My conclusion was--whether it's in an appendix or the letter--give them a lot of language to keep reiterating the arbitrariness of these adjustments So, I don't think just a sentence saying that is going to carry the flavor And I really believe we want to get that message through somehow What the letter actually says is Arbitrarily assume that 2-1/2 percent comes out of M-1A into M-1B and that 2 percent, I think, comes out of savings deposits into M-1B And this is just the arithmetic If we lower the range by 1/2 percent and then make those two adjustments, we have an M-1B range of 5 to 7-1/2 percent It looks high And that is my concern Just looking at that range for M-1B, the key aggregate number, it is raised significantly from this year [The reaction could be that] the Federal Reserve is going to hell with an inflationary policy Now, it brings the M-1A range down to 0 to 2-1/2 percent  Just hang on, Ernie I'm listening to Tony Solomon on another phone and I'll tell you what he said afterwards  Well, it is quite possible we could write a letter--I'm just thinking out loud here--that is instead quite brief It would note all this uncertainty that has arisen, the essence of what we are saying, and translate that into the 1/2 percent    7/25/80 -5-  reduction in the ranges for M-1A and M2 in the abstract And I could say I am attaching an appendix which [discusses] these further adjustments That may be a way to do it It's the same in substance; it's just lifting out 2 pages of this letter and putting it into an appendix  There may be Then the letter itself would only speak about the 1/2 percent with qualifications around it, and it would say look to the appendix to see this more or less arbitrary translation into the other numbers  Let me go backwards, here I take it the rest of you didn't hear Tony's comment  SEVERAL No  He was kind of seconding Henry Wallich's proposal to put part of this [lengthy letter] into an appendix And you heard what I said, I'm sure He just thought it might be less confusing, from the standpoint of the press, to have the elaborate specific targets developed in an appendix We can certainly look at that, and it may be better  Now, Mrs Teeters just raised a question on how many qualifications I had around the 1/2 percent Well, it talks about that general statement [as] one of the clearest and most useful indications we can make and [notes that] the numerical ranges might ultimately prove to be a source of confusion rather than clarity It speaks about the institutional change The key sentence, again, is the one that I read It says "on the order of 1/2 percent" and the letter at various points talks about uncertainties, including the public's desire over the longer run to hold money balances in relation to income  I do have some language here [about that] What is essential is that our intention to lower monetary growth ranges over time toward rates consistent with virtual price stability should remain clear There is language [regarding our intent to]    7/25/80  review this Here's the sentence I'm looking for This is close to the end as it's now written "In accordance with usual procedures, all of the ranges will have to be reassessed in or before next February The extent of downward adjustments in the ranges not only will be influenced by the technical factors noted above, but also will be conditioned by the speed with which inflationary bias in labor and product markets can be reduced, and by the likelihood, therefore, that the economy can make an orderly adaptation to curtailed money growth The need for public policies other than monetary policy to move in a complementary way to speed those adjustments was, of course, the essence of my testimony before the Committee" Now, that paragraph obviously could be read either way, as permitting more downward adjustment or conceivably none I think it's probably the way I would like it read I must say that if we make enough progress on price stability, we'd go faster But I think it's formally neutral in its wording We are caught in a box, obviously Looked at from one point of view the 1/2 percent doesn't sound like much If somebody says Hell, the inflation rate is 10 percent and at best they are going to get down to 0--and the progress will be measured by the decline in the money supply--they have 20 years to go On the other hand, if someone says something like 0 on M1 monetary growth--or to have a range, let's say 0 to 3 percent--is ultimately where we would end up, we are not all that far from it It's just these darn lags that have made it look so far off  Yes  Did you hear Governor Gramley?  SPEAKER(?) No, we did not  Well, the question was simply how much sentiment is there for 1/2 to 1 percent--the question that Ernie Baughman raised And Governor Gramley said he prefers the 1/2  Any other comment?    7/25/80  Did you have a question? Well, it sounds to me as if we are at 1/2 I think there is a real problem here in that it will seem very small to people who are unaware of some of the technicalities The sentence I read to you may help a bit in explaining that, but I guess that's where we are stuck  Yes I think you'll find this letter reiterates everything! Well, I think we have enough guidance; it's just a question of whether we put the specific ranges in an appendix or the letter I may try it both ways to see which I like better We will get this out to you in a day or so and then I think you can respond in a formal way, so that when we have numerical [ranges] we can say there has been an actual vote on this I don't think we need that today; you might as well wait until you see the language And I will also call Messrs Proxmire and Reuss I presume they will be happy, but if they tell me they really don't want anything more, despite what everybody said, I may drop this whole thing I think the chances of their saying that are virtually nil  We will do that We'll send it with the letter Okay, thank you  END OF SESSION     Let's come to order We have two new faces at the table today Another way to put it is that we have one new face and one old face in a new guise I want to welcome Mr Ford and Mr Corrigan You have great privileges as new members You may speak first, last, or in the middle when it comes to delivering some cogent comments on what we should be doing I'll give you a little time to think about that We do welcome you around the table  I would like to mention and emphasize a matter on which I sent you a note We had a leak about the aggregates [targets] for the year after our telephone consultation, which disturbed me What disturbed me was not just the substance of it--though I don't think it would be considered the most damaging leak in the world in terms of the market [effect]--but that it could happen at all I'm not suggesting at all that the only place a leak can come from is a Reserve Bank, but in this particular case the reporter identified [the information] as having come from a Reserve Bank or Reserve Banks I suppose it might have come from Washington in other circumstances Wherever it came from, there is nothing more corroding of the confidence with which we sit around the table or in a telephone conference and discuss [policy] than the fear that somehow there is going to be a leak of what is discussed I just cannot operate in that way I know of only one way to deal with this lack of confidence, which I don't want to have, and that is to diminish and diminish and diminish the [attendance at] meetings so nobody is here but the people who actually have to be At least then we would have identified [the source of any leak] down to a smaller group I don't think anybody wants to go in that direction, but that is one of the prices of having this kind of leak I don't know where it came from, and I don't care where it come from in this particular incidence, but I do care about the matter in general If you haven't already done so, I would urge you to take whatever [measures necessary to convey] the message in your own way within your own institutions to give us the best assurance we can have that this doesn't happen again We are going to end up not talking very freely if it does Enough of that  One other thing I would mention is the meeting schedule for 1981 I don't want your reactions at the moment but perhaps we can take that up at the next meeting and you can convey any reactions you have before that You will recall that I raised the question some months ago--assuming we continue with the reserve targeting procedures--of whether the logic somehow suggested that we should have a meeting near the beginning of a quarter We are compelled to do things according to the calendar annually, quarterly, monthly, or whatever Given that what we have been doing is setting the target for every quarter, the logic seems to suggest that it would be convenient to have a meeting near the beginning of the quarter or the end of the previous quarter Then perhaps a reasonable checkpoint would be somewhere around the middle of the quarter Doing that would mean intervals of six or seven weeks between meetings, typically, which is a little longer than what we have had in recent years This year we are scheduled to have ten meetings I would be perfectly happy to have more telephone updates between meetings if that seemed desirable--if it seems like a long time between meetings But it still seems to me a rather attractive way of proceeding, assuming    8/12/80  we're on this kind of targeting I'd like to get your reactions to it at or before the next meeting and then we can set some dates so people can get them on their calendars, however we're going to [proceed] I can send out some tentative dates after this meeting, just so we have something concrete to look at But the general concept is more important than the particular dates at this point I think that covers all the extraneous business  We need to approve more than one set of minutes I take it there was a lapse in approving the minutes of a couple of telephone conferences, Mr Secretary  March 7th and May 6th got lost somehow Were they telephone conferences?  We need a motion  SPEAKER(?) So moved  Without objection, we'll approve them Mr Pardee  Is the Treasury behind in covering Swiss francs and Carter bonds?  Comments or questions? Governor Wallich  Everybody really wants fixed exchange rates?  -2-    8/12/80  Given that everybody can't have that Governor Rice  [Unintelligible]  Do you have some recommendations?  We do have to ratify transactions since the last meeting If there are no objections to renewing the swaps, we will renew them if necessary  Can I have a motion to ratify?  Without objection, they are ratified Mr Sternlight  Questions or comments?  Are we changing that or--?  Governor Gramley  The trouble is that we can't do what you are suggesting, I don't think, in any particular week, and then the next week assume [the relationship] is going to go back to normal That has more or less been the behavior  We can make some kind of guess, whichever way, in the following week But we can't do anything in the actual week when that big excess arises, I don't think  If we could forecast that, I think you are right But every week is different In that particular week, the banks went out and borrowed a large amount of money at the beginning of the week, which gave them the excess But they had already borrowed it and that's the point at which the federal funds rate went up And then it was too late  But the one day behind is the day that screws it up The banks already did the borrowing, which made the market tight  I don't think we're going to resolve this here but, as I remember that week, unbeknownst to us they borrowed a whole lot of money on Thursday We [questioned why] they would borrow so much money on Thursday We thought they were going to end up with big excess reserves and we figured they would be reducing them [the next day] presumably Then they borrowed a lot over the weekend The market remained tight By that time they were locked into the excess reserves and most of them were left in If the excess was going to continue the next week and we knew it, then I think you're perfectly right But I don't know how we can manage it within the week  We'll take a look at it  Let me try to answer what I think you're getting at When we have a very low level of borrowings, frictional or very close to frictional, it's natural and convenient to have the discount rate above the federal funds rate, presumably not by too much But if we have a sizable level of borrowing, which we don't have [now], the federal funds rate will go above the discount rate And there's not much we can do about it That's the dilemma we're in because the banks won't borrow unless the funds rate is above the discount rate So we can't have a penalty [discount rate] under those circumstances I may be exaggerating a bit, but if we try, it just keeps ratcheting the rates up  I think you may be interpreting that the opposite of the way the staff meant you to interpret it The idea is not to manage the funds rate below the discount rate  It just says that with a given level of borrowings this is what we would expect the federal funds rate to be And the higher borrowings are, the higher the federal funds rate will be relative to the discount rate, wherever the level may be  Oh, I think it does matter where the discount rate is All I am saying is a very simple thing It's very difficult or impossible in the short run to maintain a penalty discount rate when borrowings are sizable, given the way we do everything else--the lagged reserve accounting and these paths and all that It's not hard to do, obviously, when the borrowings are minimal But the problem that we had before--and that we may have now to a slight degree--is that when the discount rate was way above the federal funds rate and borrowings were in fact minimal, as soon as borrowings became appreciable the federal funds rate would jump way up to the discount rate Whereas if the discount rate was lower, the discount rate is somewhat of a drag on that process That is the main reason why some of us, at least, wanted to get the discount rate down That way, as soon as we ran into any borrowing we wouldn't have too sharp a jump in the federal funds rate During a period like we've had in the last three months, I would say it would have been very convenient to have a floating discount rate--to let the discount rate just go down with federal funds rate--and avoid all these announcement effects But if we did that, what do we do when borrowings increase and we begin putting a little pressure on the money market? The discount rate would go up very fast and maybe we wouldn't want it going up all that fast We haven't got any brake on the increase in the federal funds rates from a fairly low level of borrowings  Yes, unless we prevented the [rise in] borrowing, in which case we wouldn't be getting the restraint we'd be looking for That's the dilemma that we have perceived If we could adopt a floating discount rate on the down side and an administrative one on the up side, it would be all right But I think we'd end up with more confusion than we started with We did have a problem on the down side because we were afraid every time we moved [the discount rate] that we would be giving rise to more expectations than we wanted  Well, that's another aspect  -10-    8/12/80  I think it does, too  Yes, but what I am resisting--and this confusion arises all the time--is the concept that there is a rate relationship that makes sense on both sides of the cycle I don't think there is There may be a general concept [that makes sense] when there's practically no borrowing Then I would think, ideally, we'd keep [the two rates] pretty close Look at the other extreme that we were facing maybe a month or two ago Suppose we really forced excess reserves on the system; the funds rate might have gone way way down if we had done that I am not sure we would have wanted the discount rate to go down to 5 percent, if that's where the funds rate had been going for a few weeks And there's the more general consideration that Tony mentioned I don't see how we get out of this box with an automatic rate, although it would have been convenient for a period of a couple of months or weeks  No, I think implicit in what I am saying is that there is a reluctance to borrow and that's why we can't keep a penalty rate on the way up  I don't know whether I'd put it that way There is a reluctance And the higher the level of borrowings, the more we have moved on the reluctance schedule, so the higher the funds rate gets relative to the discount rate The more reluctant borrowers we have, the higher the federal funds rate will be relative to the discount rate  I think it's still harder, if I understand you correctly I think we just move along a schedule of reluctance; we have more reluctant borrowers with a high level of borrowing That means the federal funds rate will be more above the discount rate  I think it's quite clear what would happen if we didn't change our techniques, which might have some implications for whether to change them What would happen is that we would get more volatility in the federal funds rate in the short run  Yes, I thought there was Where do we stand on all of this? We discussed this once before  I don't remember how far we got on that We did have a preliminary discussion about it at one point Did you ever circulate a paper?  I had forgotten that that had never been done formally, and I think we ought to do it Meanwhile, I have been answering Congressional and other inquiries along the lines that I have been expounding at this table I don't think this situation is totally satisfactory, but I don't think the answer is just to [establish] an "automatic" discount rate for the reason that I suggested and for Tony's reason--whatever weight one gives that reason, which is something people have debated back and forth I don't think technically we have the [alternative of doing that] without changing other things I think it would call for rather profound changes in path setting, or maybe in whether we open up the discount window or close it, as Henry was suggesting  Yes, Mr Ford  We have to ratify the transactions of the Domestic Desk Without objection Mr Kichline  Why don't we discuss the economic situation and outlook at this point Mr Eastburn  Mr Black  Governor Wallich  I don't know how you forecast interest rates but in the long-term area with your mortgage rate, your bond rate must be up in the neighborhood of 13 to 14 percent That would be an extraordinarily high interest rate compared to your price indices at the end of next year It would be the highest real interest rate, in my memory anyway, for a long time Any comment?  Short-term interest rates  Well, I will agree that it's hard to forecast [interest rates] Mr Winn  Mr Balles  When you say "better"--I just want to help Mr Altmann a little [in preparing the record of Committee member's views]--are you saying better than the staff is projecting?  I just wanted a clarification of your statement You're not saying you are necessarily more optimistic than the staff?  You're more optimistic than you were last month, which they are too  Mr Corrigan  Mr Wallich  You say the downturn went pretty fast?  Mr Kichline, I meant to ask you earlier, and I didn't, about consumer balance sheets Governor Wallich says they haven't had a lot of time to improve all that much There has not been much time, that's for sure; but the decline in debt at least has been much sharper, I think, than in earlier recessions How does the improvement in the consumer's financial position look compared to earlier recessions? Do you have any judgment on that?  Are there any other comments on the business picture?  Mr Altmann is left at this point with saying [in the policy record for this meeting] that you all agree with the staff's outlook Is that the impression you want to leave him with?  Mr Roos  A lot of people might conclude from that analysis that good judgment is 7 percent, Larry  SPEAKER(?) But you don't know about '82  Why don't we turn to Mr Ettin [and then have coffee]  Why don't we have what I hope will be a relatively brief general discussion or questioning of Mr Ettin and then we'll get around to the [policy] specifications We can divide it up We have an hour and a quarter Henry has put his hand up, too, but we'll let Mr Eastburn go first  Which isn't very good either Don't look at these too carefully That's [the message]  Try M3  I don't really think we can assume any of these numbers are the right numbers We know M-1A is bad because more goes out of demand deposits than from M-1B; but to the extent [funds] go out of savings deposits into M-1B, that measure also is distorted We just don't know the extent of this  Well, I tell you The M3 chart is such a beautiful one that I am tempted to move to M3; we're right in the middle [of the range]  You had some comments, Henry?  What makes you think M-1B is [any better]? To say that M-1B is better than M-1A, you are making an assumption that there is very little movement from savings deposits into M-1B That may be true, but I don't think you know it  Yes, one could argue just that I think we had a big impact in the second quarter, but now because we have had that impact it will make the velocity relationship even tighter than it was before  Governor Partee  Mr Gramley  We [face] a real problem next year, in my role wearing my other hat as Depository Institutions Chairman, on whether to differentiate these rates There is going to be a lot of arguing about that Mr Corrigan  -26-    8/12/80  Mr Mayo  We hope 18 months from now M-1B will be that number, and we will have washed out all these--  -27-    8/12/80  Mr Roos  We will look at it with great interest  Lyle, you had a comment?  Any other general comments? I take it there is a good deal of acceptance of some of Mr Ettin's comments, and there is some question about being too serious about M2 Maybe I have misstated that [Perhaps it's more accurate to say] we should look at it but there is some reason to think it may be somewhat distorted on the up side  Along with Mr Roos' material, you can circulate that  Now we have to turn to the serious business of the Committee A number of people, John Balles and others, have described our basic dilemma in that we have both a serious inflation problem--or more pessimism about inflation and great sensitivity to expectations of inflation--against a rather shaky business recovery So some of the things one might ordinarily think would be good for the business recovery may not be good for the business recovery if they maximize the inflationary uncertainties and have an adverse repercussion on the  -28-    8/12/80  market for that reason As one market caller put it to me the other day, if the money supply really goes up very sharply for a couple of weeks, we will have big increases in long-term interest rates I think that is descriptive of the kind of dilemma we are in I don't know how we get out of that without going through a painful process of deflating the inflationary expectations, which are not deflated yet And I don't know how they get deflated without deflating the economy more than one would like to see it deflated I don't have a ready answer to that  My instinct is that we couldn't get by with it And I don't really think it would cure the problem People would wait for the monthly figure  It would help in terms of these intra- monthly gyrations, but I don't think it would deal with the dilemma that I am referring to, which is a real dilemma for the economy Actually, the Washington Post had a good editorial just the other day They put the same dilemma [in terms of] New York versus Washington Washington wants to expand whenever the economy gets into a recession and New York will run for cover with inflationary expectations if that happens, which will undermine the expansion Therefore, you can't do either And I think there is a lot of reality to that  I don't know if it will speed up the process or not but, if I may, let me give you something to shoot at When I look at these pretty charts--though obviously when we are talking about differences as small as those in "A" and "B," it is not a widely different picture--I come away with the feeling that alternative A is not in any sense off course Under alternative A, so far as the M-1A figure is concerned--it's not true of M-1B, which has been rising more rapidly-- if we took off from M-1A the target for the quarter is the same as [the one we had previously] It is consistent with a higher M-1B figure according to the current estimates, if they are any good, and a considerably higher M2 figure than we were talking about at the last meeting But those charts don't give a very disturbing picture; in fact, they give a rather nice picture If we held to it and just  -29-    8/12/80  extended [money growth] at the same rate, M-1A would end up right at the bottom of the range for the quarter or a little above it by the time we got to December M-1B, if I am right, would be just about in the middle, or maybe a bit below for the quarter and a little above in December For M2, alternatives A and B are very close together, but it's high in either case M3 is in the middle  We are dealing with an extremely [unintelligible] The market, as nearly as I can read it, has anticipated some tightening which hasn't taken place Maybe another way of stating it is that they also have a heavy supply of securities They see better business news and anticipate perhaps a bigger increase in the money supply and assume that would bring a higher federal funds rate That may or may not be true I myself don't see any reason, particularly, to bias that question at the moment If we are satisfied with something like the alternative A money supply figures, I don't think we have to do anything now to bias where we are in terms of the federal funds rate I am talking, really, about the borrowing figure at the moment If the money supply comes in higher, that doesn't imply, with our ordinary techniques, that [policy] would be tighter But [in that event] we would have seen evidence that the money supply is in fact running even [above] this figures which looks all right Or if it came in lower, we would be moving somewhat in the other direction So I would be inclined, in general terms, to take something like "A" and unbias the decision this week I don't know whether that means $100 million of borrowing or maybe a trifle less than that, but something in that neighborhood And as I say, if the money supply comes in-- just in M-1A terms with similar changes in the others--at 9 percent, let's say, the borrowings would go up and presumably we'd get an increase in the funds rate If it came in weaker, as I guess the New York projection suggests, we could perhaps run down to truly frictional levels of borrowing and the funds rate might go in the other direction But in either case, there would be better evidence than we have at the moment I don't think it's clear that we are off course, if we discount M2 a little at the moment So I don't see any reason for a bias at the moment in one direction or another, particularly given the sensitivities in the market With the dollar in a little better shape, conceivably we could make the bottom end of the federal funds range a little less close to the current market level than it is I don't know that we have much risk of running into either of those constraints, but it might look a little better So we could alter that a bit if you wanted to, but those are the very general thoughts that I have Why don't you proceed from there, Governor Schultz  "B minus" meaning even less than "B"?  Mr Black  Governor Wallich  Governor Gramley  What did M2 do in the last month?  SPEAKER(?) It grew at a 17 percent rate  Well, it may; the only effect it can have is if we change the path on the basis of [its behavior]  Governor Partee  Governor Rice  Mr Eastburn  Mr Mayo  Mr Solomon  Mr Roos  Governor Teeters  Wait a week  The position I've taken publicly, in the sense of responding to Congressional inquiries, is that it was a consideration in the background and tended to parallel the more important considerations of what we had domestically [For example], we didn't press for as quick a makeup of the shortfall in the money  -36-    8/12/80  supply as we theoretically could have That was not a decision based just on international grounds, although that happened to be an ingredient in that decision  I think [my statement] is also true Mr Winn  You are saying, I think, that the question to debate now is between assuming that the aggregates are going to explode and biasing the decision upward--  Well, I didn't hear anybody saying anything different, but I agree the temptation historically has been not to do anything about it Mr Ford  You are not necessarily confined to those alternatives  Mr Morris  Mr Corrigan  Mr Czerwinski  -38-    8/12/80  Well, there seems to be a good deal of agreement around the table I think what really happens between now and the next meeting is going to be determined, by everybody's specifications, by what happens to the aggregates And since that range of uncertainty is much greater than the one percentage point difference between these figures [for the quarter], that is the perspective in which I would view this, as many people already have My main concern is that we not bias this The bias is more in the borrowing level that we start with than in the difference between "A" and "B" Actually, the difference between "A" and "B" is more than one percentage point for the remainder of the quarter; it's 1-1/2 percentage points Considering the lags and all the rest, we don't have a lot of room for changing this between now and the end of the quarter The predominant view is clearly "A," but there was some sentiment for "B," obviously, and some people were willing--and maybe prepared--to go in between I suppose the practical choice is whether [or not] we go with A If we did, I would be inclined to put the federal funds rate range at 8 to 13 percent if we want the [width of the range to be] 5 percentage points It's 5-1/2 points now, but we could [set it at] 8 to 13 or 8 to 14 or 8 to 13-1/2 percent So let me assume something like that for the moment  Well, I've thought about that I am not sure it's going to have much effect because it will come out a month [or so after this meeting] [The funds rate] either will have been there or not have been there I don't know; I may be wrong I have thought about it and I am not sure it will have one because of the delay in the release of the record I think it would have an effect if we were announcing this today What do you think, Peter?  If the funds rate works out that way, I agree But it won't work out that way, presumably, unless the money supply is also running pretty low  My purpose is not to narrow it; I just wanted to lower it  -39-    8/12/80  If you want 8 to 14 percent, that wouldn't bother me Just to complete this, I would start off the borrowings at maybe $75 million--I'm thinking of the federal funds rate at around 9 percent or a little more, perhaps 9 to 9-1/2 percent now--if that's the [borrowing] number that's consistent with that [level of the funds rate] We are just talking about the first week here really, but I'd be inclined to say $75 million Let me just test the sentiment and see whether this in-between [number is acceptable] The intention is to put the quarterly figure in the directive now?  SPEAKER(?) Yes  So we are really talking about the top part of this [Bluebook] table if we assume that And that's probably the safest thing If we went halfway, the rates would be 6-1/2, 8-3/4, and 11-3/4 percent, if I calculated correctly Now, that makes a bigger difference for the remaining part of the quarter, but those are the numbers that would appear in the directive As I said, there was a clear majority for "A" Let's see whether people are happier with the halfway between numbers  June to September is what appears in the directive, right?  Presumably, it means the difference for the July-to-September figure is halfway in between, too, doesn't it? Isn't that correct arithmetically? It's just a bigger distance in between, in effect  -40-    8/12/80  But don't we get the right July-to- September numbers if we average those numbers in the table below?  It isn't immediately obvious to me  What we would have is 6 percent [for M-1A for July to September]  For the quarterly figure, right?  Well, it biases [the funds rate] a bit toward rising subsequently I am saying we don't bias it at all initially But in practice what it says, just looking at M-1A--if the arithmetic is correct--that we have an objective of 6 percent growth from now to the end of the quarter instead of 6-3/4 percent [under "A"]  For the first period, that's right  What we are looking at in practice is that if the $3 billion figure holds up for this week--I don't know whether it will--it will depend to some degree upon the projections thereafter We will get a preliminary figure for the week after But if the $3 billion held up and there wasn't any reason to think it was going to be reversed immediately, we would presumably have a higher borrowing level a couple of weeks from now And your straightforward projection of "A" even implies a slight increase in interest rates, you believe  Those estimates are obviously unreliable, but even [a forecast of] an ordinary figure for next week is unreliable These figures have been jumping all over the place But  -41-    8/12/80  if [the estimate] held up, whatever path we set now is likely to imply more borrowings That's one of the reasons I don't want to set the path so we get an increase now and then automatically get an increase two weeks from now That, I think, is [moving] too strongly  It depends Right now the $3 billion, as I see it, depends upon your projection--  If the $3 billion is a harbinger of [M-1A] running high, it's going to affect [borrowing] We can technically allow for that if your subsequent projections say no [it will not run high] But presumably you would want to allow for [an increase in borrowing] if the next preliminary figure is another $3 billion or so There's an element of judgment here You can wash it out completely if you think it's of no significance But in the path--  Well, we're saying interest rates What I am talking about is the federal funds rate I am not sure that the other rates aren't too high relative to the federal funds rate right at the moment So if it worked out that we didn't get an increase in the federal funds rate, the other rates might come down again We are talking now about expectations among other things What we are talking about operationally, just to repeat it, is that if we went halfway in between, that involves knocking three quarters of a percentage point off the growth objective for the period between now and the end of September And there's no assurance about that; we never come out that close We are not going to have a 3/4 percentage point difference in any measurable way What we will have is a somewhat higher level of borrowing and, therefore, a somewhat higher level of the federal funds rate however the aggregates finally come out So the bias--well, bias may not be the right word It sets up an increased probability of a somewhat higher federal funds rate, obviously, the more we reduce the aggregate numbers  Yes, as contrasted to alternative A  It's a question of which way the preference is I'll put them both to a vote for preferences Let me take the compromise first with an 8 percent floor in this case and an initial borrowing assumption, let's say, of $75 million We'll take all of the decisions on the easy side and go  Well, anything is consistent Who knows?  This is "A minus" or "B plus"  "A"  There may be a little argument about that I'd be willing to, but-- Let me put it this way, just so you have two choices in front of you One is 8 to 14 percent and $75 million not interpreted too closely--we're only talking about a $25 million difference here--with the numbers halfway between "A" and "B" That's one choice  It's the same, assuming the arithmetic translation is right It involves different numbers, but the numbers  -43-    8/12/80  are halfway between those in "A" and "B" That against "A" straight, let me say  That and $100 million of borrowing  No  Well, it looks a little funny The argument is Tony's here, in that he doesn't want to take too much risk of the funds rate going too much lower So the more we risk it on one side, the more he wants to block out the risk on the other side  My gut feeling is that [growth] is more likely to be up than down But that's a feeling  Let's take those two choices Do you understand them?  What can be better than these wonderful options? As a matter of pure preference, it's likely to be 50/50, but let me just try The first one is the halfway in between with the adjustments that I suggested  SPEAKER(?) Voting members only?  That leaves me with straight "A" I'd like a show of hands to see if everybody is voting That's five I didn't vote Who else didn't vote?  Well, that's what I was afraid of We have exactly [half who voted for each]  Well, in some sense that's more liberal than either What about that one? The trouble is we are going to get more intense feelings the other way, too It seems as if these two choices are going to maximize the vote, and I suspect there is a lot of indifference between them  I suspect everybody could live with either one  Yes, I guess it comes really down to my preference  Oh, I guess I'd go with the "B plus" or "A minus" one, whatever you want to call it  Well, in fact, we are expecting the funds rate to fall well within the [range]  The Secretary points out to me, and he's probably right in one sense, that if we go halfway in between, we will have fractions that we have never used before for quarterly growth rates  Maybe that is the way to do it Let me try to modify this again This comes a little closer to "A," I guess What would be in the directive is 6-1/2, 9, and 12 percent I think that does look a little better somehow  Yes, that's what would appear in the directive  Look, the staff projection of a consistent relationship has been off by 2 percentage points, I think  I don't say that in any way as criticism of the staff but only of the reality of the uncertainty inherent in these numbers and the idea that we could project down to the quarter percentage point That may be a better [formulation] anyway Why don't we vote on that 6-1/2, 9, and 12 percent in the directive  Yes  We can put $75 to $100 million in there If you want to say $75 million, that's fine with me Whatever you say When the staff makes that great judgment about how to handle the $3 billion bulge that appears next week, it will be more important than whether we have a borrowing assumption of $75 or $100 million, but I think we've given the staff a tone with which to approach this that they understand  Does everyone understand what we are voting on?  Governor Wallich will have a concurring statement September 16 is the date of the next meeting and we will discuss the future calendar at that meeting on the basis of some memorandum I will send you before then  END OF MEETING       I hope we can be relatively brief this morning, but I thought it might be a good idea to touch base I hope to be out next week and the beginning of the following week, and in fact we're going to have a paucity of Governors in Washington during part of that period But we have Mr Schultz eating lunch at the table in preparation for leaving this afternoon so that he will be here with full strength next week and able to take care of all problems  Apart from some prospective absences, we've obviously had some big changes in the money figures and I just wanted to run over the consequences of those changes for the targets and what the projections are I assume, as always, that our projections are both unbiased and not very reliable They don't necessarily show quite as frightening a picture as the most recent numbers suggest; the recent numbers are not very good Maybe Mr Ettin can go over where we stand--what we are publishing this afternoon, so far as we know at the moment--and what the outlook is as he sees it  Could you hear me all that easily?  We'll get Mr Ettin to a different station [and microphone]  SPEAKER(?) Put him here  Let me say just one other thing What    8/22/80  obviously partial and not very reliable data we have for the week of the 20th indicate a decline of $1 to $1-1/2 billion, so that September figure is not projecting anything startling other than some mild increase from a lower level that we would have reached at the end of August It's not out of the clear blue sky in that sense It doesn't require any heroic assumptions as to what happens in September; it just says September will increase a little from what we now think the latter part of August will be So what falls out of that is practically an unchanged September on a daily average basis Obviously these August figures look very big; if we could put any weight on the September figure--and obviously we can't put all that much weight on it--the two months together are not all that startlingly above what we were talking about I have those figures here someplace  Yes, that's right [For the third quarter] M-1B is a little less than 9-1/2 percent as against [the Committee's objective of about] 8 percent And M2 is practically what we said on these projections M2 has been running a little low relative to the other numbers--it was running high as you recall and we had some discussion of it--partly because growth in money market funds has turned negative now So we're very close on these projections to the M2 target for this quarter For M-1A and M-1B we're clearly above, but it's not by any means out of sight [even with] the August figure, if the September number is more or less right  What this implies for reserve targeting, as we discussed at the meeting, is that of course the borrowings go up The path has not been worked out in any detail; it is complicated by the fact that we had a substantial miss in the last week, which meant we had more nonborrowed reserves than we thought we had and less borrowings on the other side So there's a judgmental question on the path as to whether to let that bygone be a bygone or whether mechanically to make up for it in the rest of the period In any event whatever adjustment we make, we would expect the borrowings to go up and they really haven't gone up yet But the market has certainly been anticipating some tightening and it's a question of how much the markets are going to react to these figures today Peter may want to comment on that My sense of it is that the figures aren't going to make them happy, but I don't know I'm not sure they are so bad that it will provoke a big further adjustment Peter, do you have some comment on that?  I don't know whether Mr Kichline wants to report on any economic data we have had in the past week We had a consumer price index this morning, which you probably all know about  We, of course, had a bad producer price index That was since the meeting, wasn't it?  Having that big increase in producer prices didn't help the market, obviously Market participants may be looking at that more than the consumer prices because they can dismiss the consumer price number as a mortgage phenomenon But the consumer price index did not look too bad outside the mortgage area As I remember it was 06 outside--  Well, we have had a very substantial adjustment in the longer-term rate area and, of course, we've had an adjustment in the short-term rate area, too I don't have the figures in front of me, but my impression is that the adjustment in long-term rates is as big or bigger than the adjustment in short-term rates, which is somewhat of an abnormal experience We have essentially an unchanged economic situation from what we thought before  I would just say that I feel a little sensitive about the manner in which we conduct our open market operations [I'm talking] not in terms of anything we've done which needed to be done, but I think we should try to avoid resolving any doubts on the side of taking overt action in the market at a time when the market is already very sensitive--if we can get by with it consistent with the path Just as a matter of judging hourly operations or daily operations--but it's a tricky business--I wouldn't want to see any unnecessary messages sent to the market, consistent with the kind of path and the anticipation of higher borrowings that we have The discount rate, of course, is at 10 percent And with this level of borrowings one would expect--as with any significant level of borrowings, which we are certainly looking for--that the funds rate would normally trade above the discount rate I think that's the prospect we face based upon the information we know at the moment How much of that has been discounted in the market, I don't know I don't know whether anybody else has any comments they want to make at this point  Fred is just saying that we did, after a relatively short debate and purely because of the potential confusion involved, accept the proposals we had from several Reserve Banks to    8/22/80  conform this ineligible paper discount rate to the regular discount rate on September 1st The announcement will present this as an action taken to bring those rates in conformity in the light of the authority and the basic intention implied by the Monetary Control Act In Mr Coyne's professional judgment, it will get no attention in the press We will see  By "overshoot" you mean the error in the nonborrowed reserve figure, I assume?  That probably falls into an area of some discretion It amounts to something like $70 million when averaged over the remaining weeks, so we're not talking about a huge number But I would be inclined not to be very eager to make up for that overshoot depending upon whether we overtly had to take it out or not That would be my judgment In other words, if it made the difference between going into the market overtly, particularly in an atmosphere where the market is already weak, I would swallow it If the market makes it up itself without us--because that's the way the operating factors are going--then it would be okay That judgment has to be made almost from day to day, but that's the way I would look at it, Larry  Where did the reserves come from to support the money supply increase? They didn't come from anywhere That's the trouble We have a lagged reserve accounting system and no reserves are needed to support it in the first instance So what we're basically talking about is how many of those reserves have to come out of borrowing now that it's effective in the market, I guess this week We're saying that those reserves basically have to come out of borrowing That is the normal path assumption That those additional reserves will come out of borrowing Now, what will happen to excess reserves and whether we will get another error or whatever [is another question], but the normal [assumption in terms] of the path is that those reserves come out of borrowing The reason the reserve miss was in the most recent week, not the week when the money supply went [up]--was that the week before that they had to put up the reserves for the money supply increase Well, I don't know, I get mixed up regarding the particular weeks, but the reserve miss was not in the week that the money supply increased And it was due to float on the last day  We would expect it to be up, based upon what we know now  What is the rate now, 10-1/4 percent?  I suppose it could go up in the neighborhood of a percentage point under normal relationships  Yes As you know, these are not very close relationships, but that's the average implication I guess All I am saying is that it's one thing if that [increase] seems to be happening kind of normally I don't particularly want to give the market the idea that we have a higher funds rate target That's the point  I'm not responding to your direct question, Larry, but let me ask a different question, which is somewhat related It is very troublesome to me, and I am sure to other people, that the money supply can jump up by $9 or $10 billion in a week the way it [apparently has recently] That is a monthly increase in the money supply that's half the normal increase for a whole year And nobody knows why I have gotten no enlightenment on it either Well, we think some of it may have been due to social security payments, but the staff presumably tried to adjust for that in the seasonal So even there, [though] we know the social security payment has an impact on the money supply it is not clear that that wasn't adjusted out  We haven't had much guidance here I haven't heard any reasons from the experts in New York and I haven't heard any plausible explanations from the market Here we have, as I say, a money supply increase in a week that's equal to roughly half of the normal increase for a year, and nobody in the world seems to have even much of a speculation as to what is going on, what caused it, and whether it's [temporary] Well, we have some sense that it is temporary; we naturally think it tends to be temporary simply because it's so big And the most recent data somewhat confirm that, at least in a partial sense All I am saying is that if anybody has any acute insights as to what has been going on in the last few weeks, I would be very interested in hearing them  We have only two chairs from which anybody out there can hear anything, apparently  Yes Let me go over those numbers, Lyle, because I meant to do it and I forgot I described it I said that if the September forecast is right, with all its uncertainty, [money supply growth] is not widely out [of line] with what we were talking about at the Committee meeting But if we look at it on an annual basis in terms of the targets--if we take the August number that we now have, which should be becoming a reasonably good number, and if we put any weight on the preliminary numbers we have for the next week-- we're hovering around the lower end of the range on M-1A On M-1B we're clearly above the middle; if the September figure came out [as projected], growth would probably get back to slightly below the midpoint I indicated that M2 was a little weaker relative to M-1A and M-1B but M2 continues to be slightly above the upper end of its range But that's about where we had it at the time of the Committee meeting  So if we look at all those numbers in terms of the annual [objectives], while the rate of increase is obviously very steep in recent months, going into September and even more so going out of September it leaves us with numbers that look quite like what we were talking about at the meeting--with M-1A low, M2 high, M-1B in between And M3, though I don't have those numbers, I think is still very much in the middle of the range Now that final sentence depended upon September in fact not showing much change; but even the August figures are not wildly out of line at all What is out of line obviously is the angle of inclination for July and August  Just in reference to this August figure--and Lyle put it in the perspective of the quarter more or less--that is still somewhat disturbing to me While one can begin making somewhat plausible explanations of why the quarter as a whole should act this way-- [attributing] it to a make-up, which is a bit reassuring in a sense--I still have some nagging questions about the whole technique in terms of how in the world the money supply can go up by $10 billion in one    8/22/80  week Again, that is not very far from half the annual growth pattern and it bothers me, particularly since it didn't all come [out] the following week  Mr Ettin is looking up the number  We don't have any of those base figures here? Does anybody here have them? It's a figure that's on the usual table that I see on a Monday but apparently it's not here on a Friday We don't have it right here but if you want to wait for a minute, the staff will extract the table The last time I looked--but it didn't reflect the latest week's figures--nothing extraordinary seemed to be going on [in the base] That figure, of course, is very heavily weighted by currency Do you have the currency component?  But it didn't do anything in that week or in the subsequent week, did it?  I am sure the base didn't increase much in that week, simply because currency didn't go up very much What was it the following week?  Well, I am just trying to judge whether the base went up, which is the figure we haven't got It probably didn't go up all that much if currency was acting that way We're trying to get that figure on the telephone at the moment  Nobody has a solution to my money supply riddle?    8/22/80  Even speculation is welcome at this point!  Nobody else cares to speculate? I keep wondering I accept that there may be some underlying explanation in terms of the quarter Still, it's very curious to me how we get an increase like this in a week  No And Ed or Darwin Beck can probably speak more fully on this, but I have been told on a number of occasions that the increase is very widely spread  No  Mr Ettin has the monetary base numbers  That's a pretty big increase on the 20th, isn't it?  No, there isn't much relation between those figures on a weekly basis and the deposit figures I don't know It just is very [odd] I guess we have to accept that we have no explanation except fitting it into a broader context  Well, as I say, the staff tried to adjust that out, though they readily concede that adjusting it out is not an    8/22/80  exact science But the total impact theoretically can't be more than 4 [billion dollars] And they did make an adjustment, so presumably it can't really be 4  Well, I think that may explain some of the discrepancy between M-1A and M-1B that we've been seeing for some weeks But that can't explain the increase in both of them on the 8th Just the fact that it comes right at the beginning of the month --and of course we've had this phenomenon before, though less big in size--makes one suspicious that there's something about the monthly patterns here that somehow affects these numbers But I can't imagine what it would be Well, there's no point in belaboring the issue I'll just express my mystification about it It's a somewhat disturbing phenomenon just from the standpoint of our inability to explain it, apart from being disturbing in terms of our objectives, the impact on the market psychology, and all the rest But if nobody else has any comment, I guess we can draw this to a conclusion I think the main message is that while this is very troublesome, it doesn't look quite as bad when put in a fuller perspective as it may look to us and to the market on first blush  And this all is based on a presumption for which we have some [evidence] It's more than shooting in the dark to say that August is on a downward trend after the big jump up But I don't think we can say much more than that And if that is borne out in September, we will be quite on track  If it isn't, we've got big problems  Okay  Thank you  END OF SESSION     We can come to order and approve the minutes if somebody will make a motion to approve Without objection we will approve the minutes Mr Pardee  Any questions or discussion? We have to ratify the transactions  Without objection they are ratified Do you have any recommendations, Mr Pardee?  I assume that if we have to renew these, we will do that without any objection I don't think it takes any formal action I might say that Mr Pardee raised with me the question of whether we want to change the terms on the swap agreements We can consider that perhaps next month; I'll talk to the Treasury first The Committee discussed making the terms more symmetrical a year ago or two years ago--well, maybe both--  Most of the swap agreements now say that when we are in debt, we share the loss or share the gain with the other central bank; when they are in debt, they take all the risk So it's an asymmetrical arrangement and the Germans have raised the issue in the past They didn't raise it again this year, did they?  They probably will raise it again They have raised it in the past and we have had some discussion of it The arrangement looks peculiar the way it is [structured] now Whether we gain or lose on the operation depends not only on the gain or loss but on the interest rate differential, because the other side of the bargain would be to shift to the foreign rate rather than [use] our rate on the interest rate dimension on the swap We, this Committee, if I am accurate, arrived at a consensus either two years ago or one year ago or both that it would be a good idea to change this and [make it] more symmetrical The Treasury agreed in principle but didn't want to raise the issue at that time for a variety of reasons I forget just what the reasons were    9/16/80  To put it mildly  Well, I don't know that for a fact; I haven't talked with them And I don't mean to debate the issue today I just want to warn you that it will probably come up [at our meeting] next month and we will provide a little more explanation and have some materials for the Committee A logical time to bring it up is probably next month as we get ready for the [annual] renewal [of the swap agreements] in December Mr Sternlight  Questions or comments?  Peter, based upon nothing more than reading the newspaper, I have the sense that the market is a little less hypersensitive to our daily operations than they were two months ago Is that true or not true?  I think The New York Times has a different guy writing the articles now, don't they?  That fellow seems to have gone out of his way a couple of times to say that these operations are just to provide reserves or to withdraw reserves and they have no implication for interest rates  It wasn't quite clear to me whom he was quoting I thought maybe he was quoting Peter or you; I'm not saying that was so but I think--  Any other comments?  Governor Wallich  We don't have that pseudo-precision  The Desk can't [adjust] in the short run It's fixed In a sense they could do it over time if people are borrowing more, as they may be now They seem to be borrowing more than we would expect, given the differential from the discount rate But in any particular week it is fixed  We have to supply the reserves  We can force [the depository institutions] to borrow more in a given week, but we can't force the level of reserves lower  All this affects the funds rate, but I don't think one can say that doing what we did, which was a compromise in that one week, was aimed to affect the funds rate You could argue that if we were pulling back the nonborrowed reserves, that would [imply] a funds rate objective--that we were forcing a higher funds rate  We have been in one of these periods, which seem to be recurrent or almost perpetual, [where the incoming data on the aggregates seem to move] in one direction or another It's not always in the same direction But all of the actual preliminary figures and the estimates keep showing lower money supply figures than eventually materializes We have had runs either of this    9/16/80  sort or precisely the reverse before But it doesn't seem to be random It does--  That may be, but I [don't] see why that would affect the actual estimates that are made Why these preliminary numbers run low or high when they are supposed to be a kind of random sample is beyond me But it seems to happen for weeks in a row  I don't understand those numbers, frankly Just stop for a second That second quarter has a misprint in it?  It should be minus 2-1/2 percent in both of those columns  Well, I think that's quite true But the question is whether we have control in the short run, and I'm afraid this recent pattern that you point to shows that we don't Most of this increase in the third quarter came in one week!  Well, we got criticized by the bankers when they were here the other day for having too much volatility in the money supply growth and too much volatility in interest rates I told them they could criticize us for one or the other but not both at the same time  I don't know what mechanism gets rid of the volatility in the one without increasing [the volatility in] the other  I think that's always a fair question  These are all matters that we have to look at as time passes I don't particularly like what has been happening in the sense that we have put all this money in the money supply and have had these quarterly fluctuations which don't seem to be particularly controllable What is the significance of that? The most optimistic view is that these quarterly movements are not very significant We had a decline in the second quarter and we have [now] made up for it We will see what happens in the fourth quarter, but the jury is still out We may have had a short-run bounceback here  Mr Winn  Well, we have been considering how best to do that I have a public appearance tomorrow; I may or may not take the opportunity to do that But it is a matter that continues to concern me and we will find an opportunity Mr Black  Well, we probably ought to find some time to discuss this at greater length But following up on Mr Solomon's comment, there is a danger [in making adjustments too promptly] Let's take March, when the aggregates were running a little high We were pretty tough then, but suppose we had followed this procedure and had made even sharper adjustments to the aggregates when they were running high in March What would have happened in April? We in fact had a 16 percent [rate of] decline; one just doesn't know looking ahead The problem is that this process apparently runs, like everything else in economics, with some lagged effect And it's those lags that give us 90 percent of the problem  It's a question of what is important Now, we can't answer these questions this morning, but I have begun to hear a lot of comments from people who say the volatility of interest rates in and of itself is a bad thing  I'm not just talking about market people I've had a complaint from automobile companies that their dealers will not hold inventory because, while they perhaps can afford present interest rates, they're not going to get stuck with a big inventory of cars [with] the risk that the interest rate will go up to 20 percent on them and they can't get rid of the inventory It's that kind of problem, which I don't think is irrelevant I hear the same thing from the homebuilding industry I don't know how justified that [complaint] is, but--  I don't know  It's hard to say The housing people, of course, argue the same thing That they'd go ahead at current interest rates, but they are afraid of getting caught in an upswing [in rates] before the house gets completed So, I don't know whether it's good or bad But there are a lot of problems here that are--  Well, there is a range of issues to which we will be returning continually and maybe in a more orderly fashion than this morning Mr Kichline  In view of the questions about the present economic situation and the discussion of a turning point and all the rest, let's just pause here for questions and comments on the business situation And if anybody wants to volunteer attitudes toward tax reduction, I would be interested in hearing them Mr Black  When do the leading indicators come out?  Not very soon  Aren't hours worked going to be down in this coming quarter?  Three percent down But you have a GNP estimate down 3 percent, roughly I just--  Mr Mayo  There's a Civil Service increase in here?  Mr Corrigan  Governor Wallich  Mr Baughman  I don't know whether I should regionally adjust that comment; I interpret it as quite bearish  SPEAKER(?) Yes  There must be some correlation between our ability to sustain office building and not do much factory building and the productivity figures  Mr Ford  Effective January 1st?  Mr Gramley  It's M-1A unadjusted? You just take M-1A at its raw value?  You know the great faith I have in these equations in general, Mr Kichline But given that great faith, the naive question that [occurs] to me is Why do we keep talking about this equation that had [an end point] of '74? Why don't we refit it through '79 or something?  But when you read off those numbers it sounded as if this demand shift that Governor Gramley talks about would basically disappear if you had used the last five years in fitting the equation It would be in the equation  I was thinking about just fitting it for the post-1974 period The average shift was what, 3 percent or something, in those numbers you read?  -20-    9/16/80  Mr Balles  Mr Solomon  I don't know that I meant there to be any difference, really Both times I conceded that they could go ahead now if they wanted, if they didn't put the expenditures up any higher than they are now projecting on the investment side I don't think that's possible or practical I don't think they're going to go along with just the investment side alone, but there's room [for that] I am not ready to say that there's room for anything beyond that unless the expenditure trend looks better than I so elegantly expressed it in my last appearance And I don't know what that [will be] The Administration's pro forma projection for '82--with pro forma meaning just where current services will carry it--is for roughly an 11-1/2 percent increase in budget expenditures in fiscal '82, which is when their tax proposal would have its full effect That might leave us  -22-    9/16/80  with a balanced budget if the expenditures were no higher than that trend, if I recall these numbers correctly, at around the 6 percent unemployment rate The full employment budget would still be in surplus, but the full employment budget assumes a lower unemployment rate than that by a substantial margin Now, is that adequate? I don't know I think it's borderline That is where I come out  We are going to have a little difficulty with time here, if we don't move along We have talk of a double-dip recession and we have a double-dip request to talk from Mr Corrigan  Mr Black And I urge succinct comments by all  Governor Schultz  Mr Guffey Welcome back  Mr Roos I assume you are going to have a statement of faith  Does that conclude comments on this general subject? Mr Winn  We are being squeezed for time, I keep saying Governor Partee  Governor Rice  Governor Teeters  As a percent of GNP or something?  Mr Axilrod, why don't you introduce the next subject and then we will [break for coffee]  If we can come to order, let's see whether we can resolve our business after our lengthy discussion, which has perhaps had some discouraging tinges to it I was struck in listening that it is quite conceivable, given what one senses is going on right at the moment, that when some of these August-September figures come out they will look a little better [than expected] I don't think that has any great significance In terms of the sluggish outlook-- nobody mentioned this so I will just mention it--apart from all the other conclusions which were quite general about having to have a fairly sluggish recovery by historical standards because of the inflationary problem and longer-term needs of the economy, I think statistically when we don't have productivity growing we don't have the room for the same kind of recovery that we traditionally have had If we have a recession, the economy can grow by 4 or 5 percent, even 6 percent, for a few quarters It doesn't bring us as far up the employment curve as it does when we don't have any productivity growth And for that reason alone one wouldn't look for the same kind of numbers, sustained very long, that we typically have had in earlier recoveries But we have problems I did not detect from the earlier comments that anybody thinks he or she has any totally satisfactory solutions, if I may put it that way But this Committee does have to proceed on [making] some decisions, and presumably in the framework of our established operating procedures  At this point, you have two [Bluebook] alternatives before you That does not exhaust all the possibilities, obviously I may be wrong, but ordinarily the alternatives we have before us haven't had a gap [between them] that is quite this wide, for M-1A anyway The reason may be that [the intermeeting period] is a little longer [than usual] It is probably realistic to have it that wide to make the decision meaningful since the reality does not obey the very narrow differences that we typically are presented with I would draw your attention to these charts, which I'm sure you have already looked at, that look backwards from the fourth quarter [to] early next year if we do follow one or the other of these paths They show how [the results] would look against the targets that we have set and reset for ourselves I was a little surprised when I saw these I just hadn't quite caught up with the fact that M3 apparently was stronger in August than I had thought earlier So while I had thought we were rather comfortably in the middle of the M3 range, M3 is within the boundaries but is relatively high [in its range] And that is one problem, [that we are] testing the high side of our ranges in all three measures except M-1A That's the situation in which we find ourselves Would anyone want to take off from Steve's comments or otherwise suggest a course?  Sure  -29-    9/16/80  Let me say that we are in a [difficult] position, and maybe we will always be in this position--certainly we were when we met last month and we carefully set the level of borrowings, which is a critical factor and one we have to consider today But [last month] within two days or something like that the money supply exploded in a way that made that a nominal assumption-- I'll call it nominal--because it was clear that the money supply in the space of two days was way above the path we were talking about and the real decision we made on borrowing quickly became nominal Obviously, I don't know what is going to happen this time The assumption is--or as Steve said, "indications are" that money growth in September is going to be weak "Indications" sounds to me like a pretty strong word I don't know what indication he has other than a preliminary figure for next week, and these preliminary figures have been notoriously unreliable But the figure that he is assuming is a decline of $1-1/2 billion in M-1A  All I am noting is that if that did not materialize, whatever we talk about here in terms of the borrowing assumption can change rather quickly Nonetheless, I think it is significant to focus on that variable It's a little difficult just in a technical sense in that I think it is fair to say that the federal funds rate that seems to be associated with current borrowing levels is less than one might have expected So in that sense there  -30-    9/16/80  seems to a little less restraint with a given level of borrowings than we were assuming last time we were in a borrowing phase, six months ago or whenever  Well, the staff is estimating it this week at around $11 billion or so  Yes, actually, it has been well above that It has been averaging $14 billion or something like that  And the federal funds rate has been about 10-3/4 percent  And that is not the relationship that we ordinarily would have thought--  Well, it may just be that; we don't know  It may be that or it may just be a gradual change in attitude Under the new operating technique they haven't been chastised all that much when they are in as they were before I don't know It may be that with the passage of time, when they have been in a little more, that the relationship will tighten up a bit Maybe it's a more fundamental easing; I just don't know  I don't know whether anybody has a sense of what may be going on in that area, but it's a rather significant variable in terms of the way we now operate Maybe we ought to consider whether-- Well, is it a fair assumption to say that if you haven't been talking to the banks in New York, that probably means nobody has been saying anything to any of the banks? Now, this has only been going on for a month or so or less, so you haven't had much chance to get after repetitive borrowers, I'm sure  The question is What is the normal level? I wouldn't think anything more than normal [is appropriate], but I--  I think we should watch this for a while longer and see--I'm not suggesting any new departure here--whether attitudes either in the Reserve Banks or in the banking world have suddenly changed But then, it's very hard to know  That was true for one week It happened in some week in August, I think  Well, with that additional element, it's an inevitable uncertainty I suppose Mr Balles  Recent revisions all have been upward, but at some point that pattern will change So, who knows?  Mr Ford  Mr Mayo  They're not operating in a very fast league either  Do you have an opinion, Mr Mayo, that you are going to give us as to why you have a [unintelligible]  Mr Eastburn  Just translating your comments You're prepared to see a big increase in interest rates right now?  Mr Morris  I don't know whether it's because different people are talking, but the business outlook suddenly sounds more ebullient than the impression I was left with earlier Mr Winn  Governor Wallich  Governor Partee  Just give me those numbers again  Governor Teeters  Governor Gramley  Mr Guffey  Mr Balles  Mr Roos  Mr Baughman  Did Governor Gramley say that?  I think he had rather the opposite in mind  Governor Schultz  Governor Rice  End of statement?  Mr Solomon  What was that last one?  That's everybody, isn't it? I confess I am a little struck by what seems to me a contrast in some of the policy judgments, or aggregates judgments, and what I took to be the tone of the earlier discussion, which was highly restrained in terms of a forecast of ebullience in the business world and somewhat skeptical of full faith in short-term movements in the aggregates I approach this with a feeling of some concern about [how we will] come out of this meeting right at this stage We've had a very high August, to be sure We've had several months that were very high, but August was particularly high There is some hope that September will show a leveling and a possible turn in the business situation I think it's probably [going to be] a real turn, if a real turn encompasses the idea of a W, with a rather weak middle of the W  I was somewhat concerned that we would come out and say, in effect, that we're throwing down the gauntlet and that we would make damn sure that we would meet our targets in a very acceptable way and take all the risks on the side of interest rates and the economy I think that's a real implication of "B" I don't think we can in honesty adopt "B" without saying Okay, beginning tomorrow or whenever we will go out and in effect force interest rates up And I would have great reservations about that kind of approach On the other hand, I don't feel quite comfortable with "A," given the way those charts look, particularly the M-1B chart, which a number of other people have mentioned I think Governor Partee's comments are correct We look at these as targets--and God knows what's going to happen--but we haven't got the short-term control mechanism that guarantees we're going to meet the targets That much has been demonstrated by recent experience But we do bias the [decision in an effort to meet the targets] I would pick up in Governor Partee's comment, which has been seconded by the comments of a number of others, that the best thing we can do is to aim someplace in between "A" and "B" I think that's consistent with not taking much of an overt step at the moment We'll see how the money supply figures develop That may be as early as when we get a revision in the preliminary [M-1A] figure But certainly we keep getting surprised by these [numbers] in one direction or another as time passes I don't know what projection is right But if the number comes out high, I think any of these alternatives imply that [market conditions] could get tighter and borrowing would go up If it comes out as favorably as New York suggests, I suppose it would go the other way If it comes out as favorably as New York suggests, it probably means a weaker business picture than many people have in mind and we might get a rally in the markets In those circumstances, with that kind of aggregates picture, I'm not sure that would be undesirable  So, consistent with what a number of people have said, but certainly not everybody, I would play it neutrally at the moment That's what we did last time It lasted for about two days until the money supply figure came out high [unintelligible] I hope another $9  -41-    9/16/80  billion increase doesn't come along and throw us off course quite so quickly as last time But [ongoing developments] are what we would be guided by to a considerable extent I don't know what neutrality means precisely, given this borrowing discussion we just had I believe you've assumed $800 million with alternative B, Steve, and that seems to me low if we really wanted to get to alternative B  Well, at the moment, we assume the present discount rate That doesn't say the discount rate wouldn't go up if the funds rate moved significantly higher Presumably, we would maintain some relationship [between them] I'm not saying the present relationship is all that bad--I don't think it is all that bad--but if [the spread] got substantially wider, the discount rate question would certainly arise As I say, I don't quite know what neutrality is I think a figure as high as $800 million or perhaps $700 to $800 million or someplace in that area might be consistent with neutrality in the short run In that way I am picking up something Steve associated more with "B" than with "A" But in terms of the targets, this implies amid all the uncertainty a change in trend, and if there's anything to the longer range interest rate forecast, I'm not sure we want to go quite that far By the longer range interest rate forecast I'm talking about the quarter That's not a very long range, but it's beyond the next two weeks I don't know what it really does imply; we have these different estimates  Well, I'm obviously affected by the most recent evidence, which may be false evidence But it sounds to me as though right at the moment anyway a little higher level of borrowing--  Well, there's some evidence for it I don't think it's just a phenomenon this week What are those borrowing figures in the recent week? You just had them  It was over $1 billion in the week of September 3 and I don't remember what the funds rate was then  My impression is that, more often than not, these borrowing figures have been higher than what we normally associate with the equivalent federal funds rate  -42-    9/16/80  But obviously there's an area of uncertainty  [We wouldn't adjust the path] quite so quickly anyway  Well, we obviously have some difference of opinion and I am proposing that we come out someplace in between These numbers do not lend themselves to easy averaging without coming up with rather small fractions And when we get down to the last quarter, I think it becomes fairly irrelevant We have heard two averaging proposals Mr Solomon was a 1/4 percentage point higher than Mr Partee on two of the numbers Have we ever used a number with 1/4 for a period this long?  I think we're all talking about the August-December figures  I assume we're all talking about the same [period as in the Bluebook alternatives], which is August to December  I'm not sure what the significance of that is  We set the annual targets that way, but--  I'll let Mr Axilrod comment But it seems to me a lot more convenient operationally to talk about a monthly target than a quarterly target that is so much affected by what has already happened  Obviously, one can express it either way  And we're stuck, unless we make an extreme assumption, with the fact that the quarterly jump is going to be fairly sizable because August went way up Even if growth is level from now on, we'd get an increase of some magnitude in the fourth quarter That's a fact of life But if we were concentrating solely on quarterly figures--while mechanically we can rationalize one with the other--I think we'd tend to get more abrupt changes than we really contemplated in setting the target  Well, if we took these--if I may so term them--more hawkish views and if we were honest with ourselves given the range of probabilities, we would be saying that we've got to go out this week and take a rather overt step to tighten up the market That may not be necessary, for sure That's what we don't know Now, [doing] that may turn out to be wrong if the economy is very weak, and we might have to retrace the step And that's one of the things that I think we would be better advised to avoid  I may just be talking about a gut feeling, but I tend to share the view that Steve first expressed That if there's a risk here, it's going to be on the high side rather than the low side I'm just going by recent experience; that's the way it has been That could well be wrong I have no problem with starting out with $700 million or something in that range But I do have a feeling that starting out in that range and putting a lot of weight on [growth rates] as low as those in "B" may delay for two weeks what you're talking about I think the odds are that at some point we're going to have to put [interest rates] up quite overtly and strongly We may have to do that even if we went with "A" If we went to an "A+" we might have to do it I can't guarantee [anything] All I'm saying is that we have a stronger case if [growth in the aggregates] did get high Obviously the higher the monetary numbers are, the more  -45-    9/16/80  protection one has in a sense--the more explanation one has for why the market is reacting the way it has and why we have reacted the way we have under those circumstances I don't think we have much [protection] if we're demanding that September be practically flat, which is what the staff is projecting And I hope that's what it is But we're also demanding that October and November be [almost] though not quite as flat Obviously there's an arithmetic difference between these, and the way one falls in the spectrum is what we're talking about But I would want a little more justification, in terms of the aggregates, for the kind of interest rates some of you are talking about before I saw those interest rates in the market We are talking about an M-1B that I quite agree is a little higher than I'd like to see ideally Just rationalizing, M-1A doesn't look so bad under these alternatives M2 we think is going to be a little high There's not much we can do about it M3 is a little higher than I'd like to see it But just weighing the risks, and against the background of the business [conditions] discussion that we had, I would like to have a little more evidence that the aggregates are fully running in excess of reasonable targets before very overt moves are forced That's what it comes down to Mr Corrigan, did you comment? You didn't  I thought I counted and we had everybody  Did I miss anybody else?  I'm sorry I deprived all our double- dippers I added up wrong There are more people here than I thought  Mr Black  I think that's right, but you're playing with arithmetic in a sense The question is what we want to do in a substantive sense  My comment about neutrality relates to how we come out of this meeting right now, not for the next month I don't think we can ignore what is happening to the money supply for the next month As I said, we take a chance whatever target we set If next week's figure comes out to something like a reduction of $1- 1/2 billion it doesn't apply to anything we have said here But if it comes out significantly different from that, we're already beginning to diverge under any of these targets I guess one can argue it any way My particular problem is that I think ["B"] is a bit unrealistic --that may not be a good word because anything can happen, including the New York projections, in which case it wouldn't be at all unrealistic--taking the broad range of probabilities We probably wouldn't be neutral coming out of this meeting with alternative B  I talked abut neutrality with a very particular meaning What is the level of borrowings that we start off this track on, recognizing that it will change if within the week these figures begin deviating substantially from whatever target we set  We would be allowing the borrowings to respond, that's right I don't know any way of running this technique without having a-- Well, let me put the question to you Do we have a conclusion for somewhere between "A" and "B"? I will leave for later exactly how to compromise those numbers Does a borrowing level of $750 million, just to take the midpoint of some that have been mentioned, and something in between "A" and "B" attract a spectrum of support?  I guess so  Between "A" and "B"  -48-    9/16/80  I would like an expression of general opinion on a mid-course between "A" and "B"  The voting members I said someplace between $700 and $800 million I don't feel I can judge that with any accuracy I'm not so sure that $800 million couldn't turn out ex post to imply a little easing  You referred to this borrowing level before, Steve Do you just want to repeat what you said?  There's a little confusion, I think, because Steve, if I understand it correctly, has changed his mind from the time that the Bluebook was written, given the extra week's experience of relatively heavy borrowing with relatively less pressure on the money market than would have been expected  So I'm taking that into account in my own comments Let me put the issue to you again in a general way We'd have to focus on the borrowing level a bit more precisely and we'd have to resolve the fractions even if this proposal for roughly halfway between "A" and "B" commanded enough general support But the borrowing level is biased a bit higher than the Bluebook says is consistent with those alternatives, based upon the comments that were just made  -50-    9/16/80  I guess "can live with"  I think it's pretty clear, without going through any other exercise, that we're not going to get a larger feeling for any other number Let me just bear in a little more closely Halfway between is literally 4-1/4, 6-5/8, and 8-3/4 percent on the aggregates, right? The main difficulty with that, as I see it, is the 5/8ths It looks like a half-size, as they say  SPEAKER(?) You're an awfully small person!  If we literally wanted to avoid quarters-- it would lean a bit toward "B"--I'd take Governor Partee's numbers of 4, 6-1/2, and 8-1/2 percent Let me say a word about the funds rate range We're right in the middle of [the current range] As Tony Solomon and some others said, why fiddle around with it at this point?  SPEAKER(?) Right  I'm inclined to say 4, 6-1/2, and 8-1/2 percent and $750 million But I have no strong argument against the alternative, which I suppose is 4-1/4, 6-1/2, and 8-3/4 percent That just puts in quarters  That's obviously closer to B And with a $750 borrowing assumption--  In the best of all possible worlds, I could be lowering these targets just for the sake of imagery But let us not forget that M-1B is obviously specified too low and we chose not to change it at midyear But some of that discrepancy between M-1B and M-1A is coming out of savings deposits We don't know how much, but it is I think we can say unambiguously that it's too low relative to what we thought we were setting at the beginning of the year Well, we have a proposal of 4, 6-1/2, and 8-1/2 percent, with $750 million on borrowing and keeping 8 to 14 percent on the funds range  Let me just raise one further point It's the point that Mr Solomon raised earlier, which is a point I don't think we can quantify But we have operated before when we were either high or low in a way that implied some tolerance for shortfalls or overshoots When we were high we said "or somewhat below,"  -52-    9/16/80  implying more tolerance for shortfalls During the summer, in fact for two months--maybe we shouldn't have but we did--we said if [monetary growth] comes in high, we will be tolerant of an overshoot I could well see adding a tolerance of an undershoot to some degree here I don't know that we can specify that arithmetically But what we would be saying is that if the numbers come in unexpectedly low-- that would mean total reserves were coming in low--we would be slower about making any adjustment that might otherwise be made in raising the nonborrowed reserve path to make up for the shortfall That's just the opposite of what was done--  No, we haven't got a lot of room We have more room for undershoots in a purely target sense than for overshoots  But that's when [we did this]; it was following that very low month that we adopted the opposite [approach]  We were below the ranges  M-1B would be right at the top of the range [for this year], I think  I thought you liked those  We can always consult, so let's not make that part of the proposal I, frankly, would be delighted if the money supply comes in so weak that it provokes a consultation as to what to do about it We'll cross that bridge when and if we come to it  I have no great objection to raising the lower limit on the funds rate if that's what the Committee wants to do It's not accomplishing anything; I'm persuaded by the point that Tony made earlier But if that's really important to somebody and it convinces them to join in this consensus then--  No, I don't think it's very substantive whether we--  For that reason, I'm not disturbed by raising [the lower limit of the funds range] to 9 percent either It's purely a cosmetic question  I think it's virtually inconsequential except that somebody is going to read the policy record a month from now and see that we raised the lower end of the band by 1 percentage point and will wonder what that means, if anything I'm back to 4, 6-1/2, and 8-1/2 percent, 8 to 14 percent with a feeling of virtual indifference on my part about that, and $750 million Are we ready to vote?  I guess you're uncomfortable about the borrowing All I'm doing is accepting--because I tend to agree with it--that the borrowing specifications in the Bluebook are a little low based upon what we know now So I'm just adjusting for that  Ready  I suppose we ought to eat, and we're going to eat right here Oh, one quick thing We need somebody to be second in command after Governor Schultz to act on freedom of information requests Governor Coldwell used to do this and we've had no alternate since Governor Coldwell left We have to repair that oversight It has not proved to be a heavy responsibility Governor Partee, who serves in that function for the Board of Governors, has agreed to serve in that function for the Open Market Committee, if the Committee so agrees Do I have a motion?  SPEAKER(?) So moved  SPEAKER(?) Seconded  Without active dissent, Governor Partee will be the alternate  But that doesn't get to Governor Partee Do you have a question, Peter?  Well, we don't want to overlook that Without objection they are approved   Without objection Mr Pardee  Questions?  Diversification?  Not fully Governor Rice  I saw something in the paper yesterday or the day before that the head of the German Federation of Business or something said they ought to devalue That's the first time I've seen anything like that, I think  Mr Balles  Governor Wallich  Well, we in the government are no way near being in this position The Treasury is $2 billion in debt, as Scott said And they would like to cover their debt so there's $2 billion to go They have a few problems in terms of the rate of speed with which they accumulate balances, because of cash problems, which raises a question of whether we can put some element of flexibility in here  I disagree with you on the value of letting [the dollar] go up earlier It may be that the reason why the dollar didn't go down further was that the market had seen that they lost some money when it was going the other way That doesn't mean that we've got to do it that way again But I don't think one can say that that was meaningless You can argue about whether it's disconcerting to have it go up--  Well, that's a different question I don't know how much influence we have on the rate anyway  That doesn't pin it down very much!  Well, let's take this up in a little more orderly way We have to ratify the transactions since the meeting on September 16 Do I have a motion?  SPEAKER(?) So moved  SPEAKER(?) Second  Without objection, we shall approve them You have no recommendation with respect to the swap lines, I take it, because we're out and the French [drawing] is not maturing  We have this question of changes in the terms of the swap agreements on which we have a memorandum Just by way of background, the Committee agreed to this in principle I don't think it requires a formal action In 1978 there was no formal action, was there?  It was, in effect, an authorization for negotiation You have a memorandum describing this again It basically comes to the conclusion that we probably would have been better off financially [if the proposed changes had been in effect] in the past Nobody can promise that [will be true] in the future, certainly not on any individual operations We have had some further discussions with the Treasury The situation the last time [we considered this question] was that the Treasury had agreed in principle, too, but didn't want to do it at that particular time when we were becoming very active again [in foreign exchange markets] and there was a question of raising an issue which may have been a    10/21/80  complicating factor at that point The Treasury is agreeable to changing They have at least one swap that should be parallel in the Exchange Stabilization Fund, and they would consult with Congress about that And they are prepared to do so if we agree in principle I don't think we have to take any formal action now other than understand that this [change in swap line terms] is going forward if we want it to Then we would formally agree, I take it, when the swaps come before us in a renegotiated form Is that correct?  There's no question that you have to have the authority to negotiate I just don't know how formal the action has to be I don't think we should go ahead unless we're going to approve this when it comes before us That's what I want to find out  Well, I think you may be saying the same thing I did in different words I don't want to be very specific  I don't know whether the Congress is going to approve and I don't know that I want a formal vote at this point But I certainly want the opinion of the Committee as to whether they're going to approve this [proposal] formally next month, if that's when it comes up, if this is renegotiated Is that thought to be a good idea?  That's what I am asking  Well, I don't know about that Somebody will--    10/21/80  No  Theoretically  Theoretically  Well, there are various considerations Theoretically we ought to be a little better off That theory is not going to be borne out in practice all the time But there are these other considerations in that [the proposed terms] look more symmetrical--in fact are more symmetrical--and the foreign countries want us to do it that way I take it in the case of sterling that they've always refused to do it the other way anyway In that particular instance, we just haven't done any [swaps] with sterling We don't anticipate any, but it could happen And it could happen that sometimes we will do it when we get stuck on the interest rate When this interest rate was originally negotiated in the early '60s I'm sure that the US presumption was that US interest rates would always be lower than the foreign rates But that was a somewhat different world It hasn't been borne out in recent years, anyway But it could happen again  We can't forecast that The experience shows that the theory has been more or less borne out recently But I'm not going to stake my life on that in the future There are going to be instances where it doesn't work out, I'm sure, as there were in the past Mr Mayo  Is that the general view?  SPEAKERS(?) Yes  I just want to make sure because if we go ahead now we may run into some problems in the next month, more internally than externally, I suspect But what we'll look toward is negotiating it that way Would we [ordinarily] have approved these in November or December?  What we are saying, without objection as I understand it, is that we would go ahead and negotiate to this end assuming that we don't run into some roadblock here or abroad, though more likely here I don't think we will, but I can't be sure Now we have this remaining question--I don't think we have to debate the whole problem at this stage--of how much in foreign currency balances    10/21/80  we want to hold or should properly hold over time I do think there's a case [for some accumulation of balances] I say that because the Treasury is so far in debt that there is quite a bit of absorptive capacity in the United States government for the next month or two anyway But there is a problem with the Treasury's management of its cash Just how that is going to be worked out, I don't know We are going to have some discussions with them, and I think it might be helpful to have some more flexibility in holding D-marks anyway That is the area in which the Treasury is short and eventually they are going to want to cover this $2 billion at least As I understand this, we're operating on a rather informal understanding now in this area The present limit, which was informally agreed to quite a while ago, is not in an authorization; it is not in any written directive  Well, if it's warehousing, it doesn't come within this limit If that's the way it is worked out, there is going to be no problem for the time being They may just do more forwards and I suppose theoretically we could swap-out some of this spot stuff and buy it back forward for the Treasury We can just hold some for a while until they're ready to take it There are several options; I just don't know the answer to it But I would propose that it doesn't hurt to have enough flexibility to go to, say, $1 billion during this period while we're working this out The more general question can be discussed in the fullness of time, but I don't think we have to discuss it right now  Yes Well, it's not that they permit us; we permit them and we'll take them back That's one of the considerations we'll be looking at--whether they want to do it that way There are several ways this might be worked out, all of which have pluses and minuses from the Treasury's standpoint They have a debt-ceiling problem, too, among other things And I don't think they can be seen warehousing currencies with us in indefinite amounts to avoid a debt-ceiling problem There are a number of considerations that bear upon this I would simply suggest--I don't think it's out of keeping with our long-term needs--that going up to $1 billion, which does not strike me as very excessive considering the amounts by which we have gone into debt on the other side, would give us some flexibility  Other than yen  I suppose we'd have to put that at $1-1/2 billion, say  That would leave us where we are except [to allow] another $500 million on the D-mark  This is just a holding action to give us a little flexibility at the moment, that's all  Well, it might not be I'm perfectly happy to go higher if the Committee wants to And if it's not high enough and we run into a problem, we can come back [to the Committee]  I only suggest $500 million to give us a little maneuvering room; I would come back if I thought that created a great problem The basic philosophy that is being expressed I agree with I just don't think it's necessary to make it a very high limit right at the moment It probably isn't necessary operationally  We can if you want to  I do think we'll try to work something out with the Treasury so that they are, in effect, taking the first $2 billion So I think we have more room But if that isn't easy to work out, that's when we will run into the problem  I have no problem going up to $1-1/2 billion I personally have no problem with going higher in a long-run context But I think that raises other questions  Well, I just don't know I suggest $500 million in the knowledge that we can always come back to the Committee if we need more The way you worded it makes it sound a little more restrictive--that the presumption is we won't come back But I guess we're [talking] nuances here I'm perfectly happy to add $1-1/2 billion, if that's the way you want to go I'm perfectly happy to go with $1 billion with a footnote that if the Treasury for some reason can't [finance more marks] very readily and we run into the kind of problem you're talking about, we may well want to come back and indicate that we want more than the $1 billion  Why don't we go to $500 million more now but with the understanding that if we run into a problem, we'll be back to the Committee  Well, $1 billion just in the mark is all we're talking about at the moment  If we run into a problem, we'll just be back [to the Committee] with a written communication  I think that's all on the international side We can consider at some point the more general issue of whether these limits are too restraining or not Do we have an overall limit? We're left with a limit, I discover, [in the formal authorization] of $8 billion, which seems a little inconsistent with our open position We can only have $1 billion on the up side but we can apparently have $7 or $8 billion on the down side But we may--  SPEAKER(?) I think there's something asymmetrical about this  We may want to look at that, but I think we can do it when we review the whole authorization early next year  Okay Mr Sternlight  Questions or comments?  Well, we don't know This gets into some very serious problems, as Steve suggested If we had pressed down very hard and pushed, I don't know where the federal funds rate would have gone but the evidence seems to be that we get very little impact on the money supply in the short run But we might get a helluva big impact two months from now and then you would say My word the money supply is declining 8 percent and we have to push way the other way So if we let the federal funds rate go to zero--I'm exaggerating a bit--we still won't get much impact [in the very short run]; we'd get that impact two months later Now, if one wanted to be nasty and critical of the Federal Reserve, one would say we reacted or pressed too hard in February and March when money supply growth was high The result was a very [weak] money supply in April and May And we pressed much too hard against the decline in the money supply in April and May with the result that it went up [rapidly] in August and September Now, I think there are other things operating, but to the extent that these lags are operating that's the dilemma we get into  If there's a lag of that sort, we can get whipsawed That's very easily--  Well, we are working on that again It's probably premature to say anything, and we probably won't get a good answer when we get it So, what do you say?  It only takes a 2- to 3-month lag We don't assume a very long lag, but we have to assume there isn't much instantaneous [effect]  I'll ask you the question back again You don't have to resolve what mechanism it goes through; [the question  -16-    10/21/80  is] how can you get the restraint on the money supply and on bank activity without having an impact on interest rates?  We are not talking about the lag in the reserve requirement This is the lag between interest rates or whatever other mechanism and the change in the money supply  But that doesn't follow; that's the problem  That problem we surely have had But I don't think one can simply say that the answer is that we ought to be less concerned about interest rates Indeed, it may be--I just present this as an hypothesis--that our lack of concern over interest rates is what produced the fluctuations in the money supply this year Now, I think many other things are going on, but one cannot reject the hypothesis  I cannot reject that proposition on the basis of what I know now  I don't think it's the whole thing--I'm speaking somewhat theoretically--but it may have entered into it to some degree By letting interest rates fluctuate so much, we may have helped to generate the fluctuations in the money supply  Indeed it is  And we're left--there's no escape at the moment--with having to rely on some judgment as to how to express this formula for how far to put down the nonborrowed reserves when the aggregates begin running high The mechanism isn't a perfect one, that's for sure But I don't know of any statistical formula that resolves it at this point  Well, one can't draw it right now But it is obviously on the agenda I don't mean to exaggerate this but I think the main reason the money supply has been fluctuating is that the real economy has been fluctuating That may be partly due to our policies but I--  John Balles  Let me just remind you that we had a perfect practical example this time of raising the discount rate between meetings, which did not affect the margin between the discount rate and market rates at all It just raised the level of market rates So we were left with an even larger discrepancy, so to speak, between market rates and the discount rate by the time [the adjustment] was finished That is what one would expect to happen if the level of borrowings, which we control, remains the same or goes up  Well, I'll just make one more comment in connection with what you said [and then I think we ought to move on] My impression is--it has to be confirmed by a little more statistical analysis--that basically all countries have much more instability in M1 than in M3 or M2 or whatever [broader measure] they look at And some of this stability we hear reported in foreign countries is because they concentrate on the broader aggregates If one looks at their M1, it doesn't look a lot better than ours, although ours looks pretty bad this year relative to any experience [unintelligible]  We have to ratify the transactions  Oh, yes  Let's take up the ratification first Without objection the transactions are ratified Now we'll take up the $4 billion [leeway], which seems reasonable under the circumstances Would somebody like to move that?  SPEAKER(?) So moved  SPEAKER(?) Second  Without objection, you have a $4 billion [intermeeting] limit Mr Zeisel  You're overjoyous Let me ask a question on the short run, the very short run We had a pretty good increase [in economic activity] apparently in August and September If we had a monthly GNP number, it would probably be going up--I don't know--at maybe a 5 percent rate or more in those two months And July was the low point So September must have been substantially higher than July To get only a 1 percent increase in GNP in the fourth quarter, are you assuming a decline if you plotted this monthly in November and December?  Well, starts will drop off, but the [drop in] activity lags  Let me put it this way If your forecast for GNP is right, does it imply a decline in industrial production in November and December?  Maybe we will go on to you, Steve, and then have a general [discussion]  Why don't we deal with any immediate questions that arise and then have a coffee break  Yes  The same thing that distorts M-1A distorts M-1B I don't see how we can escape that  I don't think we have ever to my knowledge made a decision to deemphasize M2 Operationally, when the staff make up the paths and so forth, they are looking at M1 because that's what [depository institutions] hold reserves against And that tends to color the conversation But in an analytic sense, in setting the targets for the year I wasn't that conscious of downgrading M2  Next year we may face the possibility that neither M-1A nor M-1B makes sense for the first six months of the year  That may be healthy It's not just a question of looking at one or the other We know they are both biased, but by some unknown amount  If there are no more questions or clarifications, let's have a coffee break  I have an uneasy feeling that our national economic statistics in general are not getting any better They're probably worse, but I don't know what to do about it  Any other clarification questions? Let's have our coffee break  [Coffee break]  -24-    10/21/80  Presumably the clarifications have been taken care of We can go around the table and see what you think about the business picture And perhaps you can give some general comments on our own posture and then we'll look at the decision more carefully But let's be a little general right now  Mr Black  -25-    10/21/80  Mr Corrigan  Governor Wallich  Mr Mayo  Mr Morris  I'm not sure I fully understand what you mean by guidelines  Do you mean for the longer run?  For this year?  That may be the fact But I'm not sure we can do anything at this point to affect that  We can decide that I'm just saying that what happens in the next two months may be very little influenced by what we do [today]--whether it's up or down or on the target--because it's in the cake  No, but that decision may influence more what happens beyond [that time horizon] than what happens within the next two months  Why?  I question how clearly the market can perceive that Governor Gramley  -29-    10/21/80  Mr Winn  Grading standards have been relaxed  Governor Rice  Mr Baughman  That's the best news I've heard in a long time, Ernie I didn't know that The last wage settlement I heard of down in your part of the country was a 60 percent increase for three years front-loaded  It was in the energy-related area  Governor Partee  Mr Guffey  Mr Roos  Mr Balles  Mr Smoot  Mr Ford  Well, we have a couple of quarters that haven't been heard from I don't know whether they want to be heard from or whether we should proceed  You are permitted to be silent at this stage  I'm not saying permanently I said "at this stage"  Thank you, Governor Does he speak for you, Mr Solomon?  Well, let me make a few comments We certainly have some difference of opinion, which may not be fully resolvable, but a certain number of truths keep repeating themselves to me Some have been mentioned and some may not have been These truths seem to me self evident They may not seem self evident to  -39-    10/21/80  everybody else around the table so I will repeat them I think we have to recognize, first of all, that there is a certain artificiality in talking about these targets, however much the market is preoccupied with them and however much we are preoccupied with them We talk about our credibility and that's important But credibility over time has to bear some relation to what is possible and what is desirable And these targets were not exactly written in heaven They were written by fallible people And there are a lot of uncertainties in the economy and a lot of changes occurring in it I'd love to meet these targets, but it is not absolutely the be all and end all of existence  Tony speaks about the public not understanding if we have--by some complicated arithmetic, which I'm not sure they are capable of doing very well--[numbers that are] inconsistent by a half percent of meeting the target My judgment is that they will understand one hell of a lot less if we broke our back to meet the target in the fourth quarter at the expense of a decline in the money supply by a rather sizable amount in the first quarter We'd be sitting here with people saying Why did we have interest rates so high in the fourth quarter and now we are running way below the target in the first quarter and interest rates are tumbling and we are in the midst of another recession I wouldn't like [it] either I'd like to meet the targets and not have the first-quarter experience All I know, looking at the past year, is that it isn't quite so simple to meet a target in any particular quarter and that an undue effort to meet a target in a particular quarter, however important the target may be, isn't the only thing that's important There are some substantive problems that I don't think we can completely solve by saying this is what we said, or more specifically, this is what I said 12 months ago I think we have to recognize--whether it's good strategy or bad strategy to change the targets at this point and I would not at all suggest that we change the targets officially--Steve's point about the targets for M-1A and M-1B, which is that they are wrong They are internally inconsistent That is the fact of the matter, which cannot be evaded And in any public explanation of monetary policy and how we have met these targets in the past year, I will say that because it happens to be true The M-1B [range for the year] is too low relative to [that for] M-1A We thought there was going to be a 1/2 percentage point difference; there's a 2 percentage point difference What we don't know is how much of that should come out of M-1A and how much should be added on to M-1B But we know roughly that the M-1A target is too high If the central tendency of what we were aiming at a year ago is right, the M-1A target is too high and the M-1B target is too low It's an arithmetic fact We said they were going to be different by 1/2 point and they are different by 2 percentage points  As a number of people have said, forecasts are uncertain And we have not had a good forecast of the money supply, and I say this with no criticism whatsoever We haven't had an accurate forecast of the money supply on a monthly basis or a quarterly basis We haven't had--really nobody has--an accurate forecast of the economy on a quarterly basis When we sit here and guess about what will happen to the money supply, a great deal depends on the relative optimism of the staff regarding the business forecast, which I think does imply at least a slight downturn in November or December That may or may not develop A lot of people have suggested that there's a chance [GNP growth] is going to be a little higher than the staff  -40-    10/21/80  estimate--that's my own instinct--just from momentum I'm not talking about anything big And if we look at the direction of the errors in the money supply estimates, well, maybe they are going to change There's a good chance the money supply is going to come in higher than the staff estimate But that's a gut instinct and not anything more than that because basically it's a very uncertain proposition  If you look at the forecast for next year, I have the instinct that it's improbable that the economy will be quite as stable as the staff suggests But if I had to choose between whether it's going to be stronger or weaker, I would be very uncertain I well understand why the staff ended up with a forecast of stability Indeed, whether it's going to be stronger or weaker depends a lot upon what we are going to do this month, next month, or whenever In that sense, the decision we make today is very important Unfortunately, the hard fact of the matter is that the decision we make today isn't going to have much to do with what the money supply does between now and next month or between now and the end of the year I don't think we have any experience that suggests the direction in which we try to move things is terribly significant in the very short run But it may be very significant 2, 3, or 4 months from now I just don't think we can change that That's the way the economy is built We face a situation, given the October estimate--which should have a little validity but which has been moving up, as John Balles says--in which October is already higher than either of these paths And to get down to "A" we'd have to have [an actual] decline, in M-1A anyway, from here on out Whether that's achievable or not, I don't know It depends in part upon whether the economy turns around as the staff suggests it will  The next point I would make is that I think the instability in interest rates has become a problem It has become a problem in terms of real economic activity--I'm trying to abstract a little from the level of interest rates over a period of time--because the mere instability of interest rates, to some considerable degree, I think, affects the housing industry and perhaps the car industry and other areas of planning If we could manage things so that in general we both followed the targets and had less instability of interest rates we would be better off, obviously How to do that is the question  I would repeat the point about lags that I made earlier There are limits to the effort that has to be made, given the relative inelasticity of money supply in the short run, to change the trend over the next 2 months if the expense of that is changing the trend in months 3 and 4 by a much bigger amount in a direction we don't want to see it go And we don't know We don't know those relationships very well I think we have to recognize that we're working in an area here involving some ignorance The difference between "A" and "B"--and here is where the artificiality of some of this comes into play--is almost negligible in terms of the actual reserve path exercise We are talking about a 2 percent difference in the growth path over the period to the next meeting, when we will look at them again anyway That amounts to $60 million worth of reserves, which in the first place is within our range of error and is much smaller than adjustments that we tend to make in the path between meetings in any event So in that sense, if we just focus on those targets and we expected that what we are going to do here is the only thing that influences our actions, the difference between those targets we are  -41-    10/21/80  talking about is trivial I don't think our decisions are trivial because they affect more than next month; and we ought to bear in mind what the effect is likely to be not only next month or this quarter, but next quarter and make some judgment on those grounds  We are going to be controlled by what happens much more than by a difference between "A" and "B" Last month is a perfect example What happened last month? We had a great argument about whether the money supply should be aligned, in terms of a target, 1 percent higher or lower Within a week, as I remember, it was clear that the money supply figure was far above either of the targets And we responded I don't think the aggressiveness of that response would have been a $60 million difference--or I suppose in one sense $30 million--because there was only one difference in opinion It was washed out in other factors The fact is that the Committee in general recognized--there was no disagreement, for instance, on the discount rate decision--that [the money supply] was going too high And within the limits of human judgment we responded I think it's more than likely that we will face that kind of question again this time  Now, whether we choose "A" or "B" biases things a bit, but I don't think we ought to be overwhelmed by that particular difference If I had to guess--and I suppose it's implicit in my remarks here on worrying about what's going to happen--I'd say the danger is that the money supply is going to be too big and the economy is going to be a little stronger The growth in money is going to be too big regardless of which of those targets we pick or if we choose something in between Now, we still have to make a judgment about what we are going to do and reach some kind of consensus In a sense the more relevant issue substantively--not in terms of what somebody reads in the directive a month from now, which I think is highly colored by what happens between now and a month from now--is what our intentions are, or how we bias this in the future That is only partially influenced by the choice of targets; it is more directly influenced by the level of borrowings we set now and the speed of reaction to what all experience shows is likely to be a change in the money supply estimate, not within a 2 percent range but within a 6 percent or an 8 percent range, either up or down And that's where we have to make a decision  I would point out in just technically explaining what has happened to the money supply during this year that we may have had one of the biggest swings in the direction of economic activity in the shortest period of time that we have ever had From March to July-- I'm just guessing and not looking at the quarterly figures--I suppose the GNP was declining at an annual rate of something like 10 percent for four months It meant nominal GNP was virtually zero, looking at it on a monthly basis Since then--I don't know what you would guess, Jerry--but I'd say it was going up 7 or 8 percent if one just looked at August and September alone So, getting into October we had a swing in the course of economic activity at an annual rate of 17 percent And since that is the major factor that affects the money supply in the short run, with stable interest rates anyway, looked at in that light it isn't totally incomprehensible as to why the money supply went through a swing of 17 or 18 percentage points at an annual rate Now, I'm abstracting from some very big changes in interest rates, [whose effects involve] some lags, which is the point I think we made to a considerable extent That's why I think what happens to  -42-    10/21/80  the money supply in the very short run is going to be largely governed by an uncertain business outlook as well as by all the random disturbances that enter in, as it always is  Let's look at where we come out Right at this point do we want to put considerable additional pressures on the market in the absence of any further evidence that the money supply is off line or do we not? That's the first decision, from my point of view, that has to come out of this meeting Secondly, I take it for granted that if the money supply is increasing more than, let's say, the "B" path--I'm not suggesting necessarily that we take "B" at this point--but just given the random fluctuations in the money supply, if we get some more upward revisions in the present estimates of the money supply, I would personally presume that we have to react [The growth in money] is already high; we are already above "B" If [money growth] in the next few weeks comes in still higher than we expect, that is consistent with a reaction--from what most people have said, anyway In general terms of direction, I assume that there is a consensus on that point If it comes in low--in that happy circumstance--I'm not sure there is a consensus But Steve first, and others subsequently, commented on not reacting too fast in an "easing" direction if the money supply comes in low I don't know whether I can take that as a given of our decision or not I would personally accept that And just to pin down the first point I made, I'm not sure I would come out of this meeting with a strong conviction, based upon knowing nothing else about the money supply or the economy or anything else, that we should force a significant change in the money market--in other words force a significant change in the borrowing level I'm not talking about fine-tuning here, but a really significant change  Now, I don't know whether there is a consensus on those points or not Point one is that we don't force a really major change now and I'm not fine-tuning on that [Point two is] that we certainly react if the money supply comes in above the current estimates that the staff has given us, which are already high compared to any of these [ranges] and that we don't react very fast if it comes in low I'm speaking now in qualitative terms If that's more or less an agreed framework--and I just raise that as a question--then we're left with what I see as the more trivial part of the decision, which has some cosmetic importance, more cosmetic importance to some of you than to others I shouldn't downplay it as cosmetic I realize it gets into the so-called credibility problem and all the rest Precisely where we put the forecast for the money supply, which is a figure we're not going to affect very much in the next month anyway, is a question Nonetheless, we have to put down a number at least in the directive I suppose after listening to all of this, I'd be perfectly happy to put that number between "A" and "B" So, let me hear your reactions to all of that And I suppose we need to make the borrowing number a little more concrete to give us some feeling of how fast we should react if the number comes in high--I don't know that it's so much a question of how fast, but how strongly--and the reverse if it comes in low, as to how passive we should be in relieving the borrowing pressure on the market as some have suggested  It's just the opposite of what we did last time  Well, you've come to that conclusion--just to clarify your view--because your instinct is that the money supply is going to come in high  All I mean to say by the difference between "A" and "B" is that the money supply--my own feeling and maybe I'm wrong--is [likely] to come in high; it's unlikely to come in between "A" and "B," just by the law of averages  That's right  That's for sure  "Pinpoint" isn't exactly the word he would use!  -45-    10/21/80  Yes, I think that's quite clear  It's hard to disagree with that If we get more indications of this excessive [money] growth, we're going to react  But suppose you argue that that was just the right course I think you can also argue that that's why the money supply is rising so fast now So don't be so worried about it if that was the right course, because now you have to worry about what [the money supply] is going to be in the first quarter  Well, we haven't reacted in the last two weeks We've had quite a lot of reaction since the last meeting And I think the first question is Do we want to react right now? That's a reasonable question I would say no, but that is the first question to be decided, it seems to me When I say no, I mean not react dramatically; I think $13 billion or something like that may mean a slightly higher federal funds rate  Let me make a specific suggestion I don't know if there is any argument about the funds rate; I don't think it's terribly critical We can change that, but a range of 9 to 15 percent has been suggested by a couple of people I'll pick up the borrowing at $13 billion--that's Tony's suggestion--which I think  -48-    10/21/80  implies a tendency toward a tighter market It is not a dramatic change, but it tends in that direction And, just in the interest of achieving a compromise, I'd split [the difference between] "A" and "B" We have to get a majority vote for something Have I left a variable out? I know the qualitative variable is [how quickly we react] This wouldn't go in the directive, but the implication is that if we get surprised on the high side--I'll call it a surprise--of the current money supply projections, we're going to be reacting about as soon as we know that [the aberration is] significant  We would permit the level of borrowings to go up automatically in the first instance and would begin thinking about changing the nonborrowed reserve path If we change that, it's likely to be by an amount that is bigger than the difference between "A" and "B" It always is  I think the best guess is between 12-1/2 and 13 percent, but it could conceivably go above 13 percent in some weeks depending upon the distribution  Yes, that's only for one month  Obviously, all this revolves around some concern, which some people have anyway, about interest rates But I think we really are saying something different if we set a specific funds rate objective We just said vaguely between 12-1/2 to 13 percent; it could be above 13 percent in some weeks That's a little different in terms of the way Peter is going to react If we say the funds rate should be 12-3/4 percent, he's going to be fiddling around in order to make it 12-3/4 percent or as close to it as he can, I suspect I think that's a real difference in methods of operation  What targets?  For the year?  No, I'm assuming we are not going to announce any change in the targets But I've already said that I have to testify in three weeks and I assure you that I'm going to say in explanation--what else can I say?--that we had a target that assumed a difference of 1/2 percentage point between M-1A and M-1B and, in fact, it has been running 2 percentage points After all, they can see that by looking at the chart We got more inflows to NOW and ATS accounts than we had estimated Part of that came out of savings or other instruments and part of it, presumably, came out of M-1A We don't know how much came out of M-1A; we don't know how much came out of other instruments But the M-1B range is obviously a little low and just on technical grounds--  I've already told them that Now we're giving them a specific example It doesn't imply anything for policy but it does explain a bit why we're high on M-1A What it's going to show is that we're high both in the M-1A range and in the M-1B range correctly interpreted If the money supply comes in high, we're going to be outside the ranges  No, but if one correctly interpreted it, there's a possibility, I think  Well, we'd be very close to--  That's essentially what we are after  I will rest on a simple statistical fact that while these targets may be the most wonderful, impregnable things in the world, they are mutually inconsistent  I didn't say "hammer;" I said "say"  I will certainly indicate that We already tried [not to be explicit] when we announced them preliminarily But somebody reported to me that that was promptly interpreted as an easing of the M-1B target when we said in three different ways that it wasn't  The general impression that emerges to me is that [growth is] high in these target ranges Whether we're a little over or just within them, the fact is that on a fourth quarter- to-fourth quarter basis, whatever we say, we're on the high side and not the low side I also hope that these things don't go wild in the next couple of months and that we don't have to say we missed them all and that they are all out of the ranges  If we take the midpoints of the two alternatives, just arithmetically we come out with a 1/8 for M2-- [7-3/8 percent] So, [rounding for M2] we're talking about 2-1/2, 5, and 7-1/2 percent; or we could make M2 7-1/4 percent if you want to compromise it that way There isn't much difference between the two M2 figures  -51-    10/21/80  Well, technically, people can't tell that because it depends upon the path within the quarter If somebody assumes it's a straight line, that is right The proposal that I made, [given] the present M-1B target, would [imply that as] we sat here in October and looked at November we'd be 1/4 percentage point above the range I don't think there's quite as much importance to that as [there is to the likelihood] that the market is going to attach great importance to the fact that we chose a target that was 6 percent or whatever it is, 6-1/2 percent as opposed to 6-3/4 percent for the year as a whole I don't think it's the easiest piece of arithmetic in the world, but if that cosmetic is--  The fact is that we know the market focuses on M-1B I think that's unfortunate because M-1B is no better than M-1A They're both bad I suppose one answer would be just [for the sake] of debate that we have a target for M-1A that is below the midpoint I think that's arithmetically right, isn't it?  The [M-1A] number in "B" is at the midpoint So if it came in below "B," it would be below the midpoint for M-1A  Well, let's [see whether we have a consensus] Just to repeat We have 9 to 15 percent for fed funds, a small increase in the borrowing level initially and we have 2-1/2, 5, and 7-1/4 percent, just rounding these numbers, for M-1A, M-1B, and M2  In the directive we'd pick up that language that we used a year ago of "or somewhat less"  Yes, 9 to 15 percent on the fed funds rate  Initially  If it literally came out along the "B" path or a little higher, so long as that persisted the borrowing levels would be edging up But I would describe it as an edging up rather than a dramatic change If it came in way above [$13 billion], then we would have a different situation  It won't affect the borrowings  We'll discuss that later  I'm not aware of that But I would interpret a discount rate change as a rather forceful move, which I'm not talking about taking immediately But we can't exclude it if this really comes in high over the course of the next couple of weeks  No, not based upon this decision, without a radically different money supply figure or something  That's just a personal remark Well, unless somebody has a--  --further brainstorm, let me just see tentatively whether, as I take it, this attracts some support given the difficulties I'm sure it doesn't please anybody perfectly  That's right Under the circumstances, I think "live-with" is about the best we can do until November 18th  Nine to 15 percent, which just raises it a percentage point, doesn't it?  SPEAKER(?) Yes  Shall we vote?  We can see initially with a show of hands How many of the Committee members find this broadly reasonable?  I guess I'm forced to ask what else is broadly reasonable  My sense is that I do not know of any other approach that's more broadly reasonable, so we might as well vote I haven't heard any alternative that's likely to attract more support  -54-    10/21/80  To get [positive] real rates after tax, Governor Wallich, we'd need a 21 percent long-term bond rate  What are you talking about on the borrowing level?  That's $200 million [more] I don't sense that that proposal is going to have more support than this one And I think we better vote  Okay Do we have a Board meeting now?  SPEAKER(?) Yes, we have lunch and then the Board meeting  END OF MEETING  -56-       We need to act on the minutes  Without objection Mr Pardee  Should we ratify the transactions before I forget?  Without objection they are ratified Is there any discussion?  Mr Black  Governor Partee  I don't know how prolonged a discussion we can have, but I would state it somewhat differently  I don't know about buying all that we can That's a matter of interpretation  I think the Germans have a mixed mind about this whole thing They don't like the mark depreciating, but they at least have an argument as to whether intervention is effective as a means of preventing it from appreciating There's one school of thought that says Let it go up so it will go down further and the market will learn a lesson And I think that school of thought has been prevalent But we have been in a position of rather eagerly buying in large part because the Treasury was extremely anxious to cover its losses They are also anxious--I think it's a reasonable point and this is a combined operation--to have some surplus over the coverage of their [foreign currency denominated] bonds in case the dollar goes in the other direction They want a cushion so we will have some margin of protection without making them short And I suppose from our standpoint, a cushion seems reasonable too  Well, it's a small cushion now; we haven't debated precisely how big the cushion might be  That's only part of the story The other part is that, with the dollar rising against the mark, a normal leaning against the wind does relieve pressures on both us and the Europeans to do something different in domestic policy than we really want to do So the two things have to some degree coincided, to the extent the latter is important I wouldn't put a lot of weight on that in terms of affecting interest rate policy But to the extent it affects that, it goes in [the right] direction So both of those reasons coincide in suggesting that when the mark is weakening appreciably some intervention seems desirable  I don't mind having a rising currency to some extent, and it has been rising I think it's clear from what Scott said that we have not been intervening in a way to prevent any rise in the dollar  I am not sure what the facts are on this, Scott, but my impression is that at times in the past the US government has had substantially more net foreign exchange resources when the dollar has been strong I don't mean huge, but our net [holdings] are only at about $200 million plus now, right?  They have been substantially higher than that in the past at times of--  Yes  Sure, yes    11/18/80  In effect, it is washed out as another operating factor You can't identify a sale of a security for a foreign--  It just goes into all the other factors draining or providing reserves So there is somewhat of a one-to-one relationship  Well,--  Wait a minute We are not buying Treasury securities; instead we buy marks in the very short run But you have to ask what those people would do who want to get into dollars otherwise, and presumably those people are getting into dollars and buying some securities They may not be Treasury securities, but in the larger scheme of things it is a wash in our domestic market We are getting a capital inflow which we would not otherwise get  No, because otherwise the exchange rate would go up and presumably we would get an equilibrium in the market and they would not buy the securities Sure, the analysis is that in the immediate sense we are just selling Treasury securities; but somebody is on the other side of that [transaction], buying something coming into dollars  The net is probably zero in that sense, yes  I am discussing now a mechanical relationship How it affects policy, whether the Bundesbank wants to raise their interest rates or lower their interest rates because of [movement] in the exchange rates is a different matter  No, we wouldn't have the capital inflow  That is precisely my point You don't get the capital inflow without the intervention  This gets into rather--  In the immediate sense, it requires more selling of Treasury securities There is no question That is because Treasury securities is all we operate in The other side of the transaction is not identifiable and it may well not [involve] Treasury securities Now, if that makes a difference to you, it can be of some significance But in terms of the general supply and demand in the money market as a whole, it is probably a wash But in a very direct sense we sell Treasury securities to the extent we buy marks  I don't know if you want to have a prolonged discussion today; we can do it next time, if desirable The general issue, as I understand it, is concern about how much [we should accumulate] What should be the guidelines and all the rest    11/18/80  and what should be our net positive position in foreign currencies? There are really two questions There is that question plus under what conditions does it make sense to intervene Now, we have just been basically leaning against the wind for a variety of reasons that have been mentioned We now have--looking at the government as a whole, and I think it is relevant in this particular case because the Treasury has been looking at our balances as a hedge against the Carter bonds at the moment--a $200 million positive position If there's real concern about that positive position and about that getting to the considerably bigger magnitudes that we are talking about and if interest rates stay high, then we have an immediate problem I frankly do not feel that concern I think it would be a reasonable precaution to hold amounts within the ranges we are now talking anyway--by which I mean in the hundreds of millions area I have no real problem with that; I not only have no real problem, I think it is desirable for the reasons that have been suggested  Yes, that is probably what we ought to do But I would point out, just in terms of this general problem, that we have an example currently of a country that is taking the extreme opposite view, which is the United Kingdom, and even they have accumulated some reserves They have had a very high inflation rate, high interest rates, and a prolonged and very sizable appreciation of sterling Whether that is good or bad is the question But that is an example of a country that is taking a different view They have not taken it so extremely that they haven't acquired any foreign currencies; they have But they haven't acquired very many  I don't think it has anything to do with their fears about gains or losses on foreign exchange transactions Whether it's for, as you say, monetary policy reasons or economic policy reasons, they are willing to take a strongly appreciated pound to put pressure on their inflation rate  I think it is a bit of an exaggeration to say they bought as many as they could, but that is a market judgment  Institutionally we have to face the fact that the Treasury is extremely eager to acquire marks and build up a nest egg They will build it up if we don't It is very awkward for them to--  It is in fact very awkward for them to hold [marks] I don't have any disagreement with the Treasury policy  I accept the notion that people think that is true And I have no reluctance to do it I do not myself feel the least bit confused about what we are doing, which apparently we have not articulated correctly We are leaning somewhat against the appreciation of the mark and we are willing to accumulate some balances for all the precautionary reasons that have been suggested That's apart from mostly in the past being in the position of just getting back into balance as the United States and that phase at the moment is over It changed very rapidly a week ago when we suddenly got into a minus position after being in a positive position for a few days But having reached that arithmetic point, I had presumed that we were willing to acquire some additional foreign currencies consistent with our general philosophy of being willing to lean against the wind, anyway Now, if that is wrong, we ought to change it; but I don't think it is wrong  Well,--  That is right The [informal limit] now is $1-1/2 billion [Secretary's note The $1-1/2 billion informal limit is for all foreign currencies excluding yen There is a separate limit of $1 billion for holdings of yen]  -10-    11/18/80  As things now stand, that is correct  Well, we can schedule a longer discussion of this--  We can review the subject We will review the subject  Unless the market is in disequilibrium, it is an interest rate arbitrage  The market is in equilibrium isn't it? The forward differential changes every time interest rate differentials change  It speaks of erratic--  Well, we will have a more orderly review of this at the next meeting Do you have a recommendation with respect to operations?  My recollection is that the Committee hasn't formally approved these [agreements at this stage] but that you are authorized to proceed and undertake these negotiations We will have to approve them formally at some stage There has been some limited consultation with the Congress by the Treasury So far as they are concerned, it is okay, but I am not absolutely clear in my mind that there will be no objections  We had a consultation on the House side?  It looks as if it's proceeding on course, subject to these technical [details]  I understand  I understand You don't need any specific action now today, do you?  Are they going to be done before the next meeting?  All right Do we have a motion on that?  Any objections? That is approved Now, there is this one question of the Swedish swap, I take it, as to how big that will be  This is the case where we temporarily increased the line through next May, and you are suggesting that the renewal would be consistent with maintaining the increase but only until next May  So that doesn't require any action then  They were in trouble  This was arranged last April I believe  It was discussed with the Committee, though  So we are not doing anything on that Our earlier decision stands All right, Mr Sternlight  M-1B startled me I don't know how there came to be such a difference between M-1A and M-1B, $700 million for M-1A and $14 billion for M-1B, as Peter said I was just looking at these data and M-1B is only $100 million higher than it was four weeks ago while M-1A is $500 million lower than it was four weeks ago Now, the figure four weeks ago had a little spike, but we haven't had a big increase since the [October meeting] We have had two weeks of decline and then this week of increase which has about balanced off [the declines] I might say on those money supply figures that they don't reflect complete reporting; they reflect reporting for all the member banks and the sample of nonmember banks that we used before When we complete the tabulation of the nonmember banks that we have not been getting, there may be a need for a benchmark revision, which would be exactly analogous to the benchmark revisions we have been making every quarter anyway We indicated in the announcement that that might become necessary There is no reason to think that the benchmark revisions will be any bigger than those we have made in the past, but it is going to take several more weeks, I take it, to get the flow of data from the new reporters before we integrate it We will do that all at one time and then if it comes out different from [the estimates based on] the sample, we will announce a benchmark revision  I am not positive of that Mr Axilrod is a little skeptical, I guess We expect to do it on Monday if we don't do it on Friday But we are not certain yet we can do it on Friday I might say that as I understand it, the whole process went quite smoothly People seemed to be reasonably satisfied with the data we have, though we don't have all the new reporters Tell me, Mr Beck, if I am not reflecting your views and other's views accurately We do not yet have the data from the new reporters but the data from the old reporters seem to be in pretty good shape, and we got the numbers together with a relatively short lag I think that's quite a tribute to the efforts throughout the System to get this done in an orderly way And it does seem to have gone quite smoothly I know it involved a lot of hard work around the System generally  What we are going to do?  No, there is a problem here which you may be referring to but I can't recite it all exactly Steve, you can correct me, but I think the main problem we are running into is that we have a huge amount of excess reserves now with the new system  It is all this vault cash So, what we are going to do is to put an additional line on the statement that says "excess vault cash" or something like that For analytical purposes people presumably will subtract out the vault cash that is just sitting there from the total of excess reserves to get an excess reserve figure that seems functionally [equivalent to] the old excess reserve figure  In effect, it's excess reserves of bound banks, bound banks meaning those that have a reserve requirement higher than the vault cash they ordinarily hold  It's a real problem, but I--  We think this should satisfy them, but it's a problem for us too  We've [looked at] that, I think  -16-    11/18/80  I don't know, but my own instinct is that we would not get by with that I have had some casual conversations [about whether] we would be subject to Freedom of Information Act suits if we didn't straighten out these reserve figures somehow to show them on some basis that made sense and was comparable with the past figures, which is what we are trying to do by the way Steve described it [I was told that] people were about to bring suits to demand that we make such calculations so that they're not fouled up I cite that as the sensitivity in this business  It boggles my imagination to think that we would really operate for a whole month without attempting to seasonally adjust the figure  I may be too Polyannaish, but when I observed the market recently, I thought there was a change in that they have kept these weekly figures in some reasonable perspective They haven't jumped all that much just on the basis of one week's data Occasionally, we get a jump because they say, in effect We were hoping it would come down and now we have lost hope And that's pretty much the way that we have looked at it, too If we have these targets, we really can't blame them for observing [the trend] over a period of time  Look, I am willing to re-examine this issue I don't know how to do it analytically My own instinct, as expressed by Fred Schultz, is that even if 90 percent of the people in the market agreed with us, the other 10 percent are going to raise a ruckus and there's going to be a big brouhaha We can look at the issues; I don't know how to look at them systematically, but we can try  -18-    11/18/80  Look, we would lose something [by changing] this On some occasions, obviously, it is extremely annoying to publish these weekly numbers which may be erratic On other occasions, like today, when the market is thinking that the money supply is even stronger than it probably is, it is nice to get the numbers out and show them it is not quite as wild as they think it is  If I could edit the figures--  Well, why don't we have a little paper written on the pros and cons of this  Of course, if you raise that question, you have to raise the question of how we keep reserve requirements, because basically these figures are generated in the first place so the banks know what their reserve requirement is [Unintelligible] monthly reserve requirements  We can theoretically; it is not going to save much work  -19-    11/18/80  Why don't we do a paper raising all these issues  In this general connection, let me make a point about something I have looked at recently in preparing some testimony I don't know if it will provide you with any reassurance or not, but if you think our M1 has been unstable, look at any foreign country's M1 figure If you look at the data over a period of years, the standard deviation in the United States is about half of that in other countries on a monthly basis, as I recall the numbers Even the annual numbers don't look any better; they look worse Isn't the characteristic of all these series that M1 is much more unstable than M2 and M3?  Well, let's try to do it later I don't know what it is myself But let's get on with our work here  We will produce a memorandum Did you have a comment that you wanted to make earlier, Bob?  Did we ratify your transactions, Mr Sternlight?  It better be quick  Mr Kichline  Why don't you go ahead, Steve, and then we'll have a general discussion  -21-    11/18/80  I think we now want general comments on the economic situation and strategy Let me make only two preliminary points First of all, the story isn't in yet but I will anticipate the story I don't know what is going to happen to long-term rates I take it they are higher now, or not much changed anyway, than before we changed the discount rate  It appears that the discount rate change has had an impact on short-term rates I'd just point out once again that thoughts that a discount rate change is a "freebie" in adjusting to the market are not warranted in the particular situation that we are now in, when banks are borrowing very heavily The use of the surcharge is an attempt to moderate that reaction, but just how much it will moderate it or whether it will moderate it at all is not totally clear That's the general point on the paths Looking ahead, let me say that I would find too intense a discussion on precisely where the target is in the short run sterile--not only sterile, but possibly misleading--because it doesn't have much to do with where we set the path As I indicated last month, we've had repeated indications in the past few months when the figures were coming in high that it made very little difference where the target was set It made a lot of difference as to how we reacted to the deviation from the target, right or wrong And that's precisely what the discussion ought to center on more profitably--whether one looks at it in terms of what the borrowing adjustments in particular should be or, as some people may, in terms of what kind of interest rate changes one is willing to tolerate or permit Those are the variables And they have very little to do with whether "A," "B," or "C" is chosen because the actual events are likely to [vary] over a much wider range, up or down, than is indicated [by those alternatives] The results are unpredictable, and as Steve just said, probably not much affected by what we do between now and the end of the year because we simply don't have that much time to affect the aggregates So we have to look at it with a view that what we are doing today may affect developments after the end of the year I don't see how one can avoid it So, with those preliminary comments--  That has been the practice and I would presume that that is what it will be, yes  Yes Consistent with past practices, if we wanted to adjust, in effect, we would put the target lower and explain that as the reason why the target was lower I don't know that that's written in concrete, but that is the implication of what we've done before anyway It is what the Congress is used to and it's what we are used to So in a sense we still have a sliding base on an annual basis We no longer have it on a quarterly basis if we continue that procedure We could debate that, but that has been the presumption, anyway  Yes, I see no reason [why we couldn't] do it that way--to say we're still targeting with an older base--if the Committee wanted We'd have some confusion, I think, in explaining ourselves But if that's what we wanted to do in substance, it is conceivable  I don't know I haven't thought about that question particularly I certainly haven't thought about a change in procedures [Unintelligible] there is something to say if it changed the procedure despite all the very valid objections you have If it was thought terribly important to try to make up for an overshoot, instead of just having a target that sounded terribly low next year, we might get the same result but it would look a little different I literally had not thought of doing it that way I think there would be a horrendous problem in explaining precisely what we were doing, but it may have some merit  We would have to change the relationship among them I am sure of that Well, I think we ought to begin a general discussion Governor Wallich  -23-    11/18/80  Just in the interest of clarification, Governor, I understand why you like the lower limit of alternative C from what you've said But I might have thought, knowing you, that you might not like the upper [limit] implication because of the swing in interest rates and the emphasis you put on--  You're mainly concerned about the lower limit  Mr Winn  Well, I don't know that we can get a better fix on it I strongly underscore what you have to say That this is a major uncertainty It is very much analogous to the situation at the end of last year when we were humming along in some sense and thought we might make a little progress on inflationary sentiment and other things, and along comes a 50 percent increase in the oil price That has a certain implication for psychology, behavior, money pressures, and everything else The way that situation is developing, we surely can't exclude another shock of that kind in the relatively near future  After citing all these uncertainties, do you care to express a judgment as to what you think is going to happen or the nature of the problems we face?  Does that make you want to be tighter or easier in terms of the money supply?  What country are you talking about?  -25-    11/18/80  Mr Morris  Well, you may have answered my question in your last comment, but I say this for everyone's benefit The whole question, whichever one of these targets we pick numerically, is going to be how hard we work to get to those targets and at what expense in terms of borrowings or interest rates And I think you have expressed the dimension of your interest rate feeling anyway  Well, I don't want to do it prematurely, but I'd like to get to some [views on the] borrowing assumption before we finish Mr Gramley  Mr Corrigan  Before we are too encouraged by the aggregates in the past four weeks--and I'd love to be encouraged, too --I remind you that these things have come in lumps and if we go back one more week, we had a $5 billion increase  Mr Guffey  If I may just interrupt I don't think our adoption of those targets insured a darn thing We didn't know what the money supply was going to be  If we hit those targets But there is nothing in our experience that says we are going to hit the targets over that kind of a time period  That is certainly correct recently  -28-    11/18/80  That's the issue; the actuals have been going higher  That is correct  Mr Roos  I just want to make your comments a little more operational, Mr Roos In choosing "C" are you saying that we should immediately decrease the nonborrowed reserve target substantially and therefore increase the level of borrowing?  Well, let me just interpret that I can understand that, but the only way we can affect the total is by affecting nonborrowed  Mr Rice  Mrs Teeters  Governor Partee  We're running awfully late I don't know whether people want to go out and drink some coffee before we finish this Let's do that Then we'll come back and complete this discussion  [Coffee break]  [Secretary's note When the meeting resumed after the coffee break, a few comments were missed]  Mr Schultz  Mr Balles  Mr Eastburn  Mr Baughman  Mr Doyle, we're glad to have you with us today  -36-    11/18/80  Mr Ford  Mr Solomon  Well, let's see whether we can reach a decision There is a fair amount of difference of views on some of the specifics but some recognition on practically everybody's part of some common concerns, too On approaches, I would just make two general points I think what we are seeing now in general terms is the famous collision between the recovery and monetary targets that are in some sense too restrictive to permit recovery unless the momentum of inflation declines I didn't expect to reach [this stage] this early, but here it is A number of people have commented that these targets, just to put it very quickly, lower the limit on the ability of the economy to expand They are going to continue to do that, I suspect, given all the uncertainties, with targets of the type that we have until inflation declines And that's a very unsatisfactory picture from any perspective, other than sole-minded concern about hitting the targets That's where we are and that's where we may be  Somewhat related to that, which has already been mentioned, is that we still have some concern as to how much fluctuation we are generating in the money supply figures and interest rates by not recognizing some natural instability in these data It's purely a matter of judgment and it's totally unsatisfactory in terms of reaching specific decisions because, to exaggerate a bit, we are guessing Let me simply put it that if we bend over backwards to hit a target in the short run and find ourselves not making it, we end up with exactly the opposite problem in a very limited period of time in terms of the targets and with some real effects on the economy as time  -38-    11/18/80  passes And we have unnecessary fluctuations; we may be stuck with them to a degree but they are not a happy circumstance in which to operate But that doesn't give us precise guidance on how to balance those considerations  As for hitting the growth targets or not hitting the growth targets--and I can only give you a personal view--I am not as concerned about that as some people are because I don't think, as I've said before, that these targets are written in heaven There is a lot of uncertainty in these relationships I do think we have to demonstrate, and I am satisfied that we have, that we take them seriously That is important Whether being precisely in the ranges or slightly outside of them is terribly significant to credibility or not I think depends in part upon our own attitudes, how we portray it, and how we describe the problems [To the extent that] there is a recognition of the very real problems that we have, that credibility problem is diminished If we attach what I personally think is undue importance to absolute precision, obviously the public is also going to attach more importance to absolute precision than they otherwise would In that connection, I would only remind you that most foreign countries use a range I believe they all do now Is there one that doesn't, Mr Truman? I don't know There used to be  The French have been pretty good on their targets The Swiss have varied between growth in M1 of 23 percent one year to minus 3 percent the next year to plus 4 percent the following year, I think  But they have not lost their reputation for prudence and concern in the process  Sure, and that's part of the reason All I am saying is that in part the public's attitude toward these things depends upon our general behavior, not the precise arithmetic precision with which we reach the range Well, that's a philosophical comment We have to reach a decision here  So far as the money supply targets are concerned, I sense that we are dealing with two somewhat conflicting concerns One, which I certainly recognize, is that we are in the middle of the quarter If we were on the schedule that we talked about before, this would be the middle-of-the-quarter meeting We would already have set a quarterly growth target and the inclination would be not to change that unless there was something very persuasive going on But we would consider whether to change it and how to alter our operations Certainly we have been forced to raise that target repeatedly in recent months, and one can argue that for purely presentational purposes it would be nice to avoid a further change in the target I  -39-    11/18/80  think there is a lot to be said for that view The consideration on the other side was described by Governor Partee Is that being realistic? Is anybody here really proposing the strength of action and the kind of interest rates that might be necessary in our best judgment to reach alternative C--certainly "C" but even "B"--which implies from now on [unintelligible] Is it realistic to think [we could achieve the target]? I don't doubt that it could happen, but given all the uncertainty about the normal relationships that the staff gives us, which in fact are very erratic but are all we have to go on--  Well, it may be You can reconcile yourself to that view and that's all right I don't think the staff would say that that would be their best judgment  Yes, I know Anything is possible here! I agree it is possible  Well, you could argue that All I am saying is that if we took the staff's median judgment and reflected the distillation of assembled wisdom, recognizing that there is a huge range of uncertainty around it, I think one would have to say [it means] Let's really bang it now One could argue that that's a good idea because it's going to save us a lot of problems in the future On the other hand, a lot of concern was expressed that really banging it now is just going to complicate our problem in the very short run I think that kind of consideration would lead one in substance toward alternative A If I take seriously what I think I am hearing in comments we have had about the interest rate range and the borrowing assumptions and all the rest--that people don't want to go out there and really bang it--that leaves me in something of a dilemma because I think the Committee is in something of a dilemma It doesn't exclude the possibility that we could hit the targets because we just don't know these relationships well enough And there is the argument that it's better not to change things and mislead anybody as to our real intentions I am not sure, but I believe the Committee members are mostly between "A" and "B" I haven't counted and I am not sure they all said precisely [what their preference was] But that pretty well describes the considerations We are somewhat artificially constrained because we are talking about a period that only has six weeks more to run If we were not right at the end of the year--if we had looked at it from the perspective of the next four months instead of the next six weeks--and were somewhat worried about how this looks in terms of the targets for the year, I don't know whether people would say something like "A" is reasonable  Well, that's what I am suggesting in part I would guess that people might say "A" would be all right if we were looking through the whole first quarter of next year I don't know whether that's true or not, but I--  I don't know what you mean by your comment I think what a lot of people are worried about, Willis, is that by banging it really hard now, we're going to look foolishly low instead of foolishly high in the beginning of the first quarter or even in December Now, one may think the economy is very strong--and I think it may have a little [more] momentum right at the moment than the staff implies, but I don't doubt that all the risks are for a decline in the time perspective of now through the end of the first quarter But we may find the fourth quarter numbers are a little higher than the staff is suggesting, which further complicates this dilemma We'll see just where you want to go, but I also detected some concern about the interest rate level expressed by a good many people Consistent with what we're doing, I wouldn't like to get deliberately in an area where we have to work against an interest rate constraint because that changes the tone of our actions, but the borrowings have implications for that A $16 billion level of borrowings or thereabouts has been mentioned by a few people That's lower than it has been, inadvertently or not, most recently That seems not inappropriate to me, if we don't want to put a lot of additional pressure on the market because we just had a discount rate change And in a sense, by moving the initial borrowing assumption down slightly, it probably will not have much of an easing effect on the market But it prevents the discount rate move from being amplified and reverberating through the market excessively  To be consistent with "A," in effect  If your conceptual level of borrowing before the discount rate action was $16 billion, it should be lower now  Well, it has been running somewhat higher than $16 billion What has the market done after your operations this morning, Peter? Where is the federal funds rate?  What did the federal funds rate do?  But you don't know what has happened since then?  I don't know whether you're suggesting, Steve, that consistent with what I and other people were trying to say in concept--I lighted on $16 billion as a few people did--we should really be saying $15 billion  In a sense, what a lot of people seem to be talking about is that they want to keep "B" for the reason suggested--that they don't want to show a further change in what we're aiming at But we were talking more about the specifications of "A" with a higher federal funds rate on the low side of its range anyway Let me just get reactions to this proposal The "B" specifications and, taking account of Steve's comment, $15 billion or thereabouts on borrowing, and 13 to 17 percent for the funds rate, which a number of people mentioned for that, and a hope that they are consistent despite an analysis that they might not be  Steve has also suggested the idea--it sounds awfully complicated but it just is complicated at this stage of the game--of writing something into the directive that we are looking toward the first quarter, in effect We could certainly write it into the policy record, anyway We're thinking of "B" here on how we set the reserve path and would repeat the targets that we had last time, which are those in "B" And we'd put in some phrase that we recognize that there isn't much time between now and the end of the year to get on a specific path But we would in a way reverse what we've said [in the past] if we adopted "A;" we'd say the Committee thought that a small overshoot would be tolerable, provided that growth in the aggregates  -42-    11/18/80  was at a pace consistent with more moderate growth next year I don't know whether that language--  The early months of next year, yes Now, what that leaves out is that some overshoot from the specifications of "B" or any of these alternatives, if it developed, would be tolerable in the short run without our aggressively moving against it I don't know how much you would work that language in, Steve  Well, we have a conceptual difficulty there I am sure that you are right, but sometimes those same people said we should not set out now to bang up the borrowing level and bang up interest rates That's the inconsistency with which we are dealing Verbally they may have said "Don't tolerate an overshoot," but they didn't seem to be supporting the strength of action that would be needed to insure against an overshoot  There is no question, growth in the aggregates was very high in the first six weeks; so are interest rates  Steve can correct me, but my sense of it is that if we started out at the borrowing level that we're talking about and there were no change in the money supply from now on, week by week, we would come out very close to "B," wouldn't we, Steve?  You only get a $3 billion drop in December with no increase in the weekly figures from here on out? Aren't you assuming some increase [in those weekly figures] in that "A" [alternative]?  The trouble is, Larry, that they're both wrong You should average the two It gives you a rougher "right answer," as a matter of fact  We're having a consultation right now Out best estimate is that we are above "B" If you want to choose "B," we are consulting  We are realistically looking at "A" now That is the projection Now, it's an extremely uncertain projection, and I don't attach a lot of weight to it, but the experts say that's  -44-    11/18/80  where we are The range of uncertainty around it is very wide The sense of what I have proposed, just distilling some of your comments, is that for visual reasons, which are not unimportant, we will stick with "B" [for the ranges] and hope growth comes out at "B," but act somewhat like "A" at the moment That leaves us with the question of how strongly we react if "A" gets confirmed or, worse yet, if growth goes higher than the specifications of "A" That's the sense of it if we adopt these specifications; and it's reflected in part in the federal funds range Obviously, we have to consult if we hit [the limit on] that  I am not sure what it implies in terms of [that rate but] there is a relationship What it implies is that we're pretty slow about changing the nonborrowed path to make up for any decline in borrowing That's what it specifically implies, which in turn slows down any decline in the funds rate  It would come down some if we had a really big shortfall, but--  I think it's clear that people in general terms are willing to [tolerate] some shortfall from whatever target we adopt, without moving very aggressively [on the funds rate] I don't want to pin that rate at 14 percent at this point, but I would be slow to react on that side under our normal operating procedures If the market really thought the money supply was coming in low, we would get a big psychological effect in the market that would move interest rates But we would drag in changing our paths I think what is at  -45-    11/18/80  issue is how much we drag on the up side If we set these kinds of specifications, I would sense--without counting the people who did not talk too specifically, and many people did not--that there is no eagerness to whack it too hard if growth comes in above the ranges We're going to get some reaction  That's a technical term! Let me say, just in round numbers, that we start at $15 billion [in borrowings] You know, precisely what has happened after we argued interminably in the last two meetings about whether the target should be one percentage point more or less, is that within a week, or literally a few days, the next money supply figure that came in was over anything we were talking about So we moderately whacked it, I would say We raised the net borrowed reserves, we lowered the reserve path by $100 million or so, which was enough, and we probably overshot the reduction a little It was enough to have a very noticeable effect on the market Growth in the next week came in pretty high, I think perhaps by coincidence If it came in high [in the week ahead], let's say, but more moderately high than those numbers, maybe we wouldn't do anything for a week to see whether it was confirmed the next week If it came in very high, we'd probably react but more mildly than we did the previous two times  If it came in only slightly or moderately above the path  No, I think we're saying the opposite of that We're very tolerant of an undershoot What I am trying to pin down is how tolerant we are of an overshoot I think the general sentiment is that we're going to be less tolerant of an overshoot than we are of undershoots But should we be tolerant at all of an overshoot is the question or do we react very quickly? My dilemma is that if we're really not tolerant at all of an overshoot, we ought to be whacking it right now, which is not what people said So on how tolerant we are of an overshoot, I suppose what we're saying is that we'd be fairly tolerant right at the moment [up to the specifications of] alternative A If it got above alternative A, we'd be progressively less tolerant  Whether the funds rate gets over 17 percent or not depends upon how tolerant we are  That's right  SPEAKER(?) Well, that's the point I was trying to express  I'm not sure we can escape this problem by saying we're going to consult next week I'm trying to consult right now  Solomon's approach is fine, let's take it Let us proceed The funds rate is already in his area for consulting I am consulting  What do you want to do? That's precisely the--  Let's not put it off until next week Here we are  Let me repeat We put forward the "B" specifications; we put down a funds range of 13 to 17 percent; we put down a borrowing number of $15 billion at the moment; we don't do anything except just what we're saying here at the moment  I don't know whether we'll miss "B" or not There is a lot of uncertainty The staff tells us we're likely to miss "B" We understand that  We understand that We're misspecified in that sense We're hoping that if the money supply comes in high against their current projections in the next week or two, we're going to increase that borrowing level I can't be perfectly specific about how much we're going to increase it; we haven't got a formula for relating the borrowing level precisely to a new estimate of the money supply I am saying that if it comes in significantly higher than that, we'd probably move it by $100 million, but we wouldn't move it by more than that unless [the money supply] was enormously higher  That's right, borrowing would rise in any event We're talking about whether we reduce the nonborrowed reserves  I want to get a sense from the Committee I'm not talking in numbers that will turn out to be somewhat meaningless if we get new figures I want to know how hard the Committee is willing to [resist an overshoot] We're talking about a 20 percent federal funds rate if these numbers really come in high I take it you're not--  Now And 17 percent is barely marginal now The presumption is that if we have a $15 billion borrowing level immediately, it will come down from 17 percent But almost any overshoot from what we now expect is going to force the consultation you're all talking about a couple of weeks down the road  I am assuming that the present situation is tolerable We'll wait a week or so to see whether it comes down If it doesn't, we will have to consult again in a week or two  I don't know whether it's too quickly or not All I'm saying is that we only know that ex post, Larry We'll know whether it was too quickly or too little along about next March  That's right  [From what] I observed, a good many people came right to that conclusion But there is enough difference so that I'm not sure I can see a majority anyplace  Let me see if people think we can reach some kind of consensus around stating "B" and in some sense adopting the specifications of "A" because of a feeling that they may prove consistent over time and that we shouldn't anticipate their inconsistency I suppose that is the analysis that--  The path is in a sense drawn on "B" but with a starting point on borrowing which the staff tells us in their best judgment is more consistent with "A" But we're overriding [the staff's judgment on] that in a sense The changes from then on would be consistent with "B" Let me just finish this Again, let me try to get some degree of consensus for 13 to 17 percent I think Lyle is probably right that we're not going to hit the 13 in the next month I recognize that we're at the 17 right now Implicitly by citing that kind of target, we are accepting the current level of market rates We'd accept it fluctuating even slightly higher for a few days in the thought that the specification for the borrowing will probably bring it at least slightly lower If it doesn't, we will have to consult  -49-    11/18/80  because [our specifications] will be inconsistent But we'll let that go for a week or so We will react quite sluggishly to shortfalls We will react less sluggishly to overruns, but without enormous aggressiveness We don't have a formula for--  We're right there now  That's right  Well, that's what we're assuming now But you're basically operating on the reserve path, as I understand it  We could talk about mild [adjustments in] quantifications or whatever Does that general pattern represent a legitimate consensus? Can I have a show of hands on that?  Yes I'm asking whether it's essentially [acceptable], without getting into every last refinement Is this acceptable, with the explanation  It appears that I am as reasonably close as I can get to a consensus I don't know if there is any refinement that will conceivably increase this number Henry is worried about 14 percent on the lower end I am not sure whether that's operationally significant or not  Well, I'll tell you Part of the reason, Henry, to put it baldly, is that it upsets a lot of people's doctrinal views to have [the range] that narrow  Let's vote  Well, "10-4" means the meeting is over! Let me say for all its difficulty, I think we were concentrating more on the right variables today And it was helpful to me We have some underlying problems that aren't going to go away A number of people made comments, which I think are understandable, about whether the whole process of gradualism makes sense I just don't think that's an issue that we can decide at this meeting Nor, indeed, is it an issue that is up to the Federal Reserve itself because we're not going to deviate successfully from what has been termed gradualism without an effort by the government right across the board, of which we would have to be part  When I speak of collisions next year, I think you ought to be aware, and I'm sure you are, of the potential for the Federal Reserve to be left out there hanging alone in extremely unsatisfactory economic circumstances with expectations, deliberately [encouraged] or not, of what we can do about inflation through monetary policy alone much overdrawn And when policies are not a success, there will be an inclination for people to say that somehow inflation would have disappeared if we'd been 1/2 percentage point within the target instead of 1/2 percentage point outside the target or if we hadn't had a big fluctuation downward in the first quarter and upward in the second quarter or whatever That is a conclusion that I don't think  -51-    11/18/80  bears much relationship to reality Nonetheless, we're going to be extremely vulnerable, particularly if we feed that impression ourselves that somehow we're going to do it all alone  The danger that I see, and I put it very crudely, is that everybody will be committed to an attack on inflation but it's entirely up to the Federal Reserve to perform  That is one major element There are a lot of other elements in the inflationary picture Don't forget, there are people out there who are approaching this from one point of view, which at the extreme--Mr Corrigan ran into this the other day-- is that the budgetary deficit doesn't make the least bit of difference And other policies don't make the least bit of difference Inflation is purely a monetary phenomenon And if the Federal Reserve would only get its act straightened out, it would pretty much disappear in 12 months  Well, in one sense, it's a small group I'm not sure it's an uninfluential group And when things don't go well, there is a certain irresistible political temptation to say that that small group was right  I bring to your attention that the next meeting is a bit off schedule to get us in line with our new schedule So it's on a Friday because that's the time when we could fit it in It would not be surprising if we have to have some consultation before that time I hope some food is out there  Yes we are  END OF MEETING  -53-       Everybody's on and we're all here?  SEVERAL Yes  Well, gentlemen--or rather, lady and gentlemen--I think we ought to have a little review of the situation We may want to make a decision Let me just say in a preliminary way that there is not much we can do about it right at the moment but these money supply figures have been plaguing us in terms of revisions We have known this for some time and it has just gotten worse It's absolutely clear, in my judgment, that there is a systematic bias in these numbers When they go down, all the estimates are successively revised down And when they go up, all the estimates are successively revised up This [pattern] has cumulated over a period of time [and] has become quite serious in my judgment  Now, I don't know what theoretical reason there can be for this I don't think there can be a theoretical reason The [errors] should be random unless we are getting bad reporting The only plausible explanation I can see is that early reporters are not reporting the right numbers in some cases I don't know, perhaps they report last week's number or something, so when they are in an up trend it is always low and when they are in a down trend it is always high But I will have some people here, as soon as they get out from under, organize some way to look at this I suspect it's going to have to be done by looking very carefully at the individual bank level to see whether there is any systematic bias in reporting by some of the banks I don't know any other way to go about it, but we are looking into it Did you know a characteristic is [that we have had big revisions shortly after our meeting]? Maybe we shouldn't have any more Federal Open Market Committee meetings so we can't have an eye on money supply numbers that we discussed at a meeting! That's a part of this general upward revision syndrome We have had some upward revisions since the meeting, so why don't I ask Steve to describe where we are  I'll believe that when I see it  I don't know whether you want to add anything to that Peter  The general problem, as I see it, is a fairly simple if awkward one The money supply is running significantly higher than was assumed at the meeting The kind of borrowing assumptions we were using convert, without any discretionary changes, into something like $19 or $20 billion The question of a discretionary change is at issue certainly But even without that, if we stick to the minimal "holding steady" on the nonborrowed reserve path, we have a level of borrowing that obviously puts into jeopardy the 17 percent funds rate ceiling I would just propose, as a holding action at the moment anyway, that we move that to 18 percent, subject to review next week if we have to do it  I'm afraid those projections have had virtually no informational content in the past 4 or 5 months  Yes  Well, that might depend upon how this next money supply figure comes in I think it is hard to defer [the issue] if it comes in high If it comes in low, maybe we could defer the question The preliminary indication is a little on the low side If we didn't have that, I would be very hard pressed to say we shouldn't change [the nonborrowed path] a bit  Shall I go down the list? I have an alphabetical list, it so happens Governor Gramley  [Mr Partee]  Governor Rice  Governor Schultz  Mr Solomon we have [heard from] Governor Teeters  Governor Wallich  Mr Baughman, who is alternate for Mr Roos  I don't know whether any of the [non- voting Presidents] want to make comments Mr Black, Mr Eastburn, Mr Ford?  I can't quite hear you, Bill    11/26/80  Well, I'll just give you a brief answer, and then I think you ought to make up your own mind basically If these figures don't come down, inevitably that question arises But it arises against a background--not a conviction--that if we do it, we should not expect it to have any impact on market rates  Mr Black  First of all, [this is how] we are going to play this in the short run or for the moment We have a decision on the reserve path and we will have another consultation next week This may be a very interim decision Just in terms of this general experience--apart from statistical and estimating and other problems-- it seems clear to me that the real operating question here is what we do with the discount window And there's nothing we can decide on that in the short run But in that connection, how many of you have put any administrative pressure on any banks at all?  You have Interesting  I tell you, it's a bit of a mystery to me how those rules are interpreted We don't want any undue pressure but I don't think we want to lean over backwards the other way either Any other comments?  Well, we just have two or three Districts that have been doing something, right?    11/26/80  I am not aware of any particular concentration by District, but I am just not aware Do you have any comment, Mr Axilrod?  Personally, I am not at all sure that our rules are appropriate for today's banking system We don't have a situation where a particular bank gets in trouble and has to borrow repeatedly for weeks All they do is pass the pea around among themselves; they know what the rules are So one bank borrows one week, and it says I am not going to borrow for a few weeks, we'll let somebody else borrow So we get no real pressure on any particular bank because it's just a question of whether they buy more federal funds this week or less We just don't have the situation that existed 20 years ago where a bank got into trouble in some sense and more or less had no alternative to borrowing other than to make portfolio adjustments The last thing any of them do now is to make a portfolio adjustment  Well, there are a lot of questions to consider in this area But my overall impression is that we don't get much [restraint] Banks all have their business rate, so they never have to restrain [lending] They just change interest rates  SPEAKER(?) I think it may be important to observe, [that if] we start putting pressure at the discount window [what we are] doing is increasing the upward pressure on the funds rate  That is right, among other things Okay, we may be back in touch, but for the moment, that's where we are Thank you Happy Thanksgiving  END OF SESSION     We're sending out a search party for Governor Schultz I don't know whether he is back in Florida or not I just wanted to [bring] you all up to date on the markets and have a little group-think about where we are at the moment and whether we want to do anything or not I will make a suggestion on that after we finish with the description that Mr Axilrod will give you  Peter, do you want to fill us in on the market?  Just for the purpose of completeness You have had a little action in the international area, Mr Pardee, I take it?  Well, I don't think we have to make any decisions on [the international side] today, but I think we have to review the domestic situation, to put it in a setting of the Committee's decision on the directive [At] the meeting, we made a decision which [implied] a certain reserve path and we also made a borrowing decision of $1-1/2 billion, as I recall I think the understanding was that if the actual money supply figures came in somewhat higher than that, but not too much higher--then that would, of course, be reflected in higher borrowing from the natural consequences of the nonborrowed path in the short run And if [the borrowings] came in high enough, we would have to make an adjustment in the nonborrowed reserve path As has happened after other recent meetings, they did indeed come in high, and they came in high enough so that we did make an adjustment in the nonborrowed reserve path as well as having the natural consequence of the higher money supply figures And we are left, I guess not certainly, but with the    12/05/80  probability that the 2-month numbers will look higher On the present estimates that Steve gave you they're certainly higher than the Committee's decision But there is a certain smell about this situation at the moment of the money supply perhaps coming under control I say that not so much because I am so impressed by the most recent figure of a projected decline next week, but largely because of the way the figures have been coming in For the first time this fall we have been getting downward revisions instead of upward revisions I don't know why we have always had upward revisions before and I don't know why there is a change now But it has a slight smell to it--I hope more than a slight smell--that we may be getting some stability here So there is a chance that we have in that sense done enough But in terms of the Committee decision we made at the meeting--I forget, has it been modified since the meeting?  Yes, it was modified once since the meeting So we have that 18 percent limit [on the funds rate] in any event And at the moment that is in jeopardy Clearly, the Desk doesn't have much maneuvering room--or any maneuvering room if that [limit were viewed] literally What I would suggest in this somewhat uncertain situation is that we in effect temporize for the moment and not make a decision to change that limit We might have to do that, or at least review it, next week But for the moment I would propose that the Desk be extended an understanding that, in the immediate wake of the discount rate change, it has whatever maneuvering room it feels is necessary to keep on the path--with the hope that that will not mean a much higher federal funds rate than where it has been, certainly not higher than the 20 percent area But I can't guarantee anything Then we will see, looking a week from now when we will have another week's preliminary figures on the money supply, whether it is really desirable and necessary or not to operate within that constraint of the 18 percent limit  Now, the figure that Steve gave you is a projection for December If I recall correctly, it assumes a pretty big increase in the money supply in the week of the 10th We have no data on that whatsoever That's just a reflection of the belief that every other month recently has had a big increase in the money supply at the beginning of the month and that a cautious projection better assume that But we really have no specific information on it And if we're really getting a turn in things here, maybe that figure will not come in so high, and then the December estimate would look quite different I obviously don't know that now, but that is a factor in my mind in suggesting that we not make a permanent type of change in the upper limit It's not very permanent anyway in that we're meeting fairly soon But an explicit change in the upper limit may not prove to be necessary or desirable in the light of what we will know by the middle of next week Meanwhile, the Desk needs some operating room and we could have a note to that effect in the published record that comes out after the next meeting That is, in the wake of the discount rate change the Committee had a consultation about the immediate consequences in the money market and agreed that during the period of immediate reaction the Desk should have sufficient operating leeway to conduct its operations without being constrained by the 18 percent rate, pending further consultation The implication is that we will come down to the 18 percent limit in the latter part of next week if    12/05/80  we do not by that time make an explicit decision to change [the limit] I haven't gotten precise here, but that is the substance of what seems to me appropriate at the moment  I might just add one further thought If the money supply figure came in very low for the weeks that we don't know anything about, we've got to decide whether to drop [the borrowing path] instead of the very decided increase [we were] talking about It just raises the normal question of whether that adjustment in the nonborrowed reserve path that was made when it was high shouldn't be reversed so that that's washed out, which would itself relieve pressures on the market But that's just a hypothesis based upon something we don't know  Yes  No, I agree I think it has to be in the record  It would take a huge decrease to hit the annual figure, Larry  Well, I think we have lost on the annual target on M-1B explicitly, Larry M-1B is almost certainly going to be over [its annual target] Of course, that target technically is a little low but even if we adjusted it, we would almost certainly be over it But if we talk about the theoretical possibility of having a big enough decline in M-1B in December to be within the range, I think we would get a helluva lot of flak from the other direction for having such a big decline in the number in one month I don't know what the rate would have to be [in order to come within our target range], but my impression is that it must be a 10 percent annual rate of decline or something like that  I don't know We are 1 percent above it with two-thirds of the quarter gone Somebody's doing the arithmetic here, but--  SPEAKER(?) To get to the top of the cone we'd have to have a decline at about a 7 percent annual rate  Let's finish this point I am just getting some numbers and I can relay them to you  SPEAKER(?) Okay, the top of the cone would be $4116 billion  Right  SPEAKER(?) And we're at $414-1/4 billion for M-1B So we would have to have a 7 percent annual rate of decline to reach the top of that cone  Right But you haven't figured out the quarterly figures?  SPEAKER(?) No  Well, I can't give you the full answer But to hit the top of the cone in December, just looking at it monthly not quarterly, takes a 7 percent decline And it must take three times that, I suppose, to hit it for the quarterly figures So I think for the quarterly figure we're talking about a change that is out of sight But even if [we got that], it would be a decline like the one we had in April And everybody would say, my God!  SPEAKER(?) Some people may say more than that  Maybe it will happen Who knows!  Larry, I don't know whether you had finished  But do you have an opinion on the proposal?  Okay  Okay  Okay  Well, the proposal is that we leave it at 18 percent but tell the Desk it can be above that temporarily pending further discussion next week  Well, there's nothing particularly [in the realm of] public relations about it My feeling is that the Desk needs a little maneuvering room But I suspect, looking at it over a time horizon and given the uncertainty in the money supply, that it is a question of whether people want to make a decision now that the federal funds rate should be at any particular point I don't know whether explicitly for the next day or two, 19 percent gives the Desk the maneuvering room On the other hand, I am not crazy right at the moment myself about making a decision that the 18 percent limit should be raised until I see at least the following week's money supply data, given my sense that the trend may be changing here That may be wrong and we may well have to raise the rate But I don't know precisely how much maneuvering room the Desk needs at the moment I hope it is    12/05/80  not too much, but I don't want to have the Desk unduly inhibited either  Governor Teeters just came in Let me just catch her up to date The latest information is that the federal funds rate at the moment is at 18 percent, but it had been over 20 percent earlier in the day So I don't know It is not at 19 percent at the moment anyway  Well, I would be concerned if I thought it was going very high I am a little less concerned [given] the most recent trend--that [the market] is [not] fixing a 20 percent rate in its mind What I meant to imply is that the Manager knows the general limit is still 18 percent And while that is being suspended, he is [to be] within the limits of what is feasible on the path He is [to be] a bit tender with the market this week, if that answers your question  At the moment it looks as if we have done all we have to do  I don't know where [we were] You raised a question of clarification, Governor Partee Do you have anything further to add?  No, I didn't mean to imply that in the context of where we are But I'd hate to say 19 percent is just the right number  Yes I think we probably won't have to face that question until the next Committee meeting at the earliest I think we are really talking about the degree of leeway we have on the up side during what we hope is a period of transition here It's hard to believe that those numbers would come in so low in the next two weeks that-- You know, the optimist would say that under those conditions the federal funds rate would settle in the 17 to 18 percent area I don't think we are talking about anything lower than that in this time period And one has to be optimistic even on that score, but that's what we will know next week  That is what the current directive says  Well, I will explain it to you as best I can I think it is rather interesting that perhaps for the first time in some time we seem to have a real split in evaluations of the Reserve Banks [regarding the appropriate level for the discount rate] Some of them felt pretty strongly that it should not be moved and others felt very strongly that it should be moved Some of that flavor was reflected in our own discussions, and I think it's inherent in the kind of situation we are in It was a question of balancing the risks of overkill, as it's sometimes put, against the risks of underkill, as it is also sometimes put In favor of doing it was the fact that the aggregates as of the moment are still running high and that this sense of things perhaps turning may or may not be real Even if it is real, the fact of the moment is that now the aggregates are high and if they continue high, those problems of credibility and so forth that you people keep telling me about are there We are at a very sensitive stage in terms of what has happened in the past in terms of credibility and the current inflation problem and all the rest So that was balanced against the risk of either appearing to contribute too harshly to a business downturn or even the possibility, which begins to glimmer in one's eyes, that the money supply might actually go down--and that it might actually go down faster than one wants to see it go down That case is far from proven, but those are the two balancing factors And I suppose the decision reflected the fact that there was a feeling that there was a greater risk of [overshoot] rather than [undershoot]  Well, and I speak for myself, we weren't looking for any great announcement effect And if the money supply is    12/05/80  turning--but that's an if--there's a hope that there wouldn't be all that much interest rate effect If the money supply is not [turning] for that or any other reason, we would get an interest rate effect But if the money supply really turns, maybe the interest rate effect won't amount to much because we can relieve the borrowing pressure That is precisely the reason I put this decision today the way I did, as "in the wake of the immediate impact" [of the discount rate increase] I don't want to prejudge that issue And we do have this immediate market reaction type of thing We will give it a week to see whether it settles down; that is what I am saying  Yes, but [we are not] preventing it from going up at the moment, although the market is being treated cautiously That's--  Well, I don't know what steps you are proposing, because I don't know where the rate may fluctuate in the next few days All I am saying is the kind of consideration that you are raising seems to me one that would appropriately be considered in the middle of next week when we see whether it is necessary or whether it isn't  Well, if we set a limit of 19 percent, presumably [Peter] is going to go out there and defend 19 percent fairly precisely at the moment and I am not sure that is a good thing  That's right But [if] it is already at 20 percent over the weekend, I don't know whether [a limit of] 19 percent means that he would have to go down to 18 percent after the weekend if we adopted a strict construction--  You have The proposal is to take it off with a caveat that it is treated tenderly for one week  Who haven't we heard from?  Governor Rice has not said--  Has anybody not been heard from?  Governor Teeters has not been heard from [except] in asking a question  You mentioned a vote I'm now talking to the Secretary There seems to be a consensus; do we also need a vote? I think this has to be in the record For general matters of explanation it should be in the record, but also for the reason Tony mentioned We can have a vote We can either have it now or we can try to write this down in a sentence or two and send it around in a telegram for a vote I can try to phrase it now and we might as well have a vote But let me see what the Secretary says about this  I have no problem with having a vote; it may be appropriate Let me just try to formulate something orally to see whether it comes close enough to capture the spirit of this so we can have the vote now instead of waiting for a telegram vote I would propose, in the light of the uncertainties surrounding the immediate reaction to the discount rate change and the questions as to market reaction in the ensuing days, that the open market Desk be given latitude to pursue a reserve target without its operations being confined by the existing 18 percent limitation [on the funds rate] in the directive, pending further consultation if necessary--if in fact the rate is exceeded in the middle of next week  Don't pin me down on whether the [consultation] is Wednesday or Thursday What I have in mind is that I'd like to get a look at which direction the money supply is going in and we won't know that until the middle of next week some time  Probably Thursday is what we are talking about So basically this is carrying us through this statement week  I am not quite sure I understand that If you went all the way and said we should permanently take off the limit, then I think you would be making a real postural change I'm not sure what the postural implications are to go to 19 percent, say, if that turns out to be constraining this week  -12-    12/05/80  I think we are probably ready to vote if I have sufficiently or adequately conveyed [the sense] of the sentence that would appear in the Committee's record Mr Altmann, do you want to call the roll?  I will be interested to see how the dissents read  Yes  Yes  Well, I don't know quite what you mean by "some depth" I would anticipate a fairly considerable discussion that would extend over some period of time I think the discussion can be a little wider--more free ranging--at this stage than it probably can be at the [following] meeting when we are going to bore into a very specific decision So if anybody has radical thoughts,  -13-    12/05/80  you certainly ought to bring them up at that meeting and we can let our minds roam a bit and have a kind of philosophical debate I think there are real questions here We face the problem next year--and I just don't know what we should do about it--regarding the meaningfulness of the M-1A and M-1B targets Abstracting from that, I have a few ideas of my own on presentation that I am looking at; it's purely presentational, but it is interesting I am sure that no presentation can solve the problem of judging the uncertainty about M-1A and M-1B and their meaningfulness  In that connection, I might say that the banks have gotten quite excited about this decision of the DIDC--for the same reason that we didn't like it much--to have the same rate on transactions balances as on savings deposits for commercial banks They have visions dancing around in their heads that all their savings deposits are going to turn into NOW accounts And they don't like it because it will cost them a 12 percent reserve requirement But apart from that, it certainly is going to make those M-1B figures look funny We may have to have a target of 32 percent for M-1B next year!  Well, that is one of the things I think we ought to be looking at at this next meeting Do we end up with the conclusion, whether we like it or not--maybe some people like it anyway--that we have to put more weight on M2 and M3? I don't know; it is a very difficult subject  Governor Partee was just saying maybe we have to follow an M-1B plus savings accounts kind of figure But the trouble with that is that savings accounts have been going down so precipitously that--  I haven't got an answer, but we ought to be thinking about it before the next meeting Any other questions or comments? I guess the answer to your question, Larry, is that I would use the term "in depth" [to describe the nature of our discussion next time] I would not assume, obviously, that we have to zero in on the exact [growth rate] percentage of a target But we ought to try in a preliminary way to clear out as much of this underbrush, if that is what it is, as we can, so we have the issues clearly in our minds and have some possible approaches for dealing with them  Okay, that's it if nobody else has any questions or comments Thank you  END OF SESSION  -14-     Why don't you bring us up to date, Mr Axilrod  And you have a downward revision for last week  And the published figure for the 26th was what?  What are the November figures?  For M-1A and B?  I think it would be correct [to say] with those M-1A and M-1B ranges that they would both be about 1/2 percent above for the year  On the international batting average, that probably puts us at the top  SPEAKER(?) Right  Mr Sternlight, do you want to add anything about the market?  Mr Truman, do you want to review international markets briefly? Or Mr Pardee can do it I'm sorry, I forgot [you were here since we're] on the telephone Out of sight, out of mind Mr Pardee  I would only add, as was implied by some of these other comments, that I think it goes beyond that There is somewhat of a "fin de guerre" developing in some markets, reflected in part in commodity markets We have such a strong and stable system of financing commodities and commodity speculation now that when the price declines and retraces in a week the price increase of the previous three months, people wonder whether [investors] can meet margin calls And they are substantial All sorts of rumors-- unwarranted rumors I trust--began floating around those markets yesterday The gold market, as you know, is down substantially in the face of the Polish news and continuing unrest in the Middle East and all the rest--factors that we ordinarily think would raise the gold price And commodity markets are down basically by limit amounts in successive days across the board I think it's also fair to say with all this [churning] in the money market, that the banks are beginning to get a little worried I don't think a bank is [unintelligible] alone for months They are all beginning to wonder where they are This movement in the CD market reflects a rather sudden concern as to whether they really can fund themselves and they want to take out a little insurance But the market rates have a certain life of their own at this point--or did up to this morning anyway--reflecting psychology rather than the normal relationships that one would expect between borrowings and federal funds rates and other rates There is a lot of talk about the prime rate at the moment Of course, with this rapid movement in short-term rates, it is below its normal relationship with market rates by a significant amount I don't know whether the banks will [hold] off on changes for a while, pending some feeling [that things will] settle down, or whether they will be impelled by their current fears to move rather earlier and by sizable    12/12/80  amounts I just don't know I don't know whether anybody else has any comment on the developing situation  Right Anybody else have any comments? Well, my proposal under the circumstances will be very simple We are meeting next week And we took an interim flexibility action I would propose that we act with discretion during this period, try to meet our reserve objectives but balance operations a little in terms of what is going on in the market at the moment, without putting any formal limit on the federal funds rate That seems to me to continue to be appropriate until we see how this market develops in the next week I say that because I don't like to put a precise limit on the federal funds rate in these circumstances because on particular days it can obviously move in an exaggerated way On the other hand, I think we need a little leeway from necessarily following a fully mechanical target under these conditions if the more frantic developments did seem to be breaking out in this market Last week we successfully accomplished this without deviating much from what would have been normal practice In fact, we came out within $30 million or something like that of the borrowing target We came out with a higher federal funds rate, I suppose, than would have been anticipated, but not all that much higher We were not guided by a precise limit on the rate, and I think that was helpful So that would be my proposal--just to carry over for another week until we meet again on Thursday afternoon  Yes, I think we will record that at this meeting we just extended the authority given last week  SPEAKER(?) Until the next meeting  Until the next meeting--or until the directive is changed, presumably Do I assume we have [a consensus]? Oh, wait a minute, we [haven't heard from] the people here at the table  SPEAKER(?) Yes, it's all right with me  SPEAKER(?) Okay  Governor Teeters wants a low limit on the federal funds rate, I guess So we're 11 to 1, I think, without having to call the roll again  10 to 1? Who's missing?  Oh yes, Governor Wallich is missing That's right [We're through] unless someone has something else to say I might mention, as I am sure is clear to all of you just from reading the newspapers, that the retail sales figures came in strong We also have some figures, so far as the survey is concerned--I don't know what the reality is--that show a stronger outlook for plant and equipment spending in the early part of next year If we take the retail sales figures at face value, I suppose it solves part of the mystery of why production seems to be rising faster than sales while everybody reports not much inventory [overhang] We will go over this in considerable detail at the meeting, I am sure, but I understand that under the circumstances GNP is expected to be higher in the fourth quarter than previous projections indicated Is that a fair comment, Mr Kichline?  I think it explains quite a bit about the pressure on the money market and the money supply I might say just for the record that the money supply estimate Steve gave you for December is based, obviously, upon projections for the second half of December I personally attach very little weight to it at this point It could be higher or lower They do assume an increase in the second half of December rather than a decline or this evenness  The last two-thirds of December is estimated We only have a preliminary number for the 10th, so in that sense it's even more than that  SPEAKER(?) It's three-quarters  Well, two-thirds I stand to be corrected here, but I think I'm right that the current level for the 3rd and the estimated level for the 10th is a hair below the November average  Actually, that makes it appear in this estimate that we are within 1/4 percent or so of the--  It is just that we are in the neighborhood of 1/2 point or so from the top of the range, if we don't get a big burst in the December data We always have these ifs, but they can't change [unintelligible] unless we get another $9 billion item I have been [surprised] by these figures too many times to say anything! Okay Thank you very much  END OF SESSION     I suppose we are on agenda item 1, which is approving the minutes Mr Altmann wants to make a comment  Do you want to discuss your negotiations, Mr Pardee?  Are there any questions about that? If not, we can have a motion to approve the minutes  Without objection they are approved    12/18-19/80  They are not all approved in that motion?  I will interpret that motion as including the minutes for all the meetings we've had  [Next on the agenda is a] discussion of foreign currency operations A memo was distributed that I believe you have seen Do you want to give any introduction, Mr Truman?  I am not looking at the agenda, I guess  Well, let's do that first  I thought all these German marks we were buying were going to the Treasury  I thought we weren't using it Well, is there any discussion about this?  That's $5 billion at the moment  Are there any other questions or comments?  What is the dollar/mark exchange rate today?  Mr Winn  Why don't you defer that question until we get on the general subject of holding currencies Any other comments or questions on operations? If not, we need a motion  SPEAKER(?) So moved  Without objection they are approved Do you have any recommendations, Mr Pardee?  We are then to the general questions Why don't you tell us where the US government stands on numbers anyway, Mr Truman  Why shouldn't the Treasury take some of these currencies, buy back the SDRs, and repay the IMF drawings?  Except by other countries' drawings?  Are we in the super-gold tranche?  We don't call it a super-gold tranche anymore?  When you're out of the super-gold tranche, is it still considered a tranche?  Up to 25 percent--a quarter?  -6-    12/18-19/80  There is no distinction between the two then?  SPEAKER(?) Even for Chrysler?  Well, we have a memorandum describing some considerations here It has been a while since I read it The United States government, in one interpretation, is in a balanced position That's the way the US Treasury looks at it, anyway I suppose the only thing one could argue about is whether to include the IMF drawing in that or not We are close to the top of the limit we set We still have $2 billion [leeway], roughly, on the warehousing [facility] I don't know if the Treasury feels too strongly about who holds the currency, but I think their view--just to put one view on the table--is that we ought to continue operating pretty much as we have been up until several billion more at least The theory is that it doesn't hurt--or to put it more positively that it may be desirable --to have positive currency holdings against an uncertain future, which raises the question about our currency limit and conceivably the warehousing limit But that is their feeling about it The exchange market may be close to a turning point depending upon what happens on our interest rates What happened last time [is that], as soon as interest rates turned, the dollar went down quite sharply for a while, just on the mere fact of a turn in interest rates even though all during that period, except maybe at the very end, there was a positive differential in favor of the dollar By the time the positive differential disappeared, if it ever disappeared, the dollar had stabilized The movement was mostly on the turn, reflecting the fact that there is some expectation that the dollar will get stronger so long as they see interest rates going up And as soon as they see [the differential] going down, the expectation turns around almost regardless of where the level is I don't know what is going to happen, obviously But that is an operational issue posed for us When I looked some time ago at the foreign currency directive, or wherever these instructions are, I thought perhaps it could stand some rewriting But I don't think that would have to be done in any event, if it is done at all, before we look at this in terms of these general directives And there is nothing in here that is inconsistent with what we are doing or have done I'll open up the floor for comments  Well, we obviously think we have the legal authority to do it or we wouldn't be doing it I think that issue was thrashed out and resolved in the early 1960s when these swaps first began The specific legal authority is in the [Federal Reserve] Act, which says specifically that we can hold foreign currency balances I don't think it says much about what purpose we can hold them for As I remember it's silent on that I don't know whether Mr Peterson or Mr Oltman or somebody else who was around at the time wants to comment on--    12/18-19/80  This was all done with the knowledge of the Congress, of course; it was developed at that time with the Treasury The Treasury had pressed the Federal Reserve to do it in the first instance But it was all agreed to by the Congress; they were fully aware of it  Haven't we been doing it for 20 years? And our holdings now probably are as big as they have ever been, aren't they? We have had a bigger negative position on numerous occasions This is as big as they have every been on the positive side And there's no question about the Treasury's authority to be agents in these transactions either There is a long record, too, in connection with all of this--I want to attempt to be precise about the words though it has been worded in different ways at different times-- that it has always been pretty clear that these operations are done in conjunction with the Treasury And The Treasury has a particular responsibility in the Gold Reserve Act of 1933, or whatever the name of the Act is, for international financial operations It has never been pinned down as a precise legal matter, but there are various understandings that have gone on through the years  Well, I don't know where what you call the formal limits are [located] They don't seem to be in this directive  They are in the annual authorization that we set down It's primarily a procedural matter The annual authorization sets down some general limitations, but there's a feeling that Mr Pardee shouldn't go off on his own and operate within the general limits in the authorization but that he should be pinned down more closely as an operating matter That accounts for the emergence of what you call the informal limits, with the Foreign Currency Subcommittee having certain authority in that respect  Well, as you said, they are not exactly informal, they are procedural  The procedural limits are what you are calling the informal limit?  When you say informal, are those recorded [votes] or not?  We have three types of limits We have the limit on the overall authorization, which is [voted on] annually; we have procedural limits, which are in the procedural document and cover occasional and particular problems; and we have had discussions where we have informally set limits within those other limits  But those are tactical decisions, essentially I believe we're clear now on the various types of limits that are in [place]  There's no question that it's binding; it's not going to be changed without another action  Well, that is one of the issues basically before us And I'm not sure I don't have any answer for all time In approaching that question in a rather tentative way, the Treasury did some calculations and looked at the swings in interventions basically I forget just how they did it; I think it was the gross swings in intervention over the period since 1973  If they're in the paper, you can look at them there They show that the swings have ranged, on a couple of occasions, up to $8 billion  We actually got $8 billion in debt, or very close to it, because we were starting from a zero balance--I was there--on only one occasion It was up to $8 billion and another time it was not very far from it, I think  Yes, '78 was one of the big ones What page are you on?  I'm looking at table 5, but I don't see an $8-1/2 billion total  When it's a plus that means we were buying them?  Minuses are buying, okay So that's $84 billion we sold Then there's a previous period of $82 billion  -10-    12/18-19/80  That's what I was looking at  So, looking at these figures--there's nothing very scientific about this--they say we've run into fluctuations in both directions of [up to] $8 billion And if you consider a normal position at zero, in some sense, it seems natural to be willing to hold at least $4 billion I'm talking net now on the theory that if we ran into another $8 billion drain, it would take us from a plus $4 billion to a minus $4 billion Therefore, $4 billion sounds like a nice figure not to worry about  Yes, they are saying on a net basis--  Yes, starting from this net position that they interpret as roughly zero They are not saying to go to $4 billion necessarily In this version we don't go out to acquire balances We operate more or less the way we've been operating and deal with disorderly or erratic markets as it seems appropriate We are willing to do that more or less the way we have been, within that kind of framework That's one possible approach  Mr Balles  Would you like to comment on that suspicion, Mr Truman?  Governor Wallich   -15-    12/18-19/80  The fact is that they don't intervene That much [is true]  Governor Partee  We don't have any big stake at the moment  Well, your comments are relevant looking toward the future  But we don't have a net position  No, wait a minute The Treasury isn't covered The United States is even There is no extension there  One can argue about the drawing, but I--  Including your own?  I'll strike that  Mr Morris  You've [unintelligible] yourself  Do you have any comments on these observations, Mr Pardee?  I don't know what you mean  We have the swap agreements now The question that is being raised is whether to rely entirely on them when we're going to be on the selling side of the market When selling foreign currency, do we want to go immediately into debt, which is the implication of relying entirely on a swap?  Well, it just comes back to the points that Tony was raising I think the most important point is that [without foreign currency reserves] we do lose flexibility No question We've had a lot of arguments with the Germans over the years when we were dependent upon them and they were telling us how much of the swap we could use  I'm not even sure it's true  In an area where one purpose blends into another at times, I think we ought to be as clear as we can be on what we have been doing In particular, I think those three sentences [describing the purposes of intervention] at the top of page 2 are a good characterization For a long time, we have presumably followed number 1, which might be quite episodic I think irregularly on both the up and the down side, we have paid some attention to number 2 So far as number 3 is concerned, the only clear incident of that was on the down side in November '78 And one could raise the question whether it isn't appropriate now in the [other] direction, but nobody has argued that case I almost would be inclined to argue it at times, but I don't think intervention is all that powerful in affecting some of these things in most instances I'm not raising that issue, but I just want to be clear that [late 1978] is the only time I think it has been raised and has been followed as a matter of national policy I don't think that was at all inappropriate But I don't think there has been any question of pegging all during this period I don't think that's at issue on anything we are talking about at the moment Obviously, we don't have to set down a policy that is good for all time, and it's very hard to do so in this area because conditions change  Specifically, we are in a situation where the Treasury, unless we want to change our minds, has access to something like $2 billion through the warehousing facility We are pretty close to the top of the so-called informal limit that we set for ourselves on marks I think the diversification point that a number of people have wondered about is a reasonable one, but the market is basically a mark market And we're stuck with it to a degree, although it's worth thinking about that a bit I would guess, but I could easily be wrong, that we are nearer to the top of any dollar rate than the bottom of any dollar rate I could be wrong--if the Russians march into Poland and our interest rates take another sizable increase or whatever But I'm not sure how much more room we are going to need I just did some arithmetic and, if I exclude the Fund drawing--if I don't calculate that the way the Treasury did--we are just over $1 billion long in marks  -21-    12/18-19/80  SPEAKER(?) That can disappear in 3 days  That's right; that's not terribly much I would think if you're persuaded by the general arguments presented and [agree with] what is clearly the Treasury policy at this point, it probably would be wise to increase this limit, let's say, by a billion dollars What's the limit we have in the other currencies now? There is a limit on yen, isn't there? Is it $500 million?  I don't think it hurts right at the moment to have the individual limits Now, as I understand it anyway, nobody is talking about buying currencies for the sake of building a war chest It is all a by-product of what we're doing for other purposes; and it does govern the flexibility we have for intervening for other purposes We don't have much room for buying any more marks for our own account, if we don't raise that limit  Yes, we can't buy yen now unless we really adopt a different policy that says we want to build up a war chest in yen That would involve just going into the market for the sake of buying yen I don't think we want to raise that issue today That is not to say that if the yen turned weak, we couldn't buy some But I don't think we want to buy it when it's strong  We did and we were, I think  I don't want to make it $8 billion, but I want to remind you that $4 billion is smaller than $8 billion Somebody should be looking at the foreign currency directive and the other [foreign currency instruments] anyway before the March meeting, and I think that might be an appropriate time to look at any of these limits I accept the other arguments I'm just saying as a practical matter that we ought to give ourselves enough leeway to operate on a continuing basis now; looking forward, so far as I'm concerned, if the conditions were right, we could raise those limits if it became necessary But I don't think we have to raise them so dramatically now that they would probably be bigger than what's necessary, or in some sense desirable I would propose for the moment that we raise the mark limit by $1 billion; we can raise it further if you want to, but I'd be satisfied with that I think we have enough leeway in the other [limits] should conditions change Against the background that these general considerations are persuasive, and recognizing that [the current limits] are low in terms of the numbers that some people have suggested, we can have an understanding that if it's desirable, we'd look at it again either in terms of the warehousing or the System's [overall] limit itself But I suspect that just raising the [mark] limit by $1 billion is probably enough to take care of this for a foreseeable time period  No, definitely not No, this implies no change in policy in the exchange markets at all as I see it Now, it may involve some modification of policy in another sense in that we may end up holding more balances than we have ever held before But it doesn't imply any operational change in terms of what has been happening in the exchange market It implies that we're willing to give the Desk enough leeway to continue the kind of [operations] they have been doing, that's all  I don't know what "the total" is Which limit is that? I thought the overall [limit] was $8 billion  By putting on these special limits, we have caused ourselves a bit of a problem in that sense Obviously, if we raise the mark [limit], just to conform we have to raise the overall limit we now have, which seems to be expressed excluding yen That is $2 billion, which implies we have $500 million for other [currencies] of which we only have what--about $200 or $230 million or something?  Right That is correct  I doubt it at this point  I don't think there's any particular purpose in stating it that way now, but we better be careful about what we're doing If we change it, what would you [recommend]? We could change the overall limit to $35 billion including yen, I guess Right? Is that the arithmetic implication?  Including the repayment of swap drawings  Well, I think the consideration raised is a relevant one I feel less eager--I've never felt eager about intervening anyway--but there was the excuse of repaying the debt, which the Treasury felt very strongly about, complementing the other reasons That reason is gone And if the Germans don't want to intervene, that affects the eagerness with which I want to intervene as well So that has an influence on the [issue] Consistent with our past practice, do any of these limits have to be written down and voted on, Mr Altmann?  I think we ought to have a subcommittee, whichever the appropriate one is, look at this directive Among other things, they can straighten out these [limit issues] The simplest thing to do is to leave everything the way it is at the moment so we don't find out that we are doing something we don't intend But we do have to [raise the limit on] the total as well as the mark, I think, to be consistent here So, we would have to raise the [informal] overall limit ex yen to $3 billion and the mark limit to $25 billion That leaves [the framework] exactly the way we have it with the implication of another $1 billion in marks, which I think is what we intend at the moment as a kind of holding action here until we  -25-    12/18-19/80  straighten all this out If that's agreeable, and I don't hear any opposition to it, we will just assume that I also judge just as a matter of guidance that should something happen--I would guess that this amount is adequate, but it's a very uncertain world--we would have to discuss it if we want to go above this amount; but I don't hear strong [views] that that's an impossibility Given the circumstances, [that issue] might arise  Well, I think we ought to be clear on this I want to make it as much as possible dependent upon a constraint of the Exchange Stabilization Fund because it could be construed as a form of Treasury borrowing from the Federal Reserve which isn't covered by the other prohibitions on their borrowing We need the justification that it is the Exchange Stabilization Fund's lack of assets, not a general lack of funds on the part of the Treasury, that gives rise to this  I had not recalled that this had been explained to the Congress, but you [say it has]  It's in the public record, I take it  The Treasury is aware that we want a justification in terms of the ESF capacity to hold [these funds], not just that they find it convenient to park them with us  They have given us a rationale as to why they have to warehouse this in terms of the capacity of the ESF I think we have to insist on some reasonable rationale for that Okay, with that understanding, we will proceed and Mr Kichline will talk about the economic scene  We have a bit of a timing problem as well as a great big substantive problem We're going to have to terminate the meeting at 530 pm or shortly before I don't know how far we will be able to go on this whole matter of next year's targets at this time and I'm not sure it's desirable to go too far As a technical matter, can somebody inform me if these targets we present for next year are supposed to be consistent with the plans of the old Administration, not the new Administration, as I assume? Is that correct as a technical matter when we write the Humphrey-Hawkins report?  SPEAKER(?) I think that's probably right  That may be the technical requirement, but it has a certain air of unreality about it The reality is that one would like to know something a little more definitively about the  -27-    12/18-19/80  plans of the new Administration before we make up our minds on this in a final way It may not be useful to talk in anything other than quite general terms The very general question it seems to me is what kind of strategy anybody has to achieve satisfactory economic conditions consistent with a decline in the inflation rate and how that balance is reached under unknown factors, budgetary and otherwise Views of the economic outlook get mixed in that, but I think it may be desirable to discuss the economic situation in that very broad policy context as well, which leaves me in a slight dilemma as to what to do yet this afternoon If I let Mr Axilrod talk, he's going to say that [his comments] will result in using up the time, I presume Maybe that's just as well  No, I'm not suggesting that I'm just saying that I don't think we can be very definitive about it On this schedule we would open the meeting tomorrow morning with that discussion  When are you expecting to have something for us on that, Mr Axilrod?  Does that mean that it's all going to be sprung on us that day or are you going to distribute something in advance or what?  Well, we also face some uncertainties We are very close to the point, which is relevant even to our short-term decision, where these numbers are going to go all over the lot presumably It's conceivable that we may need another meeting here in January I don't know that we have to decide that, but it may be a good idea to keep that in mind for a variety of reasons  I haven't thought of it Let me say that I hope it's not necessary You still have time, Mr Axilrod, so why don't you proceed and then we will start with a mixed discussion of  -28-    12/18-19/80 -29-  what the general tenor of policy might be in the light of comments on the economic and inflationary situations  I will be looking forward to all your comments tomorrow  We had an introduction to our problems yesterday I'd like to go around and get comments It would be useful if people commented on their proposals in relation to how they see the business scene and what they think they are accomplishing-- what the implications of their proposals are in that respect We obviously don't have to settle, and I don't intend to settle, what the targets should be next year They inevitably will be influenced by the larger setting in which we find ourselves with respect to fiscal policy and other matters, which is somewhat uncertain at this time, as well as what approaches are going to be taken in other directions psychologically and really But it might be interesting to see how people reconcile our various concerns at the moment not only against the background of the real economy, but the rather enormous technical problems we will have in knowing what the M1 numbers will mean, in any event, for some indefinite period of time Mr Morris  Let me just interject I don't know how the staff arrived at that conclusion I have not seen the analysis, and I'd want to look at it fairly closely; I think we all would  There's a cyclical element in Ml, as we saw this year  Well, let me say that this is going to bear more analysis  When we are going through it, I don't think we are aware of it  Part of the trouble is that we can cite that as a target but it's an abstract notion; and we will not know, even when we get the data, what the adjustment should be  That's right, but one can argue quite realistically that we haven't got much of a target because nobody knows what it is, including us Now that may be an advantage, but I don't think we ought to give--  Well, I don't think that helps either, if I may say so [I don't know] how long this [conversion to NOWs] is going to take, but the reserve growth is just an image of the Ms And to the extent the Ms are distorted, the reserves are distorted I don't think we can escape the problem We can make it different visually  But it blends them in some proportion of their actual change, which is subject to all the [uncertainty]  I understand that, but let me just take a minute We have a lot of people to talk yet What do you see going on in the economy? What are you trying to accomplish, particularly when you say these targets should be tighter? What do you visualize? [The staff says] we're going to have an expansion Do you want an economic expansion? Are we going to affect inflation? What are we going to do?  -32-    12/18-19/80  No, but I obviously have to decide to wind this up somehow  Things overlap, obviously, but looking at the year as a whole, give us some indication of what you conceive of as the appropriate strategy of the Federal Reserve and what that means Let me put it specifically If you accept the analysis of a very tight money supply figure or if you make a proposal of a money supply figure, I would be interested in knowing whether you are willing to accept the consequences or see as a consequence of that extremely high interest rates, perhaps higher than we have now Do you not mind if we have a recession, all things considered, if that's the price we have to pay? Is that what you're talking about or not?  Mr Black  What do you mean it's not a very restrictive policy? If I may pursue that, on your own chart the midpoint of the new range you have--I don't know what that growth rate is, but it looks like 2 percent a year or something--  Well, given what has happened, all I can say is that we have had no real growth in GNP this year We've had a money supply increase of 6 percent or thereabouts and we have ended up with 20 percent interest rates What interest rates are you going to end up with, Mr Black?  I'm not talking about the next three months; I'm talking about the year as a whole  You think that's going to affect the federal funds rate?  Mr Roos  If I may just interject a comment, my perspective may be somewhat different I am impressed by the number of comments I hear along the lines of "If this is what dealing with inflation means, I'd rather have inflation"  Mr Balles  How do you conclude that?  Just to repeat [The actual number] is not going to tell you, from anything I know, where the money is coming from There is no way we can know We can make guesses  We will ask According to the ones we've talked to, the most they can tell us, if they tell us accurately, is that they understand they have a frequency distribution ranging from 10 percent to 90 percent out of transactions balances, which makes me a little suspicious about what data we are getting The most they can tell us is where the check came from to establish the account That doesn't tell us what the ultimate substitution is It may give us a clue, but I am very suspicious when those results come in over such a wide range as they do As I understand it, they have made an estimate of 2/3rds from the sample of banks that literally ranged from 10 percent to 90 percent in one direction or another; the arithmetic average came out to around 2/3rds on the initial deposit But that is not a statistic which fills me with enormous confidence  No one else can tell either I fully agree with that Nobody else can tell any better than we can  Yes The logic of that is impeccable, but the only trouble is that there are a lot of independent influences on  -39-    12/18-19/80  savings deposits that make them unstable If it weren't for that, then we'd have a fairly easy answer  Pretty unstable Savings deposits have been going up and down a helluva lot in the past year If that weren't going to be unstable, then I think you'd have a good answer  I hate to make this even more complicated, but I am afraid it is pretty complicated What the banks are fearful of, given a decision to make interest rates on NOW and ATS accounts the same as those on savings deposits, is that they are going to get a massive shift from savings deposits into ATS and NOW accounts because from the standpoint of the customer there is no disadvantage to it And the banks don't like it, of course, because their reserve requirement is higher when the customer makes that shift I don't know whether that's going to happen, but we have gotten frantic letters from the ABA and many state bankers' associations saying that they expect that is just what is going to happen They are going to have an enormous exodus from savings deposits into NOW or ATS accounts If that happens, these past relationships may be all off because we haven't had that [particular] relationship before They may not be, but I just don't know  I don't know whether I'd say interest sensitive, but it's going to skyrocket Your solution would take care of that if there were no independent influences working on the savings deposits  I agree  At the present level of market rates this may be the way to hit the target Well, we're complicating the job for you, Mr Balles  Mr Ford  When you say NOWs, do you mean NOW or ATS accounts?  Mr Wallich  -42-    12/18-19/80  Mr Guffey  Mr Rice  Mr Corrigan  Mr Gramley  What have you left out of M2 in there?  Why? I guess I would ask, if you go that far, why would you leave those out?  Governor Schultz  We have a bit of a time dilemma At the rate of speed we are going, we're going to continue this afternoon I haven't any great inclination to speed the meeting up all that much because people have things to say I think we might as well have a coffee break now and continue after the coffee break and we'll see how fast we go after that  [Coffee break]  Mr Winn  -51-    12/18-19/80  What do you mean by that? We shouldn't permit speculative loans?  Governor Partee  Do you want to wait?  It's about the same as M3, isn't it?  Governor Teeters  Mr Solomon  Mr Smoot  Mr Mayo  Mr Baughman, you have the honor, given your status of attending your last meeting, of being the next to the last commentator I have to reserve the right to comment last for myself  Well, the wisest decision we have made is not to arrive at [a conclusion on] these long-term targets and strategies today I suspect we might be here for quite a length of time [if we tried] Many of the problems have been well exposed, with quite different views toward them I took a few notes as [the discussion] went along, so let me try to work my way through these notes and make some points that stand out to me  First of all, I think Governor Partee's point is an interesting one that deserves reiteration We are in completely new territory for the Federal Reserve or for economic policy An implicit assumption that we are just avoiding excess demand is not the present policy We have been put in a position or have taken the position-- wisely or not, but I think probably wisely given the economic conditions--that we are going to do something about inflation maybe not regardless of the state of economic activity but certainly more than we did before in looking at it in the form of avoiding excess demand It is a very important distinction I also think his comment about the English experience is worth reiterating If you want to know about the difficulties of monetarism, look there They have a government with a 5-year lease on life, totally dedicated to the proposition of monetary restraint as the way to kill inflation and totally prepared verbally to take the budgetary measures that they thought appropriate to accompany that They were almost unsuccessful on the budgetary restraint side, and on the monetary side missed a target not by 1/2 or 1 percent but by 100 percent from the midpoint of the target  Well, I was just going to say that they put a lot of weight on one target, [almost] entire weight on one target They have missed it by 100 percent There's a lot of talk about their credibility and missing it by 100 percent, but is there anybody who really [doubts] that if they met that target the British economy would be in a much more serious recession than it is now? Was that wise or not? They might also have less inflation I don't know I'm not saying the experiment will be unsuccessful We will find out about that But I do know that to make what progress they have made on inflation--the British people I talk to are very discouraged, but from 3,000 miles away one can see some glimmerings of hope--they have a very serious internal economic situation They are battling in an attempt to establish their credibility, and we'll see whether they can do it  In that connection, we obviously have a credibility problem-- by "we" I mean the United States--as to whether [our policies] are going to deal with inflation The Federal Reserve is only part of  -61-    12/18-19/80  that larger problem But when we talk about credibility, I think far, far too much emphasis is put on these monetary targets When I listen to people talk about credibility and their discouragement about inflation--and they are plenty discouraged--what I hear about the last year, specifically on Federal Reserve policy when you get away from the money market analysts, is "You brought us to the brink in the winter and we got a little worried We have been through that kind of experience before and in two months it all evaporated and nothing happened" They weren't looking at the money supply decline and saying all the pressures are off the money markets and it's full speed ahead But there are a lot of other examples where Federal Reserve policy repeated [a pattern], as they see it, over a 20-year period, not just this year They thought some results might be seen over the year and after two months the markets were easy again and they said "We shouldn't have worried"  What else did we hear cited? Chrysler A big company gets in difficulty and the government steps in, just as it did a few years ago when New York City got in difficulty What happened this spring-- I, at least, was part of it and I won't implicate any of you--is that we had a calamity in one commodity market People got darned worried about it The Hunts arranged a bail-out in the end We acquiesced in permitting them to do it Why did we acquiesce? Because we were worried about the second biggest brokerage house in the United States, and the biggest brokerage house in the country was not all that far behind And at least one of the biggest banks in the United states was in potential jeopardy Money eased anyway; maybe it wouldn't have happened We came close But the message that people came away with in their minds is not that we came close, but that when we come close somebody steps in to avoid it  I have a wonderful example in the commodity markets in the last few weeks Commodity prices had been going up pretty fast since about July or August People got a little worried in the first half of December and prices went down for two weeks The level went down all the way to where it was in October There was a tremendous loss in the last two months [after the] inflationary gains, and there was almost a panic in the market Those people weren't cheering for tight money at that point They were worried about saving their own skins Now again that has been avoided I don't know what message is carried away from that, and I'm not sure it's over Maybe I'm getting discouraged in one limited sense, but I will say in that connection that when we take on this inflation fighting job--taken on by ourselves or taken on in a broader context--we should not look around for much of a constituency If we, in effect, go to the brink or let some of these things happen that we have not allowed to happen during the entire postwar period, people are not expecting that and they are not going to be very happy if and when it happens And I'm not at all sure that we can change inflationary expectations without it happening That, I think, is the nature of our problem I wish Mrs Thatcher well, but I don't think she has all that much of a constituency in the United Kingdom now She does have a parliamentary majority for the time being  So far as the business outlook is concerned, while I share the view currently that on any kind of analysis one would think we're going to have a downturn of some sort in the economy, I would be a little cautious about too much confidence in just what that is going  -62-    12/18-19/80  to be The economic forecasting ability of the assembled economic wisdom of the United States in the short run has not been notable And I don't know what the increase in GNP will turn out to be in the fourth quarter of this year; we are projecting between 4 and 5 percent If we get a good December, it could be higher than that and entirely out of the range of what any economic forecaster was thinking of three months ago And it will explain a lot about why the money supply has been rising so fast As I say, I share the view that sometime along here we are going to have a decline in economic activity I also think that the experience of the last year, as a number of people here have mentioned, suggests that there is an enormous latent expansionary force in the economy stemming partly from inflationary expectations, as soon as people think they have the money to finance it So, I don't know how far it would go if we really got some easing of the money markets  On the other hand, the opposite danger is sitting there The danger is that if people's confidence that they're going to get bailed out of any serious situation were ever seriously challenged, the sense of panic in this economy could be enormous We have one big company that is sitting on the brink right now, and I'll bet you that 90 percent or more of the people in the country think the government will not let it go down They think in not letting it go down we are [reaffirming their] basic inflationary expectations and expectations that the government doesn't allow that kind of thing to happen They also read into it that there's not much danger of real problems arising, so why should they change their behavior patterns  I was out in Chicago yesterday and I heard two comments at breakfast that are typical of this One banker commented on a conversation he had with a savings and loan executive the night before The conversation apparently went banker to savings and loan executive "Aren't you a little worried about the state of your industry?" They probably should be worried "And how are you behaving?" The answer from the savings and loan executive "I'm behaving perfectly normally, the way I always do, trying to expand my assets because the government is going to come in and bail out the savings and loan industry" The other conversation, instigated by me, was with a banker "What do you fellows think you're doing? You're expanding your assets like crazy in the middle of interest rates rising; you're eroding your capital positions; you're getting more extended on liquidity; and you have every lending officer out there on the road" His answer "I sure do If we get in trouble, the government will protect us" These are attitudes that go a little beyond whether we made or missed our monetary targets In effect, one way of putting it is that they think if there's a clash between the monetary target and a real problem in the economy, we are going to give way, whether we are inside the target or outside the target And they don't translate those targets into their own behavior very readily even if they're fairly sophisticated  In terms of those targets, I feel a little cautious about how much relaxation of pressure we are going to see in the money supply even if we have a little downturn or softness in business activity after the turn of the year That's because, first of all, I'm not sure that it isn't going to be relatively mild We don't have the credit control program we had in force that contributed to the sharp  downturn both in the economy and in the money supply last year We're  -63-    12/18-19/80  process We were talking about budgetary expenditures of $613 billion six months ago I think that was an honest effort They have been affected by the recession in an important way But the last I heard the present Administration is going to be projecting budgetary expenditures of $660 billion or thereabouts That is an increase of close to $50 billion in six months I myself think it would [border on] a miracle, quite literally, if budgetary expenditures in fiscal year 1981 were brought down to that $635 billion level that is sometimes mentioned by the Administration I suspect the way things are going, it will take heroic budgetary measures to hold it to the $660 billion level, after an increase of $50 billion in six months Just to hold the level at which it is now projected may be an extraordinary achievement I'm not sure about that and I'm not sure about what they are going to project All I know is that there's an enormous amount of built-in momentum; and if we casually talk about the economy taking another downturn, it means more unemployment compensation We have succeeded--we, the markets; I'll be careful of my language--in sending up interest costs beyond what I'm sure is already in the budget Defense spending isn't going down; it's going up And there isn't much time left to make savings elsewhere in the budget in fiscal 1981 So when you are looking for help in other directions, you may have to wait a little while I wonder a little about declarations of economic emergency that raise expectations that something is going to happen It's nice and visible [and there may be] results in a visible period of time That's not my decision to make Whether that will be done or not or how it will be couched if it is, I do not know But it all has a bearing on the decision that we finally have to make about how we posture ourselves for 1981 I'm sure I have not succeeded in making it any easier, but we have a lot of things to think about over the next month or two Whether or not we will want a meeting in January, I do not know But I do know we have to make some decision between now and then  Let me outline a possible course of action in principle to you in the interest of perhaps speeding a decision, or maybe we will delay it I do this against a background of an increasing restiveness over the artificiality of our decision-making process in some respects in setting forth these monetary targets for a short period in a framework of very static language in the directive itself There are great advantages in static language on the other hand, so [changing] that is not my principal purpose But, what do we want to do in this particular period? We have a lot of pressure, in terms of interest rates, on the markets How much real pressure we have on the markets I don't know We hear a lot of complaints now I think we are getting a lot of complaints before people are very much hurt, in fact You may think people are hurting now; but if we really do have one of these crises to which I alluded earlier, you haven't seen anything yet  We have all the questions of lags in the process, of overkill and underkill subsequently, and of what happens to interest rates inthe future We have a fair amount of evidence now that the money supply is leveling off after all this pressure And we have all thetechnical uncertainty beginning about 10 days from now, in terms ofwhat those figures are that we are going to be looking at I really have no idea how fast that's going to go I hear what Jerry says onthe one side and I worry about that On the other side, I've talkedto some bankers who think it's not going to go all that fast  -66-    12/18-19/80  initially, just from the inherent sluggishness of people in making changes So we may not see much effect in the figures in the short run I just don't know, but we may begin seeing an effect within the time period we are now talking about It's going to make it very difficult to judge those M1 figures My thought in general is that we might say something [about the fact that] we are now at the meeting before the beginning of a quarter when, in accordance with our normal procedures, we would be setting a target for a quarter with a relationship to a longer-term target We have talked about setting the target in quarterly terms against the background of the annual target but we don't [at this point] have a well-defined annual target, [though] we have these tentative ideas that we talked about earlier It occurred to me that it might be sensible to say that against the background of the tentative ideas we have, we would in a general way be content with and look toward growth during the first quarter consistent with those tentative views We could cite what those tentative views are and say that for the quarter we'd be delighted to be on that path  We have a certain advantage, hopefully, if we are right about what most people expect for the near term, that this ought to be obtainable during this period without any additional pressure on the market Indeed, if I take any of the projections literally, they would be obtainable with substantially less pressure on the market Now, that is combined with the concern--I don't know how widely shared--over the amount of pressure that is on the market now and the lagged effects that might have and all the rest But it does seem to me conceptually that we might say we have a broad objective of being content with a result consistent with those tentative targets for next year I would suggest that we also say that we would be quite content with a lower outcome than that, given that we have been overshooting [our target ranges] most recently So, if we had a decline from what has been a recent overshooting, we would be quite content with that, assuming that occurred in an environment of declining interest rate pressures In other words, I'm not saying we would push for any undershooting of this tentative target; but if it developed out of what has already been done and developed consistent with some easing of market pressures, that would be quite acceptable Finally, on the other side of that dimension, if some undershoot did develop, presumably market pressures would go down and we would permit some reduction of market pressures but we would not aggressively try to get growth up to an annual target for the year That's the other side of the same coin, given that what has been happening most recently has been an overshoot And then I'd put in a federal funds constraint of the type we have been talking about tentatively, one that encompasses this feeling I would think the range would have an upper end around where the funds rate has been most recently or thereabouts, say, 20 percent; and a bottom end of the range consistent with all of this seems to be something like 16 percent Those numbers can be debated  I have written a tentative directive to that effect It tries to encompass that kind of thinking I don't know whether the language is any good I did it in about 3 minutes this morning and Steve tried to make it look a little better I don't know whether it conveys the message or not, but I might distribute it so we will have something to look at and see whether it captures a consensus of the flavor [of our views] or whether it's comprehensible Look at it in that view and, unless this is clearly understood and meets immediate  -67-    12/18-19/80  acclaim, I suggest we go to lunch Maybe it's going to meet such immediate acclaim that we can finish before going to lunch We have to pick up at some point the analysis of what the market has been doing recently and maybe we ought to get that from Mr Sternlight before we discuss this any further I don't know how long your report is, but maybe we ought to do that before lunch anyway Why don't you proceed  Let me say one thing This market has been affected yesterday and today by rumors about the money supply figures One rumor involved whether the figures were affected by this change and/or reserve saving games a couple of months ago, which is the thing that worried me But we haven't been able to identify it in any significant way and we are not making any revisions on that accord [Another rumor is] that there may be a decline in the money supply figure this week I'm very much disturbed that it sounds as if there has been some kind of leak That is just poison in terms of our whole posture in these markets and our credibility as an institution, and I am very much disturbed by it The fact is that we are not going to make changes but we were intending at least to point out that the reserve figures in November were affected by the changes in that reserve game Perhaps it would have been unusual, but maybe we should have made an announcement [earlier] to market people, who have inquired, that that did have an impact on the reserve figures during November That itself could have gotten confused with the money supply figures earlier But as for the rumor suddenly appearing about a decline in the money supply this week, which hasn't been announced yet, I don't know where it came from It may have come from no place, but on top of these other developments it looks like a coincidence that I would be happier not to see I don't know what else I can say  For the money supply this week? I don't know exactly, but I heard something this morning about a couple billion dollars I don't remember whether it's quite that closely identified, but it is a decline of some significance  Can we have a motion to approve these transactions before we forget it?  SPEAKER(?) So moved  -68-    12/18-19/80  Without objection they are approved And I would propose, unless the sentiment is the other way, that we have a quick lunch  So far as I am concerned, we can sit here if you prefer, but--  I am perfectly happy to do that if that--  Well, we were not going to We should have, obviously  Let's try to keep going and see what happens Let's distribute [this draft] I looked at it and the language is not perfect I don't know whether people will even agree with the concept, but let me go over it and tell you what I am trying to convey because the language may not be adequate to convey what I am trying to communicate The whole thing indicates some sense of uncertainty about what the figures will mean in the short run, but the first sentence is simply designed to say that we are tentatively proceeding for this first-quarter period in accordance with our [preliminary long-run] plans [announced] before As I noted, I don't think that raises all the issues as to whether the long-term plan is really the one we want to follow for the year as a whole because of this expectation that the money supply may be a little softer in the near term The second sentence identifies just what that is There is a practical problem These [figures] are cited as the midpoint of those long-term ranges and M2 is probably going to be higher than that So there is a question of whether we want to leave that as the mechanical midpoints of the ranges The next sentence says that we are not going to give a precise figure for M-1A and M-1B right now because we don't know what the NOW and ATS accounts are going to be And it says that's the way we will try to conduct ourselves in terms of the specific job of setting forth the reserve path Then an important sentence is the next one, which says that we want [our short-term targets] to be consistent [with our longer-term targets for] next year, but we are not going to be disturbed by a shortfall That has perhaps some implication that we'd be just as happy if [monetary growth did] fall short of these figures The reservation is that we are not going to [push] for a shortfall by tightening the money market further, but rather that if the shortfall arises in an atmosphere of some relaxation of money market pressures it would be  -69-    12/18-19/80  accepted It's an acceptance rather than a seeking through aggressive tightening action The last sentence is more or less standard, but the numbers are important I would like a phrase in there indicating "over a period of time" or something like that so it doesn't sound as if these ranges are applied rigidly on a day-to-day basis That has always been the understanding So, that is the sense of it; other people may have quite different ideas I'd avoid the term "weekly average;" it sounds rather rigid and we have been over--  Well, the wording of that sentence is difficult This is a little different than the way I had it written, but that proved incomprehensible to Mr Axilrod I think my way had a little less sense that we were expecting [a shortfall] It was mainly that [a shortfall would be acceptable] if it proved consistent or something like that, though I recognize that's obscure Just how that's written is a point of difficulty, I think  Well, you obviously raise an important point It's a substantive point as to whether we do want to avoid further increases in interest rates and also a presentational point that even if we do, do we want to say it this way I don't know which you have in mind As I said, I would put in a softening kind of phrase such as "are inconsistent with fluctuations in the federal funds rate in a general range of 16 to 20 percent"--if that's what it is--"taken over a period of time" or something like that to avoid any implication that we're going to sit on it on a day-by-day basis, whether it's above or below But I don't know whether that helps you very much  So we have a recent precedent, in fact from the last meeting, of 13 to 17 percent This is a substantive issue where the Committee has to express its view I was trying to reflect here what I thought were views on both sides The view that we didn't want to put any more pressure on the market and the view on the other side that we didn't want the rate to get down too far So, that's what I ended up with  I was wondering where you were going to come out because your initial comments about the corn-hog cycle seemed to me consistent with the way I view most of this But you're just saying--  Well, I don't read it quite that way It says the Manager will stay on some reserve path, which is probably-- it's a matter of judgment--now very close to being inconsistent with the present funds rate I think the funds rate is being held up a little by psychological [considerations] right now, perhaps by banks feeling that they don't have such easy access to the discount window after some months  Well, I'd go slowly I don't know what they're thinking There are a lot of misleading rumors in the market at the moment  Well, first of all, I don't conceive of this language as saying he should be guided by the federal funds rate in the short run We're going to sit here and establish some money supply and reserve paths as we did before A larger element of judgment will be involved, if we really think we can't interpret these M-1A and M-1B figures very well But Mr Axilrod will struggle as best he can to see whether we're coming in at or below the numbers cited [in the draft sentence] above, just the way he does now And if those numbers are coming in lower, then presumably the borrowing total will be lowered and the money market [will react]  Well, as I said, that M2 number may not be There's a presentational problem If we put in a higher M2 number in the short run, which is consistent with the projection for whatever that's worth, it also raises a question to the reader of this a month from now--the way it's constructed--about what we're doing with the annual ranges So I don't know what to do with that number; it's a bit of a problem  Have we ever faced that problem before?  But if we hold to that schedule, I suppose the expectational effect won't mean much because we will be coming out very shortly and explaining our targets for the year  It's not a coincidence that this is the same as alternative B because alternative B assumed a path that is the same as our tentative annual ranges, which is what this is saying What it adds up to is that we are not disturbed about a shortfall from the specified--  This does not say a shortfall will be accepted at a 20 percent funds rate It says a shortfall will be accepted if money market pressures are easing It says that quite explicitly  I think this is a lot more straightforward than I would suggest in the ordinary directive It is a little more operational in that sense But if you want to give the Manager instructions that the federal funds rate should be 19 percent next week and 18 percent the following week and 16 percent the following week, that's a quite different kind of instruction It's not the way we have been operating  That's the question you have to decide This is simply designed to reflect the feeling--which I share to a substantial degree--that we wouldn't like to see the funds rate go up a lot more in view of this hog-corn cycle But I'm also reflecting the feeling that a lot of people wouldn't like to see it plunge too precipitously if things get a little weak for a while I don't know how to express that in the directive other than here, if it is the feeling that we want it in the directive We can presentationally say one thing in the directive and have an understanding that it's a little different than that in practice That's another way of doing it, but I--  No, it's until the next meeting  Well, it's subject to review at the next meeting  SPEAKER(?) That's in February  Well, if we don't have a January meeting it would be until--  February 3rd  The target tentatively goes for a quarter, but the operational--  Oh no, I think the federal funds range quite clearly only applies until the next meeting  The history of these federal funds ranges, I will repeat, is that without exception every time we have hit the limits, they have been changed Every time  Well, that depends upon whether the Committee wants to take another look at them That's what we have to tell the Desk  Well, I tried to bring that to your attention recently And that's precisely [the reason for] my restiveness about sitting there and putting down some money supply figure that we have no control over in the short run It's not a very satisfactory policy decision The question comes to What do we do about it? And I think the question that this conversation is posing right now--and there may be differences of views and one way of putting it is that it's related to the borrowing decision--is this  -76-    12/18-19/80  Are you willing to see the federal funds rate stay around or move higher than 20 percent on the one end and are you willing to see it stay around or go lower than 16 percent on the other end? We have to get some consensus on that point, and people's views may differ  Governor Partee has given you what is probably a more elegant expression of that thought  Well, Peter hasn't seen this language before, so let me give him the exact language "Some shortfall from the target ranges would be acceptable in the near term if that should develop in the context of reduced pressures on money markets"  Well, not without a meeting It depends upon what we put in I remind you that every time we've hit one of these [constraints], we have removed it, rightly or wrongly But if I may say so, I don't think it's up to the Manager to interpret this now; it's up to us to tell him what the interpretation should be We could discuss a little more whether [we agree with] Steve's view that the federal funds rate would probably come down if with $15 billion in borrowing the money supply came in a little weak and the judgment was that it was running below this target But my interpretation of  -77-    12/18-19/80  this is that the Desk would move a little more slowly in reducing the borrowing target under those conditions than if we didn't have this reservation that says if interest rates are declining So there would be a reflection in declining interest rates, but that would be moderated in the rate of speed with which the borrowing level was reduced  Those problems clearly exist, but I'm not sure what your operational point is  Do you want to give the staff a guideline  on the federal funds rate and say aim at a 19 percent federal funds rate this week?  Well, I don't disagree with you [but] we ought to discuss what we are talking about for the annual range If you want to say that this time, we've got to put in a higher number for M2, I suspect, if we give any weight at all to the staff forecast It's on page 13, Lyle  Well, that's what I implicitly said Let's not face that today  Just to be clear, if we accepted these kinds of numbers with a 20 percent [upper constraint on the funds  -78-    12/18-19/80  rate]--though Henry doesn't want that--I interpret this to mean that the borrowing number initially is going to be set, with all the uncertainties that exist, at something that is not thought to be inconsistent with a 20 percent federal funds rate or lower It is not going to be set with the idea that the federal funds rate is going to go above 20 percent In making the decision today, we are saying that we are broadly concerned about 20 percent Obviously the operational people should reflect that decision in their target Now, if we want to change that next week or whenever, we can do it But talking about it right now, this week, that's what we're saying  Well, I didn't put 16 percent in there with any thought that it would actually reach that, but who knows  Well, you had some other suggested word changes anyway This language could use a little tuning up just in the sense of smooth reading It has "consistent" in the first paragraph twice and Governor Partee suggests making the first one "associated" He puts in a sense of a longer path before the second consistent, so it reads "In the short run the Committee seeks behavior of reserve aggregates associated with growthover the first quarter along a path consistent with" those targets I had begun changing it to start the sentence with "Abstracting from the effects of deposit shifts" I was looking for whatever language we used in earlier directives when we actually cited the [numbers] here That should be 1981, of course, in the next sentence "Beginning in 1981  -79-    12/18-19/80  the discrepancy between growth in M-1A and M-1B is likely to widen to an extent that cannot [be determined]" That, I think, is an improvement in the language And for the last sentence on the federal funds rate he put "averaging generally between 15 and 20 percent" Apart from the numbers, "averaging" sounds like averaging over the whole period I think that goes a little too far, Chuck  That sounds somehow as if it has a little too much rigidity Weekly average is all right with me, but I would say is consistent with a federal funds rate of whatever range we put in "taken over a period of time" or something like that That conveys the notion that we are not talking about one or two days but about something that seems to be persisting  Well, that language is somewhat different than what we've published before It sounded a little more rigid before, and that's what I--  It's in two sentences It's stuck in as a proviso or understanding "provided that in the period before the next meeting the federal funds rate remains within a range" That, just on the face of it, sounds as if it's a daily thing  Oh, it says weekly average That's how we used weekly average We can go back to the weekly average, but that always sounded a little peculiar to me, in terms of a weekly average coming in precisely above or below--  "Will be reviewed" I think that's fine  If in fact we don't publish this until February, there isn't much locking in; but I think what you are saying is fine I have no problem with it  Yes  Well, the substantive issues--and they are substantive--revolve around the borrowing assumption and the implications of that for the federal funds rate And that's what we can't duck Before we get to that, I don't know what people think about these [monetary growth] numbers Somebody may think these numbers are too high and we should in fact aim for a significantly lower level--not just accept a shortfall but express it as an objective If we do that, it substantially increases the probability, or the possibility anyway, of having to force a higher federal funds rate  I think that is right But consistent with this language and those numbers, which can be changed, we will set a borrowing total that we don't think is inconsistent with what we are saying here Now, we don't know; so, something else could happen  But we are talking, I would say, about a $1-1/2 billion borrowing level, or maybe a trifle lower, particularly if next week's money supply comes in low That probably is consistent with a federal funds rate of 20 percent or less It may take a few days for that to develop, but that is the implication Now, if the next money supply figure or the next two money supply figures came in high, there may be some doubt At some point we may run into an inconsistency, but that's--  Well, let me take it up in order and see whether we have a consensus The first thing is the numbers we mention Forgetting about the special problem with M2 for the moment, is citing something like the midpoint of these tentative ranges too high, too low, or on the mark in terms of recognizing that presumably we will have a clause in here that says shortfalls will be accepted  SPEAKER(?) Just right  Right  SPEAKER(?) These are the figures for the aggregate?  Yes I'll ask another question [later] about the M2 figure I'm talking about citing a figure which as a point of departure is the midpoint of these tentative ranges and implies that that is an acceptable number but shortfalls will be accepted We won't be happy about overshoots How many members of the Committee find that a desirable way to go about it? That's not so many  Well, let me just linger over what is partly a presentational problem on M2 The staff tells us this M2 figure is too low Let me make Henry happy It looks a little funny if we say "broadly consistent with the tentative ranges" and then cite a number that doesn't seem consistent So, we have a bit of a substance versus presentation problem here  We could do that We could use the basic form of the sentence which says that these are the midpoints that we are aiming for but add a clause at the end of the sentence saying "although it is recognized that M2 for a time may run somewhat higher" or something like that  -82-    12/18-19/80  Well, I think we can just barely get by with it this way, even recognizing in substance that it's only one of three numbers and so forth But it is something of a problem  Yes  Well, Murray is pointing out, which I think is fair, that we can mention this point in the policy record We can say that while it's generally consistent, we recognize that M2 for a time may run above [the midpoint] That's one way to handle it  That strikes me as a reasonable compromise, to make sure it's in the policy record but just as a general practice to use the midpoint of the ranges here  Is [your estimate] that high?  I wonder whether it's really going to be that high I was looking at this 8-3/4 percent figure you have; that's because you're projecting a low December, I take it Well, okay We're saying [the Manager] is not going to be too disturbed if it's 10 percent in the short run I wonder if it will be that low in December; we are talking about the period until the next meeting and--  I'm not sure you are talking about 10 percent between now and the next meeting  -83-    12/18-19/80  What makes you think January is suddenly going to jump up if December is very low?  I just have a gut feeling that if December is that low, there isn't a strong basis to think growth is suddenly going to jump up to 10 percent in January, even if you're right for the quarter  I guess what we are implicitly saying is that we are not going to get too disturbed about something in the 8 to 10 percent area, and that will be reflected in the policy record Otherwise we have to use the exact number I take it the shortfall idea is incorporated in here Is that generally acceptable?  SEVERAL Yes  Yes Then we're down to the federal funds rate range; varying views have been expressed I listened to both sides of this and I don't have a better suggestion for you than 16 to 20 percent, but let's look at it differently Let me ask questions What about the upper end of the range? How much consensus is there on 20 percent with language that says "over a period of time" or "weekly average," whichever you prefer? Understand that as before--we have had two recent examples--we have never let these things be binding, for better or for worse I'm not saying that's right, but again I cite the historical experience We have discussed this at frequent intervals recently and we can continue to discuss it if it becomes a problem So with all those understandings, to how many is 20 percent acceptable? That does influence where the borrowing figure is put at the moment  We are thinking of the kind of borrowing figure that Steve is talking about as consistent with that  SPEAKER(?) Initially  Initially, right now  It was $1-1/2 billion, I believe  It would go down if the incoming money supply figures are below the present estimates  I assure you that you've picked up a point to which no substance was attached by the author He has probably written it that way without knowing it But I take it you would prefer it to be written as "If it appears likely during the period before the next meeting that fluctuations in the federal funds rate over the general range of 16 to 20 percent, taken over a period of time, are inconsistent with the monetary and related reserve paths, the Manager will"  Okay If you can detect a difference in that language, I--  Okay  Let me assume the reversal of the language is made Do we have we a consensus on 20 percent for the number to put in?  SPEAKER(?) It's a majority  SPEAKER(?) It's 7  SPEAKER(?) Can we do it again?  We went through that one Let me try the 16 percent on the bottom  1,2,3,4,5,6 Is there a greater number for any other number on the bottom, like 15 percent?  We're about tied, I guess Is anybody for 15-1/2 percent?  I can obviously go either way, but it seems to me that 16 percent has some advantage Well, it's not going to be published for a long time anyway, so maybe it doesn't make much difference But there is some disadvantage in saying that the Committee in the middle of December, when everything was still on the high side, was rather anxiously looking for a great big decline in interest rates I think there is some credibility problem in that direction, too But--  The last range was apparently--  The pattern is very clear if anybody-- people who are so suspicious of us all the time--ever looked at it This range has never bound that hard  Well, we stayed with it for a couple of weeks; it never [presented] a hard conflict We thought we were going to--  But they know where the rate has been all this time; the funds rate is now up to 21 percent  Well, I don't think this is a vital matter, myself  Well, let me try something Everything remains the same, with some changes in language which I don't think  -87-    12/18-19/80  are substantive at all, apart from the ones we've discussed Let me just ask Is your preference to say "taken over a period of time" or "weekly average"?  Let's assume the language says "taken over a period of time"  We have three choices a period of time, a period of days, or weekly average  Let's say "a period of time"--I will interpret that as a series of days--and change the 16 percent to 15 percent We are reversing the language to conform with the way it was before  Unless somebody has a suggestion that he thinks will command [wider] support, I would propose that we vote  I hear no appeals that we have another plan that is going to command wider support I will, therefore, call for a vote  Gee, we didn't have any inflation in those days  SPEAKER(?) It was pretty good  On the whole directive  It's 15 to 20 percent  I have observed the remarks about consultation  Thank you We can go eat  You received a memorandum about the minutes for 1975  Do I have a second?  SPEAKER(?) Second  [Approved] without objection  END OF MEETING  -89-        I think we better get started  In  general outline, I assume we probably will end up spending all  morning, at least, on the so-called technical study  We'll see  whether we complete it this morning  I assume sometime today we will  get to the economic outlook over whatever your forecast horizon is   Assuming we get that far--and I would think we would get that far--we  will have at least a preliminary discussion of the longer-range  targets; I doubt that we will get to the shorter-range targets today   And I think we can defer all the managerial reports and that kind of  thing until tomorrow  So, we will start  We have to approve the  minutes  Do I have a motion?      SPEAKER(?)  So moved      SPEAKER(?)  Second       Without objection, we will approve the  minutes  Do we have anything else we're supposed to do here at the  beginning?  Well, we'll just go to the [new] monetary control  procedure  Presumably, the objective of this discussion is to arrive  at some judgment as to whether or not we're generally satisfied with  the technique that we adopted [in October 1979]--a technique which,  in the short run, emphasizes control of nonborrowed reserves  And we  alter that in the light of what is going on in the money supply or  total reserves  It implies judgmental adjustments in terms of the  multiplier; it implies some kind of federal funds rate band  My own  interpretation of that federal funds band may differ from that of  others, but I don't think it has been, in and of itself, much of a  constraint because every time we [reached the limit] we moved it  On  the other hand, there is some sense inherent in the technique, but  maybe not openly stated, that the way the technique is run doesn't  bounce reserves up and down very sharply depending upon what happened  last week or even last month  There is some sluggishness in  adjustments which in itself presumably has a short-run stabilizing  effect on money market interest rates even though that is not the  stated objective  But it is inherent in the way the technique has  been operated      So, we have to decide whether to continue with that general  technique  And if we don't want to continue with it, somebody has to  put forward an alternative that is desirable in a rather important  way, which I suppose could go the gamut of more emphasis on interest  rates to more emphasis on some stricter or more mechanical reserve  technique  Assuming we want to continue generally with the present  technique, there are a number of questions that arise as to what  modifications might be made as a matter of emphasis, [such as] speed  of the reactions on nonborrowed reserves and some important questions  --which we probably could never resolve today in any event--on the  discount window and discount rate management and the management of  the federal funds rate band  I hope we can come out with some  coherent or incoherent--preferably coherent--conclusion on these  subjects              Let me say something as far as the conclusions of the study  in a more technical area are concerned  I believe that in any  statement I make to the Congress I am going to have to review this  study and pronounce some general conclusions  The most important  conclusion will be whether we want to change the technique, the  question I just raised  But on a somewhat more technical level, my  understanding, subject to confirmation or change during our  discussion this morning--and I may not be comprehensive in this  listing--is that there is no real evidence that on a weekly or  monthly basis the money supply has moved more erratically this year  than before  I think what the study shows is that it looks that way  if you look at the raw figures; but by the time we get finished  seasonally adjusting and revising seasonal adjustments as we did in  earlier years, it's likely to look in a very short-run perspective  about as stable or as unstable as it did before  In fact, there is a  very large random component in the weekly figures and a considerable  one in the monthly figures  So, I take it the study suggested that  it was somewhat of an open question as to whether we had a more  erratic performance in the money supply this year than in earlier  years  If you look at it in a little longer perspective, say,  quarterly, then statistically we did [have more variation]; but  whether that was a reflection of external events like credit controls  and the sharp fluctuations in the economy or whether it had anything  to do with the technique is the open question  As the study put it,  it's certainly not proven that the technique had anything to do with  it      I think all the studies suggest that there is a definite  tradeoff between interest rates and money supply stability  And the  tradeoff assumes rather violent proportions in terms of interest  rates, if we really want to stabilize the money supply  The studies  also suggest that the whole structure of interest rates has been  affected by fluctuations in short-term rates much more than earlier,  depending upon how you look at the studies  So, when we're talking  about fluctuations in short-term rates, at least in the last year,  we're talking about fluctuations in the whole structure of interest  rates  We have not found much evidence of an induced cycle in the  money supply when the procedures [led us to] tighten to force a  decline [in the money supply] and then to ease off to force another  increase  That's an important question  My judgment of what is said  is that there's not much evidence for that  And there isn't much  evidence that short-run--by that I mean quarterly or more than  quarterly--deviations in the money supply have any very pronounced  effect on the economy or on inflation because they are not terribly  important in that sense  Well, those are some of the tentative  conclusions I have drawn from what I have read of these studies, but  they are all subject to further interpretation as we proceed      With that much introduction, I will have Mr Axilrod  introduce the discussion more technically after welcoming Mr Boehne  and Mr Boykin to our council this morning  If you can survive this  meeting, I suspect you will be able to survive any of the future  meetings!  Mr Axilrod      I think it might be helpful if we divide the discussion up into more technical questions at the beginning and then more policy-oriented questions after that In the area of technical conclusions or questions--I didn't bring the information with me--it might be useful if you reviewed some of the results that Mr Lindsey had on the expected short-run instability in the money supply [from the use of] the technique  Dr Burns used to be fond of saying that for a monthly period, four equals eight on the money supply As nearly as I can understand your results, in the present institutional settings, minus 10 equals plus 10  Right, if you're aiming at zero  Except that they seem to be, in fact  Governor Schultz  Governor Partee  Mr Ford  I'm not sure I understand the question  The borrowing is not controlled by the spread; the spread is controlled by the borrowing  Should we go over it once again? We have lagged reserve accounting in the present institutional setting Mr Axilrod and Mr Sternlight are setting the level of nonborrowed reserves That decision sets the level of borrowing The market rate of interest at which that borrowing takes place is determined by the banks, but not the level of the borrowing  You observed that the higher the borrowing, the higher the spread The causation is the opposite way than you are suggesting  Exactly When you look at it from the standpoint of an individual bank, that's the way it looks But how is the total amount of borrowing determined? It's determined by the difference between the reserve requirement and the amount of nonborrowed reserves And when all the individual banks [in some] form or guise come in to borrow and when they've borrowed enough to meet the total reserve requirement, they stop borrowing It looks as if it's your individual [bank's] decision, but it is not It's ours in the aggregate  You do that by the fluctuations in market rates, which are affected by the discount rate The discount rate will affect the level of market rates but not the spread, and that will set in motion the dynamics  And that would bring the money supply down, so it brings down the--  If that varies  Mr Corrigan  Governor Rice  Mr Boehne  Mr Rice  Mr Black  Mr Balles  Mr Morris  Mr Winn  I suspect that the Federal Reserve Bank Presidents may be in a better position to answer that question than Mr Axilrod  Governor Gramley  Governor Gramley  You have a very short comment, Mr Black?  You have a short comment, Mr Balles?  90 seconds  We are not going to have any coffee  What we intend to do is break for lunch at about one o'clock and there will be some food here for the Committee members and the staff  I think we ought to turn to the policy issues There are a lot of issues that can't be covered in a study of this sort Mr Gramley points out that we get just as good control, according to all these studies, by manipulating the federal funds rate The operative question may be whether we are willing to manipulate the federal funds rate in that way I think the main reason we went to another technique is that we probably are not The other point I would observe is the one that Mr Balles was just talking about I don't know about his model, but there seems to be a lot of evidence that there's a pretty good tradeoff here between interest rates and stability in the money supply Now, Governor Wallich has often made the point that 999 out of 1,000 people--or maybe 999,000 out of a million--are looking at interest rates and not deviations in the money supply when they are concerned about stability or instability How we approach that problem is an interesting one  Let me just ask a question to see whether we can dispose of some questions or not Should we have a debate about going to a different control technique? I don't know how to go to total reserves or even the monetary base under the current institutional setting But we could do it nominally, anyway I say I don't know how we can do it in the current institutional setting because we don't control discount window borrowing under any of these proposals in the short run That is a question to which I will return But, can the discussion proceed on the basis of working within the framework of an immediate nonborrowed reserve technique with an eye on total reserves, leaving the question of emphasis open? Or do we [want to discuss] going back to federal funds or take another step toward some other kind of aggregate? Is there anybody who wants to argue the case for any of these extremes?  Let me restate perhaps somewhat differently a couple of points you made As to your first point regarding our concern about interest rates, I didn't mean to eliminate that in saying we would eliminate the question for consideration We can do that with either technique I think you mean that you are interested in the broad movements of interest rates when you make that point, and that remains a relevant consideration whatever technique we use And it bears upon how hard we press on nonborrowed reserves at a given time  The money demand shift is a valid technical point If that indeed is a big problem, the [unintelligible] point has been made I do think the last point you made is a point of some concern There may be something in our present technique, merely because of the uncertainty it generates about interest rates when we don't take responsibility for them, that makes the market react more sharply to a short-term change in the federal funds rate, let's say, than it would otherwise react Now, I don't know what that mechanism is, but one gets a little suspicious when we sit here and communicate no conviction at all about what the short-term rate should be The long- term market jumps more strongly in either direction than it otherwise would because market participants are trying to figure out themselves where [the short-term rate] is going to go, and father isn't telling them That may be an important deficiency in the present technique as it is now operated And it may be the [main one], as I see it Well, the money demand shift is a technical argument; [the issue is] how important it is, I guess Mr Balles was just saying the opposite  -32-    2/2-3/81  But this last point does bother me a bit Does anybody else want to comment?  He didn't quite say that, did he?  He just said there was no special drop in interest rates due to the new control technique  I think you are making an assumption that he didn't make That may be true in practice, but he is saying if we had moved the federal funds rate as much as would have been indicated, given the decline in the money supply, we would have gotten a similar result  Well, given the decline in the real GNP  We may not in fact have done that under the old technique; but if we had, there wouldn't have been much difference I think is what he said  Well, let's get to that later and just stay on this other more general subject  Mr Corrigan  I wonder whether we can try to stay on the more general questioning and comments on the broad approach I think this comes under a modification of existing techniques Mr Roos  --or go to something else, like the reserve base or something  Well, we'll get to these more detailed suggestions On the general point are there any other comments? Governor Partee and Mr Morris next  Mr Morris Any other suggestions on the present technique are in the next agenda item, not this one  -36-    2/2-3/81  Mr Black  I'm not sure we know how high or how low nonborrowed reserves should be; that's the problem  Mr Balles  Anybody else have any comments? Bob Mayo  If no one else has any comments, I will declare it the consensus that we will work in the general framework of our existing techniques We will now discuss modifying them I do think there is basically a tradeoff here, if nothing else, of the desirability of escaping responsibility for discretely moving interest rates A number of people have said that in ten years of experience we didn't move very far because we don't like to do that But [our new procedure] has exacted a price in terms of generating more instability throughout the interest rate structure, which may pass If you want to be an optimist, you say that people will learn enough through the experience, and long-term rates will no longer fluctuate so much But they certainly fluctuated in disturbing proportion to the fluctuation in short-term rates in the past 15 months Now, we've only been through two, or not even 1-1/2, interest rate cycles, I guess, so people haven't had much chance to learn from that Maybe as they get through another one or two, these reactions will be less Let's hope so  Let me turn now to modification of the technique, which has obviously already been touched upon in a number of comments I'm inclined to reverse [the order] Well, let's not reverse it; they're somewhat inter-related, I guess Let's just discuss both together the speed of the nonborrowed reserve adjustment--another way of saying the speed of the total borrowing adjustment--and the handling of the discount window or the discount rate The latter has already been touched upon on a number of occasions I think there is a difference between moving the discount rate more frequently and moving it automatically I continue to be of the belief, and I have heard nothing to dissuade me, that if we are operating on the present technique and tie the discount rate to market rates--whether you call it a penalty rate or whatever you call it--we would have an explosive short-term situation either up or down that I find impossible even to contemplate The present situation is awkward and is imposed upon us partly, but not entirely, by lagged reserve accounting When things are tight we don't have a penalty rate and we can't have a penalty rate, and it looks as if we're subsidizing the banks to some extent If I could minimize that appearance and reality, to the extent it's a reality, I'd be very pleased I don't know how to do it We tried to fool around with the surcharge, but those are the kinds of problems I see That does not mean we cannot move the discount rate more    2/2-3/81  frequently But then as a matter of judgment, I think we also--and it may be good or bad--are going to get more instability in market rates  I don't know how you get rid of the ratcheting effect but that--  Well, it depends You reduce it to the extent you open up the time between now and when they actually have to pay the penalty But you have a pretty high--  Well, it wouldn't blow up indefinitely If you get rates high enough so that the money supply adjustment is forced, it then goes down the other way  Look, we have all these problems; the question is how to avoid them  They're not creating reserves when they are lending We just agreed to stay on this technique and I'm assuming the current institutional setting involving a reluctance to borrow at the discount window [is not changed] [As for] forcing the banks in the aggregate to borrow, I'm just telling you the opposite of what you tell me A bank is not going to borrow [from the window] unless the market rate is above the discount rate So, when we force the banking system as a whole to borrow, we can't keep the market rate below the discount rate because they won't individually borrow to come up to the total we're forcing them to borrow It's just as night follows day in the short run with this technique, and we can't escape it Now, we can change other institutional settings, but there's no use sitting here saying we're going to force the banks to borrow and we're going to move the discount rate above the market rate If anything isn't possible, that's it  Now, you can go to the other extreme and say we don't care about banks borrowing We just open up the discount window to anybody who borrows and then the discount rate will become a ceiling And we can have a penalty rate and all the rest; but we've got to make all the other consequent changes in our present technique  Right Doing that has precisely the same economic effect as getting back to controlling the federal funds rate But now it is being done through the discount window instead of through open market operations That is, it's just going full circle and going back to where we started Now, I'm stuck here because if we force them to borrow, there's just not going to be a penalty rate If there's not a penalty rate, it looks as if we're subsidizing them That's my [dilemma]; you tell me how to get out of that box  Well, in general terms, the stricter we are in lending through the window, presumably the lower the level is that we would need to adjust the nonborrowing path to facilitate this But if we go in that direction, we would get less borrowing In that sense, we would have less subsidy But the market rate then presumably would be even higher depending upon what formula we use relative to the discount rate But [the window] would be used much less frequently; it wouldn't make much difference That is one way we can go  Well, that's the extreme of that policy  No  There are a lot of traditions surrounding the discount window; it has been more or less the same for decades and decades When you change something like that, you get a big educational problem in the short run And then if we decide we don't like it after we change it, we've got a heck of a problem going into something different I think These are the constraints that have left us where we are now That doesn't say we're in a perfect position, but it's very hard, I think, to change this in a fundamental way  Let me just put in as a footnote that, of course, this only happens when borrowings are high When the money supply is running low and borrowings are low, you'll get a penalty rate  Well, it's clearly a kind of tradeoff But if you're suggesting going in the direction of more rapid reductions when we're overshooting in the nonborrowed path, we're going to get more borrowings in the very short run anyway and it's going to increase the discrepancy between the market rate and the discount rate, if that's important to you Now, this discussion already took place in part We could also raise the discount rate more rapidly; in the very short run it's probably not going to narrow that discrepancy between the discount rate and market rates very much, but we would have taken two actions to get the money supply back on course more quickly at the expense of more interest rate volatility and not done much with this appearance of subsidy But that doesn't end up saying it's wrong because--  Well, they're very much interrelated And we could do the opposite We can do what you're suggesting in the nonborrowed reserves--[by moving] the borrowings more rapidly either at a meeting or between meetings depending upon what happens--without changing the discount rate or even the discount window administration That's an interesting question Would we conceivably get more impact on the money supply per basis point of interest rate change because we put the banks into debt, which worries them and forces adjustments in banks that may not be fully reflected in interest rate movements in the market because of nonprice considerations?  Well, it would be a mistake to make changes for the sake of making changes We ought to make changes for the sake of perhaps doing a better job Almost any change we make may suffer from the defect that people will read more into it than it's really worth But it's a little dangerous to make a change because somebody wants us to make a change and then the change doesn't produce the result that's intended  I suspect that during a good part of last year we were influenced by projections of the money supply, which we've now learned were totally unreliable Each month during that autumn period all the projections said it was going to level off this month  The most effective thing we can do to affect bank behavior is to kick them out of the discount window on an individual basis; otherwise they just don't give a damn They'll go on making all the loans they want to make  The conflict I see here, again, is that the way to handle the perception and the reality of the subsidy in the administration [of the window] is to make it easier to borrow with no upper limit If we make it easy enough, the subsidy will go away But that works against the short-term control of reserves and the money supply The more we work in the direction of short-term control of the money supply, the more the discrepancy will appear And I don't know how to get out of this box  Well, of course that is precisely what we did with the surcharge I guess we have some question whether the surcharge doesn't become in market practice the effective rate, so it just moves above the surcharge and makes it look even worse against the basic rate What would happen if we moved the basic rate to 16 percent now? I don't know whether that would have a market impact or not apart from the psychological one What do you say?  We're not going to solve all the problems of the discount window and discount rate at this particular forum We have to go to eat in a second, but the other two questions that just occurred to me in terms of techniques--there may be others--are the management and the handling of these interest rate bands that we have and, finally, as a number of people have mentioned, the issue of contemporaneous reserve accounting Are there other issues that should be surfaced here?  I don't think we're going to be able to handle that one today That may be something we can look at in the future I gather there is some sense--I'm not quite sure what it means because it runs counter to the concern about the discount window --about what would amount to forcing the banks more rapidly into more debt when the money supply is excessive I think there are advantages in that approach It's going to bring more instability in the very short run; it might help in the long run  Well, that's all in that general framework there  Well, I think these are--  Well, this is a relevant question, particularly right now when we don't know what M1 is But let's return to this subject unless somebody else wants to put something on the agenda  Well, there's a general question of whether we want to be systematic at all If we're off course in [hitting] a target by plus or minus 10 percent, how fast can we get back, apart from the technique of how we get back there  I'll add another one Shall we publish the money supply figures weekly?  Yes We have quite a few on the list; I'm now up to H We're not going to be able to resolve all of these, obviously, but we may get some sense on a couple of the key ones Let's return after lunch and concentrate on this for an hour or so  Yes  [Lunch recess]  [Unintelligible] there is a certain amount of duplication that is unnecessary And I would like to delegate to President Solomon the task of giving us some recommendations as to how we may maintain a detailed record for members of the Committee and otherwise without excessive duplication If you would give us recommendations at an appropriate time in a coming meeting, President Solomon, I would appreciate it  SPEAKER(?) Amen  Right Now, I don't want to take all afternoon on this subject that we are on, if we can avoid it We have to get to the business outlook and the long-range targets The first two subjects on my check list that we have been discussing are nonborrowed reserve adjustments and the discount window--its administration and the rate I get some sense that the feeling is that perhaps a little more rapid adjustment on the nonborrowed reserve [path] might be appropriate I don't think we can sit here and write a formula for it today It may be desirable or not to have a formula at some point The discount window and discount rate, of course, are explicitly a responsibility of the Board of Governors in any event But I was not encouraged by the discussion that we had this morning that anybody has an ideal solution for getting out of the box that we are in And it occurred to me just at lunch that this is not a new box either Under the old operating technique we could have maintained a penalty rate and we never did during these periods; and the discrepancy got extremely wide every time we had a tight money period So, it's not exactly a new visual problem or real problem But it is a problem  In any event, I suggest that we have had enough discussion of that at this point, knowing that we have to come back to the nonborrowed reserve issue anyway in connection with the explicit decision at this meeting and subsequent meetings And maybe we can do  -50-    2/2-3/81  a little work on a formula But I think there may be some dissenters; I don't know because they haven't spoken  Yes I'll get to the interest rate confines, but at this point it's apart from that I must say this The logic of this strict money supply control leads one in this direction I'm a little nervous about it probably for the very reason that we haven't done it more rapidly in the past We always get nervous I guess, which is why we're on this technique at all, when we are rather consciously [moving] the interest rate structure a tick And that's what we're doing when we [adjust the nonborrowed reserve path] But let me leave it; we'll come back to that quite explicitly in terms of the particular decision today We may want to say something about it in general terms As things now stand, I probably would say in my report to the Congress that this is something we probably will be doing But that would not be quantified  My current thinking was to publish something like Steve's summary, which is marked preliminary, with appropriate modifications for clarity or whatever, as part of the Humphrey-Hawkins Report I haven't made a decision about publishing the rest of it The rest of it may be a bit uneven I don't know whether it's--  Well, part of my problem--I just don't know the answer to this--is whether the authors themselves think it is in a form that it is really ready for publication, given the speed with which it was done and so forth  No, the rest of it I'm not talking about the summary  Yes Well, I suspect, without even having read them, that given the rate of speed with which they were written the authors need at least another crack at them before we would want to distribute them  -51-    2/2-3/81  Yes, I think my testimony will have to touch upon all the things that we are now discussing I don't know what we would say about the discount window--maybe not much other than that it's a problem and that we're continuing to look at it At this point I would be inclined to say that there is a question, which is in the summary, about the speed of the nonborrowed reserve adjustment Our tendency probably will be to lean toward faster adjustments rather than slower I can make that kind of comment without being very precise about it I'm judging that this reflects the Committee's sentiment at this point  Well, I don't know whether we'd want a list or not, but we'll look at that I don't see anything the matter with it particularly Certainly if we're prepared to put them out, there's nothing the matter But we can probably delay publication anyway  I'm not sure any of these take a vote per se My thought now is that there would be a qualitative statement about the speed of the nonborrowed reserve [adjustment] The discount window would be pointed to as a problem, but [I would say that] we're not ready to propose anything explicit as a change However, there ought to be a frank recognition of the fact that there are problems in that area  The next thing I have on my list is the question of interest rate bands I think it is fair to say, explicitly or implicitly though maybe more implicitly, that the speed of the nonborrowed reserve reaction time--and in fact the handling of the discount window can be looked at it the same way--reflects some concern about overshooting one way or the other on interest rates and the fact that that is undesirable The interest rates bands--everybody has his own view--I don't think have been terribly important The closest they came to being important was last spring Every other time we reached [the limit of the interest rate band] we changed the band And we probably would have changed it last spring if we had reached the limit  -52-    2/2-3/81  more forcibly, but we teetered on the edge for a while But I think that is consistent with some implicit coloration in our minds of not wanting to overshoot on interest rates too much; that is a factor in how these other things are set [Steve], this interest rate band question isn't one on which you made any particular proposal pro or con in your summary, is it?  Well, it seems to me that the really operative question here, since I don't view these bands that we have had as having constrained anything much, is whether anybody wants to have narrower ones and actually have them be constraining I suppose it means--  I'm not quite sure how we would have gotten the same degree of restraint It may have been excessive, but it wouldn't have been the same I don't think at that [unintelligible]  That's a little different from saying--  You say lower Do you mean narrowing the range?  Well, the trouble with Governor Partee's suggestion--it's good if you want to achieve the result that you want to achieve--is that other people may have a real concern about [the level] If they are more concerned about a rise of 300 basis points from 21 percent than they are from 15 percent, you have a problem  Yes, that kind of defeats the--  But we haven't always been in the middle of these ranges Both in the spring [of last year] and just recently we've been around the upper end of the range that we set  Yes  If you change it, then I think you'll really be detracting from the basis--  Well, I think it could be We could vary on it What scale are you on here?  Well, I would suggest that when we write this report it should say that on balance the Committee wants to retain interest rate bands I would emphasize in the reporting that these bands have not really been constraining, but in a number of instances during the past year they have served as occasions for the Committee to consider what it wanted to do And the report should note that virtually every time this happened, the range has been changed I think it has been changed every time  Well, did we ever have a consultation and not change it? I don't think so On that bottom, I don't read that experience quite the way you do We flirted with a conflict, but we never really had it Just about the time when we would have had to have a meeting, interest rates began going up We may have had a meeting and not changed it but I don't know when  Well, I don't know what you're saying because I disagree with you in terms of these bands We've changed them every time we've come [to the limit of the band] Now, I think it is a constraint implicitly in our behavior in terms of rapidity of movement But I just flatly disagree with you that these outside limits have been a constraint I just observed that when we met and said we had a problem [with respect to the interest rate constraint], the constraint has been changed  Now, wait a minute They do lurk in the background, and I don't deny that in terms of rapidity of [adjustments] All I am saying is that these bands themselves--I ought to be in as good a position to know as anybody--have not constrained [our actions]  I don't know what would have happened What happened when we ran into 21 percent? We removed [the limit]  Well, that's why they're there At some point we might not  That's debatable on the down side  The closest we came certainly was on the down side  We were right on the edge That's the clearest case when it could have been a [constraint]  No, frankly, I think it's a good idea I would even question whether we should have removed it every time we did But we did  Again, I think the constraint has been more an implicit one in that we have not wanted to move too fast in the short run And that is true whether we had a lot of room within the bands or we didn't  Well, that is true without question; but I'd say that is true whether or not we're near or away from the--  Well, we don't all  Well, I think there is a real difference It would happen rarely, but there would have been a difference last spring and summer and right now when in a sense a lot of people would  -58-    2/2-3/81  want it asymmetrical Your presumption is that it would be more symmetrical I detect that we do not have unanimity but a consensus [The next topic is] contemporaneous reserve accounting  You may  I'm not sure I can think this through Let me ask Mr Axilrod and it will give me time anyway If we lengthen the reserve averaging period--let's say it went from a week to a month--and said it was contemporaneous, it seems to me we would end up at the end of the period just where we are now  I must say my concern about this is not any public relations effect or difficulties with the banks We can make the banks do what they have to do My concern is that the logic is probably to do this, but the logic may not be very strong And we may in a sense be promising [too much] People will say we made a great change and it may be that not much is different after we've made the change except that we've complicated our own life a little as well as the banks' lives And we could get an adverse reaction because nothing much has changed That's the only thing that really bothers me about this  Yes, but I think that's--  SPEAKER(?) That'll be the day!  I wish I thought it worked that way  Mr Ford  Oh, I think we have to assume that we will have to give them substantial warning if we do this  The logic is in that direction; it's just a question of how much It may be fairly trivial That's my concern  Well, I assume if this is done, it's going to have to go out as a proposed regulation for comment Now, Bob Black raised another question, which is a relevant question If we're going to make this change, should we consider any other change in the reserve period or the carryover, and put it all out at the same time? If we're going to do that, it's going to take a couple of months to prepare the regulation, I suppose, because we would have to debate these other issues too  I think the assumption would be that we would just go on contemporaneous reserve accounting for the bigger banks  A one-day lag  Well, we will have errors with that, which is a complication for us We have estimates of errors on required reserves, which we don't have very much of now But as soon as we go on contemporaneous reserve accounting, we're going to have lots of errors in our own estimates of required reserves  SPEAKER(?) Right  That's what Milton Friedman calls "bureaucratic difficulties"  Well, that implies that there's no slippage either in our estimates or in the linkage And we just had this plus or minus 10 percent a month slippage  Sure we would They can still borrow  That's an expression of faith on your part How do you know?  Well, this is the whole argument What difference does it really make? The logic goes in your direction, but I don't know why you think it's quantitatively important Banks don't determine the money supply; an individual bank doesn't It sits there and sees what deposits it has today and it will come up with those reserves tomorrow Under CRR what we would be doing is that we would make them come up with those reserves tomorrow, or at least in the  -62-    2/2-3/81  present week, instead of two weeks later But why do you assume from that a vast difference in bank behavior?  Yes, the increase in borrowing will set in process a motion, but we can get that same increase in borrowing if we have the intestinal fortitude to do it I think at the present the main thing that would change, frankly, is that the market would be making more of these judgments about what the level of borrowing was because we wouldn't have the information fast enough to do it So--  Yes, all things equal  One week earlier  Well, it all goes in that direction But it's just a question of magnitude  I don't think that brings lower interest rates, Henry An individual bank can't reduce its reservable liabilities It can do something on the assets side that reduces some other bank's reservable liabilities But that would be accompanied by more pressure on the market  -64-    2/2-3/81  Anybody want to--  When we're setting the federal funds rate, it won't make any difference That's right  Well, that would make a difference But I think the biggest single source of slippage is going to remain the discount window Nothing in going to CRA says that they can't borrow  Sure we can  Yes  Yes, but we squeeze them by making them borrow more And that has been the limitation on our operations now We didn't want to go very fast Now we can go faster within the week but I--  Let me just ask about the extremes I'll ask [for you views] symmetrically, but I have to start with one extreme first Who feels very strongly that they would like to go to contemporaneous reserve accounting? [Secretary's note Messrs Black, Ford, Roos and Winn raised their hands]  Well, let's have the other extreme now Who feels strongly that we should not? [Secretary's note Mr Gramley raised his hand]  The same amount of strength that I asked on the other side  Wait a minute We may be--  You have listened to the discussion, including the point that Bob Black made that if it turned out that we had an excessive amount, however defined, of instability in the federal funds rates from day-to-day that we might want to change our techniques and constrain that more directly Now let me ask Given all the discussion, who would favor going in this direction enough to want to make the change? That includes the people who want very strongly to do it  -68-    2/2-3/81  SPEAKER(?) When?  SPEAKER(?) With an announcement?  Yes, with adequate time and all the rest  SPEAKER(?) I don't understand this  Considering the disadvantages and how you appraise them, you are voting--whether you feel strongly or weakly-- on whether on balance you'd make the decision to go [to CRR]  Yes, but you just voted in the opposite because it says--  Well, all right, just on [changing] lagged reserves then Put your hands up once more I just want to get some sense of how many [Secretary's note Messrs Balles, Black, Boehne, Ford, Guffey, Morris, Partee, Roos, Wallich, and Winn raised their hands] Okay, let me ask the opposite; it should be all the rest On balance, who would not go, either strongly or weakly?  Well, all right; you're permitted to be indifferent  SPEAKER(?) Can we vote for indifference?  We have a majority who would like to go for it The next question would be--  And how? And would you raise all these questions about the reserve averaging period and the--  I know  I understand  You did a memorandum on this a year ago, didn't you?  I'm trying to remember Do we have any study in the various studies on contemporaneous reserve accounting that brought these together?  The carry-forward, carry-back, and the change in the reserve averaging period  The posture we are in now, if I recall it accurately, is that we have said we don't want to do this right away because of the Monetary Control Act And, if we ever do it, we will give the banks a lot of notice and all the rest We are seriously contemplating it but we haven't made up our mind  Yes Among other things, this is a Board of Governors decision But I'm just trying to figure out how we can advance the ball or kick the ball back in terms of what we say in connection with the Humphrey-Hawkins report We can put a more positive cast on it and say an appropriate regulation is being drawn up, which the Board would have to agree to subsequently We can say we are considering these other things and we plan to publish a [proposed] regulation but it's short of an absolute decision We can put a much more positive cast on it, but we can't say we absolutely have decided on it anyway if we're going to put it out for public comment  I would assume that if we began right now to consider it, we'd have to consider some of these other matters and couldn't do it short of six months anyway  But we have to get comment [from] the banks and give them time to get prepared  Well, just to pick a round number, I think we're not talking about [making a decision] before six months  We on the Board will discuss this against this background [discussion] One possible outcome is, in effect, announcing that we are going to publish a regulation for comment and consideration  If I may move to item E  Well, the only thing that strikes me about that offhand, without having thought it through, is that all the adjustments get delayed until the end of the month, and there would be a tremendous crunch at the end of the month That would be worse But we'll look at it  Next on my list is Which target do we emphasize? We have a particular problem--and I don't know how far we can carry this outside of the specific decision we have to make about targets this year--when, for institutional reasons, we don't have as good a handle on what M1 is doing as we might like Who would like to address themselves to this subject of which target? I suppose we could say the general question is How many targets do we announce?  I understand everything you're saying M1, very recently anyway, has [not] been very closely correlated with nominal GNP But how do you answer the fellow who says "That's fine, but we can't control M2"?  With M1 I think--  Mr Axilrod now tells us that one can produce a study to show anything, I guess  Well, just to clarify this If you just look at the simple relationship with no lags, it is clear that M2 has a much closer relationship I think everybody would agree with that recently But you're saying that if one makes a complicated enough equation with lags and so forth and interest rates, yes--  Yes  Didn't I see somebody speculating on the British experience that they might have had slower growth in M3 if interest rates were lower?  Well, we heard Frank expressing one point of view on one side Are there those who are 180 degrees away and say we ought to forget about M2 and M3 and bank credit and so forth?  Let's get into that later  Or M3  -76-    2/2-3/81  We'll get back to that in a minute  Just in terms of a more general sense of the meeting, if I detect it correctly, the view is that we will remain rather eclectic on this as a matter of principle but that some M1 measure continues to have a particularly heavy bearing as an operating matter We may modify that in the light of the particular decision we have to make now M1 is particularly [distorted] But as a general principle--though we had one on one side and one on the other side--I assume everybody else is in the middle, which is the view I just attempted to express  We'll get into the specifics of what we will do [with the targets for this] year in a minute You wanted to say something, Bob?  Well, I think you are citing a general opinion It's clear enough, subject to any change we have to make  -77-    2/2-3/81  this specific time because of the confusion about M1 But we'll get to that later  Let's go to that when we look at 1981 I think it's a relevant question Anything else on the general principle? We are remaining eclectic A question arose in the course of these studies; it doesn't need to be systematized, but somebody may want to say something about it The staff detected, as a matter of empirical research, that the targets that the Committee set tended to move one-third of the way back toward where they were supposed to be per month Am I expressing that correctly?  I don't think this was consciously thought out or very explicitly thought out I may be overstating this, but did I understand that the staff judgment that emerged, considering the implications for interest rates and all the rest, was that that did not seem, for better or worse, an unsensible way of doing it?  Well, I don't really think this requires any decision because we can always make it at any particular meeting, as we have in the past But I thought it was interesting to convey this sense of what presumably we had been doing subconsciously I don't know if anybody wants to raise a question about it or systematize it or whatever  Well, I don't know What do you say to that, Mr Axilrod?  And they weren't too closely related?  Just to rationalize those two things, Mr Black, what we have to be saying is that it may have been logical to set the target to move a third of the way back But we didn't change the nonborrowed reserve [path] fast enough to support the actual numerical target that we had set  I think that's why we did it, yes  I don't think we have to sit here and decide we're going to have a fixed policy or that it should be different But apparently this was systematic enough in our unconsciousness so that it could be commented on, if anybody wants to comment on it  Well, the thing that bothers me the most, as just a simple observation of last year, is whether we were generating a cycle That is the question we're now raising And when I don't probe too hard, the staff tells me that we weren't But I don't know whether I feel comfortable with that  SPEAKER(?) I don't  Well, one of the things that continues to concern me a bit about this is this simple relationship, and maybe Mr Ford can enlighten us about it, that we're attempting to control the economy through bank service charge practices Corporations hold a large percentage of the money supply; their required balances are related to their activity in the prevailing interest rate [environment] with an indeterminate lag of several months We push up interest rates; the banks all send out notices to the corporations that they can keep lower balances next month Interest rates go down, so the money supply declines And because interest rates have gone down the banks send out notices to their customers that they now have to keep higher balances  The saving grace here is probably that the bank practices vary in this respect enough so that it doesn't have any cyclical movement to it  Henry has raised a question of publishing the directive, which was not on my agenda But do you want to make your case, Henry?  Certainly, once we began doing that, we couldn't stop And if we ever wanted to put something in the directive such as some qualified statements about if this happens something else might happen later on--as we did last month, though not on the federal funds band--  I detect no upsurge toward a majority for this opinion The last question I have here is a similar one, which we certainly don't have to resolve here It's not the responsibility of the Committee, but I wonder where opinions stand on publishing the money supply data I got a letter from Senator Garn and Senator Proxmire the other day raising the question of whether we shouldn't stop publishing weekly figures  And presumably we could ask Congress to change the law if they thought seriously about it  No, they didn't specifically ask that I forget whether they made any reference to it or not They made some reference to the fact that they understood there might be a question under the Freedom of Information Act I think that is the way they worded it I don't think they volunteered to change [the Act], but they didn't say they wouldn't  It has occurred to me--though I'm not ready to propose this yet--that we may have legitimate grounds for not publishing seasonally adjusted figures because the seasonal adjustment factor is so bad We would tell the public that we don't trust it and we're not going to--  I won't prolong this any further  There is no question about that Mr  -86-    2/2-3/81  MESSRS KICHLINE, ZEISEL, and TRUMAN [Statements--see Appendix]  Thank you for your happy comments I think we ought to discuss the outlook, probably for most of the rest of the time we have [left today] anyway In that process, you will recall that you recently provided some [individual] forecasts, which presumably will have to be summarized for the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony Not all the assumptions were the same on the monetary side I forget What have we done in previous years about getting commonality in the assumptions if not the forecasts?  Yes We didn't [specify] any assumptions I don't think Did we ask people when making their forecasts to use the same assumption or not?  We gave them a forecast that [generally encompassed] the views of the [individual] Committee members But I can't remember whether we asked everybody to make a forecast on the basis of the same monetary and fiscal assumptions  So everybody presumably had the same money supply assumption?  Well, in these preliminary forecasts [the assumptions] were different anyway I just don't know what the right procedure is here It's logical for everybody to use the same assumption But if somebody violently disagrees with the assumption, it seems a little artificial to force that person to use it  Well, that's the dilemma, and I'm not quite sure how--  Well, all I would say at this point is that we have a considerable amount of time before we have to publish this, and we haven't even decided what we're deciding Maybe we can defer that question until after the meeting tomorrow and then ask if anybody wants to redo their forecast; perhaps we can at least narrow the range of assumptions from what we have  I suppose that's a reasonable compromise To ask people to make assumptions that are at least within the range of what the Committee is talking about  SPEAKER(?) Especially if you're going to be called--  We have a summary here of all your forecasts, which could be distributed after the meeting for whatever use it may be But we will not consider this a final forecast until we complete our work Who wants to talk about the outlook? Mr Boehne  I think that is a relevant comment, that we have a two-tier economy or something Half of it you can't keep down and the other half is in depression I don't know what to do about it It makes it more difficult [for us] for the very reasons you suggest  Well, it may be consistent with low growth overall, but the pressures, financial or otherwise, [are concentrated] on the half that isn't doing anything--even now  SPEAKER(?) [Unintelligible] the stock market  Who else wants to comment? You're all speechless!  Mr Corrigan  Mr Morris  Governor Teeters  Mr Balles  Mr Roos  You did have a little higher, but not terribly high, M-1B assumption compared to the staff You have a low price number Does that mean that your [forecast] suggests that the restraint that has already been exerted plus [restraint for] another few months produces lower prices?  In your model, prices ought to begin going down some in terms of their rate of increase  -92-    2/2-3/81  Who is next?  You prefer to have a lower target and overshoot or a higher target? What is the implication?  Governor Gramley  You say it has done no good at all Are you excluding the possibility that [our policy] prevented it from getting higher?  Are there any more optimistic comments? Mr Winn  You know, we have a certain bashfulness today  SPEAKER(?) We're weary  Oh, not very rigidly anyway  But that's all based upon a much more optimistic business outlook  Well, I don't think the general problem will be one of estimating the budget; it just falls out But we don't have to make a forecast for 1982 If we accepted the staff forecast, we're certainly going to have a difference between our forecast and the Administration's  I don't think they'll project whatever we have for 1982 in the forecast we just heard  No, I'm thinking of the GNP Do you have a comment on the outlook beyond that?  By unexpected developments you mean what? No tax cut?  -95-    2/2-3/81  Who else? Does anybody else want to comment on the outlook and the dilemmas for monetary policy? Mr Ford  Mr Mayo  Heartfelt comments from an old Budget Director!  John Balles  To 6-1/2 percent?  Does anybody else have a comment? If not, we are not going to get very far into these long-range targets tonight It's clear that we have a difficult decision, as always, but a philosophic choice tonight, if I interpret the comments I have heard correctly We are looking at a gloomy business forecast; one view is that it's constrained by money so we could unconstrain the forecast by increasing money The other view is that we should go ahead with monetary restraint on the basis that the forecast is really going to turn out better or that we need it anyway in terms of the ultimate need to eliminate inflation It's a little hard for me to see that we can adopt the "give up" alternative, if I may term it that, at precisely this stage in our economic evolution I try not to be overly optimistic, and I don't know if I'm being overly optimistic, but I personally think that the Administration is probably going to try harder on the spending side than most of the comments around this table suggest What actually is going to be accomplished, I don't know I don't have any number and I don't have any precise  -98-    2/2-3/81  information of this sort The kind of number that the staff put in for 1982 must be on the order, anyway, of what they are thinking And they are aiming for considerably more than that I am sure by 1983 I also sense that they are going to try to get a vote on a big spending package before they do anything on taxes or do it in the same vote in some maneuver Whether that can be done, who knows? But there is a certain amount of sentiment in the Congress to do something And if this can be maneuvered in a way so that everybody doesn't have to vote one by one on each particular program--if they find some way of packaging it so that when it comes to a vote in the Congress as a whole everybody can vote in favor of expenditure restraint and not against a particular program--there may be some possibility [of passage] Whether that can be done or not, I don't know I also suspect that, if anything, the tax reduction will come later than the staff has assumed I don't think it's going to come any sooner But that all remains to be seen  When I look at our targeting exercise for the next year and realize that I have to explain it, I will tell you that I am in trouble for more reasons than the difficulty of making up a target I can barely understand what we are doing in terms of the adjustments that have to be made to last year's [M1] figure in one way or another! I thought it might be useful in the little time we have left [this evening] to go over the problems as I perceive them so that hopefully we can talk on more or less consistent grounds tomorrow That may be more than I can hope for because I keep getting confused by this every time I go through it myself Let's look at something like the numbers--and I'm just basically worried about the M1 numbers--on page 6 [of the Bluebook] I am sure that Mr Axilrod will be listening carefully to me and will tell me that I am confused by the time I get finished For either of the M1 numbers the Bluebook shows the target ranges for '80 and the tentative target ranges for '81 that we had adopted in July before we knew they were off course or internally inconsistent There are some alternative target ranges for '81, which presumably are on the same basis as those tentative target ranges Then it shows as a memo the actual growth in '80, which I don't think conforms to any of those targets As a taking off point, so to speak, it seems to me that we have to think about this in one of two ways And I just boggle at both as I think about explaining this when I go before the [Congressional] committees One is that we could think of adjusted ranges for '80 that we presume economically are the same as those targets that are listed here These are the shadow cones, so to speak, that we had In that case, we would be taking off--it's the same target presumably, and the same economic substance--[from a point] consistent with the actual results That is something like 2-1/2 to 5 percent for M-1A and 4-1/2 to 7 percent for M-1B Is that roughly right, Mr Axilrod?  If you think of that assumption in your head and you know what change in the target is appropriate--whether you want a reduction or unchanged or whatever--you make the assumption that the relationship between M-1A and M-1B was the same as last year That's just a base point for starting It is not going to be the same But just to keep straight in your mind what you are talking about, I think you would have those targets in mind that I just gave  -99-    2/2-3/81  orally and then you would talk about a target that was unchanged or [up or down] 1/2 or 1 point or whatever you thought [appropriate] from there, on the assumption that the relationship between M-1A and M-1B was the same as it was last year  Alternatively, if you wanted to talk in terms of targets like we had last year, then I think you ought to mentally adjust that memo of the actual growth figure and add to M-1A this unexpected transfer out of M-1A You get something like 6-1/4 percent, which is what it says in the footnote For M-1B you have something like 6-3/4 percent Those numbers are then consistent more or less with the targets on the left hand side of the page Now, in fact, what we are going to have this year, of course, is something quite different from any of these It's not only going to be different but, because of what went on in January, it is quite clear that in a sense it is going to have a big dogleg in it We had a big decline in M-1A in January and that probably is proceeding to some extent in February and then will return to some normal [pattern], while M-1B is going to have a dogleg to the right I'm just looking at the charts on [subsequent pages], where M-1B is going to be exaggerated in January and February and then resume, presumably, some kind of normal growth Those doglegs bother me a little because if we just show a cone without the dogleg, it immediately shows figures that are way off the cone and just adds another element of confusion I would suggest--I don't know whether we can conform to it or not--that we have to make clear what we are talking about in terms of citing whatever targets we think are appropriate I'd suggest in the first instance that we forget about the impact of NOW accounts and the institutional change this year just so that hopefully we can keep the communications among ourselves straight I played with the idea in my mind that that should be the target we give them, saying that we are not going to give them a target adjusted for NOW accounts until the January-February business straightens itself out, after which we will give them [an adjusted] one, beginning maybe from February just so we avoid this dogleg problem But, really, one idea is as bad as another I don't think there is a good way of doing this In any event, we will have to tell them that the cone or channel or whatever we have that tracks the actual figures as reported over the course of the year will be subject to change as the year progresses--maybe every three months or so--as we evaluate what the actual NOW account impact is  Maybe you could put it down both ways, if that's possible, Steve Just put down the targets the way you have them but with the figure you cite [in the Bluebook] as the adjusted figure for last year Then do it the other way with the ranges for last year adjusted retrospectively, with the actual results last year I was going to suggest that there is a third way to do it, but the third way is very similar to the adjusted actual figure, I guess Steve's adjusted actual figure still assumes that there is some modest trend shift between M-1A and M-1B that is going to persist forever more or less; but it's a very vague estimate, which is part of the difficulty I think it might be helpful to put those figures down those two ways  -100-    2/2-3/81  I'll make one more comment Either way we adjust this, the M1 figures come out very close to the top of the range And we could think of taking off from the top of the range instead of from the actual number, if you wanted to There's not much difference; in a sense one could call it base drift or not; it's not a drift outside the cone that we had We can't quite do that with M2, I don't think, because M2, which doesn't have all these other problems, ended up 3/4 of a percentage point above the cone Presumably we have to call that base drift, I suppose, or whatever you want But we can't blur it because they are not virtually the same numbers  Well, I think that's purely semantic If you think of it from the midpoint, we have base drift under any definition If we don't admit that it's base drift because growth was within the cone, we don't have it It depends; different people have different views of these cones Some people say the midpoint is the right target and any deviation is [measured from] the midpoint Other people say that [the cone itself provides] the elasticity one allows oneself to adjust through the year and we shouldn't consider ourselves off course if we're within the cone I don't think one way is right and one wrong It all depends upon how one looks at it  Well, I'm not really suggesting it for M2; there's virtually no difference because they are so close to--  We just make a different estimate of the target when we make it identical  Well, I'm not necessarily arguing for one or the other I suggest this as a possible method of presentation, if we want to take it It does create a precedent; some people may think the precedent is good and some people may think it's bad I think we'd better quit for the evening at any rate If we could have a different piece of paper, it might facilitate [our discussion]  Yes, I think that's all  [We will resume at] 930 tomorrow morning  [Meeting recessed]    2/2-3/81  Session held on February 3, 1981  We can come to order and turn to the long- range targets Mr Axilrod has prepared a little table in accordance with the instructions yesterday, which I hope is as "crystal clear" [as] he described it It is a difficult thing to keep in mind It's conceptually simple but somehow--  If I may just inject here, all of this is based upon the assumption that Steve mentioned of a two-thirds/one- third shift Unfortunately, I think that's a rather weak assumption We don't have much direct evidence during this period That is inherent moving forward from this point as well as looking backwards, and it's a ballpark figure That's all one can say about it  The same assumption is used for both You can see that either way you look at it, growth in 1980 came out 1/4 percentage point above [the ranges] It's just a different way of looking at the 1/4 point  That is correct  Well, the published figures are the 5 and 7-1/4 percent In testimony we gave the public those ranges shown in the right-hand column--that top part We've never given them the adjusted figure, although it's a mirror image, I think  It's all crystal clear!  Well, you may now understand why I have doubts that anybody can explain this I have great confidence in my ability to explain, but!  That's right That's the question I want to raise here now I suggested tentatively yesterday that we may not want to indicate the bottom line here I don't know whether it's a good idea; maybe we should Of course the bottom line is the same, whichever way we [describe it] If we do state the bottom line, it's going to have to be stated in an exceedingly tentative fashion; we will have to say that we are prepared to change this every quarter or whatever, depending simply on an analysis of what is going on One of the difficulties we have is just that the shifts are so big We have a reasonable appraisal of where this money is coming from at the moment in January But the actual growth rates are very sensitive to the assumptions one makes We do think it's in the ballpark of 75 to 80 percent or a little more [from demand deposits] We will have a little finer judgment when we get some more thrift institution survey data But when we are not having big shifts, it is exceedingly hard to tell what fraction is coming from where because it doesn't distort the other figures enough to permit a fine judgment The inherent problem is that when things are shifting, one can measure it When things are in a more steady state and people are building up NOW account balances, let's say, they are not actually shifting from demand deposits; they are just holding a NOW account The NOW account goes up and we don't know whether it's going up because people are holding more transactions balances of the traditional type or whether it is because there is very little difference--or none in the case of commercial banks--in the interest rate, and thus money they might otherwise have put in a savings account ends up in a NOW account It's just very difficult to judge; it's a bit of a shot in the dark as to what the adjustments last year imply about what that proportion is There's just no way to cross-check it, really, I don't think  That's right We have the question of whether we want to give people those figures on the bottom In one sense, this is a substantive problem but not a presentational problem They are the same both ways, although there is a psychological problem in that they look distorted The other question in trying to explain how the devil we got there or not even giving those bottom numbers at all is Should we think in terms of giving them the kind of ranges on the left-hand side or the right-hand side of this table? It depends upon where your starting point is What little foundation has been laid is that the public has no actual figures other than 5 percent and 7-1/4 percent They have been exposed a little to the idea that those targets last year were mutually inconsistent and should have been revised, as shown on the top row [of this table] Just proceeding on that basis, I think the presentational problem we have is that the actual 1/2 percentage point reduction in the M-1B range happens to be the same as the range that they are familiar with for last year When you look at it at first blush--and maybe it's fifth blush--it looks as if we haven't changed the range, although we are insisting that we have lowered it Economically, we have lowered it; but we may have a helluva time convincing people that we have lowered it when we cite the figures On the other hand, if we use the other figure, then we have to say that this is a range that is consistent with an actual figure that we never gave you It is [consistent with] an adjusted actual figure, which we are now going to give you--the growth in M-1B last year was not 7-1/4 percent but 6-3/4 percent--and we will have to go through all that rigmarole More importantly perhaps at this stage, I don't think it makes any difference which way we look at it and present it in the end, so long as we are straight in our conversations today when somebody is citing a range whether they are working from the right-hand or the left-hand side of this table  That's the great advantage of using that side of the table  Eventually I think we want to do that I would assume that we would do it next year if we don't do it this year In my mind, the problem with doing it this year is that because we are getting switches that expand M-1B artificially in a sense, it helps in terms of perspective if we also give the M-1A range, which shows a decline If [critics] keep saying we haven't reduced the range, we tell them to look at the whole [picture, showing both M-1B and M-1A] and it's obvious that we have That's the one advantage of keeping both of them  -106-    2/2-3/81  Which one are you looking at?  But they're not the same  It comes out close, as I guess you said, not quite the same It would come out the same if the shift were 50/50  We cannot say that the shift was not 50/50 last year, because we just don't know If it was 50/50, it just lowered the one range by as much as it raised the other  Are you talking about what happened last year or now? There is pretty strong evidence that right now the shift is at least three-fourths But our assumption is that that's very much a transitional thing during the first stages of this  Yes, the shift from an ATS account shouldn't affect this, if everything is being reported correctly  That's the real trouble, I think Once the NOW account has been created, it will inherently have some characteristics of a savings account and not the old style transaction account  No Nothing is for sure  We can ask a bank where the shift comes from We may not get an accurate answer, but at least we can ask it  In some cases they think they know, but the answers are pretty much all over the lot It is at least a concrete question to ask them Once the shift has taken place and we ask them why their NOW accounts have gone up, they don't know what the motivation of the customer is  -108-    2/2-3/81  We had people from the National Savings and Loan Association in here the other day and they had done some kind of a survey This is the smallest part; most of the shifting is in the commercial banks But for what it is worth, they said their survey showed 60 percent was coming out of their own accounts, which meant basically savings accounts; 40 percent was coming from elsewhere They couldn't identify where "elsewhere" was, but they assumed it was mostly from commercial bank checking accounts But that's one survey of the S&Ls Now, the banks have given us the surveys that you people made and had tabulated, weighted probably incorrectly That showed more than 80 percent of it, in this first blush, coming out of their own checking accounts So, these figures reflect some casual weighting together of the relatively small thrifts and the relatively big commercial banks at over 80 percent For the thrifts I don't know whether to assume 50/50 and then come up with something like 80 percent for the combined total for these weeks But they expect, as Steve said, that this will decline when we get over the initial shift  Yes That is why I think we have to retain the right to change these [ranges] Let me say that we not only have survey data now, for what it's worth, but that these shifts are so big that it does not appear that we can explain a large part of the shift by an exceptional decline in savings accounts Savings accounts have been declining pretty fast, but they were declining pretty fast in December And money market funds are going up very rapidly now So, if you make some allowance for how much is going out of savings deposits into money market funds, there isn't all that big a residual left to explain what is going into NOW accounts That tends to confirm that most of it came out of checking accounts on the first blush  It literally does not matter if you could make an assumption that it is coming half and half; you would get mathematical precision in that answer But it does throw it off as soon as you depart from that assumption  Well, in fact, we are never going to know in the end how much came out of M2 and M1  The other way of handling it is the way Governor Teeters suggested last time Add savings deposits The trouble with that is that it's quite evident right now that savings deposits are declining very rapidly for entirely extraneous reasons, so that doesn't give any satisfactory answer  Well, extraneous to these shifts here I think all we have to do at the moment for purposes of our discussion now--we have presentational problems--is decide whether we want to talk off the right side of the sheet or the left side of the sheet  The really important thing is that we keep in mind in our comments which one we are talking about We can talk about both of them, I guess, and decide the presentational issues afterwards Let me just say one other thing, which I didn't say yesterday The President is going to make a speech on Thursday; he's  -110-    2/2-3/81  going to present a State of the Union Message or some kind of long message outlining his economic program on the 18th I think that is the current schedule It's always possible that that is going to slip At the moment my testimony is scheduled for the 19th That probably will be delayed for that reason and, with the agreement of the [Congressional] committees, we will submit the report after the statutory deadline so that we have a chance to write the report in the light of what the President says I don't mean delay very long It would be, say, Tuesday of the following week instead of Friday the 20th of the previous week It is more likely than not that the whole schedule will be shoved back by several days in the light of the President's schedule, although I can't be certain of it There is a substantive problem, to the extent it's relevant, that conceivably knowing what the President has to say might shade our own judgments here I only say this because I don't know that we have to be absolutely conclusive today I'd like to come as close to it as possible and make at the very least a tentative judgment; but we can reconfirm it between now and whatever date [the report is made] What is today's date? Today is the third, so we're talking almost three weeks before we actually report We may or may not want to make use of that [interval]  Yes, we may be able to take some account of that, but we won't know how Congress will react We won't know a lot of things, so there will be some continuing uncertainties The only other thing I would say as a preliminary point--in terms of psychology, imagery, and substance in the light of what we have said in the past--is that I don't see how we can avoid some reduction in some or all of these targets, properly interpreted I'm not saying just what the arithmetic is going to look like, but--  Well, let us discuss it now at this point Who would like to comment?  Well, let us proceed Who would like to comment? Mr Morris  I don't think there is any doubt that the staff or anybody's staff or any member is incapable of making a reliable judgment at this point on how big these shifts are going to be The only issue is whether to give a figure and say we are going to revise it freely or not to give a figure at all But I fully accept what you say about the impossibility of [accurate estimates]  Of course, what really bothers me is not only that we cannot estimate this shift now but that we won't be able to estimate it very accurately after the year is over Do you want to comment on the substance of where the target--whether shadow or otherwise--should be?  Just so that the discussion can proceed, let's try to resolve how we present the targets after we decide what they should be, recognizing that there is an issue there Your position is that we shouldn't have an M1 target at all  Well, you are going to have plenty of time to say whether you agree or not What M2--or M3--target would you like to have, Mr Morris?  You'd actually raise them from this year's?  Let's have a staff exegesis of that point  Just as a little aside on the precision with which these figures are calculated and the weight put on small deviations from the target range M2 got benchmarked 03 of a percentage point higher based upon a one-day observation on call data of RPs for nonmember banks in March  You mean 6 to 9 and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent, in other words?  Wait a minute You are going from these down to where?  Okay Who else? Mr Black  If I may just interrupt you, Bob On what page in the Bluebook are these past annual figures?  Well, it's an interesting point I was just wondering, Steve Do you have any rough figures?  Let me just get clear where you are If you were working from the left-hand side of the sheet handed out this morning, you are talking about 3 to 5-1/2 percent for M-1B?  You have 2-1/2 to 5 percent for M-1A What about M2 and M3?  You are not unhappy about going higher?  They keyed to the midpoint of that I don't know whether it implies necessarily--  Who else? Governor Wallich  I'm not quite sure what you are saying about the targets we should state for M1  Without the bottom row?  Mr Guffey  Mr Solomon  Mr Schultz  What would you do about the bottom row?  No  Yes  -118-    2/2-3/81  Mr Boehne  Governor Rice  What would you do about the bottom row?  Mr Roos  Mr Mayo  I don't think we can do that  Well, let's not raise that subject right now You're saying, Mr Mayo, don't give these bottom row targets?  Mr Corrigan  Governor Teeters  Is that what we did last year?  Yes  SPEAKER(?) What was the [miss] again?  We'll improvise [Unintelligible] if the figures are any good to start with  Are you saying announce the bottom line?  Governor Gramley  Mr Balles  Governor Partee  Declare that we're reducing them but not reduce them?  Mr Ford  Mr Winn  Mr Boykin, you're left  You'll get more confused as you go on! Governor Partee has been around here for a while  Well, this morning we have a little coffee and orange juice  SPEAKER(?) Hear, hear!  SPEAKER(?) We need it!  SPEAKER(?) We're going to need more than that!  How about a little scotch this morning?  It's conceivable to me, since we're not yet at the short-term targets, that the meeting may continue after lunch a bit  SPEAKER(?) Are we going to eat here?  No  [Coffee break]  Where are our absentees?  SPEAKER(?) They're going to a shadow meeting of the Committee!  I will accept the injunction to a considerable degree that the presentational problem is going to have to be decided by the Chairman when he testifies I don't think there's any readily soluble way The more I think about it, the more I think we have to give the public some indication initially, however tentatively, of the way the real numbers might or might not come out, just to give some flavor The fact that they are way off--the jog at the beginning of the year--I am worried about It makes the charts such as those in the Bluebook look not very good because we're so far off [target] right off the bat Maybe we can defer being even halfway decisive about it, but I think we've got to give [the public] some indication That is my current conclusion on that I certainly think we have to show some reduction in the ranges, as I said at the beginning But I guess I do look at these targets differently than some of you, or maybe all of you, look at them  I think we accomplished two things this morning In the decision we will give some flavor of the general direction in which we want to go [in setting the ranges in the future]; and that has to be down, consistent with everything we've been saying But maybe more importantly in terms of how we come out in the remainder of the year, once having stated the ranges, they become something of a discipline on us I'm not one who thinks that we have the capability of necessarily reaching all these targets all the time, not only on a month-to-month basis but even by year-end You know, there's nothing magic about the final quarter of a year We cite these targets and tend to look at them fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter Last year we  -128-    2/2-3/81  happened to have had a high fourth quarter If we looked at an average for the year as a whole, we came out within the target ranges; but since the focus is on the fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter period, they look a little high It is quite possible, the way the figures are going now, that if one looked at it from the fourth quarter of '79 to the first quarter of '81, we would look comfortably within the targets that we set Well, maybe not comfortably, but within anyway It depends upon what happens for the next two months So, I think we can exaggerate our control and the importance of being precise with the ranges But I don't think there's any question that there is a discipline That discipline operates, in my opinion, when we're in the vicinity of the upper end of the target range; the rest of the target range doesn't make much difference  The way I observe what I've seen going on here for the last couple of days--I hope not completely unfairly--is that we were presented with a gloomy economic forecast by some standards I could imagine a considerably more gloomy one, in fact The staff doesn't have a real recession in this forecast but I don't think we could discount having something that would be called a real recession That's not the only forecast one could have; one could obviously have a more ebullient one too There is a general question, which I guess is the most important question, of how serious we are about dealing with inflation I got a little feeling, as I listened to the conversation, that we're like everybody else in the world on that Everybody likes to get rid of inflation but when one comes up to actions that might actually do something about inflation, implicitly or explicitly, one says "Well, inflation isn't that bad compared to the alternatives" We see the risks of the alternative of a sour economy and an outright recession this year So, maybe there's a little tendency to shrink back on what we say we want to do on the inflation side I don't want to shrink back very far; that is my general bias for all the reasons we have stated in our rhetoric but don't always carry through on The history of these things in the past, as we all keep telling ourselves, is that when we come to the crunch, we back off In a general sense the question here is whether we should back off  In terms of the general setting that we have, my own guess would be--and I suppose it can't be anymore than a guess--that almost any range we set that shows a reduction will be readily accepted by the Congress and the Administration and everybody else because we've said we're going to do that Everybody has [understood] this little lesson that we've got to reduce the ranges in order to deal with inflation, and we're not going to run into a lot of flak in the short run about anything we're talking about or what has been set before us I obviously can't be sure of that, but that would be my assumption The only question I might get is Why did you tentatively reduce the ranges only by 1/2 percentage point? I have not yet gotten the question Why did you reduce them at all? I'm not saying that these people have thought this all through; I'm not suggesting that at all But that is the common impression  Now, in fact, what we're going to be doing is fighting the upper side of the range; talk about the midpoints and the lower end of the range may not be very relevant But I'm not sure that fighting the upper end of the range isn't right where we should be if we're going to have a sour business outlook People are going to be  -129-    2/2-3/81  complaining about Federal Reserve policy It is not the worst position in the world to be in to say Look, our only risk is that we're exceeding our range, not that we're down at the midpoint or below If we're in the low part of a range or at the midpoint of the range and the economy is sour, we're sure to have everybody telling us that we have to ease up because we're not even exceeding our own ranges and the economy is awful So, I do think there is an element of internal discipline and external explanation in assuming that the relevant part of the range will be the upper part of the range and not the midpoint or, certainly, the lower part of the range The lower part of the range in my conception of the world is something we'd accept if some of these relationships go off; our instinctive judgment is that we wouldn't want to be all that easy in an ordinary sense despite the fact that the [monetary growth] figures were coming in low, given what is going on in the economy and what is going on in interest rates or whatever We have a safety valve so we can say we're not below our range But we will only be down there if [the economy is performing] in a "satisfactory" way So, the crucial number here is the upper part of the range, and the forecast is based upon the midpoint I don't sit here and assume, frankly, that we're going to be at the midpoint if the economy is going to be as bad as the staff has projected, much less if the economy is worse than projected Indeed, if the economy is better than they projected, which implies a whale of a lot of pressure on interest rates, we'll probably also be at the upper part of the range So, that's the relevant number we're talking about, not the rest of the range, unless something unexpected comes along and these numbers for some institutional or other reason happen to come in low when interest rates are declining and everything is going along more or less swimmingly  We have a great preponderance of opinion for alternative I and for looking at it from the viewpoint of the left-hand side of the sheet that was given us, leaving aside the question of how it's actually presented That gives us an upper end of the range of 5-1/2 or 6 percent, depending upon which one we look at, compared to an actual outcome last year of 6-1/4 or 6-3/4 percent It's a reduction of something like 1/2 or 3/4 percentage point, depending upon which one we look at I guess that's where we are I would, if anything, make it lower than that rather than higher, again based upon the assumption that we're going to be flirting with the high ends of the ranges and not the low ends I am somewhat comforted, on balance, but I don't know whether I'm more comforted than discomforted by the fact that we won't be able to tell with much precision where we are anyway, so far as the M1 figures are concerned That does make M2 or M3 potentially more important, as a number of people have said Let me assume that the staff forecast is more or less right about the relationship [between M1 and the broader aggregates], although there's bound to be a good deal of uncertainty about that; the amount of confidence one puts on that estimate is not enormous But let me assume that's the reasonable assumption as to the consistency between the two If I convert that into my own feeling that the more relevant issue is being at the upper end of the range rather than at the midpoint, that in itself makes me willing to go toward a tighter stated range in order to make sure that it is disciplining enough We have the presentational problem of whether to raise one or both of those ranges It's a purely psychological problem regarding what that does in terms of the imagery we are portraying at the moment The  -130-    2/2-3/81 -131-  staff's best guess on M2 is that 8-1/2 percent is consistent with the midpoint of M1 in some sense But at least with 8-1/2 percent you're saying that's your best guess consistent with the nominal GNP forecast, which is more relevant  But it's consistent with the GNP forecast; that's more important than the M1 forecast in that respect  I don't even know what the definition of base drift is It depends upon whether you thought you were really aiming at the midpoint of the previous year and there's an error in that Anyway, for the reasons I suggested, I would go below the 7 to 10 percent and 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent [shown under alternative I] I'm not sure we want to go above where we were last year, but for the psychological or presentational reasons I don't like going as high as stated there But I have no great compunction about announcing that we expect to be at the high end of the range--that we would be disturbed about being over the range but not at all disturbed about being at the high end of it--and that the low end of the range is only to take care of totally unexpected developments that might for some reason reduce the attractiveness of money market funds or whatever We could get a development in the thrift industry such that they don't become more eager competitors for money market certificates, so that [lower end] was expressed for a variety of other contingencies that conceivably could develop We have a pretty mixed view on this, I think The Committee is pretty well split down the middle in the initial comments between a 7 to 10 percent group and those who prefer something less than that There is a slight majority--seven--for less than 7 to 10 percent, just using the M2 number  The only other comment I would make is that we will be announcing these targets a few days after the Administration is announcing its program I don't know what that's going to be I assume it's going to include Kemp-Roth for three years I'm not at all sure it's going to include--my guess is it is not--a beginning date of January 1, 1981 I think it will be some time after that And I do think they are probably going to have a bigger expenditure reduction number in the proposed program than conventional wisdom has assumed--conventional wisdom now and perhaps conventional wisdom after they announce it--is at all possible But I suspect they are going to have a very big number in there and put a lot of emphasis on the importance of the changes they are trying to make in the structure of the budget and, therefore, in the American economy The question is how our money supply numbers will play in connection with that tune-- whether it will sound like we're doing business as usual or supporting the program or whatever I don't know quite how that will play, but it is a psychological question    2/2-3/81  I guess what I am saying is that if it's the great predominance of opinion that we go substantively, however presented, for what is alternative I in the Bluebook, I would suggest that we reduce the M2 and M3 numbers to some extent The presentation would suggest that we would be near the upper end of the ranges That is what I would propose Presentationally, I think we have to give at least a tentative view and try to avoid getting it written in indelible ink in any way; I'd give a penciled-in tone for how the actual number may look You know, we're going to have to report what the actual numbers are; and I think we have to give a target at some point relevant to the actual numbers rather than say that we can somehow adjust the actual numbers when we don't have a good enough handle to adjust them on a week-by-week basis By the same token, we don't have a good enough handle to adjust the target on a week-to-week basis either But I think that can be a little vaguer concept than a number we actually have to publish every week in print Sooner or later we will be forced into giving a target that allows for the shift My main reluctance about doing that at all decisively right now is that there's such a jog in the actual pattern of the numbers that come out right away But I would, as I feel now, do it that way  I've been playing around with just how we might present this and give some sense of continuity There is a possibility The problem is impossible, I hasten to say, because we really have three sets of numbers We have numbers based upon what we were estimating last year, where we are now, and with further shifts [this] year To give some sense of continuity in terms of the M1 numbers anyway, I was wondering whether we could take the cone we had last year, which is the conventional way to express these things, and adjust it for what actually happened to the numbers That means that the actual figure is very close to the cone for the fourth quarter We could take the top of that cone and extend it by whatever percentage we have decided on here It would be extended in the case of M-1B by 6-1/2 percent-- we'd have to go off the right-hand side of the sheet--and by 4-1/4 percent for M-1A, if [alternative I] is the decision we make Then we would extend the bottom part of the cone by the same percentage and we would have created a channel which is consistent with the 4 to 6-1/2 percent target or the 1-3/4 percent to 4-1/4 percent target But the cone would coincide with the channel by the fourth quarter Thus we would have established a channel in which to operate with exactly the same upper end of the line as the cone But the bottom end of the channel starts from last year's target rather than where we are at the moment It's the same information; it's just presented in a different way so that we can link the one target to the next I don't know whether one would call that base drift or not It creates the same channel we had last year  That's what you do, yes  -132-    2/2-3/81  That is true One of the difficulties with this portrayal is that there is an angle where they join The angle is so small it is not perceptible to the naked eye I don't know that it's worth lingering over this; it's a presentational matter If we literally attached it to the cones with the current estimates that we're using, the actual is 1/4 percentage point above the cone If we did it this way and we wanted to get in the channel, our effective target from the actual is 1/4 percentage point lower than the target itself would suggest  Well, I'm not sure it's a good idea One can go that far and it's fairly simple I think I can explain that much very, very easily What gives me pause is that then I'd have to say "But that new channel I just gave you isn't the right channel because now we're going to get more shifts into NOW accounts" That's the real problem This much can be explained simply  [Yes], if we literally did what I just described and did it from the cone instead of the actual and took the present estimates of the cone--we could change them--but if we accepted that one-third/two-thirds split instead of a 50/50 split If we took a 50/50 split, it comes out that the actual is just about on the cone; if you take the one-third/two-thirds split, it is not So, it would imply that we're going to make that up during the year and it would reduce the ranges effectively by 1/4 of a percentage point  That's right It would reduce the upper end of the target by 1/4 percentage point  That's because the implication is that we would come back within the channel  No, you took off on the midpoint, I think This is a little different  Oh  Well, there's nothing very hard about explaining it to the Committee if it wasn't for that last step And what may make it impossible is that when you get finished with the explanation, you have to say this isn't the right channel anyway That's really the problem; but any presentation has that problem That's what makes the whole presentation impossible  That's right We would have to put another shaded area on here That's exactly what--  Well, with M2 and M3 I don't think we can do it because they're too far out of the target  That is it exactly Right  SPEAKER(?) But you can't do it, I don't think  Well, without worrying about the presentation--anybody can have second thoughts--the substance, however it's presented, is that the majority opinion at least was that we should be 1/2 percentage point lower on the M-1A and M-1B ranges Let's just look at that part of it first Just what I would say, I'm not quite sure But my opinion is that we're going to be near the upper end of whatever range we pick That is, as I said, much more likely than anything else In thinking about the ranges myself, I don't consider that a problem I don't consider that a miss in any sense of the word and I assume that's what we're talking about I'm not saying we couldn't be at the lower end if things evolved in a different way than the economic forecast suggests, with much lower interest rates or whatever other permutations and combinations might develop in the real world I am simply saying that we would be    2/2-3/81  satisfied to be around the upper end of the ranges with an economic forecast of the kind presented Let me just confine myself to M-1A and M-1B As I say, my concern is that that's too easy, not that it's too tight Do we have a consensus on that?  Well, we'll approach this by partial differentials or something I take it that people are willing to live with that 1/2 point reduction on the M-1A and M-1B ranges, with reservations depending about how we come out on the other parts and how it all fits together We recognize that in the end it might be presented as on the right-hand side of that piece of paper, but someplace it's going to be presented both ways, I'm sure I don't know whether we have to deliberate over the difference between M2 and M3 Let's assume that whatever we say for one applies to the other There I would feel even more strongly that we're more likely to be flirting with the upper end than anyplace else and that the higher we put the upper end, the higher in fact we might be, given the kinds of problems that we foresee How many do we have for 6 to 9 percent, which is precisely where it was last year? I better just take a poll of Committee members Six Who do we have for 7 to 10 percent? We must have a couple in the middle Well, I would encourage a moment of discussion by somebody other than me--somebody who wants to be persuasive one way or the other  The 9 percent encompasses the staff forecast  That's the problem  Well, what we do about this depends upon what emphasis we put on the fact that we expect to be in the upper part of the range One way of approaching that, I suppose, is to narrow the range instead of widening it  SPEAKER(?) Or not have a bottom  Yes, or not have a bottom and just put down a number We could say we don't want to see it exceed thus and so But we could narrow it; I hate to have narrower ranges but I don't think we're going to hit the bottom of this one anyway  You know, I hadn't thought of that I don't know whether we have any rationale that this great increase in savings is going to push up--  If you took this decade's relationship of 3 percent [as the differential between M1 and M2] and we're setting an upper limit of 5-1/2 percent for M-1B, M2 comes out at 8-1/2 percent, which is within the 6 to 9 percent range I would not suggest a 6 to 9 percent range if we thought M2 growth was going to end up at 7-1/2 percent because that is in all likelihood considerably too low My problem is that I want this range to be a constraint on the up side  Well, before we get there, let me ask a question If you had to guess, as a technical matter, between M2 and M3 which is more likely to be exceeded?  The difference is basically negotiable CDs and Eurodollars, [which are in M3], right?  -139-    2/2-3/81  Well, they're already split It's just a question of how much they are split The staff has M3 1/2 percentage point higher I don't know whether it's worth it, but we can compromise the position by moving one down more than the other  I think it will turn on the amount of bank lending, but I'm a little hesitant to predict whether that's going to be exceptionally big or small  Going back to something that Fred suggested earlier, we could have 6 to 9 percent now but say that given the institutional changes it might very well be that in July we would want to revise that on the up side  -140-    2/2-3/81  Any port in a storm!  Well, my problem is this I think 10 percent is too high It's higher than we had last year, and I assume we're going to be near the top Now, one can say 9-1/2 percent is a nice number, and in some ways it is a nice number Is it worth it for a 1/2 percentage point to present a higher target than last year? That's my problem  -141-    2/2-3/81  No, that's right; but I think it will receive more and more after this  We're talking not only about M2 but also M3 And in the popular view, we would be raising two out of the three targets  Just because it's interesting, do you have those numbers that Mr Black was asking about earlier? This is really M1, but it's interesting What page are those on in the Bluebook?  We didn't make much progress last year on those numbers We redistributed the progress that appears in the unadjusted numbers That doesn't change--  Well, it's pretty close The weighted average is a little better on the adjusted, about 01 better Well,  -142-    2/2-3/81  we have to make up our minds We can try the 9-1/2 percent number I think the real question is whether it's worth going to 9-1/2 percent, which in some ways looks better; but it is going to show an increase in two out of the three targets  If we go up [on M2 and M3] I'm assuming at this point that we do with M3 anything we do with M2 When I say two out of three, I'm assuming both the M1 ranges are essentially one range We could call it two out of four or two out of three Well, how many like 9-1/2 percent?  Better than 9 percent  For M2 and the equivalent number for M3  Better than 9; that's right  I understand Not better than 10 percent in some people's view How does that leave me? How many prefer 9? Seven and one Well, the 9s clearly have it That only leaves me with the question of whether we can attract more support by fiddling around here somehow Let's assume we have 9 percent for M2, but not do exactly the equivalent, which I was implicitly assuming, for M3 Let me try 6 to 9 percent for M2 and 7 to 10 percent for M3  I don't think that's right  Well, it depends on whether you're looking at the midpoint or not I'm not looking at the midpoint, frankly  Now we're talking about moving the M2 figure from 6-3/4 percent, where it was on this adjusted basis?  --to 5-1/2 percent presumably if we're at the top; it's down 1-1/4 percentage points  About the same as M2, about 99 percent  I'm not going to attract anybody else?  You're implying more accuracy in the staff forecast than I think they can bear Well, I think we ought to review this anyway It's very likely that we might want to have a review if anything I consider really important happens that we don't know about at this point We'd do that some time before February 19th, but I think we ought to have a tentative vote, which could be a final vote If I interpret this correctly, we are voting on what is essentially alternative I for the M1s, presented however I deem appropriate at the time it's presented And consistent with those changes, 6 to 9 percent on M2 and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent on M3 On bank credit, Mr Corrigan reflected some suspicion; I don't think it's too important whether we move that up 1/2 point or not I don't know whether that makes anybody happier or sadder Is there any feeling about that one?  Well, we might as well leave it then  So, the proposal is to leave the M2, M3, and bank credit ranges the same as last year and reduce the M1 ranges by 1/2 percentage point, with a definite explanation in the presentation that we expect to be near the top ends of the ranges on the M2 and M3 numbers It would be encompassed in the explanation that those ranges are biased or asymmetrical  Well, in fact, we're probably going to be near the upper end of the range on the narrow aggregates, too, but I'm not sure I would state that quite so clearly  I'd be willing to say that, too, but there's a difference in my mind I think, in fact, that we probably will be near the upper ends of the ranges on the M1s But their relationship with GNP is likely to be more erratic than the M2  -145-    2/2-3/81  relationship, and I would just point that out M2 does track [GNP] more certainly; the velocity of M2 is probably a less uncertain animal than the velocity of M1, and that would be the excuse for making the statement I would not exclude the possibility, certainly, that we'd be near the upper ends of the ranges on the M1s  I would want to put some emphasis on the fact that if we were near the upper end, that would be in no sense a failure on M1 There's a difference between it being in no sense at all a failure if growth is at the upper end of the range and, in the case of M2, having an expectation that growth is a little more likely to be at the upper end of the range That is the distinction I would make Is that proposition clear? If no one has any further modifications to suggest, we might as well vote The vote is subject to possible reconsideration  It will be noted  You're not going to dissent from the decision?  I would prefer to put it clearly in the record that some people accepted it in general, but didn't like the idea of a guideline [for M1]  Mr Altmann will reflect all these views  Well, there is no problem in reflecting those views in the record, but they won't be associated with individual names that way  We're going to turn to the short-term decision, and we'd better turn to the exchange markets and do that part of our job I don't know whether we can get these preliminaries out of the way before lunch It looks as if we will indeed run after lunch unless you want a very late lunch We might be able to finish by 200 pm; I can't see us finishing before that Would you rather eat or try to finish by 200 pm?  UNANIMOUSLY Eat  I understand what the relative priorities in this group are! Mr Pardee  Comments or questions?  Any other comments?  It's only an informal limit, but presumably we would need a telephone call It would take the Committee's concurrence, but we haven't had a formal vote on this, if I recall correctly We'll get into this in a minute Let me just see if there are any other general comments or questions  Any other general questions or comments? Well, we are within $300 million of [our informal] limit I would be inclined to take a holding action and say-- Is that limit $1-1/2 billion or $2-1/2 billion?  -148-    2/2-3/81  I'd stick another quarter billion dollars in there just to give us a little operating leeway I don't know in any definitive way how the new Administration will feel about the Treasury's participation in this, but they haven't [expressed] any objection to what we have been doing They are informed, and they haven't wanted to change it, presumably, at this stage Whether they will or not, I don't know But they haven't yet and it may be useful while we're meeting today to add another $250 million leeway Let me propose that Do I take silence as acquiescence?  We or the Germans?  Well, I said $250 million simply because, without going very far, [we ought to] let the Treasury consider it at some point  We have $300 million now, so that's--  It seems to me a reasonable operating leeway, that's all If there are no objections, I will take that as an increase in the informal limit of a minimal size simply to provide operating leeway for the time being  Do you have any other recommendations?  We have to ratify the transactions  Do I have a motion?  SPEAKER(?) So moved  SPEAKER(?) Second  Without objection We'll go to Mr Sternlight who is going to have a short report before 100 pm  Before I forget, maybe we ought to ratify the transactions right now  SPEAKER(?) So moved  SPEAKER(?) Second  Without objection, they are ratified Are we going to have a lot of questions on this? Who knows? Let's spend five minutes and see whether we can dispose of comments or questions in that time Who has a comment or question?  Well, it was an interesting period I don't mean to shut off discussion Is everybody satisfied? Well, we will come back from lunch and have Mr Axilrod present the short-range targets I wonder if we can get back here by, let's say, 140 pm  -150-    2/2-3/81  [Lunch break]  We have carefully observed, as I said earlier, everybody's arrival time Mr Schultz was not among the early ones! We've already made the decision, but I wanted to note that this is Bob Mayo's last meeting and he has rendered valued service through the years and we're [unintelligible]  I understand that you're going to be here at the time of our next meeting--if not at the meeting, in the surrounding area--and we will duly note the occasion Mr Axilrod  Just to make sure we're clear All these numbers you're talking about are not real numbers They're numbers that exist in your head  But they are adjusted numbers, as best one can adjust them from the estimates we have of the shift The actual numbers will look different from this  But the actual numbers themselves rest upon particular assumptions about shifts  We're obviously now in a difficult period where assessments have to be made about the amount of shifting to track these figures at all, so far as M1 is concerned But apart from that difficulty I suppose the question that is raised is one of tactics That is, are we relatively satisfied for a while with a shortfall from the target that was just established in the interest of a better possibility of hitting that target for the year as a whole in whatever contour [emerges] in connection with tax cutting programs or whatever As with the economic projection, there is also, I would think, some consideration of the fact that in the last two quarters we overshot by a significant margin And any undershoot from the annual target has to be assessed not only in the light of what we want to do next year but in the light of the overshoot in the most recent period  Well, the economic forecast doesn't rest on these quarterly figures that we have  I wonder a bit Nobody knows about the interest rate forecast associated with any of these numbers There seems to be some tendency for interest rates to decline during the period when money supply growth on balance has been negative  Well, in accordance with our earlier discussion, I think we should have a little discussion of what these targets mean for where we're setting the operational nonborrowed reserve target--or looked at the other way around, the immediate figure on borrowings and in the light of any movement in these numbers how we might react With all that preliminary, would someone like to say something?  Well, let's talk about the alternatives first and then talk about the borrowing assumption  The only problem with that is that I don't believe that forecast; I have reservations  The interest rate forecast is derived from some quarterly forecast, isn't it?  I understand that, but it seems to me that whatever velocity increase we're going to get we've already gotten, so to speak, if we look at monthly figures  Last time we did say 4-1/4 percent or less basically  Does anybody else have a suggestion here? Mr Boehne  Who else?  Mr Winn  I worry about it literally  You say we're well outside of the range Where are you measuring it from? We were too high in the fourth quarter; we now look a little low only because December was low  Mr Corrigan  I don't think we have any alternative but to rely upon whatever estimates and changing estimates the staff may make as we go along I don't have great faith in their estimates, but I wouldn't have any more faith in any estimates that we try to make up here I think we're just stuck with that It may make us a little more sensitive to wide gyrations in interest rates; we may at least want to use that to a small extent as an indicator Governor Wallich  Mr Guffey  -156-    2/2-3/81  I suspect in this connection that you have worked out here someplace--these are monthly figures on page 9--what the implied quarterly average is?  Right, they are low  That's right; it's because of December being low What we might do is think of it as an average of those two figures  That works out fine [Unintelligible] the average is high, and if you look at the quarterly figure, it is low  Are you suggesting a funds rate range?  15 to 20 percent  Who else? Mr Morris  Between "A" and "B"?  Who else? Mr Balles or Mr Mayo  Let's get to that at the next stage Do you have a federal funds opinion, Mr Balles?  Mr Mayo  In all this talk, which I share, that we can't interpret these figures with precision, let us not forget that we can't interpret them with precision even when the numbers are not distorted We have a plus or minus 10 percent error anyway, so we are only slightly worse off in some sense than we ordinarily are  Mr Black  Mr Roos  Governor Rice  Who are we missing? Mr Ford  Who else is missing? Mr Boykin  Somebody else is missing here Whom did I not count?  I guess that's right; I don't have [Mr Gramley]  Where are you on the federal funds range?  -160-    2/2-3/81  For the very reasons Roger suggested--and also because of the fact that we were high for about 5 months, not [just] the last 2 months--if I look at the quarterly averages, I'm not the least bit concerned about having a low quarter on a monthly average basis I don't think we want declines in the money supply as we look ahead We know we don't have all that close control over these things, but it would concern me if the money supply began moving into the kind of fall that it did last year, and I think we ought to respond to that Short of that, I don't think we have much to worry about in the short run On the federal funds rate range, a majority of the Committee wants a top limit of 20 percent or below, and that's true of almost all the participants not on the Committee I would propose that we not put the federal funds rate range above 20 percent [Views on] the bottom are scattered around 14 and 15 percent I'm not sure that's too terribly vital at this point The range is 15 to 20 percent now I suppose absolutely the most neutral thing to do is to leave it where it is We are right in the middle of that range now  I share the view that some place between "B" and "C" is right I share the instinct that Governor Gramley just expressed in that I wouldn't want to make a great effort to get down as low as "C" or below "B," if that took a lot of effort But I would not be very disturbed if it goes there without any effort This all bears upon where we put the borrowing number We have to put some numbers down here I wonder whether they shouldn't be expressed as a quarterly average What have we been doing recently? Have we been expressing them as quarterly averages or--?  The reason that occurred to me is that some of these numbers sound rather high to put down as a target when we just adopted a long-range target [with an upper limit of] 5-1/2 percent If we suddenly put down a number that says we are starting off fresh out of the box with 6-1/2 percent, even though we can rationalize it, I don't know how many readers are going to be rationalizing it  What is the target we just adopted 3 to 5-1/2 percent?  For M-1B?  It's 3-1/2 to 6 percent for M-1B and 3 to 5-1/2 percent for M-1A  Well, it's a round number It's going to be either 5-1/2 or 6 percent, I guess, or we can say roughly 5 to 6 percent if we want to indicate a little less precision One thing for sure We won't be between 5 and 6 if we say 5 to 6 percent for a 2-month period  Nobody will ever know what the number is anyway  I'm looking at the December-to-March numbers, yes  Well, I suppose if we say 5 to 6 percent, they will assume 5-1/2 percent  Well, both of these numbers are the same So what I'm talking about are both the M1 numbers  They're both the same now  Why is that?  What's your explanation of why in "C" M-1B is different from M-1A?  But why isn't it the same for the others?  I think we are at a level of detail that isn't going to be significant  Well, I don't know on what basis it is That's what Frank is questioning Is that a hypothetical reserve figure?  You think it has to be that high?  -163-    2/2-3/81  If anything, we have had a slightly declining trend in the money supply since the first week of January Why would we be increasing the borrowing?  Well, I don't know where the funds rate should be But just looking at the last few weeks, the tendency is for the money supply to decline with our current level of borrowing, and I would think the natural thing to have, until you have shown us differently, is a somewhat lower level of borrowing  Well, I don't know what the total reserves have to do with the money supply  It's increasing nonborrowed reserves  I don't think it works that way, Larry Your basic idea, I think, may be useful I'm not sure we could write the language here The borrowings aren't totally predictable, but for the most part we make them what they are The real question that arises is what we do with the nonborrowed reserve path when the money supply deviates and therefore generates--if we don't change the path-- a difference in borrowing But it's not exactly unanticipated; it's anticipated What we want to end up doing in those conditions is that if the money supply is high, we'd reduce the nonborrowed reserves and increase the borrowings still further, not the reverse  But that's not what that language says We'd have to--  I think the language would have to read that if total reserves went off after all our multiplier adjustments and all the rest, we would increase the borrowings, not bring them back to the initial level  Maybe we can work on this for the next meeting I don't think the language that Larry has is technically accurate, but maybe we can get some sense of this for next time I suspect we will be here all afternoon if we try to do it today  That's a little strong  What it says now is "In the short run, the Committee seeks behavior of reserve aggregates consistent with growth" We could say "In the short run, the Committee seeks behavior of reserve aggregatesand shall so adjust the provision of nonborrowed reserves consistent with growth"  Well, we will say something about that in the testimony, which will be out before the directive is out  I would suggest we defer this in terms of the directive It may be a reasonable suggestion, but we will have to mention something about this in the testimony  There certainly was some difference of opinion expressed yesterday, but I think the weight, at least in terms of a majority opinion, was that we would be looking at that with a great deal of sensitivity  What we are talking about now is in which direction the risk is with regard to where the money supply will go And nobody knows very well My sense of it is, compared to your $15 billion, that [borrowing] has been declining a little It's possible the economy is declining Without being very fancy about it, I guess I would take the risk more on reducing the volume of borrowing from the figure you suggested than raising it from the current level, which is what is involved in your suggestion [I say that] just as a starting point If we get a week or two of high money supply figures, then obviously, consistent with everything we have been saying, we would change it in one direction or another  Well, I think the primary point, and what I will try to list in the testimony, is what came out of the study But in this sense, it seems to me the most important thing that came out of the study is that the present technique wasn't that bad  Well, there are other things, too I get this [criticism] all the time, of course, most specifically from the current Chairman of the Banking and Currency Committee I'm just using him as an example because of his institutional position He is in a mood where he says "I don't give a damn where those money supply figures go, but you have too much volatility in interest rates" Now, that is one source of criticism Everybody can unite on criticizing us on volatility One group comes at it from the standpoint of instability in the money supply and another group comes at it from instability in interest rates One of the things that came out of the study--I don't know whether the study was all this strong on this point but I'd love to make it this strong--was that you can't have it both ways, boys You can criticize us for one or the other, but not both Now, we know what the particularly monetarist oriented people are talking about Mr Garn has put it quite clearly, saying "I'm sick and tired of all that monetarist business I don't like these fluctuations in interest rates" That's a--  I have a lot of sympathy for what you're saying, Larry, because I've got to answer the questions But I don't want to get out of one box and we say we're doing things differently for the sake of doing things differently and then find out that we're in another box  I could think of quite a few responses to that, Larry, from which I will refrain!    2/2-3/81  May I return to our operational decision? Steve put forward the hypothesis of $1-1/2 billion of borrowing to start with I tell you, that makes me a little nervous as I see the probabilities But it's anybody's guess in practice, I suppose  This is a particularly confusing period But what I'm looking at is the recent trend in the money supply--and if anything it may go too low--and the economic outlook Steve is looking at the willingness of the banks to borrow recently He says the money markets are relatively easy, given the amount of borrowing, so that leads him to believe that the borrowing figure ought to stay up So, there are your choices  If that's what you think--that the economy may be a little strong and it continued--that would give weight to what Steve is saying If the risk is the money supply being too high, you shade borrowing up and you end up where he is  Who knows?  Anybody for $13 billion?  Let me assume something generally in that neighborhood It depends upon how we want to word it Is there any appeal to saying 5 to 6 percent as a hypothetical figure for M-1A and M-1B? I suppose we'd say 8 percent or so for M2  I'm talking now about the directive language We fill in those blanks by saying 5 to 6 percent for the M1s and about 8 percent for M2 and leave the federal funds range where it is at 15 to 20 percent, with the understood borrowing assumption We did have language in the last directive implying that we were less concerned about a shortfall than an overshoot Do you want to retain some language of that sort or not?  SEVERAL No  It might be useful to get some pretty clear language--I don't know whether in the directive or not--about what this implies for the quarterly average We'd say it implies a low quarterly average to avoid misconceptions  In the 5 to 6 percent figure, we're talking December-to-March I guess it doesn't make any difference Well, the average makes a difference It doesn't make any difference, if I understand this, [if we use] from January-to-March  If it'll make you happy, I'll look at the January-to-March on this now  -170-    2/2-3/81  What I was talking about was the December- to-March figure For some reason it seems to make very little difference which one we're looking at  I would suggest putting some quarterly figure in the directive just so people can see it in perspective  I think the directive, in case anybody just reads the directive So, that's the proposition 5 to 6 percent for the M1s, about 8 percent for M2, 15 to 20 percent on the federal funds rate, and an understood initial borrowing level somewhere around $13 billion These borrowings always mean adjustment borrowing as interpreted by Mr Axilrod Those are all the specifications we need And there is no bias in the statement Is that clear?  I don't think it's if the borrowing assumption goes off; it's if the money supply trend goes off If it goes low, he reduces it; if it goes high, he increases it  SPEAKER(?) The path?  The borrowing, yes  Apparently Mr Axilrod thinks it's going to decline That's a--  Yes, the guessing hasn't been very good  It's implicit in Steve's earlier comment that he thinks it's likely to drift off, but there's a considerable amount of uncertainty  -171-    2/2-3/81  Okay Do people understand what we're voting on?  Let me ask another question that occurred to me earlier I don't think we have to make this a Committee decision Mr Axilrod keeps telling me that if we make the target wide enough one target we can always make--which makes people happy-- is the reserve base because it's four-fifths currency and it's a fairly easy figure to predict I'm talking about the annual targets Do you think it would be useful to put in a statement someplace--not in terms of an operational target--that we believe this is all consistent with growth in the monetary base of such and such?  Okay, thank you  END OF MEETING       Mr Kichline, do you want to give us a very brief update on the economy?  Mr Sternlight, do you want to catch us up on where we are?  Oh, wait a minute I looked at Mr Axilrod and said Mr Sternlight You apparently have a call into Mr Axilrod, so why don't you catch us up and then I'll have Mr Axilrod catch us up  Well, I think that's just a setting for the general situation Why don't you proceed, Mr Axilrod?  I don't know whether you want to add a word, Peter, at this point  There is another possibility, not exclusive of the possibilities that you cited That the kind of institutional wrench of NOW accounts has somehow affected behavior I don't know [why] that should be but it's a peculiar coincidence  I have an uneasy feeling from time-to-time that we may just be getting some pure misreporting from banks, where ATS accounts are not classified in the right [categories] with this limitation of three transfers a month Banks really don't know what to do I suspect we do get some misreporting Actually, I suspect we get a lot of it; whether it's mutually offsetting, I don't know But there are a lot of elements of uncertainty  -3-    2/24/81  Well, the general purpose of the meeting today, of course, is that we are having a consultation because we reached the 15 percent [lower limit on the funds rate band] that we cited [in the directive] The question is what to do about it My own feeling is that moving very mechanically on uncertain M1 numbers, in the light of the other aggregates being high and considering that there has been a substantial easing in the money market, is probably not appropriate pending some further evaluation of this We actually set a little higher target at the Federal Open Market Committee [meeting] this time than we had in December, if you recall We didn't accept the low path that took us back to the equivalent of the December decision, if that's a correct way to state it, Mr Sternlight In any event, we have a conflict between the two parts of the directive and the question is what to do about it We can just operate on the 15 percent limit, I think, without doing anything Alternatively, and I think probably more appropriately, we can make a different judgment These judgments have an arbitrary element anyway We are keying off the $13 billion borrowing assumption we made at the last meeting and the changes have been mechanical from there I would propose raising the borrowing assumption from where we now are--not from the $13 billion but from the $770 million We think it's likely to go up anyway when we get through this period Raising that to somewhat over $1 billion and letting the money market go where it goes with that assumption seems to me not inappropriate at this time So, that's what I would propose Let me hear what other reactions are  I don't know which way the ball is going to bounce But I'm a little suspicious even if there were some slowing in the economy, which isn't very visible now but which I don't discount, that we may get a big bounce up in these M1 figures anyway because that velocity figure looks awfully peculiar  [Mrs Teeters], I'll get to you in a minute  Mrs Teeters has a question  My assumption is that we'd move the borrowing [down to] probably a little above $1 billion, but then let interest rates develop as they would And if, after a suitable interval of time, [the funds rate] appeared to be moving lower and was inconsistent, we'd have another consultation  It does not mean protecting the 15 percent floor per se during this interval, but we may have another consultation  Well, it would lower the nonborrowed reserve path, yes But I don't know what the market effect would be  Yes, it's uncertain; it doesn't imply necessarily an increase We just don't know Governor Partee  Well, if we have a formal approach, I would--  Let me just interject If you want to formalize it, I had some wording that I was fooling around with here, which follows pretty much what Mr Solomon said It would say something like "In light of the relatively strong growth of M2 and M3 and the substantial easing recently in money market conditions, as well as uncertainties about the behavior of M1, the Committee agreed to accept some shortfall in the growth of M1-A and M1-B from the specified rates in the domestic policy directive as consistent with developments in the aggregates generally and the objectives for the year"  We'll discuss formal or informal later Let's get the substantive views  It seems to me that fooling around with the discount rate would be very confusing, Willis I thought of that but--  Yes  It's only $770 million now--or will be on the current projection We're in one of these arbitrary averaging periods that we use, and because we inadvertently ran a little high earlier in the period, this $770 million is in that sense artificially low So, the current assumption is that on the same mechanics the borrowings would go up anyway based upon current projections of the money supply in the next reserve averaging period two weeks away And they would be around $950 million But right at the moment they're below that The current expectation is that if we didn't do anything, we'd be back at $950 million in borrowing anyway two weeks from now  $300 million anyway  Well, my proposal is that we wouldn't do anything with it, but we would recognize that market rates might be above or below it If they were significantly below, we might want to have another consultation in a couple of weeks or a week or whatever    2/24/81  Well, I don't know that we would consult if it were 14-1/2 percent, just having consulted today; but if it got down toward 14 percent, I certainly think we'd have another one, just consistent with the basic directive  Who is next?  I might add to that If we got a further very distinct softening in M1 instead of the reverse, I think we ought to meet again, too We've got to keep this under close review Who else has not talked here? Governor Rice?  Governor Schultz?  Mr Black?  Mrs Teeters, you haven't expressed a view You asked a question but didn't express an opinion  Mr Boykin  Okay I don't know whether we have any comment from San Francisco or Philadelphia where the presidents aren't available Well, there seems to be a general agreement with maybe a little restiveness Let me report to you an arithmetic calculation that was made yesterday that disturbed me, which may bear upon this a bit If you literally took our targets for this year and we hit them exactly every quarter, the average level for the year would be significantly higher than last year, even though the target is lower That's a result I don't like much  If we were on target every quarter on the average, the average level of the money supply for this year would be higher than it was last year  Yes, the midpoint of the target  The reason you get that result is, in effect, the base drift problem We ended up last year very high, and that's where the new target takes off from So if one were looking at the year-to-year change, the target is too high unless we have a shortfall sometime during the year  Well, we've already got it for six weeks, but the data are inadequate The question remains as to whether or not we want to incorporate this in a formal finding, which would be reported when we publish [the policy record] I think we can do it either way One can argue that the more straightforward way is just to report it It's not really a new directive; it's an instruction to the Desk as to how to conduct [operations] when we have the aggregates going in somewhat different directions and in the light of the 15 percent limit I think we can well justify the written modification  Well, when we have reached the top, I think we've done it different ways at different times When we actually relaxed the limit, we did a formal relaxation  Well, M1-B would be higher if the percentage coming out of [savings] were higher  Yes, we already have the percentage coming out of savings at 75 to 80 percent The other possibility is that we're not getting all the ATS accounts reported  You were looking into that out in Minneapolis, weren't you, Jerry?  Yes Of course, that's reflected in the strength of M2  Well, what's the general sentiment about whether to make a formal modification of the directive?  We did take a formal vote in December; that was the most recent time Well, we have some mixed opinions Let me just check quickly Governor Gramley, do want to be formal or informal?  Mr Guffey?  There's no question that we are changing the nonborrowed path from a mechanical application of what we decided last time Put another way, one could say it's being shifted in the light of M2, which is in the directive, and in the light of the 15 percent, which is in the directive too That's why we can do it either way But you're basically a formal fellow?  -11-    2/24/81  Mr Morris?  Governor Partee?  Mr Rice?  Mr Roos wants it formal Governor Schultz?  Mr Solomon?  Did I interpret his previous comment as wanting it formal?  Mrs Teeters is informal Mr Winn?  Well, we have a lot of immateriality, but among those who expressed an opinion we have a majority--I don't know whether it's a true majority--who would like it formal So, maybe we ought to do it formally I do think there is uncertainty about the behavior of M1, but I don't think whether or not that is mentioned in the [directive] language is anything like a make or break point  What's this? Uncertainties about the interpretation of the behavior? Is that the wording?  Okay, "uncertainties about the interpretation of the behavior of" If we're going to take a formal vote, let me try to read some scribbles I have in front of me "In  -12-    2/24/81  light of the relatively strong growth of M2 and M3 and the substantial easing recently in money market conditions, as well as uncertainties about the interpretation of the behavior of M1, the Committee agreed to accept some shortfall in growth of M1-A and M1-B from the specified rates in the domestic policy directive as consistent with developments in the aggregates generally and the objectives for the year" That latter part is meant to convey that we're not just forgetting about these aggregates and we're not going to let them go down so far that it jeopardizes the objectives for the year Understood? I take it it's understood We will vote  Okay, thank you I suspect we may well be consulting again shortly  END OF SESSION  -13-     A low; it was a high in the numerical sense, a low in reality That was what--three or four weeks ago now, I suppose?  Since then, it has come off that very low valley The market has continued erratic, but I don't think there's any great judgment that there was much to be done about it The tendency was not cumulative in one direction or another At the same time, we've entered into some discussions with the Treasury as to what their views might be on intervention They're going to start out, as all new [Administrations] do anyway, by not being very--let me put it the other way around--by being quite cautious on whether intervention is useful or not It remains to be seen I don't think there's any big question here that a variety of influences have suggested that intervention under the current circumstances is not serving a terribly useful purpose And there hasn't been any intervention except for yesterday, for what--three weeks or so?  The markets have been quite erratic on a day-to-day basis, but have shown no particular trend movement in one direction or another after coming off the valley or the peak, whichever way one puts it I myself don't see any particular need for any systematic intervention, in the near future in any event We'll see what happens in the market, but it has been rather trendless and featureless as I see it, though not featureless in the sense that there is quite a lot of short-term volatility But that's the nature of the beast at the moment  What is a disorderly market? That is always the question  No, this is not a--  As with any new Administration, in terms of their own views, they are going to have to test their way in specific circumstances We had a circumstance yesterday which was obviously of a highly exceptional character But just forgetting about that aspect--though that's an important aspect--I myself do not see intervention as serving any particular purpose at the moment And we haven't done any, so we haven't got a test of it By some measures, I guess the market has been disorderly By measures that we would have considered appropriate ten years ago, certainly, it has been disorderly I think there's a question whether it is disorderly in the present context of things That there is some inherent volatility here is, unfortunately, a fact of life I'm not sure how it will settle down most easily, frankly--with an official presence or without    3/31/81  I think we've gone through every possible variant and permutation and combination of this through the years Sometimes there has been [no intervention] and [that policy] was maintained for a considerable period of time Sometimes there has been intervention with rather specific authorization each time and sometimes there has been a more flexible view We will try to work this out a little over the next month or two in terms of consistency with the Treasury's views There is no definitive answer to that question at the moment, so far as they're concerned But as a practical matter, I don't see any urgent requirements at the moment Now, that can always change on a day-by-day basis, and that is what will give us the grist for practical judgments in working this out  Oh, yes  I said "yes" hastily; I'm sure there have been  I think one can find every combination in past history in terms of what has been done But it has been exceptional to have the Treasury participate to the extent it has participated in the last four years or so Nevertheless, the question has been a repeated one going back to the earliest days of floating [rates], when I participated from the other side [at the Treasury] Should intervention be joint, separate, or should the Treasury do it in the first instance or should we do it in the first instance?  John Balles raised this question of a study Let me suggest a procedure, if it's satisfactory I'm not    3/31/81  sure whether you all are aware that some of these things were touched upon in a System study, the results of which were sent out a few months ago Why don't you just say a word or two about that, Mr Truman? Describe the nature of that study and its limitations for this purpose  It is extremely difficult to identify any peculiar results from intervention per se economically Intervention serves a number of purposes, some of which are inherently immeasurable, such as cooperating with a foreign central bank and maintaining some spirit of harmony in markets, and some of which more directly affect markets, such as a psychological objective as to the intentions of the government in combination with or apart from other elements of an economic program Against that background, what I would suggest is that you take a look at that work, which has already been done And we can consider next time, having looked at that and refreshed our minds about what has been done, whether we can identify more precisely what additional work, if any, might be desirable If that's acceptable, we'll have a little discussion of it at the next meeting in that context It may be that there are things to be looked at and we should have a go at it again; or we may conclude that there isn't much more to be done But those studies are not fresh in my mind, to say the least In fact, I would say I have not read them and some of the rest of you may be in that same position  We have to ratify the transactions, if we're finished with this topic Do we have a motion?  Without objection Do you have any recommendations, Ms Greene?  What was that concluding comment? I am afraid my attention wandered  Well, we can take an action, if we want to We can't wait until our next meeting, which comes [after] the expiration of the [increase in the] line I don't know that this is a big issue; but I can just as easily wait and see whether they request a renewal  I would think we could defer action on this, but if there's any expression of opinion that would be helpful in guiding conversations with the Riksbank, we might have such an expression of opinion at this time  The total amount of the line is what now?  -5-    3/31/81  It's $300 million, so it goes up to $500 million As I remember, when that line was increased last year there were some pretty clear understandings that it would be used--  --as bridge money to a financing, which in effect is what they did, or perhaps for other contingencies of that sort But the obvious [purpose] was as a bridge financing to a market financing or to an IMF drawing, which was in the picture recurrently with respect to Sweden Is that still in the picture, or do they feel so confident now that they're not thinking of IMF drawings?  Well, it strikes me that there are a number of reasons why, in fact, we should not make a decision right now We can have some discussion and see what the attitude is toward these things Assuming the attitude is favorable--and my inclination would be like Mr Solomon's that we have the probability of a renewal [request] here--we don't have to take the formal action We have to see the way they will present it And we can take the action at the next meeting if it seems appropriate then, assuming they do request it Any objection to that?  SPEAKER(?) No  If not, of course, we will conduct ourselves accordingly Since we're on the subject of the foreign issues, we might as well jump to the amendments to the authorization for foreign currency operations and the renewal of the directives, which are standard material The only [proposed] change involves what is essentially a cleaning up of the language in the authorization for foreign currency operations Do you want to describe that, Mr Truman?  I'm a bit lost What specifically, are you proposing? It's on what page of what memorandum?  We now have an $8 billion limit on our open position  Your recommendation is to move the $8 billion from the footnote to the text?  Let me just make sure I am clear on this The substantive proposal is nothing more than moving an $8 billion limit, which is now in a footnote, to the text  But you rewrote them slightly, didn't you?  Where do the informal limits appear?  Well, how were they appearing in the notes that is different from the way they now appear?  All right, I guess I understand this Let me repeat it We have two proposals, basically One is to move the $8 billion from a footnote to the formal text Is this in the directive?  Authorization The other is not to put an individual currency limit in the formal authorization We are now confirming an informal understanding, stated a somewhat different way, that says the total limit on the balances is $4-1/4 billion, the same as the present limitation, of which the limits are $2750 million in marks, $1 billion in yen, and $500 million in all other currencies That is the same as we have now, expressed a little more felicitously  The $8 billion is the only thing that is published    3/31/81  The way it is now, the authorization is for $1 billion and then there is a footnote that says, in effect, except the Committee decided on $8 billion So the $8 billion is moved up to replace the $1 billion Let's just focus on that one for a moment Is that acceptable?  That's right  The $8 billion would mean that if we were long $4 billion in one currency and short $4 billion in another, the net is not zero but $8 billion It covers our overall exposure Is that acceptable?  We can put any number in there we want to We got to $8 billion during the '78 operation, I guess  I'm not sure how that language got in there, but it seems clear that the Committee can always change this to put in whatever number it wants to put in, either larger or smaller  Well, we can make the substantive decision, but I think we have to have a reason for making it If we want to reduce it, we can reduce it But if there is a strong feeling about not suggesting a policy change here, or explaining what we are doing, the straightforward thing is just to do the $8 billion  Well, I think we had $8 billion because that was the guess of what might have been necessary at the time of the '78 operation  We had increased swap lines at that point and so forth  Is $8 billion acceptable?  SPEAKER(?) Yes  Without objection, we will have $8 billion Now, this other issue, if I understand it correctly, is the way it is recorded in the notes Again, there's no substantive difference It would be recorded in the notes slightly differently, in a simpler way, which is what gave rise to the discussion There is a straightforward limitation on how much in total we can have and how much of that total can be in marks, how much in yen, how much in everything else And it's exactly where we are now in substance  How much do we have now?  So, if we approve this, it implies a leeway of approximately $200 million in marks, $600 million in yen, and $240 million in everything else  That's the Treasury  The substance of what we're saying here is that these numbers are not changed from what we now have, but there isn't much room for increasing mark balances and there isn't much room  -11-    3/31/81  for increasing other balances There is a fair amount of room for increasing yen balances, but we have no intention of doing so  It says it more straightforwardly That's right But there isn't a lot of room here, actually, in these current informal limits for increasing [our holdings of] anything  So, we have a little more room for increasing marks, having sold some yesterday Is that acceptable?  Was there anything else? [Next] we have paragraph 3 and paragraph 5 This is an attempt to have more straightforward wording again, isn't it?  I don't think any of these changes is substantive One purpose of the change in paragraph 5, at least in part, is that we now have authority to invest in foreign government securities and, in effect, we are limiting that and making clear that these [investments] are to be in liquid form Are these all acceptable?  Well, I assume that we made the decision not to, in accepting the other alternative and these language changes Hearing no dissent, I guess we need a motion This is the formal [authorization], isn't it?  SPEAKER(?) Yes So moved  Without objection, we will adopt those One other issue in this area is warehousing Mr Truman, are you going to comment on warehousing?  You are recommending no change here?  This [issue] comes up every year as to whether we want to continue it There's no change [proposed] It is being used to the extent of over $4 billion against the $5 billion authorization Do we have a motion on this one?  SPEAKER(?) You have a motion  Without dissent, we will approve the renewal of the warehousing [agreement] Mr Altmann tells me we have to approve one other thing here  These are the basic authority for the foreign currency operations There are no changes They are just reviewed every year and accepted or not accepted Obviously, changes can be proposed, but there are no changes being proposed by the staff This is the basic [directive] for foreign currency operations and the accompanying procedural [instructions] They have been in effect [in their present form] for three or four years  Without objection, we will renew the foreign currency directive and the procedural instructions That concludes all the foreign-related matters We did ratify the transactions, did we not? I think we are finished with the foreign side We will go now to Mr Sternlight  Comments? Governor Partee  I'm not sure that's quite right  We set the path  I am a bit confused at this point Maybe the way to state it is this That I didn't realize you were back on the original nonborrowed reserve path Well, that's right My understanding is the same as yours, but I suppose you could say that this may be the source of the confusion With total reserves running low, you might have raised that path and you didn't  [An adjustment] was not made which might in other circumstances have been made Maybe that's it  That was certainly a factor  Let me be clear about the funds rate This is my interpretation, obviously We made a decision on the 24th or whenever it was which, in my judgment, overrode the funds rate We said This is the way we are going to set the borrowing path Now, there may be some fogginess, and I can't put myself back there Once having set the borrowing path there, the federal funds rate came out where it came out regardless of where the limits were on the federal funds rate The path was reset The only question is reset from what to what? It was reset, based upon some judgment of what the aggregates in total were doing combined, I'm sure, with some feeling in the mind of Committee members--and each one probably had a slightly different feeling--as to the implications for interest rates But, once having made that decision, the federal funds rate was no longer relevant We had our consultation when it moved below 15 percent The result of the consultation was to set a certain nonborrowed reserve path, and the federal funds rate then fell out regardless of the 15 to 20 percent limit And, in fact, it ran below 15 percent almost all that time That was of no concern to me because in my mind the Committee had made a judgment that it would be overridden  We always target on borrowed reserves  I don't think that's true I don't agree with that at all  Mr Roos  The confusion here arises, in my mind anyway, [in that] I had kind of forgotten what the implicit path was for the next 4-week period We certainly lowered the nonborrowed reserve path for whatever period of time was left in the then current period being used for operational purposes That's clear It was done against the background of a high M2 figure and the relatively low M1 figure at the time, and whatever judgments various members of the Committee had in their minds as to what was going on in the money markets I did not remember that the new path was exactly the same as the old path That may be true In any event, we forewent what could have been a possible increase in that path when [borrowing was] running low I think that was implicit in the decision And I repeat Once having made that decision, it was my conclusion or my interpretation of that decision that the federal funds rate limit was no longer binding It's never binding in the way we formally set forth the directive, but we had an inconsistency, we had a consultation, and we reset the reserve path Whatever happened to the federal funds from then on happened to the federal funds rate in the light of that path, barring any further consultation, which we did not have  I don't disagree with that We made the judgment in the reserve path I think what is different and what will appear a little different to the market when this decision is published is that previously when we ran into the federal funds constraint, we said something about the federal funds constraint per se This time we didn't say it openly; we said it implicitly, in my judgment And the implicit judgment was reflected in the fact that for at least two weeks or maybe three weeks--I don't remember exactly -- the rate was clearly below the 15 percent limit  Just a little below So, one week it was way down and in only one other week was it below  -17-    3/31/81  We could arrive at a different decision I think that was the decision we arrived at [in this case]  Let me say that if I had thought the funds rate was declining way down and was going to stay down, obviously, we could have had another consultation But I didn't feel that was necessary in the--  Mr Corrigan  I think the Committee's action did two things I'd just forgotten all the details here It did what you just said and it forestalled what might have been a judgmental  -19-    3/31/81  increase in nonborrowed reserves to take account of the shortfall in total reserves  Mr Guffey  That's right  Well, that is an interpretation that ought to be cleared up because my interpretation, as I stated it, was that the directive literally says that we will consult if these things are inconsistent We consulted And my assumption was that the decision was made and we recognized that we were flirting with 15 percent and it might go below I think that much was explicit And, therefore, the new reserve path was controlling Now, that does not say as an exercise of judgment that if the rate had really gone down, we would not have had another consultation We would have  I think that's probably the source of the confusion What you would have done in the absence of that [consultation] I had forgotten, but technically it seems to be the case that the path was set just where it would have been set tentatively four weeks earlier But the issue just ordinarily arises as a matter of discretion If total reserves are running [off] enough, we raise it We didn't do that  I hope this has clarified things a bit  We have to ratify the transactions  SPEAKER(?) So move  SPEAKER(?) Second  Without objection, we shall ratify them If we could take a moment, just in logical order, we have the authorization for domestic open market operations to review This, again, is a routine item for the [annual organization] meeting There is no change proposed It's the basic authorization for domestic operations  SPEAKER(?) Move it  SPEAKER(?) Second  Any discussion? Without objection, we shall approve it Maybe we should just slip in this lending issue, too, while you have the table, Mr Sternlight  This one seems to be a little less routine than the others We do have to justify this in terms of promoting the ends of open market operations, I guess, and that is a matter of judgment Mr Sternlight has so indicated I'm not sure that this is a business that we should be in, as a matter of routine; it really should have that justification But we have the authorization and we've done this for how many years now?  Well, I don't think the markets should use this as too much of a crutch There is an effort--we charge a penalty rate on this stuff compared to what the market charges, don't we?  That is at least one indication of [our objective of] discouraging it and not using it excessively Do we have a motion on this one?  I need a second  SPEAKER(?) Second  Without objection, we will approve this I think that is all the authorizations and directives and so forth that have to be approved So, we can go to the substance of our discussion Mr Kichline  I will just make one preliminary comment myself As we focus on these numbers, let us recognize that we are not [skillful] enough to hit any of them And we are engaged in an exercise [of assessing] which way the risks go in substantial part, following a period when velocity has been way off from expectations or interest rates have been way off from expectations, however you want to state it In fact, they have both been off from expectations I suspect that when we sat here the last time we were all somewhat [expecting], in setting the reserve path, that interest rates were going to go up with any of the reserve paths Instead, they came down by quite a few percentage points, which cast a quite different light on things as the period progressed There is nothing we can do to    3/31/81  eliminate those uncertainties I just think we ought to be aware of them Who would like to comment? Mr Balles  That's from January to March or December to March?  Well, I think your comments are very well taken in the vein that there is uncertainty here, which I doubt we can resolve completely, but we've got to keep looking at it I think we just have to recognize that there is a band of uncertainty And in that connection, we assumed in the target for the actual figures, the equivalent target, that this would pretty quickly go down to two- thirds, didn't we?  You have? We haven't published a new one The question is when we should indicate that there is a new target equivalent for the actual figures, if we change that assumption  -25-    3/31/81  But at some point we will have to change that other target, won't we?  Well, I might want to do it before then if I thought it became big enough so that it was really significant It's the other side of saying that this adjusted figure may understate what actually has been going on  The answer, of course, is not very solidly, which is a matter of curiosity It may affect how people think, if people were suspicious of this estimate we made of 75 to 80 percent, depending upon what month If you had to guess, is it the general feeling that that percentage sounds too low, which is what you are suggesting, John?  We will never resolve this because, even if we did it very accurately for this early period, which we can't, we just don't know how it affects the behavior from then on And no banker can tell us because he doesn't know either  The ATS account ought to work the other way I would think the inclination would then be just to call the savings account an ATS account, which means it's all--or a large portion of it--coming out of savings accounts It's very difficult Well, Mr Ford  It seems to me what you are saying, if I understand you correctly, is that one can pick any one of these alternatives and seasonally adjust it the other way, which seems more sensible to me, and the growth would be bigger  Bigger or smaller?  It would be smaller in April, bigger in May, and smaller in June  Well, it bothers me a little, because it just seems conceptually that we should seasonally adjust these things  I know you don't know But as a first approximation I would think it would be more like the demand deposit seasonal than no seasonal at all  Mr Schultz  -28-    3/31/81  I'm not quite sure where that leaves us Mr Black  If we seasonally adjusted it, it would be 3-1/2 percent higher than if we didn't  Mr Winn  Let me just say, if I may insert a comment relevant to base drift, that I look at these targets somewhat differently We look at these cones, which always gives us an impossible problem at the beginning of the year; because the cone is so narrow at the beginning of the year, we're always outside it If we were to attach this cone to where we, in fact, ended up last year-- and we concede that we ended up high last year--and took the targets from the fourth quarter and showed where we wanted to end up this year, I think one can argue that we are now about in the middle of the range where we should be I am sorry that I don't have the picture with me but we're about in the middle of that channel  Yes We're clearly high on M2 and M3; I'm just talking about M-1B In other words, stated another way, we ended up the year high, so having a low quarter brings us back to where we should be  Or stated another way, we didn't change the target's slope much If you just extended that target for last year, we'd be at about the middle of it now  -30-    3/31/81  Mr Corrigan  Did you get some rain in the last few days?  Governor Wallich  Governor Teeters  Governor Partee  Well, the other side of that coin is that if we don't get a high April figure, we really have a much lower number than we think we have when we're publishing it  Well, at 15 percent it's not so bad We'd know it's high  Mr Morris  It's much easier to disagree with the staff forecast than to come up with one of your own  Does this lead you to any particular conclusion among these alternatives?  Mr Solomon  Mr Roos  Steve, what is the latest on NOW account growth in the last couple of weeks? I forget Has it come down further or not?  Well, we will see It would certainly ease our problems if it were over fairly soon I'm a bit confused by what you said, [Larry] I just want to clarify it I'm a little surprised that you came out for "C" It's against that background that I ask this My confusion is what numbers you are using The numbers in the table, as I understand it, are adjusted M1 figures So, when you talk about 73 percent last year, you are talking about the unadjusted figure  Yes, but that 4-1/2 percent is adjusted On an unadjusted basis, that means what 6-1/2 percent or something?  No, right now  -37-    3/31/81  It's only a 1-1/2 point difference now?  And if you talk about 6 percent through the year unadjusted, this estimate may be wrong in the amount of shifting You may be assuming less shifting but, as we have [now] estimated, it's at the bottom of the range for the unadjusted figure  Six percent from the first quarter through the last quarter, unadjusted?  That would give you slightly less than 6 percent for the year then, which is at the bottom of the target that has been set I just wanted to make sure that's what you were saying  You want to come in at the bottom of the target range for the year I just wanted to clarify that That means, in terms of the adjusted target, that you would be happy to come in at 3-1/2 percent or so  Yes, that I understand may be a problem But it's in that neighborhood, right? Mr Black  The unadjusted basis?  So, you're on "C" basically; I just want to be [sure]  Six percent on an unadjusted basis, from what Steve just told me, is equivalent to "C"  Well, you're below "C" then, if you're talking about February [to June]  I just want to clarify where you are  They're adjusted  Keep these two pages in mind  If you look at the last line on page 8, as I understand it-- It doesn't seem right Well, we don't look at March to June [on a quarterly average basis]  Yes, that's right February to June or March to June, whichever one you prefer to look at  Wait a minute We are saying on an unadjusted basis, February to June produces an adjusted figure considerably below "C" We better all try to get this straight in our minds I think the confusion is because of the parentheses The real figures are in parentheses; the adjusted figures are not So, if you were saying 6 percent on the unadjusted figure, you're at only 4 percent on the adjusted figure, which is below "C"  Well, that's okay Those are the adjusted figures  Okay  It's easy to get confused I think we had better be sure what we have decided before we go on Mr Boehne  Governor Rice  Mr Guffey  What was that last comment? It's the last sentence I need  Okay  Okay Mr Balles  Well, Mr Axilrod would have to address that I will give you a general answer The federal funds range that we cite in the directive is the trigger for consultation, and then what it means depends upon the nature of the consultation  Well, I'm just taking it literally I'm not talking about what numbers we put in there The purpose of the funds range is that if an inconsistency develops, as it says, we will have a consultation What happens during that consultation is an open question It depends upon what the results of the consultation are  Well, my comment is entirely independent of where this federal funds range is set, which is something nobody has addressed yet You may want to address yourself to that question  I will tell you what my personal attitude toward setting those ranges is I look at what the staff has to say, but I don't think that's the controlling thing It's where do we want to have a consultation if it went either down or up, which may or may not be consistent with where the staff estimates that the market might bring it Those estimates are not very good They may be the best estimates that can be made, but I look at the range and say, as a first approximation What level of interest rates might disturb us enough to want a consultation?  Well, we'd be having a consultation all the time, I suppose  Quite possibly  Well, we haven't set the borrowing level yet Let's finish the go-around and we'll get back to this subject It's obviously a variable we have to set Who hasn't been heard from? Mr Boykin  Mr Doyle  According to my little checklist, Mr Ford, you talked but you didn't express any conclusion about where we should go  Governor Wallich, you were not very specific I gather you are on the lower side of things  A little higher?  I wasn't quite sure how to interpret you, Mr Winn, but I thought you were in the same direction Is that correct?  -45-    3/31/81  Mr Corrigan  Mr Schultz  Well, we have a lunch for Mr Mayo and I don't think we're going to complete this [discussion] before lunch without forcing things a little faster than I think is appropriate, considering the uncertainties here It's clear that nobody has been for "A" There are a lot of "Bs," quite a few "Cs," and some in between "B" and "C" We really have had very little discussion of the funds rate until very recently I am comfortable myself on this I don't think I would be quite comfortable flat out aiming for "C" I wouldn't be very comfortable going much above "B," depending upon how things happen here It's a question of how we posture ourselves on borrowing and the funds rate and how we react to the inevitable uncertainties that arise I may feel differently about the borrowing and the funds rate or whatever, depending upon what happens in the next couple of weeks If it remains very quiescent for the next couple of weeks, we have quite a lot of room for growth If we suddenly get a jump in April, we're on the other side of the fence, and I think we will need a little discussion of how to proceed under various hypotheses--or at least two hypotheses One is if money supply comes in weak in the short run and the other is if it comes in strong in the short run When is lunch scheduled--at 100 or 115 pm?  Well, if it's 115, I think we can proceed a little further I'm a little worried about how the directive is written in the light of the various options before us In general terms, I take it that people are prepared to react fairly strongly, by which I mean they are prepared to see the borrowing level go up and a discretionary adjustment in the path or whatever, if [monetary growth] began running significantly above "B" Nobody has been for above "B," so I assume that that is the implication of that approach I assume that if we really got below "C," let's say--and there isn't a very big margin between these--in the way the numbers came in, that nobody would resist a decline in interest rates in that possible scenario Where has the borrowing been just recently? It's under $1 billion, isn't it?  It's that high, [$1150] billion? I guess I would at least raise the question why we should start out any higher than where we are, given that the money supply isn't moving in any particular direction It's contrary to a "B to C" view of things until we get some evidence that it is moving in one direction or another I just don't feel confident enough about any of these forecasts to suggest a strong view that we should move off the existing level But the implication is--you know, literally it can happen in a week--that if a great big figure comes in as it sometimes does, assuming that it either happens in a week or over the course of two or three weeks, we would be prepared to move the path pretty quickly if we felt it was getting above the "B" path  Well, I don't know I don't know how to interpret it The latest estimate is 8 percent or 8-1/2 percent  If you just look at March in isolation, that's a reasonably big figure If you look at it against the previous two months, it doesn't seem very big, and the most recent figures are slack And if I take the revisions as my leading indicator--that has been the most reliable indication--they're not very clear but they're certainly not being revised upward as they do when this gets a lot of momentum If anything, the latest revisions have come in a little weak, haven't they, Steve?  M2 is certainly high; there is no question that M2 is high The prevailing view--and I should say that not everybody mentioned it--among those who did mention it, with at least one exception, was to give some weight to M2 And I think that that's implicit I should, though, make it explicit in what I'm saying, that we would give some weight to M2 in adjusting the reserve path Again, I'm not quite sure what number to put down in the actual directive But if I read the Committee right, the members are certainly more disturbed about exceeding "B" than falling somewhat short of "B"  I think that's probably a fair summary What bothers me is how to word this I'm not sure there's any massive difference of opinion I do think all these federal funds ranges seem too high All these ranges as stated, given the uncertainties that  -47-    3/31/81  exist, may be quite appropriate in terms of the best estimate the staff can make But I would get worried if the funds rate shot up to 20 percent here, quite frankly, without reconsidering just where we were I would not get particularly worried if it went down to where it was before, conceivably, depending upon how business [conditions] unfold in the next few weeks The lowest was 13-1/2 percent on a weekly average basis I can imagine circumstances in which that would not be at all disturbing and may be desirable The numbers I had scratched down here before I heard any conversation were 12 to 17 percent, but I had no particular brief for that exactly  It is symmetrical around where we are, sort of  Well, this week, I guess it would be a little plus  The most recent figure is 14-1/2 percent or something?  Well, it will probably ease for the rest of this week, given all the borrowing that has already taken place That still doesn't tell me how to write the directive, which makes me a little hesitant But I suppose we could put in a number somewhat below "B" if that captures the center of gravity, with whatever funds rate range--  Yes, we could use that kind of language Maybe that captures it We could say "B" or lower, depending upon--  What is the language we've used before? It was "somewhat lower depending upon"--  Yes Did we actually put that in the directive or was that--  Well, maybe that is the kind of language we need here Can you provide that language to us, Mr Secretary?  Yes, but what do we actually put in the [path]?  Let me just point out the consequences, not just the arithmetic consequences, of this decision in terms of its implications If we went with "B" and if the forecast is [right]--and I think most people agree with it in terms of tendencies toward a weak economy in the short run and weaker than average in some sense for the year--a 6 percent growth in M-1B in the second quarter maintained through the rest of the year would leave us within our target, but barely, with the prospect of a pretty good interest rate fluctuation if this next quarter is really soft "B" potentially forces [the funds rate] up against a natural tendency "C" continued through the rest of the year, I guess, brings us--  The bottom end for the year as a whole?  It might be more than the middle, wouldn't it? It's three-fourths [of the year at] 6 percent and one-fourth at whatever it was  So we'd be above [the middle], yes Well, these are monthly growth rates rather than quarterly What is the equivalent quarterly growth rate here for "B"? It appears someplace, doesn't it?  Yes, so it's a little less But we'd still be above the middle of the range, I think It would not be running at the top of the range, but just slightly below it after a small first quarter It's right at the middle of the range in September Continuing at 6 percent must put us above [the middle], but not as close to the top as I thought  All that suggests, I think, that we should be more conscious of exceeding it than falling somewhat low What language do we have that was actually in the directive?  Yes, that language was "some shortfall in growth would be acceptable in the near term if that developed in the context of reduced pressures in the money market"  Well, I'm not particularly assuming a level of interest rates All I said is that I might want to consider [an adjustment] at some point if they got high enough I'm suggesting that this is what the relationships look like and if we want to hit "B," we'd better go out and increase the borrowing right away But I'm saying Let's wait and see and get some evidence that that projection is in fact being borne out before we move It may well be correct or maybe we will have to go even further, but let's wait and see  Yes, that may be, because I'm not sure we're talking about reduced pressures It might be that we'd accept somewhat less if [the funds rate] just stayed where it was  Well, let me try to see what we're talking about You said 6 percent is the figure you were thinking of for March to June  Right  I think we ought to use March to June, too  Well, we can say 6 percent or somewhat less or I suppose we can say 5-1/2 percent or somewhat less I don't know where you want to put the funds rate range As I say, I would want to look at it even if the funds rate were at 17 percent if the economy were also quite weak at the same time It wouldn't bother me at 17 percent if the economy were quite strong But that's something we don't know until we sit down and look at it  I do have the feeling that at some point we would want to consult  -51-    3/31/81  Well, I wanted to get to that next I was implying that until we get further information we'd stay roughly where we are, whether that's $11 billion or slightly over $11 billion But consistent with this whole attitude is that if the money supply came in strong, we would be prepared to move pretty quickly, which might mean a discretionary move as the natural result of holding the nonborrowed path steady And we'd be quicker to move in that direction if it came in strong than if it fell short  I don't particularly care myself about the present level of the federal funds rate  SPEAKER(?) Well, I think this is going too far Well, I have no vested interest in 12 percent If you want to make it 13--  Well, I don't think we can deal with every possible contingency, but I--  Just to take the specifications you suggested, if M-1B came in around 5-1/2 to 6 percent and M2 was very high, we would lean on the tighter side We might make an adjustment  I don't think that would require a consultation if the funds rate were in the range and so forth  Well, I'm sure if it did, it will be all  This is a question of whether we give some weight to M2 But we don't have to word the directive that way; it already does The directive always gives weight to M2 as I recall  Yes, I'm not talking about a formula The directive just specifies a target for both, which implies that we take account of M2 I don't think we have to change the directive for that purpose  SPEAKER(?) Okay  I think we have to have some knowledge among ourselves about what weight we give to it; I'm suggesting that be on a judgmental basis If we want to give it weight, that doesn't in itself require a consultation The substantive question is whether we want to give it weight  I have no particular sense that any bill on money market funds is going to be passed in the near enough future to affect anything before our next meeting  There conceivably could be legislation, but I don't think it's going to take place in a way that affects anything before May 23rd, or whenever our next meeting is scheduled  Yes I just want an understanding of how we adjust as we go along The basic [M-1B reference] is 5-1/2 percent or less, but I think it is appropriate to give some weight to M2 That's what most people are saying  Well, we have to resolve that  We are trying to find the center of gravity here  Pardon me?  I don't understand You would just reduce the nonborrowed reserve path  You might be on the M-1B path, but you would not be giving weight to M2 I don't understand how it differs  That is what I am saying, yes Well, we have to go to lunch We'll see whether we can resolve this in a hurry or not We have a proposal for 5-1/2 percent or lower  I'll just put down 13 to 18 percent at this point on the federal funds rate  Well, let me finish  I'm suggesting the level of borrowings about where they are, the implication being fairly rapid adjustment of the borrowing level if we exceed [the money supply growth specification] There would be an adjustment if we fell short, too, but it would be a little more sluggish That's what the "or lower" reflects  About $11 billion or slightly above, I think  $1150 billion And there's a degree of consensus that we're giving weight to M2 if it gets wildly off the assumption here, which is about 10 percent  Well, [the "C alternative] is only 10-1/4 percent [for M2], so we're at about 10-3/4 percent for M2 or someplace  -55-    3/31/81  in there If M2 were in the 11 percent area, it isn't going to get any weight It's consistent if it's--  13 to 18 percent And the M-1B number in the directive is 5-1/2 percent or lower  Either one you would prefer "Or somewhat lower" probably better captures it  A consistent number for M2 is 10-1/2 percent, I guess, just looking here  For the March-to-June period Well, let me have a show of hands as to how many prefer this formulation? I think the obvious alternative is just changing M-1B to 5-1/2 to 6 percent and leaving everything else the same  I guess so We're on the 5-1/2 percent alternative at this point  13 to 18 percent on the funds rate and $1150 borrowings with more of a hair trigger on raising it if it comes in higher than lower  Let's accept it  Well, let's vote on this  Well, we can explore preferences on that How many people prefer 6 percent? Everything is the same except we would put a 6 percent number in there  One, two, three, four, five  We're in an area where the [difference] is extremely narrow How many people prefer the 5-1/2 percent?  -57-    3/31/81  SPEAKER(?) Or less?  Before I ask how many would accept it, how many prefer the 5-1/2?  You've got to sneak--  We already have "or lower" and it makes almost no difference here  Look, we're virtually equally divided as to preferences here Let's go with the 5-1/2  I think there is a--  Let's have a vote at 5-1/2  Yes, or somewhat lower  Okay finished before lunch If we make always finish before lunch!  Thank you Without much delay we the lunch late enough, we can  END OF MEETING  3/31/81 -59-  Yes No Yes       [Unintelligible] money supply figure The next money supply figure, in case any of you don't know it, shows a sizable increase, which is not particularly in line with anybody's expectation or projection and puts us well above the last path we had I'll get to that in a minute, but I want to put it in the perspective of these seasonals And I'm afraid there was some misleading of the Committee at the last meeting in that it was said that it just doesn't make much difference It makes quite a lot of difference--not the seasonal changes themselves, but how we treat NOW accounts On the seasonals themselves, a tentative decision has been made to use the technique which, in effect, knocks out April to September of last year If we don't, and just run an ordinary seasonal, a lot of the seasonal adjustment factors move in the opposite direction from [the way] they have been moving in recent years and the year-to-year changes in seasonal adjustment factors are much bigger than has been typical There are 05 changes and 06 changes in particular months, which is very exceptional and doesn't look very reliable Moreover, the other technique is at least consistent with what our outside consultants said to do when we had something unusual occur in a series in the space of a year Also, it gives seasonal adjustment factors that are at least no more different than they ordinarily are; they change either 0 or 01 or, in a few months, 02; and they all tend to move in the same direction they have been moving in recent years So, tentatively at least, we're operating with those kind of revisions in the seasonals  As for NOW accounts, we are putting in the NOW accounts and seasonally adjusting them Of course, they've gotten quite big this year, and there is a decision as to what to do I think we can say there is no right way of doing it We don't have any history that gives a particular seasonal for NOW accounts We could do what we've been doing up to now, which is to assume they have no seasonal We can do what we are tentatively doing, which is to assume that the proportion of NOW accounts that came out of demand deposits acts like demand deposits and the other portion acts like savings accounts Or we can just seasonally adjust the [M1] series with NOW accounts in it, which is presumably what we would do in the long run But, of course, we haven't got much experience for that either So, tentatively, what we're doing is taking that middle course, which is to seasonally adjust the total of M-1B adjusted, in effect; and we get a seasonal that is almost the same as the demand deposit seasonal, but there's a big difference in the fact that we're including NOW accounts where we didn't before This question arose at the Committee meeting [in late March], and the response was that it didn't make much difference Well, it turns out that it makes quite a lot of difference on a month- to-month basis An advantage of publishing this now is that it makes almost no difference from December through April In other words, it would not change the April level appreciably It would raise it by $100 or $200 million or something, according to our current estimates But it does not make a very appreciable difference for the whole period from December through April It does make a big difference for particular months I'll read you what we tentatively have for the monthly adjusted figures  What we now have shows +15 in January; -23 in February; and +82 in March Just extrapolating what we have, with that big jump in the week we haven't published yet, April would be +18 percent Now, choosing the seasonal that includes in effect two-thirds of the NOW accounts or a little more than that for the early part of this year, the monthly numbers would be January, +41; February, +23, which is a particularly big change; March, +73; and April, +136 The quarterly change, which on the old method was -2, becomes +13 The December-to-April seasonally adjusted annual rate, again using that April estimate, is 63 percent on the old basis and approximately 69 percent on the new basis That change of about 1/2 percentage point is only a third of [the difference in the quarterly change] because this seasonally adjusted annual rate actually looks at the April level The difference in the April level is between 01 and 02 percent, and 01 is maybe a little more than $400 million, I guess  It obviously shows a smoother pattern on the new basis, but it doesn't change the general trend April looks much lower and February looks much higher Let me just stop there and see whether there are any questions or comments  Well, I think it ought to be done, too But I'm not very happy about the fact that it involves such big changes and that the pattern looks somewhat different than what we had before  I agree with that People will say that's why we did it  Yes, we'll give the back data for last year and all the back data for this year, including the weekly numbers We haven't got the weekly changes worked out yet It obviously won't change the direction of week-to-week movements, but it will change the week-to-week movements in some way that corresponds with this monthly change  We would also publish a long explanation of just what we did  Well, that adjustment factor I don't think is seasonally adjusted, but we will show the adjusted figures seasonally adjusted We have two adjustments here The first adjustment is called shift adjustment; the second adjustment is called seasonal adjustment We will print seasonally adjusted, shift- adjusted, figures  Yes  Now, on this seasonal--nobody knows what May is going to bring anyway--it reduces the April growth and it would increase whatever May growth there is Or if May went down, it would go down less because the seasonal happens to work in the other direction The way it works out, these NOW account additions don't make much difference on a quarterly basis But they make a lot of difference in the months within a quarter The seasonal adjustment factor tends to come back to about the same thing in the first month in every quarter as a kind of first approximation So, when you look at a figure from January to April, or April to July, or July to October, it doesn't make much difference whether you seasonally adjust the NOW accounts or not But whenever the seasonal adjustment factor moves by a large amount, it makes a large difference because NOW accounts are now $60 billion or whatever  SPEAKER(?) Well, let's just forget about this--  We have another conversation on [this telephone line], I guess Either that or I can't hear somebody  I don't know whether it's more interesting than ours Mr Secretary, can we clear this up?  Well, I wish this could get cleared up Is there any more comment on this?  Just a second, John We have to get that other conversation off of here Can we start it over again or what?  Look, we're going to hang up and start over again  All that fancy telephone [junk] they've put in here  Can't I call someone now and--  I guess we interrupted John Balles, but let me just say one other thing The implication of taking this kind of middle course on the seasonal adjustment, which looks best at the moment, is that we're going to have to change it again At some point--I don't know when--we should just be seasonally adjusting the total series You know, two years from now we're going to face this same problem and what to do about it Presumably at that point, we may just shift over and seasonally adjust the whole series  No, we published them in footnotes at the end of every month  They were not seasonally adjusted We had this bastardized series; the demand deposit component was seasonally adjusted, but not the NOW account component But those figures with that earlier seasonal are in the public domain  We certainly intend to say that And it's very unusual for [alternative techniques] to make so much difference As I said earlier, I don't think there's any theoretically right answer to this The fact is, first of all, that we don't know the shift adjustment, which bears upon it a little; that's an estimate But we don't know whether NOW accounts behave the way demand deposits did before they became a NOW account There's no way of knowing that until we get some experience  Yes  Well, we made the arbitrary judgment that it's two-thirds [from demand deposits], I guess, throughout 1980 Then in 1981 it's month by month It started at 80 percent, Steve?  Okay, did you get that? It's 77-1/2 percent for January; 72-1/2 percent for February and March, and a guess of 70 percent for April That's based upon some analysis of asking banks and asking consumers  Whatever that means, it came out to the same answer  Yes Well, it reduces that extraordinary velocity in the first quarter by 1-1/2 percent It's still an extraordinary velocity figure, but it runs in that direction When they revise the GNP figure downward, we'll lose another 1-1/2  I don't have the M2 figures with me now  It's obviously not going to move as much because this is a small part of the M2 series But I presume it will raise January and February and lower March and whatever estimate we have for April I presume I can say this That it won't change the April level of M2  Okay, have we finished with that subject?  Wait a minute Henry Wallich  I'm not sure what you mean  Well, we did the two systems We did just the straightforward X-11, or whatever it's called, leaving in April through September And we tried it basically by flattening out those April through September figures Those were the two main alternatives that were looked at  Let me just repeat something Steve mentioned, in case you missed it, because I didn't mention it before The staff did this same so-called intervention technique, smoothing out a three- or four-month period, when ATS accounts were first introduced This led to a valley in demand deposits at that time That valley was smoothed out; that was at the of '79, I guess  The end of '78  I think I can answer that They didn't assume anything But that is relevant to the next subject of discussion  It's the same kind of problem in theory  Yes, I think you're probably right Maybe we ought to fiddle around just for our own edification to see what difference it makes We have time I should mention one other thing, just for the sake of completeness, so long as we have M-1A That is being seasonally adjusted with a demand deposit seasonal, which is probably wrong theoretically because a certain type of demand deposits, namely consumer demand deposits, is a smaller component of that now and that presumably changes the seasonal But we don't know how [it does so] and there's nothing much we can do about it    4/28/81  If that is behind us, let me just introduce the more current discussion by saying that, obviously, we have a high April figure We have had upward revisions for about three weeks, which is always an ominous sign to me Last week's preliminary number showed a fairly sizable decline By the time we got around to publishing it--every day it got whittled down--it was practically no decline At the same time, we have this high preliminary figure for the [week] we will publish next And that is a little surprising, just with reference to the earlier question, because if the IRS is really processing tax payments more quickly, one would have expected a seasonally adjusted decline I don't know what up-to-date information we have on that I keep hearing that they are doing it quickly but, if that is really true, it makes the increase even more ominous Let me just say that for several weeks the reserve path would have indicated some tightening; and in some statistical sense, that was right But the market hasn't reflected it until the last day or two; it is now reflecting it quite strongly But last week, on these normal conventions we use, we expected borrowing to be $1-1/2 billion and it was well below $1 billion because instead of having positive excess reserves we had minus excess reserves of $450 million That is bigger, I understand, than anybody has been able to find in recorded history Let me have Steve describe the last few weeks and the outlook and then Peter can describe the market  Peter, do you want to report on your view of what has happened here?  Well, we have a situation where we have had some statistical pressure, but it was all in the statistics and not in the market until very recently And now this statistical pressure may be even greater just because technically we can't get the reserves in That may be a good thing; I don't know But there is going to be a lot of borrowing, I suspect, today and tomorrow, as Peter suggested It will probably be tomorrow because there has been no eagerness to borrow before people are really under the gun I don't think we require, in any technical sense, any Committee decision What I would plan here--and we can discuss it--is that we  -10-    4/28/81  might think of taking some of the adjustment implied by the high level of total reserves, which we would normally do in this kind of circumstance Since even without that we have a level of borrowing going toward $17 billion, if these calculations mean anything, that does imply a sharply tighter market for the next few weeks unless the money supply turns around Obviously, this high figure, which is supposed to be published on Friday, hasn't been confirmed yet My short-run error analysis says it's going to go even higher than the preliminary figure But we don't have anything for the following week yet; and if we have a big decline, then things will look quite different for May But I just have no evidence of that at all at this point And if something is going on here in the tax collection area that is affecting this--we do know these are extremely difficult weeks because of the big tax collections--we just don't know how it's affecting these weekly figures One other thing I should mention in this connection is that, while we're obviously above the path that we set at the last Committee meeting, we are still, I understand--but Steve better confirm this--just slightly below the midpoint of the basic annual path  Sure  Well, we won't go all that way, I don't think, but typically we take a partial--  Yes  Just let me interject another question Does anybody have a feel about what economic activity is doing now? I would personally volunteer that on the basis of very little--just casual comments one picks up--I don't have a feeling that April was a terribly weak month Quite the contrary But I don't know whether anybody out there is getting a feel on the change in the business situation  April has used up our pennies  That is correct I haven't got those figures right in front of me but they are all hovering just above or a little more than above the top of their ranges They are also not showing this surge and this seasonal [adjustment revision] shouldn't change that You're quite right that they're high If anything, they're showing somewhat decelerated growth but they are high  Well, obviously the discount rate question arises here We're not going to make that decision today  Yes, I'm at your service But I don't think we have to take any Committee [actions] today That would be one This situation may bear some watching and we may want to have  -13-    4/28/81  another telephone meeting next week because what this next money supply figure shows, I think, could be quite important in view of all this uncertainty surrounding the tax [processing] I think we have to play it safe now--defining safe as has been discussed--but things could look either quite worse or better very quickly  You remind me to note, in connection with the broader aggregates, that bank credit, which was quite strong earlier in the year, is quite weak now It's still above the range as I remember, but that is the one measure that has shown the most pronounced weakness recently  Well, I don't know if anybody else wants to say anything I think, at this stage, this is not a Committee decision in any formal sense We are confirming that we will tighten up the nonborrowed path, which is what we would normally do under circumstances of this sort  I would say we have a choice between $200 or $300 million, I suppose  These get looked at every week in that sense  I think I am correct, but I stand to be corrected if I'm not right, that we have not had borrowings above $2 billion Late last year when we had the maximum tightness, the borrowing level was something short of $2 billion, as I remember it  Okay, I stand corrected It got a little over $2 billion, right?  Yes  Well, maybe yes I would say it's quite likely, too But the reserve path that we had for the last three weeks should have been implying a federal funds rate about 2 percentage points higher than it in fact was So, unfortunately, those guesses are not too reliable But I think you're probably right that the market has gotten in a different mood after the last couple of days or is getting there  -15-    4/28/81  Well, I think we have to have one if it goes above 18 percent But I was not suggesting that we just stop it at 18 percent  Well, we won't let it go too long before having a consultation Any other comment? I think we have disposed of everything that I had on my mind Thank you  I'm just getting your question repeated to me, Willis I haven't gotten anything new, no  That has been so recent What is surprising here is that the market has just refused to go up despite this statistical tightening  Well, we are in rather intensive consultation with Congress, and I guess the answer to that question is "yes" The Administration is remaining in a posture of silence on the thing basically But we are going ahead and trying to get a definitive bill, in consultation with the Congress We are right in the midst of that process now and maybe by the end of the week we will have a definitive version  I'm glad this question was raised Let me just say one thing in that connection and one thing in another connection We're in the midst of this consultation process now It  -16-    4/28/81  may be that when we get a bill it would be useful for you people to have a meeting with your thrift advisory committees or whatever equivalent you may have at your particular Bank to bring them up to date and talk with them about it We have a potential problem of legislative tactics and all the rest in trying to get this bill through in a hurry with a minimum of controversy And that requires, among other things, that the thrifts not bring out their laundry list of highly controversial amendments that they might want to make such as restoring differentials on money market certificates, doing something about money market funds, and mortgage warehousing schemes  They have all sorts of proposals or wish lists, none of which, in my judgment, can conceivably go anyplace at the moment And they would only make it difficult to pass this legislation if they press to try to amend the bill I think this bill is in their interest, but they have to see it in their interest and let it go through and fight their other battles later I don't know whether they will take that position or not I suppose some of them will and some of them won't I think what makes people edgy either in the Congress or among some of the trade associations is any smell of bank takeovers in extremis, which is in the bill, or any interstate mergers or acquisitions, which is also in the bill as kind of a last resort measure in the case of failing institutions The capital injection side I don't think is going to raise many hackles, but this other stuff might  I saw an article to that effect in the American Banker this morning I've heard no discussion about salaries It is true that there's nothing in the bill about conditions, but presumably the agencies would put on conditions, at least of a standby kind They would write a contract--this has been their practice--that would give them very strong residual authority in a great many areas I think that's part of the price they're going to have to pay But it's not in the bill itself as now written Now, this is all subject to further negotiation The bill itself is one of those things that you can't understand when you read it because it amends a lot of existing language in random fashion But it basically has only three provisions authority for liberalizing capital injections; cleaning up some issues regarding mergers and acquisitions of failing institutions or at least broadening that authority; and adding a bit to the FSLIC draw on the Treasury That's all that's in the bill  I don't know myself We may do a little consultation with the national associations, but we haven't decided whether to do so before the bill goes up or when the bill goes up So, I don't know [the answer to] that yet There are conflicting feelings on the Hill about that I wouldn't do anything at the moment, but I'd just be ready to do it  -17-    4/28/81 -18-  The other thing I wanted to mention, and I don't think we ought to take any more time now, is that as time passes, I keep wondering about the attitude of the banks toward the discount window We have the same dilemmas there that we've had before I'm a little suspicious that one of the reasons that on some occasions we don't have much reaction in the market to a statistical tightening is that the banks all sit there and figure they can borrow from the discount window at the end of the week We may want to do a little thinking about talking with some of the banks, if they're persistently running reserve deficits and not borrowing during the week but then popping in late on Wednesday afternoon when we can't say much to them That's all I have I'll resume my conclusion Thank you  END OF SESSION     [I'm not sure] if you heard me talking to Mr Kichline about whether he knew anything new about business [activity] He told me "not much," but I think he ought to tell us what he knows  I don't know whether anybody else has any comments on the business situation at present Nobody has any strong sense of conviction out there?  SPEAKER(?) No is right  We will turn to Mr Axilrod  Mr Sternlight  We've had rather special circumstances in the money market affecting the federal funds rate for some weeks, where the banks either had not borrowed and then came in at the end [of the maintenance week] or had not borrowed and had run reserve deficiencies This week we've had the opposite pattern of borrowing early in the week in a very tight market and the banks are now being left with excess reserves Just for the moment, it's a somewhat easier money market Steve described generally where we are on the aggregates which, to summarize, is on the high side on the broader aggregates--where we've been all along, or for the last couple of months anyway They are not moving particularly strongly at the moment but they are on the high side M1 is right in the middle of the long-run path, if you consider that significant, but above where we want it to be at this point We have reduced the nonborrowed reserve path for other than multiplier reasons in the light of the  -2-    5/6/81  higher-than-desired total reserves, leaving us with something in the neighborhood of $2 billion of borrowings  I'm not sure that any great decision has to be taken here In terms of the target, I think we have to recognize that at the moment we're running high, but we meet formally again in a few weeks and we will reassess that target I'm not sure that there's any need to put down another target formally for the next two weeks We recognize that we are high; we recognize that in our operations We do have a federal funds checkpoint, or whatever, which is 13 to 18 percent It has generally been fluctuating above that in recent days And, today, I think we have to recognize that somehow or another But I would suggest that we don't have to take any decisions on money supply targets per se We would recognize that we are running high and describe the situation--I'm just thinking now in terms of what we might say in the brief paragraphs we write [in the policy record] about a telephone consultation--and recognize that we've made some adjustments in the reserve path And there we are There is always the question of the precise reserve path and where we are, if anybody wants to comment on that I'm not sure I see anything in these most recent money supply figures that suggests any big change in that We can certainly maintain that kind of borrowing level regardless of the fact that these last estimates are a shade lower than our previous estimates  If I may interject before Steve answers It's not worth a damn But he can answer the question  But below the previous three-week period?  I didn't write down what you said, but I thought you just gave a figure that was lower  They are above the path But what figure did you give for the three or four weeks just ending?  Yes, but you gave the projected level of total reserves for the next three weeks  That's for the period just ending, I thought you said  Oh, May 20th Okay  I don't know whether I'll need this Any other questions?  Well, I was just fooling with some language as to what we might report I'll tell you what I have written down here Don't hold me to this word for word, but to capture the sense of it I would say We held a consultation on May 6 The Committee agreed that in the period between now and the next regularly scheduled meeting on May 18th--that's only two weeks we're talking about--the reserve paths should continue to be set on the basis of the money supply path established at the last meeting It is recognized that actual money growth may be high for a time relative to that path, in view of the recent performance of the aggregates In the light of this approach, the Committee recognized that short-term market interest rates might well fluctuate around levels prevailing in    5/6/81  recent days, which by implication says we're not [constrained] by the 18 percent, and the Committee agreed to consult further if the monetary growth rate does not abate  This particular version is written on the assumption that we've had our consultation, related in part to the federal funds rate range, and we say that we anticipate the rate is going to be around recent rates, which carries us into the 18 to 20 percent area by implication But it just does it by implication  Oh, I just think it avoids controversy about what the new limit is I don't mean controversy in the Committee particularly, but just that these people who look at what we say with great precision would say that we really were aiming at 20 percent or whatever  You have expressed my feelings more eloquently than I did, Governor Gramley  Well, I had that in mind with this proposal, Frank My own conclusion is that the net result of that last [episode] was highly constructive Now, opinions may change on that, but by doing something a little different I think we may finally get them to look at it in a little different way This is only meant to reinforce that feeling I was just a little afraid that if we either use the word "suspend," a slightly awkward word, which is one thing we can say, or if we say [the upper end] is 20 percent, they would go back and say "Well, it really is a constraint" That's why I tried to avoid it Something precisely along the lines of Governor Gramley's reasoning is what I had in mind But it's a psychological point in terms of how people read it My conclusion was that it would be less confusing doing it this way because I really do think that it was worth the few days' confusion it caused that other time  -5-    5/6/81  "To fluctuate around levels prevailing in recent weeks" is what I happen to have written down here  "Recent days" [is actually what] I have  I don't think so The problem would be the opposite, if anything It happens to be lower today How many days ago did the federal funds rate hit--  We can say in the last week or so, if that makes it better  I do have a phrase at the end--I think I read it "And the Committee agreed to consult further if the monetary growth rate does not abate" I just wanted to get some reference in there to monetary growth in terms of the targets There is nothing magic in these words or the particular formulation We could say "agreed to consult further if necessary to maintain adequate restraint on the rate of monetary growth" or something like that  Yes  But I don't think I really have, Roger, if I may just interrupt This is all filled with subtleties in some sense; pay your money and take your choice But this says we recognize that market interest rates might well fluctuate around levels prevailing in recent days or in the past week, whatever the wording is I think, by implication there, if the rate were widely different from that, it would be an excuse for consulting Then it goes on to say explicitly something about the aggregates So, I don't think we've lost any sense of consulting here I don't know that it will be necessary in the next two weeks, but I would read this to mean that if things were drastically different, particularly on the up side, we would consult  What I am saying is that I think it has both in there  We can do that It's a matter of preference My own judgment, in this particular instance, is that it would be more confusing and not less confusing in one sense I think we really have the [better] market [understanding now] after some confusion The confusion is not entirely absent now; it's a question of which way to diminish it Doing something that sounds quite consistent with what we did last time, I think, will put us ahead of    5/6/81  the game and not behind it That has no implications to me for what we do with the range at the next Committee meeting We can obviously discuss that, but I think that's something we can discuss when we're here face-to-face [at the next meeting]  Just to be clear, what I'm a little afraid of--whatever language I played with for all of three minutes before coming in here--is that if we change the range, the confusion will come down to [why] we set a range for such a short period of time The market will say "Well, what the Committee tried to tell us last time really isn't right They really have a great concern about [the funds rate], particularly if they were worried about it for a two-week period And they put it right on top of the present market rate; that must mean that what they tried to tell us last time wasn't true" That's what I'm worried about  I guess what we're saying is that there is no perfectly nonconfusing way of doing this The question is In which direction do we want to go? I just have the gut feeling that language that establishes a new range for such a short period, against what we just did, will create the confusion in the opposite direction  I have no trouble in principle with what Tony and John are suggesting The trouble is that it's very hard to put it in language that does not say Right now this doesn't make much difference, but ordinarily we take it very seriously It's easy to read that into it That's the only reason I came up with this language, not that I have any disagreement in principle That's what we're doing; we are suspending [the ceiling] When we use the word "suspend," given the confusion that has existed, it sounds as if in other cases we would have been very apt not to suspend it That's my only problem with it  I am, but we can obviously discuss it  Well, one can argue that  I do not consider that question at all prejudiced by this language That's not the object at all for me personally  I don't have the concern because we consulted I think it's useful to consult when these things happen Well, I don't have any problem with your thought, if you can put in    5/6/81  some language that doesn't say the opposite And that's my problem I started out where you are I don't know what that language is  That might do it I was just thinking of something similar "In light of this approach, the Committee recognized that short-term market interest rates might well fluctuate around levels prevailing in recent days and that the federal funds rate might exceed the range specified" [I hesitate at] the word "specified;" I guess "specified" is all right  "the upper end of the range adopted at the last meeting" See, it's when we get into words such as "adopted" or "specified" without saying what the directive does--that this is the point at which we consult--that gets us into a little difficulty  "The range indicated for consultation at the last meeting" Maybe that's a way to do it  Well, that is a reasonable comment We can try to get some words that mention the range That last formulation didn't sound too bad to me off the top of my head I don't think it prejudices anybody; it just recognizes that the funds rate is going to be above what we said was the consultation point before, which is a factual report  Well, the basic issue is whether we want to do anything more; I guess that is an important issue I would propose no substantive new directive I don't know whether we need to put anything down here except for that point I would propose that we not change the money supply targets And, apart from what we say in the language, you understand that we've tightened up on the reserves and we won't, at the moment, do it appreciably further We would do it further just in the normal course of events if the data come in  -10-    5/6/81  adversely That is the way we intend to operate If that's understood, we can conclude  I don't think anything I've read said that  The paragraph I have in front of me here says We had a consultation The Committee agreed that in the brief period between now and the next regularly scheduled meeting the reserve path should continue to be set on the basis of the money supply path established at the last meeting It doesn't say whether we lowered it, raised it, or moved it sideways  It was recognized that actual money growth might be higher We have, of course, reduced the nonborrowed path I'm just saying that it doesn't say in this operative paragraph [that that was] the conclusion of our discussion  I wasn't planning to We didn't have any operative decision I guess since we weren't planning to then, we shouldn't plan to now I don't know what it would say I'm looking at a paragraph here that Steve has written just as background It talks about constrained availability of reserves and so forth This is just something he might put in as background; it doesn't say that the reserve path was reduced It says that pressures on reserve positions were growing and reserves were constrained I don't know what precedents we have in the Committee record, but we certainly must have language of that sort  There's nothing in here that says we made an explicit decision about the nonborrowed reserve path Any other comment? In fact, I suppose this paragraph will go out to you for review in the normal course Don't these consultations--  -11-    5/6/81  Yes It will only be a paragraph or so saying where the aggregates are and that banks have come under increasing pressure and so forth The operative language was what I read you Okay?  I don't know if we have something we have to vote on  It's not quite clear to me that we need a vote  What did we do last time? We didn't change the range Did we have a vote? What did we vote on?  Well, we can have a vote I don't know what the pros and cons are The operative sentence here is the reserve path that the money supply path established at the last meeting is unchanged That's what we would be voting on plus this other language If you want to vote on that, I think we can vote What you're voting on is that the money supply path is unchanged and the language indicating that we recognize that short-term interest rates are going to be around their recent levels and that that involves a higher rate than was in the checkpoint provided before  Might involve Is that clear?  SPEAKER(?) Yes  -12-    5/6/81  Well, we'll have a vote  Okay, thank you  END OF SESSION  -13-     The meeting can come to order and we can approve the minutes  Without objection, the minutes are approved I want to propose a change in the order [of the agenda] this morning I'm going to have to leave at about 1000 am for about 45 minutes to an hour, unfortunately, so I want to start off with the business discussion I've had appointments with the President on and off and he came up with one this morning and I decided I'd better grab it while I can get it You can go back to do the reports on foreign currency and domestic operations and so forth at that point And then I can be back for Mr Axilrod's presentation, hopefully So, why don't we start off with you, Mr Kichline?  Well, we have a situation continuing where forecasted downturns by a lot of people haven't materialized I guess we ought to focus on how strong we think things are at the moment in the face of historically high interest rates Who wants to comment? Mr Boehne  How strong do we think it is? That's just it  Mr Black  I think that's probably right  It's a little troublesome because we had higher levels of rates than this in the fourth quarter and we had an 8 to 8-1/2 percent increase in the GNP immediately following  Mr Balles  Mr Corrigan  Mr Winn  Mr Roos  Mr Ford  Mr Doyle, let's get the depressing side of this  Did you get rid of your dry weather, Mr Guffey?  Well, I'd better run in a second We have heard from all the presidents; the governors have all been silent We'll leave that to you And you can go over these other [agenda items]  Good By what?  Count on the lady bugs!  I don't know where you are [on the agenda] I understand that you have to ratify the transactions Maybe you don't want to, after all of this!  [Unintelligible] dentists  We still have to ratify the transactions  Without objection, they will be ratified When I came back, I thought you had finished your coffee break I see the coffee is there Do you want to hear from Mr Axilrod so you can chew over a doughnut and his comments? Maybe we'll do that, if you don't take too long  Is that all there is?  I wasn't quite prepared for you to stop so soon, but why don't we have the coffee break  [Coffee break]  We have several alternatives laid out before us They take as their low point where we were last time as converted [for] the remaining part of the period, due to the unexpectedly high [M-1B] growth rate in April We are, as you know, at the midpoint of the range for M-1B adjusted The only comfort I feel about M-1B adjusted is that we estimate these shifts about three different ways and they all [produce] more or less the same [results] They are probably all wrong, but the different ways of estimating come out more or less the same In the last meeting we picked what is the equivalent of "C" this time, which I believe [involves growth that] is low in the range However, if I recall correctly, the actual M2 came in a little less than we projected the last time, right?  -23-    5/18/81  And as you see, bank credit has sneaked just inside the range and M3 remains above its range While there is a lot of week-to-week change, I suppose that is the trend on the absolutely most recent money supply figures, if there is such a thing as a trend for about 3 weeks or 4 weeks [of data] That's where we stand Alternative A would leave us theoretically running in the middle of the range for M-1B adjusted but would leave us above, although closer to, the ranges in the case of the broader aggregates-- only slightly closer, I guess, in the case of M2 That seems to me to be the range for our discussion Who would like to start?  I think it's fair to say the range of outcomes is likely to be somewhat wider than the ranges presented to the Committee So, as usual, we are moving in a direction of bias and risk averseness or whatever I agree that any of these results would not be disturbing in and of themselves But it's a question of which way we should lean  Governor Schultz  Mr Solomon  The question answers itself  If I may just interrupt, I have a feeling that this relative buoyancy in the economy against expectations is importantly affected by the psychology of the Administration's program itself, the tax reduction  I didn't mean to get off on a discussion of pain Governor Partee, what do you have to say?  We are below $2 billion of borrowing right at the moment  Well, it depends upon what happens late in May The staff is assuming an increase late in May  Mr Black  Mr Rice  Mr Morris  -28-    5/18/81  In defense of Fred Schultz, that's not wholly apparent to me, [even] with the benefit of hindsight Had we not had the credit control program we might not have had the decline  Ex-post people say that I don't know  Mr Balles  Mr Corrigan  Wait 'til next year's revision!  Governor Wallich  Mr Guffey  Mr Boehne  Mr Roos  We'll get to that subject a little later Mr Gramley  Mr Ford  It makes April lower, but May and June higher  February is higher and April and January are [lower]  Governor Teeters  That doesn't sound like such a weak approach  You're above--  Mr Boykin  Mr Winn  Mr Doyle  I guess that is everybody, unless somebody has not been heard from  I'll reveal my forecast on where the Committee would come out, which by coincidence or otherwise doesn't make me feel uncomfortable We have had a 5-1/2 percent [M-1B] target for the quarter, and the alternative that's consistent with that is "C" But we had a big increase [in M-1B] in April My forecast was that it might not look too good or that people might not want to say that we should go all the way to "C," which implies about 1 percent [M-1B growth for April to June] by the time we state it in the directive Stated flatly, we're certainly around the "B to C" area; both the Committee and the non-Committee members, looked at individually or collectively, are split someplace between "B" and "C" with a little flavor of between "A" and "B" The question I would raise is whether we can reconcile that part of it, and I'll get to the borrowings and the other issues in a minute If you look at the way the record has been stated historically, the most consistent way is that [at this point in the quarter] we'd put in a growth rate for April to June  Well, it means through June We next meet at the beginning of July, don't we? I wondered, when I looked at it, whether we could even put in a growth rate through July I thought about it after the Bluebook was prepared But generally we go on the theory--maybe it's not a good theory--that we set something for the quarter and then review it at the middle-of-the-quarter meeting We can get some of that flavor--I don't know whether this captures some of the [concerns] or not--with a slight rewriting The draft directive says "In the short run the Committee seeks behavior of reserve aggregates consistent with a substantial deceleration of growth in M-1B from April to June"--and that's shift-adjusted--"to an annual rate of ___ percent" This language is all the same so far Consistent with this approach, we presumably could put in something like the "B" number or we could put in [the "B" number and] "or lower, as may be consistent with the objective for M-1B adopted by the Committee on March 31" and then repeat that number If we want to go that way, I think it says that we are between "B" and "C" And then we'd put some M2 number in there We could go that way or we could just put in a lower number--we can't put in a much lower number--and say "or lower" To get absolute consistency with what we did last time, we would [have to] say "C" or lower Last time the directive simply said "5-1/2 percent or somewhat less," so theoretically we could do that I confess to my own bias of rather liking some feeling in the directive that we are not going to hit a precise number, because we are not going to anyway, and giving some flavor of which way we want the errors to go  -36-    5/18/81  Well, let me just get a very preliminary reaction to something like that Let me say specifically that we are putting in 3 percent but with the period April to June In any case, we want a substantial deceleration--I'm just talking about M-1B--to an annual rate of 3 percent or lower, as may be consistent with the objective of 5-1/2 percent for the quarter that we adopted last time  It just ties it back to what we said before as to what [M-1B growth for] the quarter should be; it's an element of continuity and it's not really a lower limit I don't think we can control M-1B that closely, so its purpose is to give some idea of what we mean by a little lower, I think  Yes, it's shift-adjusted We are all talking about the shift-adjusted number--or I am--at this time  Well, I guess I disagree with that But it's a question of approach My [point] on this is that we are not going to hit a precise number anyway, so it's useful to give the direction in which we would like to go from whatever precise number is put in Or we could be completely neutral If if we put in something as high as 3 percent as the center of gravity of the Committee, I would interpret that as not neutral; we'd rather come in lower than higher And that's what I'm--  Well, this is the question The question obviously was not asked this way, but let me ask the question Suppose we have a happy day and those late May figures come in rather low and it looks as if, indeed, we may come in lower than 1 percent for May and June with interest rates not rising and maybe falling under those circumstances Would the Committee consider that an unhappy result or a happy result? I myself would be rather happy And, therefore, I would not want to be pushing out money if the growth rate happened to come in, let's say, at zero in May and June, if interest rates were already stable or declining  -37-    5/18/81  I'm not sure I follow your concern I would argue that without some wording of this sort--not that the wording is all that critical--the Committee would begin getting worried that money growth was coming in too low and would want to raise it a little And I'm not sure we want to do that  Well, it wouldn't be But in that case it's not consistent with the 3 percent either  We can look at this language if you want  Yes, I think that is what it is meant to convey, if we put the number 3 percent in there There is nothing to say we have to put 3 percent in there; we can put in a different number  Yes, but then it says the previous target was 5-1/2 percent or less  I would read it the way you did and maybe even add one of the negative numbers  -38-    5/18/81  Well, what's consistent? We are talking about a very small number for two months That's the problem I always have with these things One thing I'm sure of is that in one meeting out of about twelve we may be within 1 percent of one of these numbers There shouldn't be a comma after "percent" anyway It would be " percent or lower"  How we set this up depends upon where the borrowings go But I do not read this at all the way you are now reading it It says 3 percent or lower and it refers to the consistency I read it the way Mr Partee reads it  Forget about the language at the moment My interpretation of this language, as I say, is very much the way Governor Partee suggested There's no point in saying that we are not going to permit something above 3 percent We don't know Maybe it will come in above 3 percent We may set the borrowings at $3 billion and it could come in above 3 percent Forgetting about the language, is this where we want to be? Will we resist pretty darn hard growth above 3 percent but be quite relaxed below 3 percent down to zero or I  -39-    5/18/81  would say even below zero, depending upon how things develop in the market for this 2-month period? Is that what we are trying to say?  I must confess that I don't know what the operational meaning of that is for M1-B [growth] All I have are forecasts that are right within [a range of plus or minus] 10 percent  Well, I don't think any construction allows us to deal with that What allows us to deal with that is where we go on the borrowing assumption right now I don't see people being all that gung ho on the borrowing assumption that the staff says is consistent I'm not sure it is The staff estimate may be too high I think we ought to get some understanding of what we are talking about here, but the only difference it makes in the real world is what number the outsiders read six weeks from now or when it's all in the past anyway We can obviously put in 2 percent here That goes squarely in between  Well, we will get to that in a minute  We can write this more straightforwardly perhaps by just using a sentence that has a number in it and then go on to say that a shortfall in growth for the two months from the rate specified above would be acceptable That's saying the same thing in two sentences  Well, this is partly a question of whether we want to tie it back to the objective for the quarter that we set earlier I don't know whether it's a good idea or not But if we follow this idea that we set a target for the quarter and we shouldn't forget about it six weeks later, it's useful to make a reference  I don't think we can do that here with the rest of this We can't say 2 percent, which is higher than the previous target, and say it's consistent  We can put in a range I have thought of that, too  The only fear I have of ranges is that we can put in a range of 2 to 3 percent and we won't be within it anyway And people attribute special importance to a range as a whole That's my only objection to a range  You're going to get all excited if it's less than 1-1/2 percent?  The effort is to get some sense of a range without saying we have a range that's only one or two percent [wide] That [kind of range] sounds more rigid than I think we can afford to be  I am inclined to feel that we ought to get something in there [that gives some definition to the] "or lower" It's something of an experiment, but I think it may be useful experimenting to see whether we like referring back to the quarterly ranges in these interim meetings We may get in trouble because sometimes we may not want to refer back to them But if we don't, we don't In this case I think it may be useful [to do so] This other language may be better, saying whatever growth rate we want to use-- perhaps an annual rate of 2 or 3 percent--and maybe putting in an "or lower" and whatever the consistent number is for M2 I don't know [We could say] "A shortfall of growth in M-1B from the 2-month rate specified above would be acceptable in light of the rapid growth in April and the objective adopted by the Committee on March 31 for growth from March to June at an annual rate of 5-1/2 percent or less" This other way tried to compress it into one sentence; maybe that isn't wise  No, I'll get to that Let's take it one thing at a time  Well, as nearly as I can see at the moment, I think we are only left with whether we take this or make it two sentences The question is whether to put in 2 or 3 percent to start with It doesn't bother me much either way  -42-    5/18/81  Actually, now the way it's written here it just says 3 percent and then the next sentence goes on to say a shortfall would be okay  Now, we could say "3 percent or lower" and say that a shortfall would be acceptable because of--  Well, I think we are close to this two- sentence version The question at the moment is the borrowing Not everybody mentioned it; a minority mentioned it Of those who did the levels suggested ranged from $2 billion to $2-1/4 billion The latter was the highest We had some at $2 billion and some at $2 billion plus--$21 to 22 billion A lot of people didn't say anything So, I think it's clear that we start out at least at $2 billion, which is about $150 million above where we are The question is how much, if any, to go above the $2 billion at the start, with the recognition-- particularly if we start around $2 or $21 billion--that if [M-1B growth in] the latter half of May comes in high, we are going to raise that  Well, I'm not quite clear where we are at the moment I thought we were at least at $18 billion  We know where it has been this week so far We only have two numbers What we were aiming for this week at this moment on our present track is $1860 million, I take it And we have been averaging $2 billion, so $2 billion really isn't all that much of a change It's a little higher than where we are aiming right at the moment, but not higher than where we have been I don't think $2 billion implies all that much of a change, so we may want to make it just a shade higher than that But a lot of people haven't been heard from Whom do we have for something between $21 and $ 22  -43-    5/18/81  billion--$215 billion, I suppose, just to split that--which is about $300 million higher than this week's figure  Well, let me just try $21 billion and see whether there's a consensus for that  Well, I'm asking for a vague consensus now How many are happy with $21 billion?  Well, I wasn't getting that precise I was trying to get to some kind of consensus I take it there's no overwhelming happiness at $21 billion I don't know which direction to go from the $21 billion  I'll try it Does $2 billion make people unhappy? I have a lot of no hands raised here Does $22 billion make people happier?  SPEAKER(?) How about $21 billion?  Is $21 billion acceptable? We'll remain very tentatively there at the moment Let's [discuss] the federal funds range First of all, the question has been raised whether we should have it at all, I guess Did you hand out these other--  SPEAKER(?) Yes  I have a series of reworded sentences I have one reworded sentence that assumes we keep it; let me see what the change is from what we now have Maybe Mr Axilrod can explain it to me  Well, I think we ought to discuss whether we want this at all, which I guess is the question you're raising I'm obviously at the hands of the Committee, but I don't find any difficulties myself, and I see some advantages, in saying if interest rates move extremely enough the Committee at least wants to review  -45-    5/18/81  what the heck it's doing I think that's the question If we really think that, then I'm inclined to feel that we ought to say it If we don't think that and genuinely don't think this is anything to be worried about, then we [could] leave it out Now, we could write this to say that if either the money supply is moving well outside its range or if the federal funds rate is moving well outside its range, we would consult And I think that is true in a sense The difference in the implication is that if the money supply is running outside its range, we know what to do if it doesn't involve conflicts with these other things We know what to do in the sense of the general direction  Well, I'm not so sure we would consult if it were running outside the range; it depends upon how far It's likely to run outside the range in the short run, so we would make all these adjustments in borrowings and stuff that we talk about  Now, if it went far enough What I think disturbs people is that we would want to look at [our decision] again if it implied a very large change in financial conditions that was not necessarily contemplated at the time of the meeting  It could It can be anything we want At the present time, I am somewhat allergic to making that big a change in the directive because it will then give more significance to it than I think it's worth  Well, I think we can say that But the explanation you gave I'd be perfectly happy to put in the general discussion as background for this  Oh, it's for more than a couple of days, I think, under the current directive; we've done that historically  Well, I think they've been doing that anyway, but I agree with you  Right I think this comes pretty close We can quibble about the language, but the intent of this is to be consistent with what we've been saying  Well, I'll tell you What I don't like about that--and we're talking about nuances--is that it has no connotation that we're following a reserve path That sentence in and of itself can be interpreted to mean that we really set this federal funds range as a range  Well, there are two questions Forgetting about the market, there is just the question of what the Committee wants to say and whether it wants to have a consultation If we do, then I think we ought to put it down But so far as the markets are concerned, I think that it will be read as--  SPEAKER(?) As an underlying focus  --a further step in the direction toward ignoring this, and they would expect more instability rather than less  -47-    5/18/81  in some sense They'd feel we had changed in some more fundamental way than this discussion seems to imply  Do you mean the way it was last time?  The way it has been?  I can live with it the way it is This is an effort to say what we've said more informally  Mr Altmann reminds me, and I will remind you, that in what we're going to publish Friday or whenever we publish it, we have a paragraph in the general discussion that says "With respect to the federal funds rate,"--it probably should say the federal funds rate range--"it was stressed that the Committee specified an intermeeting range for fluctuations over a period of time to provide a mechanism for initiating timely consultation between regularly scheduled meetings whenever it appeared that fluctuations within the specified range were proving to be inconsistent with the objectives for the behavior of reserve and monetary aggregates Thus,  -48-    5/18/81  the limits of the range were indicative of the conditions under which the Committee would wish to consult to reexamine its short-run objectives and were not intended as binding constraints on System operations pending such consultations"  I take it that there is a general feeling that we should continue to specify something Is that correct?  SPEAKER(?) Yes  That's a majority One can make an argument that in the light of all we have said the present language is increasingly well understood and that we always run some danger of a renewed misinterpretation by changing it at all So, we can just leave it as it was That's one option The other option, if I'm reading it right, is something very close to what was distributed here, which is not a very drastic change anyway Which of those two options commands the greatest support? Let me try the option of not changing the language at all Who is for that? Do I conclude from that that there is positive support for at least a modest change in the language by the other 15 people sitting here? If that is right, then we are down to the particular wording You have one version in front of you  I think you can be sure that the Chairman will [do so], whatever the language says So this is just a nicety of whatever language it is  Well, in substance, it seems to me to say the same thing  Read it again  Very honestly, I don't detect a substantive difference, but it's perfectly all right with me  It's not a change in the directive language; it's an explanation  Well, I think the argument for not changing it at all is that it may be more confusing to change it We'll see whether your comments changed to more than 4 votes the number who want not to change it  -50-    5/18/81  Have you convinced anybody, Roger? Do you have more than 4 votes for not changing it?  Any change we make may be confusing I don't disagree with that  Look, we can attempt to handle that problem I think there is some danger, which we can't get around, that with any change in wording somebody will look at it and say Do they really mean what they say? We can put in the policy record what we mean That what we really have done is to change this language slightly to make sure it conforms with what we said last time  SPEAKER(?) Sure  It's only a formal point as to whether it's desirable or not to be in the directive  -51-    5/18/81  Unless people are ready to change their minds, I think there are these problems I'll just return to my question Has Roger convinced anybody that there is greater danger in changing the words at all?  SPEAKER(?) No  There's always a danger of some confusion here There may be a little but I think we can handle it without undue risks I could certainly live with it the other way It's no big deal to me If the issue had never come up in the first place, I wouldn't change it But I--  He didn't? Let's try it again How many people would vote for no change [in the directive wording]? We're up to five; we have one more That still is a minority  -52-    5/18/81  Do we have a consensus on Mr Gramley's reworded version which, if I can read it, says "The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations" I don't know what happens if it appears to the Chairman, but not to the Manager  SPEAKER(?) Then you better talk to the Manager!  "that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of __to __ percent" Do I have a consensus on that? I hope I have more than 5 votes anyway All right, let's assume that Now we have to put figures there, it so happens  We will come back [to that] Actually, very few people specifically commented on [the funds rate range] Among the people who specifically commented, we have one mentioning a ceiling of 20 percent and three a ceiling of 22 percent My notes only have that many comments  Right Well, I think it's probably a choice between 16 to 21 percent and 16 to 22 percent I think there is an implication--these people may be wrong--that the upper end of this range is much more likely to be binding than the lower end during this period And the range isn't absolutely symmetrical [around the current level] I'm not sure it's so far from the [expected rate], depending upon what reserve number we put in there But I would also presume that there is a bias; people recognize that it may be a bit asymmetrical, but they want to consult if it gets above whatever number we now put in, which seems to me to lie between 21 and 22 percent How many 22s do we have?  Yes, that's right It looks as if that's the prevailing view How many would prefer 21 percent? It looks like we put the upper limit at 22 percent; 16 to 22 percent, I guess  All right Now we have this reworded sentence and we have that range tentatively settled at 16 to 22 percent Let's come back to the borrowing Is $21 billion the consensus?  SPEAKER(?) Ask for a vote  How many people are willing to put in $21 billion immediately? That looks pretty good at a quick look Now we come back to the [wording of the] paragraph What I am suggesting is "In the short run the Committee seeks behavior of reserve aggregates consistent with a substantial deceleration of growth in M-1B from April to June to an annual rate of __ percent" The question is whether we put in "or lower" there The sentence continues with a comma and then "after allowance for the impact of flows into NOW accounts, and with growth in M2 at an annual rate of about __ percent A shortfall in growth of M-1B from the two-month rate specified above would be acceptable, in light of the rapid growth in April and the objective adopted by the Committee on March 31 for growth from March to June at an annual rate of 5-1/2 percent or somewhat less" Is that general language okay? I think that's where we arrived before We have to fill in the blanks and decide whether to put in "or lower" As nearly as I can see, it's a simple choice between 2 or 3 percent How many 3 percenters do we have?  SPEAKER(?) If it's "or lower"  Okay Let me assume it's 3 percent or lower, if we take the 3 percent  SPEAKER(?) Okay, I'll go with that rate  -54-    5/18/81  The alternative, I think, would be 2 percent without the "or lower," but the "lower" appears in the next sentence  What the next sentence says is that a shortfall in growth would be acceptable It refers back to the earlier [decision on the quarterly growth rate] The choice is between "3 percent or lower" in the first sentence, which we just had an indication of views on, or 2 percent in which case I think we leave out the "or lower" but the [concept of] lower appears in the next sentence in the form of a shortfall  Yes, for the 2 percent without the "or lower"  SPEAKER(?) Just voting members?  Well, I don't know whether we're getting close here Let me just take the voting members and go over it again How many--just the voting members now--prefer the 3 percent or lower?  Five, okay  Was your hand up or down?  I asked for preferences at this point Now, let me just make sure Who prefers the 2 percent period? Six  That's great Six and five  SPEAKER(?) [Not] including you  We're down to splitting hairs  Well, let me try Who would accept the 3 percent or lower? Ten  We're within very narrow grounds I'm interested in maximizing the happiness at this point I biased this thing now A lot of people will find the 2 percent unacceptable now, I presume How many will accept the 2 percent?  Eight I'm afraid I succeeded in biasing the thing  SPEAKER(?) No, I was going to vote--  It looks like 3 percent or lower And maybe we should just start the second sentence by saying "The shortfall," which refers back to the "lower"  All right, now we have 3 percent or lower with this two sentence approach We have 16 to 22 percent and we have borrowing at $21 billion [without] an allergy toward raising the borrowing if [money growth] comes in high  SPEAKER(?) M2?  Oh, M2 Where are we on M2?  All right For conforming purposes, we've put in 6-1/2 percent Because we said "or lower," we can put in 6 percent; that's [about] halfway between "B" and "C" and it's a nice round number  Okay, put 6 percent in there  It just squares the thing Okay, so we've got 3 percent or lower, 6 percent, 16 to 22 percent, and $21 billion  Yes Is it clear what we're voting on?  Right  Where does this all appear?  I think it's perfectly safe to say that it will grow more slowly  No, I agree "Grow more slowly" is perfectly all right We'll make that change Okay, you all know what you're voting on Mr Secretary  We can go grab a sandwich  Thank you Wait a minute, do we have anything else?  We have to confirm the date of the next meeting Let me just say that I assume we can confirm that But it's a meeting where we have to review the annual targets, so I think it's quite likely we might want to come in here the afternoon before  SPEAKER(?) What's the date?   Gentlemen, I just thought it was a logical time to review things The money supply, M-1B anyway, has been rather weak We have reduced the reserve path to some extent, as [M-1B growth] got below whatever number we put in the directive What was that--3 percent for--  It was 3 percent or lower, as you recall Up until now we've reduced the reserve path somewhat to reflect the "or lower" part of the directive There is a question of whether we should continue doing that, given the current situation, and I don't think we should I'm not sure we require any decision on a directive here in a formal sense--I'm not inclined to think we do--but I thought it would be useful to have an exchange of views and a mutual updating So, why don't we have Mr Ettin bring us up to date on where the aggregates lie and where interest rates lie and then we'll have Mr Sternlight comment on the market situation  As compared to the 5 percent or somewhat less that we specified [in March]?  Okay, 5-1/2 percent or somewhat less  Mr Sternlight  Mr Kichline, why don't you review the feel and tone of the business situation as well as the statistics  Well, the overall situation seems to me not entirely unsatisfactory We're within no target range, if you take those literally Some [aggregates] are low; some are high The M1 numbers, of course, are somewhat fragile in terms of their meaning with everything that is going on M2 is just above the range, M3 is further above the range, and bank credit is somewhat around the top of the range We're going to be above the ranges for the second quarter, quite clearly, on all the aggregates except M1 on a quarterly average basis Interest rates have been coming down The economy seems to be softening a bit I don't think that's wholly undesirable in terms of the speed of growth we had before and in terms of expectations And I guess we're a little more believable than we were earlier in the light of recent trends in both interest rates and the aggregates Just in the normal course what we would do is to follow the path that Ed suggested falls out of the numbers, which means somewhat lower borrowings for these coming weeks--not too much lower if the money supply is not weaker than projected But if it comes out weaker than projected--and I guess this last figure is somewhat on that side--we'd have borrowings down in the $1-3/4 billion area fairly easily That would develop, I suppose, in the next week really And in my judgment, that doesn't require any change in the directive or anything else; that's just what we're following in the normal course of events Let's just have your reactions to that  Yes This implies no discretionary downward adjustment It says that we're happy with where the aggregates are and we're not encouraging any further downward adjustments, so to speak  Yes, the $200 million was somewhat of an artificial adjustment  It's the $180 million that you've really taken out  The multiplier is the normal thing  -3-    6/17/81  No  Well, I agree with a lot of the technical analysis you provided I don't consider what is happening very ominous; I think it's rather happy  Any other comment? How many people do we have out there? Somebody must be commenting  Let me point out a couple of things I did some calculations--or rather I had some calculations done If we don't look so carefully at these cones that we're so fond of examining but at how we're doing in terms of trend, one way is to look at year- to-year changes We are running high this year relative to last year We have had a couple of years of decline in annual average aggregate growth It's going to be very difficult to get a decline in the annual average this year If we ended up at the midpoint of our M1 target--almost in a straight line from here on out, but only at the midpoint--it would look fine in terms of the way we arbitrarily set these targets On a fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis, we would end up with 6-1/4 percent year-to-year growth or something like that And last year it was only--I haven't got the figure in front of me-- 59 or 57 percent, something like that And it's almost certain that the M2 and M3 numbers are going to be significantly higher in year-to- year terms than they were last year I think that has some significance apart from presentational If we really are working toward lower growth, it may be more meaningful to look at annual averages in some sense than to put all the weight on particular quarters, which is what the targets do somewhat inadvertently I don't like the feeling myself of coming out for the year with a higher average growth in all these aggregates than we had last year But that's the way we're headed  I'm not sure the formal directive did that, though I don't remember the wording, but I think it was reflected in the tone of the discussion I just don't remember precisely how it came out in the directive itself  Yes I don't know about the wording "take some of the sting out" It may take some of the joy out  Yes, if you look at it just in the narrowest perspective from the last meeting, M2 is slightly below the limit that we put on it But if you look at it in the broader perspective of the year as a whole, it is high and is running above the range M2, according to the current projections, is only slightly below the figure that was put in the directive  End of conversation?  Okay Any more here in Washington? Well, we will proceed Thank you very much  Okay, that's it  END OF SESSION  -6-     That's only a formal gavel The meeting can come to order I should mention first of all that we have a new member of the Committee in the broader sense Is he a member in the narrower sense--I should know this--at the moment?  I want to welcome Si Keehn from Chicago I'm sure you are all aware of this at this point I don't know if you have had any meetings with the Presidents yet  You haven't been introduced to all the bureaucracy of the Federal Reserve You can be introduced to this portion of the bureaucracy We welcome you  The second item of business is the election of the General Counsel As you know, Neil Petersen left some weeks ago, and I think we are fortunate here at the Board in having enticed Mike Bradfield to come as General Counsel And I think it's appropriate that he be made General Counsel of the Committee I am familiar with Mike, as are some other people here, because he was with the Treasury for some years; and he has recently been in private practice in a firm in Washington If somebody would like to make a motion to that effect--  That's right, we have several people here who have worked with him closely in the past Without objection, we have formally disposed of that  I would like to change the [order of the] agenda a little because enough has been going on with the money supply and interest rates recently that I think it would be useful to have that background, if you are prepared, Mr Meek We will approve the minutes first  Without objection the minutes are approved Are you prepared to talk, Mr Meek?  We'll go to Mr Pardee next just to complete this part [of the agenda] and then go to the general economic situation  Where are the CD rates today?  How is FNMA raising the money [they need] if they have cut back [on their monthly offerings in the market]? Where are they going for money--discount notes?  Questions or comments?  Mr Winn  We have one proposal to get rid of a range on M-1B    7/6-7/81  I don't understand fully the statistics on the money market funds Everybody I talk to is using them like crazy and the statistics don't show that  [You mean] a thousand or so people, right?  Oh, really? How big was the sample?  Any other questions, comments? Mr Black  It has not been moved down; it also wasn't moved up And if the borrowings have fallen out since that time, they have just fallen out  If I remember it correctly, two weeks ago when we already had some June numbers, we were assuming [that M-1B in] June was minus 3 percent or something like that We are now assuming two weeks later that it was minus 10 percent  Mr Roos  Where is the federal funds rate today?  We have to ratify the transactions  Mr Pardee  The implication is that the Germans want to intervene I haven't seen any [evidence] of that  Wait a minute A 30 percent decline?  Do I detect a ground swell here in favor of intervention?  Yes  Of course, we have independent powers [but] we endeavor to cooperate internally as well as externally Do I detect a ground swell?  I'm not so sure  -12-    7/6-7/81  Trade one [problem] for another  Divert the argument Well, I haven't detected a full-scale ground swell  -13-    7/6-7/81  I'm not convinced that it would have made much difference in the actual level of the dollar; in terms of atmospherics, it may have made some difference If we haven't any more questions about that, we can turn to the economic situation over a prolonged period as background to our deliberations, keeping in mind that we have to make quite a few decisions over the course of our meeting, presumably tomorrow morning for the actual decisionmaking Are you prepared, Mr Kichline?  Anything! Go ahead  -14-    7/6-7/81  MESSRS KICHLINE, ZEISEL, and TRUMAN [Statement--see Appendix]  Questions?  You have a chart here on the money supply  Well, that's what I was wondering I wondered what was plotted I can't find it at the moment  Yes Those are the changes fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter?  Yes, I just didn't know whether they were fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter  I would note in that connection that I've been trying to keep track of the annual year-to-year changes Of course, we won't know what the quarter-to-quarter changes will be for this year either until we finish the year But it looked for a long while as if it was going to be difficult to make the year-to-year change less than it was last year Last year adjusted it was 67 percent, which was the same as in '79 With this slump in June, if we remain within our targets without a weird pattern, we're going to have a year-to-year decline If we're at the midpoint of the range or below, it will be a sizable year-to-year decline in the adjusted figure It will be an increase in the unadjusted figure, but I guess that's to be expected  A reduction in the rate of increase--a decline in the year-to-year change What did I look at? I was looking at the wrong numbers My conclusion is right, but it's not much of a decline That's right I'm sorry We have to be at the midpoint or below to get a year-to-year decline--I'll get this straight now--for M-1B adjusted For M-1B unadjusted, we'll never get a decline  Because that's what we're supposed to be doing  Well, it depends upon which figures you think are more significant I happen to think the first three quarters are not excluded from the year But I may be peculiar in that respect On M2, we are not going to get a decline year-to-year; regardless of what we do, we're going to get an increase of some size And it looks as if we'll get a big increase in M3 on a year-to-year basis I just cite this as background We'll probably get a small decline in M-1B adjusted and some increase in all the other numbers year-to-year  Let me ask another question and then I want to say something else The Treasury seems to think that the budget this [fiscal] year is going to be only about $50 billion in deficit, if I interpret them correctly How do we have a $10 billion dollar difference with only two months left to go?  My other question is How much [reflects] the difference in your [interest rate assumptions]? They were assuming a 9 percent interest rate next year for the bill rate, and you're assuming what--15 percent or something?  Yes  What is the figure on interest payments?  I have a tabulation of the tentative forecasts, at least, that were made by various members of the Committee I don't know whether you can review this better than I, Mr Kichline; I don't know whether you are prepared to Are these staff forecasts the same as the ones you have here or--  Somehow, the Committee members straddle the staff forecast in every item for this year and for next year except [for nominal GNP]  Yes, in [nearly] everything Technically they straddle [the staff forecasts] The staff's forecast of real GNP is in the middle of the others for this year For the GNP deflator, the staff is on the low side and for unemployment it's about in the middle But next year the staff is on the low side on real GNP and I guess on prices It's not unanimous but it's about in the middle I guess on unemployment If this [table] is right in terms of the Administration's forecast, no member of the Open Market Committee who has expressed himself so far [has a forecast close to] the real GNP growth implied in the Administration forecast [for 1982]  This has been a matter of some discussion Maybe we ought to linger on this point a moment, Mr Kichline  I don't know whether anybody is enough of an historian here [to know] There have been lots of times in history when short-term rates have been above long-term rates, going way back  Does this happen when the general structure of interest rates is going down--that short-term interest rates are persistently higher than long-term interest rates and the general trend is downward? In the 1920s I guess the trend was down  I don't know what the historical record has been  The trouble with that analysis, to me anyway, is that it doesn't take taxes into account And we've never had the kind of inflation, interest rates, and high marginal tax rates of the sort we have now I don't know how high these interest rates are They're high for some people and they're not high for other people I don't know how to resolve that  -18-    7/6-7/81  I'll reverse the question It's easy to ask the questions of Mr Kichline, but almost everybody in this room has a similar forecast for nominal GNP You were told to assume somewhat lower monetary growth next year What interest rates are you assuming and how do you get there on the basis of historical experience?  It solves the puzzle unless you consider part of the puzzle [to be the] historical relationships between money and nominal interest rates  -20-    7/6-7/81  I'm not sure that resolves your dilemma The deus ex machina that brings that about is the high interest rates that you don't want to assume in the first place  You can consider that we may have an insolvable problem here and that Mr Kichline is right That barring a so-called disaster, if interest rates go down, then the GNP will jump up And if interest rates don't decline, the economy will decline sharply  Mr Balles  If this table is right that I have in front of me and you haven't changed your numbers, your nominal GNP forecast for next year is a lot higher than the staff's Right?  Which means your velocity must be much higher than this, assuming you use the same money assumption, with lower interest rates You have much lower interest rates and much higher velocity  Mr Morris  -23-    7/6-7/81  Is there anyone who would like to defend M-1B or M1-A or M1?  I don't know whether it helps or hurts, but we had a conversation similar to this about a year ago I suspect I thought that M1 [growth] would never come up And no sooner did I so state in public testimony, it came back up to the point where [M-1B] was [above the Committee's ranges] by the end of the year  Mr Corrigan  Who else would like to go on the couch? Nobody else has anything to say about the outlook?  Well, just any general comment that you would like to make  -26-    7/6-7/81  I'm not sure I share all this optimism about inflation  Let me just report on a few very scientific surveys I've made in my own research  Yes, that's right! I asked a few businessmen recently what they are assuming on inflation for the next five years in their internal planning I haven't found one who is not close to 10 percent I also asked them, when I've had a chance, what it would take to change their mind And they say a couple of years of less than 10 percent!  I just wonder with how much speed we can expect these changes in expectations to materialize As nearly as I can see, they haven't been dented by anything--well, I shouldn't say they haven't been dented There is more questioning; business people are not so likely to say [inflation] is going to accelerate They're ready to concede that they may be wrong, but I'm not sure they are yet ready to take a strike to have wages rise at 8 percent, let's say, given that kind of expectation And I don't think labor is going to ask for less than 10 percent, so where are we?  Well, I don't know Theoretically, yes But as they look around, they say look at what happened to our friend Mr McCardell at International Harvester He took a nice strike and tried to get wages down and damn near bankrupted the company  The corporate tax cut will pay for the union settlement?  Mr Boykin  Governor Partee  Governor Gramley  Governor Teeters  Mr Roos  Governor Wallich  Mr Keehn This may be your only chance to give us a view from the outside world uncontaminated by deliberations within the Federal Reserve  Mr Winn  -31-    7/6-7/81  Have we exhausted the comments? I guess we can't carry this much further this afternoon We didn't get quite as far as I thought we would Maybe we'll start off with Mr Axilrod tomorrow  Let me just say that, when I look at where we are today as compared to where we were six months ago, I share Larry Roos's feeling of some satisfaction thus far But it's a limited satisfaction I think we have clearly taken the froth out of inflation All those prices that are sensitive to tight money or expectations, or both, are pretty well deflated In fact, I think many of them are deflated below the cost of production and, therefore, if things got easier, they would go up again at some point If the economy began going up again and interest rates began going down, we probably [could expect] increases in some raw materials prices anyway I think we've been exceptionally lucky on oil--I don't know how long that will last--and we've been pretty lucky on food The trick is to convert that luck, to the extent that it is luck--it's partly tight money--into a more lasting wage and cost pattern Views differ on that I don't quite believe that we're seeing it yet, but I hope we will see it I think we can begin to say that something may be happening on the inflation  -32-    7/6-7/81  side I'll concede that much, Mr Kichline, even though it will take some time to be confirmed  I also think conditions are softening in the economy, which may be optimistic compared to the view of some in the markets that even this level of interest rates wouldn't soften anything in the economy I believe we are seeing, at the moment at least, some softening; but the burden of all the comments that were made around the table is that there is no simple way to get from here to there I don't know whether the staff forecast or many of the other forecasts imply a fairly simple way They don't imply big recessions or a big backtracking on inflation I'm not sure that there is an easy way to get from here to there or any way that doesn't involve a lot more real problems and controversies than we've had so far But we don't know where all that is going to lead or precisely what direction it's going to take  Meanwhile, we have to make a few decisions We unfortunately have to use these fragile numbers that we have, and some of them are getting increasingly fragile I agree with Frank Morris in terms of direction, but we happen to have a law as well as an expectation that says that we have to review our present targets and have to put down some new ones for next year We are in a happy or unhappy situation that practically everything is outside the target range It's not quite that bad Some are high within the range; others are above or below; it depends upon which one you look at I think we do have inconsistencies among the targets for the first half of this year I suspect the staff analysis, when Mr Axilrod gets to it, will suggest that those inconsistencies will become less as the year progresses I guess he has to assume that because they were estimated in a consistent way originally and if they're off path for six months--if the original analysis was right--they have to come back toward consistency in the next six months  In any event, at the moment they are inconsistent We have to consider, therefore, whether to change the present targets to realign their internal relationships I don't mean to suggest that that's positively necessary; it depends upon the analysis And they all have ranges, so we have some room for some inconsistencies But we do have to consider this internal alignment question We have to consider all the questions that were raised about what velocity is likely to do and what all the new institutional arrangements mean When we get through all that technical [analysis], we have to decide where policy ought to be in some sense in terms of real pressure And the policy [discussion] only comes after we get through that morass of technical questions, the way this is set up We're going to do all that for this year and, obviously, we have to set some ranges for next year Again, we have what one might think of as pictorial questions in terms of how the targets look against this year's targets and this year's performance relative to all those expectations out there, and we have to reconcile that somehow with our policy predilections  The policy question comes down, I suspect, to a question of where we want to take our chances because--at least speaking for myself--I doubt that anybody can be all that certain about any  -33-    7/6-7/81  particular outlook or all that certain about what some of these internal relationships are Not only do we have to make substantive decisions, but we have to portray them to the public And we are going to have to lean one way or the other on where we want to take our risks I would only say in that connection that we may not be quite as far along as we thought but we are some distance along the road of taking the risks that a constraining policy [presents] in the interest of dealing with the inflationary problem--risks for not only the financial system but the real side of the economy I suppose everybody is looking to see whether that's where the risk is going to be balanced in the future or not With that much comment, I guess it is late enough so that we can retire for the evening and come back at what time?  At 930 in the morning we will take up the long-term discussion We will consider revisions in the targets for this year, if any--and I'm not implying there should be any--and whether we want to make any changes in the targets from this year for next year And then we will come back to what we want to do in the next month  Well, they recommended a somewhat higher M2, but the distance--  SPEAKER(?) 10 to 12--  I don't know It wasn't that high; it was 1/2 to 1 percentage point higher The discrepancy could explain, one can say, perhaps half [of the overshoot from the target]; I think their original analysis probably would have explained one-third or two-thirds of it or less  [Meeting recessed]  -34-    7/6-7/81  July 7, 1981--Morning Session  Mr Kichline, do you want to take about a minute to describe the producer price index figures that came out this morning?  Mr Axilrod, do you want to proceed with a laying out of these difficult arithmetic issues and presumably some economic implications thereof with respect to the targets with which we are blessed or hung--one or the other?  SPEAKER(?) Hoisted!  Well, it's all complicated, as Mr Axilrod suggests Let me just make a couple of comments If I can, I will separate the substance from the numerology; that distinction may not be accepted by everybody around the table, but let me make it for the moment I do think there are some signs of progress on inflation and inflationary psychology; I'm not one to overstate that, as I suggested yesterday Largely we have affected the things that are most likely  -35-    7/6-7/81  to be affected by restraint in the short run commodity prices, precious metals prices, and the exchange rate to some extent The hardest part of the battle is ahead in terms of affecting the underlying rate of inflation Maybe something is happening there but it's still in the "maybe" stage Nevertheless, the stage is at least set more favorably than we've had it in the past All that is on the plus side  We discussed at great length the economic outlook yesterday I don't think anybody is very satisfied with any of the projections in terms of their internal logic and plausibility for continuing over a period of time There is a high risk premium in any of them and our job is assessing where the risks lie in our own policy in terms of our broadest objectives I haven't much doubt in my mind that it's appropriate in substance to take the risk of more softness in the economy in the short run than one might ideally like in order to capitalize on the anti-inflationary momentum to the extent it exists That is much more likely to give a more satisfactory economic as well as inflationary outlook over a period of time as compared to the opposite scenario of heading off economic sluggishness or even a downturn at the expense of rapidly getting back into the kind of situation we were in last fall where we had some retreat on inflationary psychology and the latent demands in the economy immediately reasserted themselves Then we would look forward to another prolonged period of high interest rates and strain and face the same dilemmas over and over again Neither of these outlooks is very simple or happy in a sense But between the two I suspect, hard as it is to say, that the lesser risk in the long run is taking a chance on more sluggishness in the short run rather than devoting all our efforts to avoiding the sluggishness in the short run  How that converts into these numbers is another thing We have technical problems of internal consistency between M-1B unadjusted and M-1B adjusted and between M1 and M2 We have the problem--if it is a problem--that we're low on M-1B and that to come back within the range or at least near the midpoint of the range, as Steve said, gives us very high growth rates in M-1B for a period of months If we had those high growth rates, we'd probably overshoot on M2 We wouldn't be overshooting on the annual objective for M1 but we would probably be overshooting on M2 So, we have a question as to what to do with this year's ranges I have some predilection myself, but it's no more than a mild predilection, not to fool around with changing them this year on the grounds that to change them has an atmosphere of fine-tuning and it's even harder to explain at the end of the year why we are outside of the ranges if we are outside of them [Changing them implies] a kind of renewed commitment to coming within them and we may lose a little flexibility that it may be desirable to have  On the other hand, internal consistency and the actual level of M-1B could easily suggest that some reduction in that range would not be out of line So, one could argue it either way If we raise [the range for] M2 or M3, which is another possibility, as Steve suggested, it creates something of a problem of giving confusing signals to the market, just in terms of the surface impression of "easing" And if we change this year's targets, particularly if we lower the M-1B range for this year, we have to consider what that does in terms of what we can say about next year in the portrayal of some  -36-    7/6-7/81  year-to-year declines [The task] is not impossible, but we just have to consider what those implications are So, we have a lot of permutations and combinations, starting from my own predilection that the general risk is that we in some sense may be too easy rather than too tight during the period ahead I think we ought to take our risks on the side of being tighter rather than looser I leave it to you to convert that into numbers, but that's my general sense of the direction in which we should be moving  With that much introduction, I open the discussion at this point not to a consideration of the short-run operational decision for the next month or quarter or weeks--although obviously that's going to be in the back of people's minds--but of this problem of what to do with [the ranges for] this year in terms of internal consistency or broader changes and what to do about next year We are not looking at this point at the short run but recognize that the [dilemma] we're in is going to be greatly colored if we have the [large] decline in M-1B for the next published figure that the preliminary data suggested The way we start out the next quarter is going to be considerably affected by whether we get a big increase in the following week, which is now the instinct of the projectors and some people in the market We have an [estimated] increase of $5 or $6 billion in the week of July 8, which seems possible We started out July with a better posture in terms of our targets; if M-1B goes down by $4 billion in the next published figure and remains there, then we are really behind the eight ball in terms of the targets in the short run Whereas, if we have that big recovery in the following week, we would not be faced with that same drastic low starting point In an ironic way I rather hope that the July 8th figure is a big increase The ideal thing would be that we recover from the big decrease of the coming week and start off at a reasonable level for the next quarter But that's all in the lap of the gods, so far as I know All I know is that it's going to color where we start off this quarter But since we don't know that and we can't do anything about it, I don't think we can take it too much into consideration at the moment Let us proceed Mr Roos  Let me make a comment in that respect, if I may I think we are all in the position you are in I suspect that if we arrive at some tentative figures, after some preliminary discussion, we better have a recess for figuring out the implications of all these figures in terms of growth rates over the next couple of quarters to make sure we are really where we want to be There's too much arithmetic involved to put together the figures casually So, I think we ought to get a general feel of what people think and then go back and do some of the arithmetic and see whether we are really where we want to be in terms of all these targets and their interrelationships Go ahead  That may be pretty vague, and I was pretty vague I raised the question of lowering the M-1B target [for this year] But whether or not we lower it, I would not aim right now aggressively, in quotation marks, for something like the A alternative presented here in the short run and what that means for the long run-- returning to the midpoint of the present target I think we have the alternative of either lowering the target or saying that we are going to be low in the range--not necessarily outside the target, but we don't expect to be in the upper part of this range We could either be below the target or in the lower part of the range Those are the two choices I see for changing the M-1B target for this year  Page 8 is where are we  No, we shouldn't be talking about the short run Is page 8 the short-run stuff?  What page?  Look, I'm confused about what those alternatives are What are they?  That's right Let me just clarify this If we implicitly accept the strategy of alternative 2 in a rough way, we are left then with the question before us of whether we keep the M-1B range unchanged or whether we lower it [That strategy] is consistent with either hypothesis, and we wouldn't have to change the M2 range We could, but we wouldn't have to Now, I don't know whether any of you people who have commented already want to say anything about 1982 In effect, you have said alternative 2 You haven't said anything about 1982, and I don't know whether you want to at this stage  I think there is a relationship between the two We have too many numbers to discuss here, we all agree But I think we should just get out on the table initially a feeling--I  -39-    7/6-7/81  guess it's broadly reflected on page 8 and then it's reflected on page 14, too--about what's implied for next year  You have an Arabic number 2 on page 8 and a Roman numeral II on page 14  May I just go back and ask Mr Roos and Mr Partee if they are ready to pronounce judgment? This all should be considered very tentative All I want is an instinct at this point Consistent with alternative 2 for the short run, meaning this year, would you leave the ranges unchanged or would you lower M-1B presumably?  I mean this year Not really short run but this year as opposed to next year  Yes We have two questions here One is where we should aim in substance and the other is whether we should change the range That's a pictorial question We can go either way on the pictorial question  Well, it presumably will be explained in the testimony  Yes, I think it is a matter of pictorial taste Mr Black  Where are you for next year?  Governor Gramley  Let me just make one comment on one of Governor Gramley's points, which I think is valid, but maybe not too much in the very short run At some point, if inflation does come down and interest rates come down, we may find we need much higher growth in transactions balances relative to nominal GNP than anything in recent experience has suggested How we would ever make that shift is very difficult psychologically in terms of all this numerology because we all keep talking about the need to reduce money growth, and  -43-    7/6-7/81  it would give the wrong signal if we actually set a projection based upon [the need for faster growth] It's too early to assume that need anyway Some day it's going to happen or it may happen My reaction is that it's premature [to act on it now] It may not be premature to raise the subject as a possibility for the future, but it's too early to raise the subject in terms of the actual targets we put down because I don't think we are there yet And we might give a wrong signal by leaning on it now even though I suspect it is going to happen at some point Some day we are going to have to say rather flatly that the target is higher relative to nominal GNP precisely for this reason, and I would consider putting a sentence or two of that sort in the testimony But it's probably too early to reflect it in any actual targets we set, because it will not be identified in the public mind with this rather sophisticated analysis but would just be interpreted as a straightforward easing of policy And that is not what would be meant Governor Wallich  Governor Schultz  It's consistent with alternative C in continuing to--  You're also saying you'd leave it unchanged in '82?  If you reduce the bottom limit of the range for this year, just pictorially, I think you'd want to reduce the top too because you wouldn't want to be widening the range in the middle of the year  That would leave the top the same as this year and would reduce the bottom by 1/2 point further from this year Governor Teeters  Well, let me just make one point as a footnote I think you are correct in worrying about [high] interest rates and what that might do to the financial fabric The question of strategy is whether we take that risk in the short run or exacerbate that risk by being too easy in some sense in the short run and having high interest rates longer I think that's the issue before us  That's right  Well, you could argue we haven't been tight enough  Mr Solomon  He said leave it unchanged  6 to 9  The next appointee to the Open market Committee is going to be a market psychiatrist!  Mr Boehne  Mr Corrigan  Mr Morris You would solve half the problems by abandoning M-1  That simplifies it  Well, I'm not sure that's what Steve was suggesting We would have an M1 target period, not shift-adjusted  That's on the presumption that we declare the shift is completed  Either completed or irrelevant, one or the other  We're going to have to consider that one of these days I take it that the predominant comment from market people, as you would expect, is that they want us to continue it There are some comments in the other direction, however; but all the market people argue that the more information they get the better  -53-    7/6-7/81  The farther away you get from the market operator types, the less sympathetic people, including the more senior bankers, are to that Governor Rice  Let me just say that given all the complications of this, I think the meeting is going to run until after lunch I'd like to get through this preliminary go-around and maybe before we resolve this turn to the short run because I think that has some influence on how we finally come out I suspect we're going to continue the meeting after lunch Mr Guffey  Unfortunately, the only new evidence we have on the shift adjustment would lower the adjusted M-1B If we wanted to take that evidence from this Michigan survey, that's--  Mr Ford  Let me just restate my own semantics I think you have stated it correctly There are risks in everything we do I think the lesser risk is--  --holding tight, not that that's the greater risk  No, I think the sense of it is clear enough, but just as a semantic matter I think we're minimizing what inevitable risks there are by doing that There are risks with any of these alternatives  Mr Balles  We haven't had much experience I think what that means is that we haven't done it for two years  Mr Boykin  -57-    7/6-7/81  Mr Winn  Mr Keehn, you can make an interim concluding comment and we can have a coffee break  Let me just make one or maybe two comments before the coffee break Most people have said "Keep the ranges this year the same," which was my instinct when I was thinking about it before However, I found that Governor Schultz raised some rather cogent points I did a little arithmetic this morning and I think one can argue, although I'd want to confirm this arithmetic, that it's reasonably safe--that may overstate it a bit--to expect that we would come within the M-1B range if we lowered it by 1/2 percentage point That may give us the leeway that Frank is worried about in the unfortunate circumstance that M-1B growth would go up I still don't think it's going to go up above the upper end, but as opposed to saying we're going to be in the lower end of the range there may be some advantage in just reducing the range a little this year Everybody probably changes their mind on this, like Tony Solomon, but I find the case for keeping the range less persuasive than my own initial instinct suggested, depending upon just how the arithmetic works out I think the arithmetic works out rather favorably on that, although I'd want to look at it again Anyhow, let's go to the coffee break and after the coffee break we'll go to the short run; and then we'll go back to the long run again and make sure the short run fits with what we want to do in the long run  [Coffee break]  I guess we are back on page 15 [of the Bluebook] Is that where we are, Mr Axilrod, for the short-run ranges? I'm not sure on the arithmetic of how the short-term ranges match with the long-term ranges Maybe you can inject something now Do you have another statement to make about the short-term ranges?  Fourth quarter to fourth quarter? And it implies for the two quarters, 28--  Yes, for the two quarters on average But it would imply [quarterly average growth rates], assuming [a fairly smooth trajectory month-by-month], of 28 and 82 percent, right?  Yes, that's apart from the difficulties of any short-run interest rate forecast According to the model they depend upon a GNP projection, which may be unreliable; and, therefore, if we get a weaker GNP we can get much lower interest rates consistent with any of these forecasts Who would like to wade into this short- run problem? Mr Boehne  Mr Morris  What alternative do we have other than to publish?  Okay, you would put in the 8-1/2 percent  Do you have a comment on the funds range, Mr Boehne?  Mr Solomon  -61-    7/6-7/81  Governor Wallich  Mr Black  Mr Guffey  16 to 20 percent?  Mr Ford  -62-    7/6-7/81  Let me just explore the implications You say leave the federal funds where it is, meaning--  Okay, that's the range But where would you put the borrowing? If you lower the borrowing, the funds rate presumably will come down The borrowing this week was $14 billion Was that what--  Governor Gramley  Do we have a consensus on that?  Governor Teeters  Mr Corrigan  Theoretically, they ought to be giving away federal funds tomorrow afternoon  I ran out of names--no, Mr Schultz  Mr Balles  Let me just comment on this sharp deceleration I think it really is misleading I looked at some figures yesterday on the annual growth We started out this year from the highest quarter we had last year, and it was an exceptionally high quarter When you look at this in a broader perspective, taking all the quarters into account, if we end up at the 3-1/2 percent lower end of the range, we're only slightly below the average we had for last year--on the order of 1/2 percentage point below as I remember the figures And we had an increase for the whole of last year of what?  58 percent If we end up at the bottom of the range in the fourth quarter, in a straight line from here to there, the annual growth in M-1B would be what?  It would only be about 3/4 of a percentage point reduction in growth from a year ago  -65-    7/6-7/81  Well, my argument is that I don't think that's a peculiarity The peculiarity is the fourth quarter The fourth quarter happened to be the only quarter last year when we were above target, and it was an abnormally high quarter If we say the world begins and ends with the fourth quarter of last year, we get a different picture than if we say the money supply was lower during the first three quarters of last year than it was in the fourth quarter Anybody putting in any kind of econometric equation puts in an annual figure Nobody just picks out one quarter to put in  That's another way of saying the same thing Or if we draw it as a channel from the end of the cone last year, as I sometimes draw it, we are now a little below the middle of the channel, or maybe quite far below in June But for the first half of the year as a whole, we're right in the middle of the channel  I thought of doing that last year The reason I didn't was because it looked too damn difficult to get the annual average down But it looks as if we have achieved it, or may achieve it  But that is in a sense more meaningfully in economic terms One can argue it either way Obviously the year- to-year change is influenced by what happened last year But just picking out one quarter and saying that's the end of all existence is clearly not right either  I don't have the figures, but if we looked at the year-to-year changes in M1 now, they are still high, I think If we looked at the first half of this year against the first half of last year--  That's right  No, it will narrow from now on with any of these numbers By the end of the year we would be down just a bit below where we were last year  Next year we'll straighten this out by putting back the first half of the year in the seasonal patterns that we left out and then it will all look very even during the year Governor Partee  Quite true  Governor Rice  $2 billion?  Well, that may be what they have in here Okay  You may be right These are adjusted figures, certainly; and if we continue to get some growth in NOW accounts, the unadjusted figure will be still higher It's a point worth making I'm not so sure that we're going to get much growth in NOW accounts from now on In the last couple of months we haven't gotten much, but nobody knows, obviously It may be that these figures are coming together But the chances are you're right  There are a few more people who have to talk here Mr Boykin  -68-    7/6-7/81  Mr Winn  Mr Keehne, you bring up the caboose again  Well, let's see where we are Obviously, we're between--  Well, the funds market has been rather mixed up for some weeks now, really beginning around Memorial Day, I guess, as Paul Meek suggested It is mixed up partly because the staff said weakness in M-1B should bring a pretty prompt easing and it hasn't happened, so they don't know where it should be We have sentiment ranging from "B" to "C" with some emphasis on "C" I share the concern about just the publication effects of saying we want to aim for 8-1/2 percent over any period of time I would not mind a big rebound in July, if we could sneak it in there and get it over with In fact, that would be the desirable result But we're starting July from a very low base and I don't know what the chances are of getting a very high growth rate in July, considering how low we're starting-- if last week's figure is borne out when we get the final numbers A number of people have mentioned M2 I would be strongly inclined, whatever we say about M1, to stick something in the directive that says we don't really want to see M2 going outside its range That provides something of a fail-safe Having done that, we swallow the pictorial effects of any of these things So, we're someplace between "B" and "C" For the borrowing assumption, $1-1/2 billion seems to be about where we are now; it's not too bad to start with The real questions are the ones that Lyle and others raised about what happens under various contingencies The most straightforward way to play it, I suppose--if we decide on an initial borrowing level of, let's say, $1-1/2 billion at the moment, which is lower than the staff says is needed to restrain the money supply over the whole quarter--is to take it symmetrically If the money supply began rising faster than is projected here, we would simply let the mechanical [process work]; we wouldn't change the nonborrowed reserve path but would let borrowings rise It depends upon what happens to M2, but if M2 is behaving itself, we would just let borrowings rise, which would mean a rather gradual rise in borrowings to a higher number And we'd do the reverse if it's falling short, which would mean a rather gradual fall in borrowings If it fell short, we'd bring the caveat on M2 into play If M2 were rising very fast, that might trigger a change in the nonborrowed reserve path  Well, if M2 was high, we'd lower the path Or if it was low, we'd raise the path  What's unrealistic to you? What would you suggest? I don't know You didn't suggest anything, I guess  -70-    7/6-7/81  I don't have a borrowing number down for you  We haven't been at $2 billion for a long time, theoretically, and we've had a decline in the money supply We were at or above $2 billion on the borrowings at the beginning of some weeks But we haven't been aiming for a $2 billion number for a month or more  Well, I think that's true It's harder to go below but I think the experience is that it will go below It's just that the higher that rate is, the higher the funds rate will be  If we cited the target in terms of a quarterly average, it wouldn't look frightening because that's going to be low Suppose we put that in the directive Can you give us your evaluation of the pros and cons of citing the target that way, Mr Axilrod?  You raise some question in my mind about what kind of quarterly pattern you have in mind  That would be right if we were starting from a reasonably high level or a normal level But we need an awfully high figure in that first week just to get any growth in July  I just don't know how this works out arithmetically But I have some concern that if we don't have a really big increase in the week of July 8th, we are starting July so low that we'd have to drive the borrowing down to $700 million or something to have any chance of getting there  I'd like to get a rebound I just don't know what we'll do if we don't get it I devoutly hope that if in fact we have a big decline this week, we'll get an offsetting increase or a little more next week  We'll return to that question  -72-    7/6-7/81  You can return to that argument at the next round  In some sense the specifications here are easy enough It's just how we should act if we go off course that is a little more difficult The specification seems to me to be something like--well, just to use a round number--7 percent We may want to have a small range and say provided that M2 is within its range I don't see why borrowing somewhere around the present level of $1-1/2 billion isn't reasonable  The staff says no Or, what is coming out of the machine says that we have to have a higher borrowing level But I don't know A lot of skepticism was expressed around the table about whether in fact we do need a borrowing number that high Balancing my general feeling about where the major risks lie, given the shortfalls that we have had, I don't want to run an undue risk of a further shortfall Borrowing of $2 billion would produce, at least I would think, a 20 percent federal funds rate around this time I'm not sure we want to be that tight; and 20 percent is what the staff says that $2 billion would produce  18 percent on the funds rate?  Two billion dollars is literally higher than what we have had for a month  We'd have to have one week of $23 billion or something  It has been higher than I thought it was  Well, we can be a little higher on the borrowing, but I think that's taking a chance of the money-- These differences are so small Let me try 7 percent and $1-1/2 billion  SPEAKER(?) What was the second number?  And 15 to 21 percent I'd be happy with 15 to 20 percent, but 15 to 21 percent seems to catch more people What else do we need to know? And the caveat on M2  Yes Right now it's at the upper end of the range, so it means M2 growing at 9 percent or a bit less  That's not what they will do We will just have a consultation  Well, we're right on the margin of it now There's no question about that  Well, I think it's very important  -74-    7/6-7/81  To have a very high M-1B figure and have M2 within the 9 percent would be very unlikely  What has the growth in the nontransactions part of M2 been in the last couple of months at an annual rate? Do you have such a number?  I don't know what the arithmetic is, but I presume the nontransactions part of M2 could run at approximately 10 percent with this kind of M1 figure  Shift-adjusted M2 numbers  Well, I don't intend this to be quite as precise as you're talking about We can't judge M2 that closely The figures come in a little late But if M2 is running 9-1/2 percent-- and we won't even know it [currently]--that's within our range of tolerance If it's clearly running high, it's very important--  Inevitably we have to [unintelligible] Well, let me try this Have I mentioned all the variables 7 percent, $15 billion, 15 to 21 percent, and a strong M2 caveat  7 percent for M-1B  -75-    7/6-7/81  For M2 I think it would be rather explicit that we're talking about 9 percent or less If it got over 9 percent, we'd be concerned about it  We [tried to draft] some wording We can come back to the precise wording, but let me see what Steve has "In the short run the Committee seeks behavior of reserve aggregates consistent with growth in M-1B from June to September at an annual rate of 7 percent"--or whatever number we put in--"after allowance, provided such growth is consistent with M2 growth remaining around the upper limit of or moving within its range for the year" Everybody knows that's 9 percent, I presume  I don't think any of these relationships is all that precise but it's true that, according to the staff's estimate, if we got 7 percent, the 9 percent M2 constraint wouldn't operate  Well, the answer is I don't know But if you accept the staff's analysis here, they would say there's no  -76-    7/6-7/81  problem Their estimate is that if we get 7 percent on M-1B, M2 will come in at 8-1/4 percent It has met this--  That's precisely what this would say We wouldn't worry very much about that shortfall in M-1B if M2 is rising rapidly That's what we would be saying  Well, with the negative growth in M-1B we've had an M2 figure of 5 percent or so So, we're not likely to get a combination of 9 percent on M2 and a negative M-1B  Well, I'm not so concerned about the question of what the appearance is  I'm happy to go all the way to "C," if that's where you people want to go  I don't know how much you want to build in But to the extent you want to build some in, you have the staff's estimate, for what it is worth--and the staff's estimate is always the best technical analysis that can be provided--that M2 is going to come in below this constraint if M1 is really weak  That's right  I'm not sure exactly either, because we have 19 different permutations and combinations I didn't go quite as far as what you said I said that if M1 were coming in weak, we would just let the natural result come in on the borrowings I haven't faced explicitly what we would do if M1 is in fact [weak] and M2 is above 9 percent I suppose at some point if M2 got strong enough-- there's some shady area there--we would have to reduce the nonborrowed reserve path  Obviously, there are lots of circumstances in which we'd have enough of a conflict that we would have a consultation, but the clear implication is that we would let M-1B get weaker than 7 percent if M2 is running strong in the short run pending--  We can't handle every possible contingency here The ultimate answer has to be we would have a consultation if things go askew enough  I'd like to get it in the published directive, frankly, because I am hesitant Whatever the M1 figure, the arithmetic of what we publish is going to look high, and I'd like to get something in the directive that says we're not going wild in increasing the monetary aggregates And the way to do that is to get M2 in there  We're getting into an area where there are more things than we can write into the directive If there are special factors causing it to rise, we better consult But what we're talking about here is a relatively brief statement that eventually is going to come out in the public and we're talking about the best way of expressing it We can be straightforward and just say we're looking for M2 growth of around 8 to 8-1/2 percent; that's what this draft says  That's the more traditional way of doing it--just to say we want x percent on M-1B and 8 or 8-1/2 percent on M2 You think the staff is wrong, Mr Solomon?  Well, I cannot resolve that technical argument; I don't know what the answer is I suggested the way I suggested because I think we probably want to be in a posture of not  -79-    7/6-7/81 -80-  easily looking at overshoots of the broader aggregates And that's what this attempts to express  Well, I think there's enough problem in this language that we ought to fiddle around with language during lunch and get wording that we're satisfied with But the substance of it is what I'm suggesting Have we had enough discussion? It's 100 pm and I don't see anything better at the moment than the 7 percent, $15 billion, 15 to 21 percent and the caveat of M2 staying within the range basically  How many find that acceptable?  SPEAKER(?) Voting members only, right?  Well, I guess a lot of people find it acceptable If nobody has anything better to suggest, let's have a vote  We have sandwiches out here Let's take a little time to begin eating the sandwiches and return to the longer- run discussion in the light of the shorter-run decision  [Lunch recess]  I think we more or less solved the problem of where we are for the rest of this year--that's implicit in the decision we just made--which is around the lower end of the range for M1 and around the upper end of the ranges for M2 and M3 and [credit] I'm not sure that needs a lot more discussion What we have to decide    7/6-7/81  is whether to change any of the ranges for this year and what to do for next year On next year, there isn't a tremendous amount of difference in the alternatives the staff has given us I share the predilection cited by a good many people that we probably shouldn't raise M2 and M3, which means that M2 would be lower than cited in any of these alternatives by a full 1/2 percentage point if we neither lowered them nor raised them My own feeling about M-1B, though I'm not even sure at this stage whether we will call it M-1B next year-- I'm assuming we can be rather general and just call it M1, but it's not adjusted--is that we are left with an unknowable about what the nontransactions component of M1 means conceptually One can argue, as I guess Steve argued--I'm not sure he quantified it--that having that component in there and the fact that it is household transactions accounts at best, means that it has a higher growth trend than the others and that, all things equal, [its growth] ought to be what--1/2 to 1 percent higher on this combined basis?  I also worry a bit about the opposite of that We have a lot of nontransactions [balances] in the initial adjustment of M-1B, but when people get [funds] in there and look around at all these attractive rates in the market, they may take it out over time, which artificially depresses that aggregate  The burden of my comment is not that we know any of these things empirically or logically The burden is that [we have] all these uncertainties I'm basically agreeing with Frank Morris; I'm going a long distance [in that direction] but I don't think we can abandon M1 because people would question our good faith if we abandon M1 at this point, given all the emphasis on it I think we have to end up giving them a target for M1 But I don't see why we can't make a radical change and make it a 3-point range instead of 2-1/2 points and just tell them there are all these uncertainties in both directions So what I would be inclined to do--I don't know whether to call it alternative III or not--is to take that 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent range [under alternative III], which gives us a reduction of 1 percentage point on the lower end of the range and 1/2 percentage point on the upper end of the range from where we now are, and leave the others unchanged tentatively  SPEAKER(?) We're back on what page?  -81-    7/6-7/81  SPEAKER(?) 14  It's about what a lot of people are suggesting, but I would cast my vote on widening the M1 range a bit You might want to say a word about M3, Steve You told me you have the feeling that it may be a little high here or that it could be comfortably lowered I don't know whether we want to do that or not, given the--  For both M2 and M3?  Let me just be clear Your analysis says M2 would grow faster than M3?  Right Well, that's an alternative that we could consider then It gets us another reduction in one of these ranges  We could  The only reduction that this would involve at this point is M-1B  Let me restate that I said M-1B; what I stated [earlier] is that we are just calling it M1 It will be conceptually the same as the present M-1B, but it would be an unadjusted number  I'm saying 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent but 3-1/2 to 6 percent is the present range Well I don't know if it is; it's 3-1/2 to 6 percent or 6 to 8-1/2 percent, depending upon which way you look at it  Well, the argument is purely intellectual because I don't think we have any empirical evidence If you took the Axilrod analysis, you would say that the effective range is reduced by another 1/4 to 1/2 percentage point because of this growth factor that he builds into the total If you gave weight to my suspicion that that wouldn't be true, it might even be the opposite But who knows? My suspicion is that people have excess money in M-1B now, unadjusted, that might be withdrawn  Yes  It means moving it 1/2 percentage point more than you otherwise would  In terms of the midpoint, that's correct  -83-    7/6-7/81  Do you have copies of this that you can distribute, Mr Altmann?  We don't have to do that But at some point fiddling around with a very small adjustment--  We can change our minds at the end of this year, if we think a big shift is going on  Yes, but we have a--  We have unreconcilable inconsistencies in that respect, I guess There's a great question as to whether it's consistent with their GNP forecast On the other hand, they will presume that the money supply is declining from year-to-year So, we'll have to say we are inconsistent with that assumption if we--  I recognize all the problems, but it's a little hard to say we're not going to reduce the target next year in any respect  The only other decision we have to make, as nearly as I can see based upon the earlier discussion--tell me if I'm wrong--is [on M1] Nobody talked about--well, maybe somebody did, but the great majority did not--changing the M2, M3, and bank credit ranges We had this debate We had a predominant view, which was not to change anything But Mr Schultz raised some arguments, and one or two others did, on reducing the [M1 range] this year, which may have some bearing on this That's the only other decision I think we have to make here  That's right; we could do that So the open questions are M-1B this year, M1 next year, and M3 next year if we're sticking with the 6 to 9 percent for M2 next year, which seems to be reasonably satisfactory These differences are small but, unfortunately, the one that is critical is the Ml range for next year just in terms of public appreciation and the psychology of getting something down  Well, I am hoping--  I think we've run out of speed on this already It has exceeded my tolerance for having any faith in the adjustment now  I hope that we will find in the next six months that there isn't much difference between the two and that against that background we'll say "Forget about it next year" I would plan to say in the testimony as background for whatever number we put in here that we don't think [the shift] is going to be significant next year, so we are very tentatively assuming it's not going to be But if it still looks significant by December, we'll have to give you a different judgment However, we are assuming in this very tentative way that it's not going to be significant next year  Just to make sure you realize the arithmetic of what Mr Roos said If we reduce the range by 1 percentage point on both ends, it would be 2-1/2 to 5 percent  The fact is we don't know We're all giving grist to Mr Morris's mill  At midyear But I see some positive benefit to widening the range to explain to them that these numbers are not so solid and reliable It's a symbolic recognition of the fact that there are great uncertainties about M1 and what M1 means these days  Well, we've heard the arguments on both sides Having heard both sides, I conclude that 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent is still the right compromise I feel somewhat open-minded about M3 Let me just try 2-1/2 to 5-1/2, 6 to 9, and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent, but I am perfectly happy to try the same [M1 range] and 6 to 9 percent for both M2 and M3 What are the preferences between those two?  Is that what we did? I thought we raised one of these  So we have precedence for that Let me just ask the preference between those two approaches There are other combinations and permutations, but let me just see how those two go Everything the same with 2-1/2 to 5-1/2, 6 to 9, but a 1/2-point difference on the M3 range Who is for the leaving the M3 range at 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent, given that choice  How many have a reasonably strong feeling about the 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent versus 6 to 9 percent? Well, among those registering feelings anyway, the 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent commands a little more support Now, let me just ask a general question Does  -90-    7/6-7/81  anybody else, after hearing this debate on both sides--on lower or higher, visual, substance, or uncertainty--want to propose another change? If not, I am going to go ahead with the 2-1/2 to 5-1/2, 6 to 9, and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent  There have been preferences expressed on both sides, but let me just ask--  There are other possibilities There's a whole range of numbers we can put down--different higher limits, different lower limits, whatever  Is there some reasonable contentment with 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent?  Yes Well, [unintelligible], let's just reserve that for the moment That's tentative Now, what do you want to do about this year? I've been on both sides of this issue and will remain on both sides of the issue The argument, as I understand it, is Why horse around for 1/2 percentage point and raise questions about fine-tuning and all the rest If we go that way, I think we have to say something about being comfortable on the low side however that is precisely expressed  Yes, that's right  The other side is If we lower it, we have a target that is more attainable on the low side, consistent with the decision we made earlier It's less frightening on the up side It comes down, in part, to how convinced one is that if we saw a sudden radical move in the other direction so that the upper side is threatened, we'd be prepared to pull out even more stops than we otherwise would, given that we went out of our way now to lower it  Does anybody have anything to add to this argument? Does anybody want to make a final statement that's going to be persuasive on this score before I ask for preferences? Or does anyone want to make a statement that's not going to be persuasive but that they want to get off their chest?  Does anybody else want to make a statement? One choice, as I understand it, is to leave the ranges unchanged but say something [specifically] about being low in, or maybe even below, [the M-1B range] if necessary to remain comfortable But we are not unduly uncomfortable on M2 and M3 We would expect to be high in the M2 and M3 ranges That's one approach The other is that we'd still say that we're going to be high in the M2 and M3 ranges but in recognition of the undershoot in M-1B, in effect, we are lowering its range by a half point Those are the two choices  I'd lower both ends by a half point if we were doing it I don't think we can widen the range in the middle of the year Part of the purpose in lowering it actually is to constrain us on the up side and indicate that we are constrained So, those are the two choices They seem to be quite evenly balanced, in my judgment Who does not want to change them, with that explanation?  That seems to be the wide consensus, so I guess we don't move them  That was a beautiful argument  He would have changed my vote, too But we are still in the minority Mr Axilrod raises a question, which reraises a question about what we just said before I am hesitant to recite it to you but I will out of a feeling of loyalty He says that in general we are putting some additional emphasis on the broader aggregates and the decision for next year doesn't lower any of the broader aggregates Is that going to diminish the psychological impact? I guess that reraises the question of M3 Does anybody feel strongly that we should reconsider the question of M3? If not, we won't So, what we have here is No change this year with the explanation that I cited; for next year 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent tentatively for M1 period, 6 to 9 percent for M2, and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M3 Nobody discussed bank credit, which is still what-- 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent?  Are we at 6 to 9 percent? Oh, yes, it's the same I see So, 6 to 9 percent on bank credit  At this stage, I think yes It's clear that for 1981 there isn't going to be any change  Well, let's do it separately It might affect somebody's vote, I guess Shall we formally vote on '81? All right, we will have a separate vote on '81  I have a footnote in my mind to all of this, that if the figures for the next two weeks come out widely different than our current expectation, I think we need to have a consultation and relook at all these decisions So, I will make a [mental] footnote Maybe we ought to put in our record that we are going to consult at--  Yes, we will have a consultation before the testimony to confirm all of this Maybe just put it like that, neutrally But I don't expect any change unless we get some radically wild figures in the next two weeks Now we are just voting on '81  Exactly  -93-    7/6-7/81  You can explain your vote  Okay That leaves us with 1982 This is all going to be described as tentative The coloration around it is clear It's 2-1/2 to 5-1/2, 6 to 9, 6-1/2 to 9-1/2, and 6 to 9 percent, which is no change for any of the ranges except for M-1B  The rationale is "modified Morris" Is that clear? There's a lot of uncertainty about what is going to happen to M1 in terms of the technical interpretation of the figure  That is the problem in explaining There's so much invested in this now It's difficult to go up there and say we don't have any faith in these figures It happens to be the case We have more credibility, a lot more credibility, saying it when they are low than when they are high Do you all remember what you are voting on?  Okay, I guess we are finished Oh, no Will you hand out this directive language? Let us suspend the Open Market Committee meeting for the moment and spend a little time on these other things And while you are uninterested in this other conversation, you can read the directive language and we will reassess that language in 15 or 20 minutes Let me try and run through some of these other things rather quickly I have a note here that you are prepared to report on our readiness on the pricing, Governor Gramley, if you would do that  [Secretary's note The Committee's discussion of the directive language was not recorded The language adopted, of course, has been published in records of the Committee]  END OF MEETING  -95-       Yes  Well, we will have to get on that I'm sorry to hear it, but these things happen Let me return to another unhappy matter of an apparent leak about part of our decision last week--it was last week, wasn't it?--in the Washington Post  The leak was this week, but the meeting was last week It's very frustrating to me personally It's hard to know what to do about it but I'm thinking and will continue to think [about that] As you have heard me say before, this kind of thing can be extremely damaging and I don't how we can operate with some confidence, given the necessary lapses between meetings and announcements, if we're subject to this kind of thing I don't know what else I can say other than that I'm thinking about it further  So far as the substance of the discussion is concerned, we agreed to have some consultation before any actual announcements were made, [given that] we were faced with some volatile money supply figures We indeed have [new data] and they're somewhat different-- Steve will go over them--than what we were assuming I don't see anything here that casts any question about our decisions And I don't propose to raise that, myself; the new figures don't require any decision of that nature in my view I think they do have some implications, [with regard to] the operations that we agreed upon and the manner of conducting them Why don't I let Steve describe where we are  One thing I don't understand You said we were $17 billion [above] where you expected to be in some week--I wasn't sure what week But it seems that we [published] a smaller decline last week than we anticipated when the Committee met and we have a much larger increase this week Why aren't we much further above the path if you--  If I may just interrupt In a sense, that's the only change that should bear upon the Committee's decision, it seems to me And it doesn't seem to me enough to make much difference It's just that the base is $400 million off from where we thought it was  That in itself doesn't seem to me to call into question what the growth trend should have been in this quarter  You still haven't told me how far we are above what we assumed at the time of the meeting for July 8th or 15th, or whatever the week is for the latest data  I don't know who is around from the Desk Paul, do you want to say anything?  Clearly, we seem to be getting a figure here that's much higher than--  --than the market is thinkingMR PARTEE    7/17/81  -- than the central tendency of the market thinking It's obviously a very big figure, partially and hopefully [to be] offset next week But the arithmetic, as Steve suggested, is for no further increases or decreases beyond next week, which [means the July increase] about balances the June decline We're not very far above where we want to be, but the risks look a little different at this point And M2 seems to be running high In the normal course of events, I would be inclined to make one of the operational adjustments we talked about at the last meeting and lower the nonborrowed reserve path The presumption is that borrowings will go up; we'll go toward the position Mr Rice expressed at the meeting, and toward what the staff saw as consistent I would think something in the neighborhood of $18 billion is probably about right, which is where we were just a couple weeks ago  Who knows at this point? I think the market is going to be very strongly affected in coming days simply in reaction to the money supply figure Borrowings ran low last week with no excess reserves and have been running very low so far this week, so presumably the market would tighten up even if we did nothing  What do you have for thrifts just in absolute terms? Are they having a run-off or not in their deposits?  I know June was up a little, but I--  What other observations do we have?  I believe right now we're not below the lower end of the range but well into the range  I don't know I'll ask Mr Axilrod  I'm just looking at the figures we know  I don't know Is it below the cone? I looked at these figures the other night and I thought we were--  We are below the cone Let me see that I looked at it the other day and I thought we were above  I thought we were [unintelligible]--  SPEAKER(?) You mean he has his own?  Okay, I guess we're below I'll take it back  In a couple of days we're not going to know anything more than we know now    7/17/81  Well, not hearing any other comments, we will make a decision in the light of all the comments that have been made, which is somewhere between not changing, changing in a couple of days, and going to $18 billion right now We'll be someplace in between I don't think we can wait very long We're just operating in the context of the decision that was made We'll maybe look at the M2 numbers a little more closely and see how they look Any decision we make now doesn't imply any operations today or Monday or probably Tuesday anyway  We're talking about where we lean in this reserve period and where we set our next reserve period So, we will leave it at that I will commune with my soul and interpret all the random comments that I have heard I guess that's all we have  I think we'd only need a vote if we were going to change something I have not heard any sentiment to change anything So, this is just an updating, if that's acceptable Thank you  END OF SESSION     We welcome Mr Cross as a new participant  Comments or questions?  Governor Partee  The market is very broad and efficient  But it did move up  It's very hard to argue that this foreign exchange market is operating very effectively at the moment It has some analogies with the domestic market in terms of the uncertainties and the discontinuities and a lack of confidence  And no conviction in it  Well, there's something we ought to do if we get that kind of fluctuation in either direction in my opinion, but we're not going to solve that this morning Do you have a recommendation for us, Mr Cross?  If you're close to the German mark limit, how close are you to the overall limit of $4-1/4 billion?  I raise the question Why do we have to increase that limit? I understand the German mark limit, but with that much leeway in the total, one doesn't follow the other, does it?  If we don't increase the total, we're implicitly reducing the yen limit or the other currencies limit Is that what you're saying?  As I understand it, all we're talking about are the informal limits and this doesn't require any vote The formal limit is actually $8 billion  Which we're far from  If we kept the others the same, then the overall limit would follow [the increase for German marks] I don't think it would make much difference Unless we're going to sell some currencies, we have to increase the [informal] mark limit anyway  No, but I think we need an understanding  I think that's right All we have to do is confirm that there's an informal understanding that we'll increase these limits by $1/4 billion in order to allow for interest payments If that's acceptable, we will assume that that is done There aren't any transactions to be ratified because there weren't any transactions I'm reminded that we forgot to approve the minutes of the last meeting at the beginning of this meeting Could I have a motion to approve them?  SPEAKER(?) So moved  SPEAKER(?) Second  If there's no objection, we'll approve the minutes We have approved informally that increase in the limits [on our foreign currency holdings] Mr Sternlight  Comments or questions?  What we appear to get, for whatever reason, is a low federal funds rate, and banks underborrow one week and then get trapped at the end of the week and that sets up a higher rate So they say "Oops, the funds rate is higher," so they overborrow for a while  [Unintelligible] the explosive corn-hog cycle But this one is neither damped nor otherwise on the chart  The coupons that are under one year, as I remember, amount to about $12 billion or something like that, right?  Coupons are not too easy to get rid of  No, but we can do--  We can do reverse RPs with the other--  Any other comment or questions?  No, we have not; we'll discuss that at lunch We have to ratify the transactions  Without objection, that is ratified  SPEAKER(?) It should be  Mr Zeisel  Maybe you can go ahead, Mr Axilrod, and then we'll discuss the two reports together  Comments? Mr Roos  Still, [would we] be better off with one bad compass? Governor Partee  Governor Gramley  Mr Black  Mr Smoot  I think that's getting a little premature We'll worry about that when we get to the directive  Mr Balles  No, I don't think so Just to amplify and emphasize Mr Axilrod's point, we got a proposal for establishing a money market fund which would be marketed by VISA but conducted by all the bank members of VISA, which is about--I don't know if I can remember--6,000 banks or more They would all be able to run this money market fund, if they wanted to, on an in-and-out, automatic, daily basis People could hold their demand deposit at zero or any other arbitrary figure; there would be no fluctuation in the demand account and all the ups and downs would go into the money market fund in half, or much more than half, of the banking system  No, I guess it would be in M3; it wouldn't even be in M2 It would go right from a transactions account into M3, as presently defined I can cite you the example of my famous banker in Tennessee whom I happened to be sitting beside at a dinner some months ago--this is a $500 million bank--and he said "Do you count repurchase agreements in transactions accounts?" I said "No, but it's a narrow question" And he said they had only begun this two years ago in his bank but they have quite a few corporate accounts and those corporate accounts are swept every day at noon If they have a balance over the suggested amount, the excess is put into an RP overnight In two years the RPs were up to 30 percent of their demand deposits This was some months ago; the figure is undoubtedly bigger now  We made an estimate of this sort for money market funds, not on a short-term basis, but looking at the whole first half of the year We made some arbitrary assumptions--well, not entirely arbitrary, but based upon whatever evidence there was from surveys, etcetera--as to how much of that could be said to be used straightforwardly as transactions accounts, meaning that checks were written on them And the velocity assumptions were such as to make them, say, comparable to a NOW account Then we tried to make some  -15-    8/18/81  calculation of how much that affected M-1B and we got 09 I forget whether that is an annual rate or the actual--  But that made no allowance at all for the degree to which the holding of a money market fund enabled people to economize on a transactions account merely by the fact that they held the money fund and had that reserve available for instantaneous transfer So, undoubtedly, it's an underestimate in terms of its substitution effect for transactions balances That was an arbitrary thing which gave us a general order of magnitude perhaps But we never get at that second kind of influence What is a transactions balance? I don't know; one can't define it that clearly But this direct substitution effect is even harder to get at than the direct transfer effect, so to speak So what do we know? It was enough so that it brought M-1B roughly to the lower end of the target in the first half; that just allowed for the increase in money market funds from December through June or the 6-month period in the first half of the year I don't know whether it's quarterly or monthly at this point We can make estimates of that sort, but what confidence do we have in them and what does it tell us in the end? We have a figure that's increasingly an artificial construct to start with, even when we just take the numbers; and then we begin making these adjustments The adjustment for NOW account transfers is becoming increasingly problematical I think it was appropriate during the initial stage of big transfers; it gave us a much better feel for what was going on But after six months these transfers have diminished substantially, and I don't know what it means anymore to make this adjustment because I'm sure we're now getting transfers out of NOW accounts into money market funds or something as well as transfers in  Governor Teeters  Well, with all respect--I don't want to prolong this discussion--I don't understand the point analytically because the reserves are simply a reflection of currency and M-1B  Governor Wallich  We've had no comments on the business situation, which I would suggest we have to look at a bit in order to resolve these imponderables about which direction we want to go  We had no comment on the budgetary deficit in the presentation, as I recall You might say a word about that, Mr Zeisel  Governor Gramley  You talk to different businessmen than I do  Mr Corrigan  -20-    8/18/81  Mr Zeisel, we have gotten some retail trade figures recently and some inventory figures since the GNP figures came out Do you have assumptions regarding that? When do the new GNP figures come out--next week?  The numbers were higher than what the BEA staff thought when they made the [first] GNP estimates I'm just asking a technical question Are they likely to revise the GNP number up or down or sideways?  Mr Forrestal  We are approaching 1130 am I have about four people on the list at this point Governor Partee, Governor Rice, Mr Winn, and Mr Balles Do you have short statements or long statements?  You're next on the list, so you ought to make up your mind right now  -22-    8/18/81  I think we better quit for a short coffee break  [Coffee break]  Governor Rice  Mr Winn  Well, with that confession of ignorance-- widely shared, I'm sure--we'll go to Mr Balles  Mr Keehn  Do you see declining house prices in California, John?  Mr Black  Mr Boykin  Are you in the Eleventh District, Mr Czerwinski?  -27-    8/18/81  I was going to speak to the Tenth District, just having been there  Having observed Denver, if they are not becoming overbuilt, something is the matter because they certainly are building I don't know what is going to happen when they complete it all There are lots of beautiful people in Aspen who seem to have a lot of money to spend and I'm sure that's characteristic of the country  I don't know They'd be a little worse if [unintelligible] If you want to make a real estate investment, you can go to Aspen and get on the muddy side of the mountain and buy a half acre lot for $200,000!  Well, I think we'd better get to our policy decision It isn't any great secret that we're in a difficult period here; we shouldn't have expected otherwise, I guess The industry differences that have been alluded to seem to continue I don't know what to make out of the latest figures, but the economy surely doesn't seem to be falling apart, despite the Midwest and some other gloomy reports that there are enormous pressure on some sectors of the economy Some concern has been expressed here about a tearing of the financial fabric and bankruptcies and all the rest I think those are very real and legitimate concerns On the other hand, I guess one has to question whether we can get through this kind of period and deal with inflation without running into at least the threat, and maybe the actuality, of that That is what we've been struggling with all along, and I suppose past history is that we were never willing to face up to this We're facing up to it already, more than I think we have for many years, but we're going to remain in this extremely uneasy position for some time  I wish there were some refuge in mechanics, of following one figure or another assiduously and feeling that this was going to solve our problems for us I have no confidence that we can take such refuge in mechanics against the palpable knowledge that any one of those figures is potentially, and probably actually, distorted We're in one of those periods for which we get paid--some of us better than others--for making a few judgments about what is going on And I think those judgments do encompass what is going on in a most general view of the financial world and the business world when we get mixed signals from the more mechanical indicators of policy We're obviously high on some and low on others And I don't find any very convincing stories, looking at the past and putting together what we know of the distortions of those figures, that we can make much of a choice between relying on those that are high or those that are low  When we look at the business picture, there is a lot of talk about recession It's a political fact of life We're going to get a lot of talk about recession every time the economy deviates below a zero growth pattern for a short period such as a quarter Then people  -28-    8/18/81  say, "Is the next quarter going to be below zero?" and that makes a recession We've been on an even trend, as a number of people have pointed out, for several years If you're on an even trend, half the quarters, roughly, have to be below zero and presumably half above I'm not sure it's a significant recession if you put together two quarters in a row below zero; I'm not even sure it's entitled to be called a recession if [the deviation below zero] is a very small number In that context, the business picture isn't very bright, I guess we all agree On the other hand, the latest data don't suggest, as many people have said and as I just said, that it's falling apart  On the inflation side, I don't fully share--maybe out of natural caution--some of the optimism that has been expressed around the table It's not that I'm unhappy to see the indications of lower prices I think prices certainly have been affected, even on those things that tend to be called accidentals such as food and energy prices, by monetary policy But it seems to me that we're at a stage where monetary policy has squeezed in an obvious way the things that can be squeezed and has helped affect the price numbers What I'm not at all confident of yet--and I say not confident of yet to express my strongest optimism because I actually feel a little weaker than that-- is whether lower price trends and lower price expectations have really been built into behavior In a way that has to be built into behavior if the favorable price trends are going to continue when interest rates do come down and there's a sense of more monetary availability I think what has happened so far is a reflection of the intense pressures on financial markets If they were relaxed--if we waved our hand and relaxed them in the next two months--that favorable price impact on commodity markets, on food, to the extent it has been influenced, oil with a little greater lag, and that kind of thing, would dissipate very rapidly and we'd be back where we started [Although] we see some glimmerings on the wage side, I think that could be reversed pretty quickly, too, if there were a sense of no restraint on the economy at this point We have to play the game long enough so that we have a degree of confidence in the price outlook that begins to be inbred in behavior, including wage negotiations; I don't believe we're there yet But there is a better chance than we have had in a long, long time, I think, that we can get there in the fullness of time How much time it will take is another matter  As for policy I don't know how you measure it but in terms of the aggregates, the reserve aggregates in particular, the fact is that, taking into account the very latest money numbers, we've gotten easier again I think there is some appreciation in the market that we've gotten easier That will be reinforced by the announcement that comes out at the end of the week as to what our objectives were last time and people see whatever it was--9 percent growth in Ml?  Growth of 7 percent, which is much bigger than what it has been running I don't know whether that will attract much attention or not While we've been getting easier in that quantitative sense, interest rates haven't reflected it I take it they're up again today I guess there's a lesson in that That we literally don't know how to affect interest rates these days We don't know all the things at least in the market that are affecting interest rates We don't know how that interacts with our policy to  -29-    8/18/81  get any very reliable change in interest rates, assuming we want that There certainly is an enormous desire on the part of the country to have lower interest rates at this point That pressure is building and it's going to build further I'm sure the Congressmen are getting an earful as they go around the country during their recess--unless they're all at Aspen, and I didn't see any there And that background is going to become more difficult  Looking at this problem, which is reflected I suppose in the projections of the staff, right or wrong--and not many people have said they can make a better forecast this month, in contrast to last month when everybody seemed to be more optimistic and saw interest rates down--it seems to me that this is not a period we're going to be out of in a hurry, if you take that as a benchmark The staff is projecting that with policies of anything like what we have the current interest rate structure is going to continue indefinitely without killing the economy in any sense; [in the forecast] the economy stumbles along anyway at a level course, gradually building up if we go out enough quarters It's not a very happy picture for us to be in, looking ahead Given that we are in the early stages, if I can put it that way, of any success in the anti-inflationary effort--given that kind of outlook and given the demonstrated apparent resilience of the economy in the face of very high interest rates despite the distortions in the economy and the very different impacts on different sectors--it seems to me that there is still a considerable danger, and maybe an overriding danger, of underkill rather than overkill [I think that's true] whether one looks at it in short-term economic terms or in terms of the longer-range problem we foresee over the next year, 18 months, or two years, with the fiscal stimulus that's coming along and has been remarked upon here, the big government deficits, and the demonstrated resilience of the economy It would be lovely to steer those interest rates down if we knew how to steer them, which I don't think we do But if we did, what are the risks that in a few months we will [witness] another rebound in the economy and Henry Kaufman's [unintelligible] scenario will come true? Then we will be in an even more difficult period, losing time at the very least in the fundamental fight on inflation; and we will [face] a more awkward market and I suppose a [worse] political situation not very many months down the road, with higher interest rates, more concern about financial institutions, bankruptcies, the outlook for the economy, and all the rest  When I add this together [I come out] with a posture that is not overriding but is convenient at the least, and makes some sense at the best We are in a mid-quarter meeting; we set some objectives after some careful consideration at the beginning of the quarter and I'd say that unless there's a pretty strong reason for changing, let's stay where we are in terms of the directive Where we are in terms of the directive is not bad If these recent M1 figures hold up--while they look big in the short run and that has some unfortunate repercussions and shows the other side of our dilemma--it brings us at the moment anyway about on track in terms of the M1 figures that we set forth in the directive last month, taking July and August together The M2 figure was slightly lower in July than was consistent with the directive It didn't bring any pressure on us to tighten up There is a fear and a concern, which is understandable, that the M2 figure will bulge at least in August because of some figures we have for the first week or so in August And with M1 going  -30-    8/18/81  up more rapidly, that also tends to support M2 So there is some danger, if danger is the right word, of overshooting in the narrower sense on M2 in August anyway Part of that, but a fairly small part depending upon how big the overshoot is, can simply be looked at as making up for a slightly low figure in July So, while we are more uncomfortable on M2, the discomfiture is not yet at least at an acute stage And I have some question as to whether fine-tuning at a mid- quarter meeting--to do too much tinkering on the basis of short-term expectations about M2--is worth it  In terms of the expectational and imagery question, we have to maintain the policy course We have not yet had whatever public impact there will be, if any, of the apparent raising of the M1 target, depending upon how one interprets it It obviously hasn't been raised in the broader sense of the target for the year; indeed, it has been lowered by one interpretation Regardless of that, I don't know how people will interpret both a higher rate of increase in the directive and a higher rate of increase that seems to be in store for August nor what that's going to do to expectations But I wouldn't want to press our luck, if indeed we have luck on that score, of not being interpreted as having overtly eased policy by taking another step now that for two months in a row would seem to push in an expansionary direction, when nothing much has happened during this month to suggest that that's appropriate other than that people are sick and tired of high interest rates, which I well understand But the business news, in fact, in this past month has been better than anything that was expected when we last met I think almost every business figure has been better than one would have anticipated at that time So, I would suggest to you that the most prudent course of action at this particular meeting is just to write a directive which continues the wording we had the last time and in effect says the Committee continues to seek what we sought a meeting ago, which is equivalent roughly to alternative A, the more liberal alternative given in the Bluebook  [Yes] At this stage I have not discussed questions of tactics and interpretation in a fine way, regarding just what we would do if one of these figures goes off We've already had some discussion at this meeting, which the record will make clear, that we are aware that M2 may be distorted by these all saver certificates and the other kind of saver certificates The difference between the all saver certificate and the small saver certificate is "SM" and I think this whole thing is somewhat of a sadomasochistic operation, so maybe that's appropriate  It might be worth getting that number when we get to tactics, because my sense is that it wouldn't carry us way above these targets and we could talk about generally being around the  -31-    8/18/81  upper end of the range But how far it carries us would come to the question of tactics and how September looks and all the rest The current projection--and I put as little stock in these projections as anybody--shows a much slower growth in September after this bulge in August If that [were to materialize], the bulge in August wouldn't look all that enormous  It depends, I suppose, how much this early August growth is affected by these small saver certificates I don't know whether [the staff] projection for August is right They had a big jump in these small saver certificates; whether that's a one-week phenomenon or whether it will continue--  Well, I can't give you a precise answer You have to tell me what is happening in M1 at the same time and what is happening otherwise It obviously makes us more restrictive than we would otherwise be It would have some influence if M2 were moving well above its range If it's moving slightly above--I don't know what the exact--  I don't think I'd necessarily call a conference It's in the directive  Well, as I say, I think that requires some interpretation, which we would reflect in the discussion at the least But there's nothing that's going to affect M2 that we didn't know about last month when we put this [proviso] in the directive  I have a little more modest view of my capabilities  I think this is the problem Larry There's nothing we can tell people that is going to convince them because everybody will have different interpretations I can assert that [we haven't eased] but somebody can come back with a different viewpoint and say that's a lot of baloney I think it's right in our terms; I'm not saying it's wrong But somebody will say that he looks  -34-    8/18/81  at reserves and at nonborrowed reserves--and that's what they do most immediately--and those measures have gone up at an annual rate of 20 percent for two months Or someone will say "I look at the reserve base and the Fed had that under control for a while, but now at the end of August for two months in a row growth in the base has been 9 to 10 percent So, he's blowing a lot of smoke because those are the indicators I look at and they've eased [because] total reserves are going up by whatever" There's nothing we can say to convince a person who looks at those indicators that we haven't eased This is the state of the confusion we have in the markets, even though in my terms it's a misinterpretation There it is And they are not going to change their minds because we issue a white paper or anything else  I'm not saying I'm not going to get on All I am saying is that I don't think that's going to solve in any complete sense the kind of problem that you suggest We are stuck with it in this peculiar period, when so many people operate on different theories and they are all uncertain There is no action to be taken that everybody is going to interpret the same way  Well, it does, but by the end of the year  It is consistent with getting to the low point by the end of the year  You know, the really sophisticated people won't have this interpretation But I would suggest that there is nothing much we can do I am very sensitive to the fact that last July I pronounced in all splendor that M1 was low, we weren't uncomfortable about it being low, and we weren't going to force it up And I think that's true; we did not in those terms "force it up" But the market remembers that we had a couple of months of big increases and a lot of momentum and we ended up slightly overshooting the target A lot of people will go look at that; I hope it's not the predominant view, but I just can't project it  Rates did not drop They dropped before At the time I made that statement they were at the bottom, as it turned out, and we had the great overshoot while rates were rising very rapidly  I'm not saying that it's going to repeat itself All I am saying is that there are a lot of skeptics in the market who are going to say that it's going to repeat itself  If you're worried about next year, and there's a certain legitimacy in that, surely your best defense is not to be easy prematurely this year There will be some tradeoff between lower interest rates now and lower interest rates then I don't consider my line a particularly hard one It seems to me it's on the upper crust of the choices given us But whatever that interpretation is, my general point is What has happened between last month and now, except better employment figures, better retail sales figures, and less concern about an immediate deterioration in the economy that induces us to change the directive in a way that will be interpreted as an easier mode?  You are assuming that the object of policy somehow is to try to manipulate the short-term interest rate  I don't object to keeping one eye on it, but it's a pretty old bird  I don't think anybody is jumping to hasty conclusions, from anything I know now  I know We're operating on a directive that now produces borrowings of $14 billion and produces an increase in reserves in August of what, Mr Axilrod?  I don't see anything now that suggests we should change that technical path that we are now on, which implies at the moment $14 billion of borrowing  Mr Morris  That's not true  [No,] having made a little study of it recently--  First of all, heaven knows what real interest rates are After taxes, they're half what they appear to be And if you cut them in half, they're not even up to the inflation rate Now that [assessment] is legitimate for some people and it's not legitimate for other people But it's a very mixed up picture  That is fair I think this tax reduction will have some impact on this Somebody put together for me the existing studies on real interest rates And the one that was most impressive--it went back to 1791 and covered just the United States because the picture is very erratic if you look abroad--shows no consistency of real interest rates at all And I thought the concluding comment from this study was rather interesting It said, in effect "If there is a law of economics that the real interest rate must be maintained at a positive 2 or 3 percent or something like that, it is a law that Moses must have brought down from Mt Sinai about 1950 and retreated back up on Mt Sinai a few years ago" because there is no evidence for it at all before 1950 The rate goes all over the place Forgetting about the tax issues--and that makes a big difference because we never had these kinds of income taxes earlier in history--there are quite a few periods, which look short on a long- term chart but were periods of a year or two, of high interest rates that were [at current levels or higher] What is unusual about this period, and quite unusual, is that those periods of high real interest rates in the past typically accompanied a period of declining prices We had enormously high real interest rates from 1929 to 1933 and in similar periods of recession You can't find, I think, without examining these charts more carefully, any time when real interest rates, forgetting about taxes, were so high during a period of inflation Typically, the opposite happened Real interest rates became negative during inflationary periods as was true in the '70s up until fairly recently It's all consistent with an explanation of what we've had, maybe for the first time in history during peacetime, which is an expectation of a continuing peacetime inflation That was never built into expectations before Before when we've had inflation--including in the postwar period--people thought that prices would subside, so real interest rates went negative during inflationary periods, as they began to do in the '70s But we've had a heck of a difference in the interest rate structure since '79, in those terms, which one can interpret as the American people giving up on the idea that we were ever going to return to price stability I don't think we get a lot of wisdom from looking at real interest rates, even though I don't object to the theory that there ought to be some tendency to go toward a low real positive rate  Mr Corrigan  I thought everybody wanted a penalty discount rate  Not put it at a penalty?  That was a generalization  What's the best of both worlds?  Well, I don't know what is going to happen to M1 I don't think it's inconceivable, looking at the July pattern which is the most recent we have, that we could get a decline in the second half of August that would bring M1 below the growth pattern implied here and would be consistent, then, with some easing in the borrowing level But I don't know whether that's going to happen  And we know that that has some funny money in it from this merger business, which should be out by the following week, I guess  I don't know if there'd be much in M2; there'd be [some] in M3 at least What would be in M2?  I don't think Dupont--  Stockholders' money could go into M2  Well, I think that is another caveat on the M2 numbers, if we had some sense that this merger was affecting it It's swelling up both sides of the balance sheet and I would suggest some caution on M2 I think all of these concerns ought to be reflected in the record somewhere  Let me just remind you of something that I think is true I don't know what to do about it, but it isn't going to make life any more comfortable If the expectations that Fred Schultz is talking about do change, it's going to have some impact on the economy What is holding up house prices? The expectation that house prices are going to rise What's holding up farm land prices? The expectation that farm land prices are going to rise What's holding up retail sales? To some extent, I assume it is the assumption that prices are going to be higher next year If we could snap our fingers and have that perfect world in which nobody expected prices to rise next year, I think the inevitable implication is that house prices would decline, farm land prices would decline, there'd be less construction activity in the short run, and retail sales might take a short-term nose dive I don't know how to avoid that That's assuming our policy was a great success in terms of inflation  I'm not sure there is a middle course That's my concern I don't think there is I don't see any way to fine-tune this situation  Governor Wallich  Certainly, we've achieved something!  Mr Forrestal  We'll find out on Friday, I guess, when it is published  I don't know In answer to that question, I don't feel so confident that it won't [excite the market] that I would want to take another action here that a month from now is going to be interpreted as further easing  Well, we have had a variety of opinions expressed But I detect, with some prejudice, a willingness to live with last month's directive, though with some concern about how it's going to be implemented I don't find entirely answerable those  -44-    8/18/81  questions because [they require] too many assumptions about what is going on In the immediate sense, [an unchanged directive] doesn't imply anything but staying on the path that we're now on That involves borrowings of around $14 billion, as I understand it, and in the first instance borrowings would be reduced if M-1B comes in weaker than now projected for the month Presumably, they would tend to go higher if M-1B came in higher than projected for the month But those judgments would be shaded by what is happening to M2, particularly If after several weeks M2 appeared to have a lot of momentum and was continuing high into September, we would shade the decisions on the tighter side And if the reverse happened, we would not  Well, I would not, but we can do that I wouldn't just because everybody reads these things with an electron microscope and will say "Why did they do that?"  Why do you want to say that?  Well, I don't think we have to worry right now about what I'm going to say on McNeil-Lehrer tomorrow We have to resolve this directive  Well, let me make a slightly different suggestion I think we can say something along the lines of what you're saying in the policy record someplace I don't know that we have to put it in the directive just after it says that it implies 7  -46-    8/18/81  percent for the quarter as a whole That sounds awfully fine-tuned to say it implies 8-1/2 percent for two months out of the quarter We're probably not going to come anywhere near the figure anyway  The problem revolves around the M2 issue and I don't think I can fully resolve it There should be some discussion in the policy record about the problems, of which we have several What was the last one? Oh, this takeover thing We have the takeover, the new institutional thing, and that was all in my statement Well, the takeover was not, but my statement in July mentioned the other things And we did not say it was going to make us terribly happy with a big overshoot in M2 only three weeks earlier  Well, I have no problem with reflecting in the policy record that these things may have unexpected results that we can't anticipate and that they would have to be taken into account in judging M2 I would prefer to keep it out of the directive just in the interest of continuity But if we made any change in the directive, I'd make it in that next artificial sentence, which is put in there routinely, that says shifts in the NOW accounts will distort measured growth We could say other things will distort measured growth in M1 or M2 and we will take account of those distortions But I think we could say the same thing in the discussion within the body of the policy record text That's what I would prefer, just in the interest of not complicating this further  I am not saying that because M2 is projected high at the moment for August we would do anything but remain on the path that we're now on  Not right now  No Things will change and M1 will be higher or lower or M2 will be higher or lower; and we just have to look at it as time passes I don't know what other answer I can give you If the growth in M2 is high but that in M1 is low, it obviously  -47-    8/18/81  has a different implication than if they are both running high If M1 is right on the bottom and M2 is beginning to run still higher than we project now and it begins to look [high] in September, then I think it does have some implications  I guess we're ready to vote I would make one change in the directive I would say "In the short run the Committee continues to seek" just to emphasize that we're not changing anything  Or "In the short run, as decided at the last meeting, the Committee will seek" I'd use one of those two  Well, I think it's consistent with what I just said If we have a significant drop in the second half of August beyond what is anticipated now and the M2 figures are just what we anticipate now, that would have at least a modest effect of reducing the borrowings If M2 were coming in high at the same time--by high I mean higher than now projected--we'd probably shade that judgment  And consistent with not changing anything, we just repeat the current federal funds range of 15 to 21 percent Am I right? We're somewhere in the middle of it  No, I was not going to add that I'd put that in the text, in the discussion about adopting the same [short-run objectives]  Well, I don't know that I--  -48-    8/18/81  Well, that's your interpretation, not mine The directive says "provided that M2 growth remains around the upper limit" The current projection, as I understand it, meets [the description] "around the upper limit"  Oh, I think 94 percent is "around the upper limit" That 94 percent is for August?  And in September on the current projection M2 growth would come down I think that is around the upper limit I don't disagree with that, but I don't think it's beyond it; that's all I'm saying  I'd just leave it in on the basis that it may well move within, though I don't know, by the time we get to September Why change it?  Well, I don't think that's right Obviously, it's a question of interpretation But "around the upper limit" does not mean the upper limit  Oh, there's no question about that I think it gives less tolerance for above than below  I proposed this on the basis that we're not changing anything from last time We knew about the special [small] savers certificates and we knew about the all savers certificates We didn't know maybe quite so much about the takeovers What we didn't know was that we'd have a bulge in the beginning of August But presumably that's what we were forewarning ourselves against  I think that is true We did not know We were only 99-1/2 percent sure  Actually, the all savers certificate is probably reducing M2 at the moment because the savings banks are all offering RPs in the anticipation of the all savers certificates Instead of putting money in a money market certificate people are using RPs, which are not in M2 and the money market certificate is  So, we may be getting an artificially low M2 at the moment  "Around" is the right word  I'm just wondering This part is not the part where we can put in some sentences about the possible artificial factors affecting M2  Yes, but that's mentioned I think it's alluded to, yes  That's right I agree I wouldn't suggest to you any more emphasis This says "the shortfall in M-1B growth in the first half of the year partly reflected a shift in public preferences"--that's good Federal Reserve language--"toward other highly liquid assets" It adds that growth in the broader aggregates has been running somewhat above the upper end of the ranges for 1981, but "in light of its desire to maintain moderate growth in money over the balance of the year the Committee expected that growth in M-1B for the year would be near the lower end of its range" Is there any reason why we can't insert a phrase there? We could add "at the same time, growth in the broader aggregates might be high in their ranges, an expectation reinforced by" Or let's put in another sentence "It was recognized that changes in the institutional setting might have an effect on M2 and M3 in the second half of the year" or some such language Is this language sacred? Do we have to repeat exactly what we had the last time?  Yes Well, I'm on line 44 I just don't know if that's a more convenient place to insert it  The trouble is that this says what we did last time, which doesn't--  That's what I was suggesting before, but that gets into the operational part of the directive It could be put there, but--  That is the place we can put it if we want to change the operational paragraph If we don't put it there, I guess the best place to put it, if we put it in the directive at all, is in line 25 That discusses what happened in July Growth in M2 accelerated; the level wasn't very high The level of M2 was slightly below the upper end of the range "It is recognized that during August and potentially in October the introduction of new certificates may"  I think we can put it in there and then put in the body of the [policy record] discussion again our concern about this factor Let's assume we will do that and let's vote  I think that will be accepted Well, with all that, I would propose just sticking in the word "continues" on line 52 "In the short run the Committee continues to seek" Are we ready to vote? Vote  Okay, thank you We have some sandwiches out there Do we have anything else? The next meeting is October 6th There's nothing else on the agenda for this meeting  END OF MEETING  -53-       Any comments or questions? Mr Winn  Governor Wallich  Let me just raise one thing informally and I'll ask for your comment, if you have any, tomorrow morning so you can think about it a little We have had an informal inquiry from one central bank not in the swap network to be placed in the swap network It is a small country  They have been given no particular encouragement, but I told them I would raise it for a general reaction, not for a decision I told them I thought there was a certain reluctance to extend these arrangements, partly because of the inquiries that would trigger from still others I think it's fair to say, Mr Truman, that the  They are on their own, so to speak [Participation in the swap network] would be of some assistance to them in their reserve management and, I would suspect--although this weighing is mine and not theirs--even more assistance in terms of their prestige  and as a member of the in good standing Weren't those about all the considerations they raised, Ted? They've raised this from time to time in the past I will not ask for your comment this minute, but apart from Mr Corrigan's let you reflect on it for a very brief period [and ask] tomorrow for any comments you want to make  Yes Their numbers are smaller, they are an Article IV country or whatever it is, and they are in the EMS Article VIII is what we're looking for, isn't it? Article IV is those other guys So, it depends upon one's attitudes toward this kind of thing Domestic open market operations, Mr Sternlight  How much did the bond market go up today?  Was this a rally that hasn't been accompanied by any lightening of spirits?  Any further comment?  Mr Balles  We don't know what [last] week's figures are much less the figures for the 7th These preliminary figures have gotten very [unreliable] One of the strange things is that currency is so weak Does anybody know why currency is so weak?  M1 has really been lower, drug adjusted!  Any other comments or questions? If not, we shall adjourn But first we have to ratify the transactions  SPEAKER(?) So move  Without objection, we'll ratify the transactions and adjourn until 900 am tomorrow  [Meeting recessed]    10/5-6/81 -5-  October 6, 1981--Morning Session  Well, gentlemen--lady and gentlemen--we can resume and spend just a few minutes on any reactions or comments or feelings you have about swaps, with particular reference to  not necessarily confined to that  Their answer to that is is not becoming a member but also-- Are they an Article VIII country?  But they are Article VIII?  They're not Article VIII?  Well, the argument is that we turned them down ten years ago or thereabouts apparently on the basis that they were members of the sterling area and that they ought to look to London for assistance They are no longer members of the sterling area so that reason is no longer valid for turning them down They do have independent reserve management, and it would be of at least modest help to them in reserve management to know they have this backstop  Clearly, a major problem with this is the precedent we create for others It's not ; we also get asked by countries  Turned them down solely on what ground?  Oh, they've become a member  Any other comments?  They could take it up in 1990  Well, I don't detect any enthusiasm They have already been told that a major problem is the precedential character of it Well, we can proceed to the staff reports on the economic situation  Maybe we should just pause here and get reactions on the business scene as such You made the comment that you don't see any precipitous drop likely That's one question that I suppose arises Comments on that or other points about the business scene are in order at this point Mr Boehne  Anyone else?  -7-    10/5-6/81  Mr Solomon  Your people had some data yesterday, Jim, relating to failures--I forget whether the term used was failures or not--per 10,000 firms It wasn't all that much, was it?  It was high, but it didn't look so high historically  Mr Roos  Mr Ford  I must say that among the bankers I have talked with there's a growing sense of concern about small and medium size businesses Several of the bankers have commented that there are bankruptcies that are in [train]--that at this point, nothing can be done to defer them and they're just plain going to happen Despite that, just to echo Tony's comments, I haven't talked to anybody I would regard as a responsible individual who would suggest that we ought to change what we're doing [They think] the course is certainly the right one  I just want to comment a bit on bankruptcies Though that is a statistic that is available and is followed, there are also a lot of people who are just quietly going out of business at this point, and that is not a statistic that we can follow very easily And there are a lot of people who feel that some of these small and medium size companies are simply getting what they can out of the business before they actually have to go into bankruptcy So, this is having an adverse impact on that group  Let me ask Jim Kichline something on what he said about construction My impression is that major construction is holding up pretty well in terms of orders and that kind of thing Is that right?  Yes, big construction  It seems to me a little surprising not to see some weakness there, in the orders anyway I understand there's a lot in the pipeline Mr Winn  Well, it's a large other subject, but one can get a bit concerned about what one sees going on in the banking system companies being held alive by not very good lending and loans to foreign countries being rescheduled with loans on top of loans  Mr Balles  Mr Corrigan  You touched upon the wage picture I must say I get a little discouraged sometimes when I look at wage attitudes The gentleman on my left is very optimistic on this score We had some big bankers in here a month or so ago who are all planning to increase clerical salaries in a range of 11 to 15 percent next year and who I understand believe this is typical of industry generally I suspect it is How that is consistent with getting inflation down, if this generalizes very far, I don't know Not many people have commented on that If there are any additional comments to lend insight as to how business or labor are reacting in this situation in terms of prospective wage settlements, that's an interesting variable  There's no question that there are some scattered signs I won't prejudice [the discussion] The question is how widespread they are  Well, [unintelligible] the typical big businessman up until recently--he may be changing his mind--was ready to give a 10, 11, 12 percent wage increase like falling off a log He thought that was a normal thing to do That may be changing, but I--  It sounds to me--  Well, the federal wage increase is set at 48 percent or something like that Oh, you mean in the private [unintelligible] I meant in the government itself They broke the comparability link, so it moves in that direction Of course, I think the attitudes on the controllers' strike have had some bearing on this climate in general, accidentally or otherwise Mr Boykin We have the good news coming up!  You have so many holes in Texas that after a while, it's going to--!  You need a McDonald's by every 70-story office building!  Mr Guffey  You think the cattle is marginally profitable?  -15-    10/5-6/81  Thank you I had a bunch of cattlemen in here on Friday and they weren't very happy  What do you see going on in land prices--I was asking those fellows on Friday about that--and in house prices too? These cattlemen who were very upset conceded that land prices weren't going down and might still be going up a little because of all the outsiders coming in and buying land  Don't kid yourself I think without question there's a lot of support now There's a lot of concern about the budget deficit and a lot of understanding among business leaders and association leaders in many areas But there's a lot of anger growing out there It tends to be The Federal Reserve controls interest rates and the Federal Reserve ought to do something about them It's not exactly below the surface And when it will erupt like Mt Vesuvius, I don't know  Well, I think you have to make a distinction A lot of [the criticism] has been focused on the budget deficit, fortunately, which is where it should be On the other hand, for both political and real reasons, I'm very skeptical of how much progress is going to be made on the spending side The Democrats don't have much incentive; they're fairly happy The Republicans are worried; they feel they've cut spending It's going to be very hard  -17-    10/5-6/81  to make the next cuts There will be some but how much relative to the size of the problem is very questionable I think you've talked to fairly sophisticated people; I'm talking about the people who are a little less sophisticated perhaps And they're just getting angry  Mr Keehn  Well, we've exhausted this subject We can turn to Mr Axilrod  The subtleties of Mr Axilrod's analysis may not be fully grasped by the Chairman in all respects, but we can perhaps clarify [them in] the discussion Mr Roos  This arithmetic gets rather drastically changed by the estimates of the money supply for the past two weeks, of which one week is still doubtful And the first week in October may also be doubtful; we don't know very much about it Let me ask one purely statistical question, Mr Axilrod, so we know what we are talking about here It may be covered in the Bluebook Even in alternative C, let's say, which is 9-1/2 percent for M2, we are above the range That half percent is your estimate of a somewhat extraordinary impact of all savers certificates or something?  There is some assumption that [money] comes into all savers out of what would otherwise be in M2 Where is that from and what evidence would you have for it when it happens?  You haven't any evidence; you wouldn't have the evidence now because you don't know the statistics But where would you find that evidence?  -19-    10/5-6/81  Well, presumably, you would look where for individual holdings of Treasury securities or something?  Yes, but they are all in M2, let's say  Will you assume those are in M2? And you say apart from that you are only estimating $5 billion or so  That only makes 1/4  Do you have currently any direct evidence of what the basis for this shift adjustment is?  But you have evidence that new NOW accounts are still being opened and that some significant proportion is coming from outside of demand deposits?  Is it 5/8ths of 6 or 5/8ths of the difference between 3 and 6?  You may be interested--this sounds like a little more reliable report--that Mr Sadat clearly was hit, but they say no vital organs were hit and he's being operated on and said to be not critical  The observation was just made--it's a peculiarity and I don't know if anybody has a logical explanation--that the weakness in M1  -22-    10/5-6/81  partly reflects an extraordinary weakness in currency in terms of general trends Governor Gramley  Let me just pick up on one point you made I have no doubt about the enormous weight of Mr Axilrod's presentation But the point about M2 I must confess went right over my head  He can repeat it, but he's going to have to repeat it in different words so far as I am concerned  -23-    10/5-6/81  You'll get restraint on M2 relatively easily  I understand all that; M2 doesn't decline the way it used to when we would run into deposit ceilings  And interest rates may move more rapidly as a result of that I don't understand that it follows that M2 is in some sense artificially swelled by this and gives you a--  That I agree with It rises relative to M-1B But I don't understand that it follows that M2 is in some sense artificially--  Artificially isn't the word I don't understand that the expansion in M-1B is giving a false signal as to the credit growth in the economy or the monetary growth in the economy  I guess I don't see the conclusion from what has happened that in some sense we were tighter than we intended  -24-    10/5-6/81  to be Also, if I may just make a point here, I don't think it is accurate to say we haven't been following M-1B The borrowings have gone way down, particularly with the sinking spell at the end of September M-1B obviously isn't as high as we intended, but I think that is why borrowings have gone down We didn't make some discretionary adjustments we could have made But, certainly, the fact that pressures on reserve positions have eased as much as they have is because we were looking at M-1B  I [don't] know if it's prompter; you certainly get a larger one  We have all kinds of problems You mentioned one kind of perceptual problem, Larry I guess Lyle and others are worried about both perceptual and real problems in other connections more related to interest rates Let me tell you just from a public relations standpoint that there is great restiveness and anger, as I said before, growing out there That would be relieved, obviously, by some decline in interest rates But in some way the worst thing that could happen to us is to have a great sense of relief for a month or two or three that interest rates are coming down--I'm now talking public reaction and not policy--and then have them racing up again I think the public patience for climbing up the hill very rapidly again may be extremely limited  Hence, public patience is getting limited in all directions It's a question of--  Well, to the extent funds come in from outside M2  It's a simple common sense analysis that I have used on many occasions There are some institutional changes that have depressed M1 and increased M2 It must be the case since there is a discrepancy between them We didn't have to operate on both of them, I suppose, but certainly the discrepancy is bigger than expected Governor Rice  Let me just suggest that we can break pretty soon for coffee but that anybody who wants to make some general comments of the sort that have been made do so I think that is  -26-    10/5-6/81  useful Let's dispose of that before asking everybody to make a [specific policy] comment If the spirit doesn't move anyone, we'll go and have some coffee and come back and get more specific  I'm not quite sure I heard Steve saying that  I thought I might have heard him say that the first time around; the second time around, I don't think so  I'm not sure that's saying anything but that that's the way monetary policy works whatever M you use  -27-    10/5-6/81  Governor Schultz  Mr Solomon  Pardon me? We're just making general comments  Mr Winn  Governor Partee  If nobody else is thrusting their hand upward or whatever, we'll go have a coffee break  [Coffee break]  [In response to your question about Mr Sadat,] he's either dead or alive, and that's all we know  The dollar was up some, but not all that much The gold price is up pretty far Our intervention policy isn't associated with it  -30-    10/5-6/81  Well, I think we can proceed with somewhat more precise comments at this point I don't know right now if I have anything in particular to add I don't have much faith in any of these projections, I must say, as to the statistical relationships between borrowings and the money supply or interest rates or whatever I think we have to assume that those relationships are highly unstable, to say the least And the probability distribution around these estimates, if they are perfect as a measure of the central tendency, is enormously wide I don't think anybody really has the faintest idea what the money supply is going to do on its own in the next month or three months And I think we have to take that into account in making our decisions The volatility of interest rates is a problem The economy is soft; in some sense in the very short run there may be some risk of it getting softer rather than stronger But there is a major risk, which a number of people have alluded to, of a yo-yo performance of the economy That isn't going to be very helpful in terms of our longer-range objectives if it gets up a head of steam again in a time perspective of 6 months or so Having said that much, let's proceed Mr Ford  Mr Balles  Let me just inject that there is an official report here that Mr Sadat is dead  Did you complete your comments?  Mr Boykin  Mr Guffey  Governor Teeters  Mr Morris  We have more than a slight overrun in M3  Governor Wallich  Governor Gramley  Mr Boehne  Mr Keehn  Mr Schultz  Mr Roos  Mr Corrigan  Mr Balles, I guess we're back to you  Yes  Well, on that point, Larry, I think one has to average through We can face the question when we get to February as to what we say One thing would be to base it on the fourth quarter of 1980 and look at the two years combined if we're way short That would also tend to take care of your problem, Fred I agree with Jerry that we're going to have volatility in the money supply I just wish we would have some volatility on the up side because it has been quite a while--April I think was the last month when there was a really strong [M-1B] number--and we're about due I'm a little concerned that we may not get it because if we are in fact moving into a somewhat faster decline in business--I avoid the word "recession"--it seems unlikely that we're going to have strong money growth So, we may in fact be facing this over the next several months As I said before, I think we have to fall short on the year We just can't ask for a 12 percent increase in M-1B from September to December, and even that won't quite get us there The public wouldn't understand It's just too radical I could accept "B" I could shade M-1B in "B" to 8 percent, which I think would be a reasonable objective I don't think the monthly pattern the staff has in those numbers means anything We could have an 11 percent growth rate for December or we could have 3 percent or 18 percent We don't have any idea what the month of December is going to bring But I think the central thrust of our policy ought to be to begin to return to the bottom of the M-1B range, and 8 percent seems to me suitably fast to plan for I'd consider ourselves very lucky if we get that high of a number in those last three months  I would also agree with several who have suggested that maybe the federal funds rate range ought to be 12 to 17 percent That's not because I don't think rates are going to come in low Let me point out to you that the staff projection for the rate of inflation next year is 71 percent Now, assume they're wrong A lot of people  -37-    10/5-6/81  think they're too low Assume it's 8 percent Still, these rates are too high for that rate of inflation And in a recession environment we can't have much of a real rate and expect to get the stimulus to the economy that will bring it back So, we might have a temporary problem with borrowers coming into the market because rates are lower than they have been But I don't think it will last if, in fact, the rate of inflation does tend to wind down, as most forecasters now are anticipating So, we really have to get from where we are to a level of rates, it seems to me, of about 8 to 10 percent It's a question of how we manage that reduction in the rate level over a period of time if we want to have a reasonably bland economy And I would, of course, change the emphasis, as suggested, away from too much emphasis on M2 I think the way that Lyle suggested is a good way of doing it That $200 million for borrowings is at the end of the period, I believe Steve has left the room, but I think the idea is that borrowings might work out to be $200 or $300 million by the end of the period I think the [initial level] ought to be about $800 million or something like that  Mr Winn  Mr Solomon  Mr Monhollon  What are you encouraged by? Tell me  That's impossible, if I may say  Mr Rice, you expressed yourself earlier, I believe, and so did Mr Guffey  I'm sorry, I didn't catch all these  Right  Look, I think we've been through the list I just want to take care of another matter for about three minutes, if you will just excuse me, and we will come back to this  It's a matter of whether we should intervene in this market [The dollar] went up a bit, a percent or more, on President Sadat's death Since then it has come back I don't see any urgent need at the moment but we will be in contact with the Bundesbank and make sure that they know we're willing to be helpful if we can be of any help But at the moment we're doing nothing  I may have to talk to the Bundesbank, so if I get interrupted again, that's what it is  There may be some thread to all of this, for all of the confusion The problem is that none of us can rely very well on any of these statistical projections Certainly this is a time when we may have to stay closely in touch because we don't know what is going to happen Things will look quite different than they look today We  -41-    10/5-6/81  had a 7 percent increase in M1 in August, and September looked as if it would be up until we got some [new] figures, one of which hasn't even been confirmed yet And, if we had the pattern that Mr Corrigan is suggesting that was in the paper, I think it would look awful If we had growth, but because it was a big bulge suddenly in October which we didn't have to react to, it would look quite different I think [the money growth numbers] are just plain unpredictable  So far as the threat of recession is concerned--it depends upon how you define recession--that's not the forecast that has been given to us, which people did not take great exception to, but I share the feeling that there's a danger in balancing the risks in the very short term There could well be a risk that things will get significantly worse rather than better in terms of that forecast I'd just repeat that in a sense I think those are the risks we have to take We have a very restrictive policy; I think those risks were there all along That doesn't mean we should go out of our way to aggravate it or create a provocation, but I don't think we should be surprised if those risks arise, given the configuration of economic policy generally and the kind of problem that we have Indeed, it would probably be a miracle if we get through this without a recession--something that goes in the books at least as a mild recession--because everybody loves to have recessions and they're very quick about calling things recessions There is an automaticity in all of our policies in that as this pronounced sluggishness remains, interest rates should tend to go down as short-term rates have been tending to do for a couple of months And, presumably they would continue to do so under those circumstances The big problem, and maybe the only question there, is that an enormous amount of Treasury financing has to be done We've had a glorious period of short-term rates going down 2 or 3 percentage points and long-term rates going up, which is not very helpful in some sense, and there's nothing we can control just by pumping out money It may have the opposite effects, but we have the hard reality of all that Treasury financing out there  Well, we're projecting $37 billion, I think; it's only about $3 billion a week or something of that kind! Well, I'm including the off-budget finance to the Treasury, but I'm not including the other But it's an enormous amount of financing  Or it just could get higher In any event, frankly, getting M-1B in the range is very much a two-edged proposition so far as I'm concerned It has the moderate merit of looking great when we're testifying, but it doesn't look great even when one is testifying if M2 and all the other aggregates are above  -42-    10/5-6/81  the range I'd rather have [M-1B] below the range if the others are above, quite frankly, just in the pure presentational sense But a great big increase [in M-1B] is not going to look good to what I will call the market or to people wondering what we're doing and whether we're easing aggressively in the face of sour business news Also, just in terms of the performance for the year as a whole, while it's very hard to evaluate the quantitative magnitude, there are reasons to believe that M-1B should be lower than we thought when we set the targets, particularly in light of the effects money market funds, which have only doubled or more this year, have on that particular aggregate I also recognize that it may have the other kind of effect on the other aggregate But the interpretation that is going to be put on this and its real effect depend upon whether we have to push or whether we accept it, and that's what we've been struggling with here I think there is--if I detect it correctly--some fair reluctance to push M-1B growth too high It's a matter of judgment what too high means On the other hand, there's quite a willingness to accept a high number if it can come without pushing too hard I don't know whether that's possible or not That's about where I am anyway, and I suspect that sums up the feeling that a lot of people have If we take this backwards, what is your infamous borrowing number at the moment--$875 or $884 million or thereabouts?  And that has come down a lot, of course As a matter of instinct, although it is alleged to be inconsistent with alternative C in being too low, it doesn't seem to be inconsistent with interest rates where they are and moving lower if M- 1B continues weak, which is the normal repercussion we would have to that So, starting out around that level may tempt us to be slightly lower than where we are and it seems to capture the midpoint of what is proposed anyway The same thought is reflected in all these feelings; [namely], that we should have a consultation if the federal funds rate gets around 12 percent I don't have any problem with that In some sense, those are the two most operational decisions we will make here We'll see what happens with that approach  Around $800 million  Well, I've not specified that at the moment One or the other  I'm not going to stop there, but I'm just saying that the operational [decision] that's important would be how we handle the concern Just in terms of these various alternatives, I myself think the weight of the argument is on something like "C" in terms of its presentational and other effects That doesn't mean that if we got a burst--if October turned out to be the long awaited month of some bulge in M-1B--we would react It would imply to me that we wouldn't react to that at all fast or at all, if it's just in October  -43-    10/5-6/81  If we ended up above the "C" specifications as a result of a bulge in October, it's not going to make anybody terribly unhappy On the other hand, I don't really want a specification that forces us to ease and push so hard that it conflicts with what I think was the tone of what people said--in effect, that they don't want to push that hard simply to get within a range And I would attach some importance to M2 Now, whether that's put in the form of a proviso or of equal weighing, which some people have suggested, isn't a crucial issue to me I think that's what it amounts to anyway  I suppose that would leave me at something like "C," with borrowing of $800 million; and if you want to make it equal weighing of the two aggregates, that doesn't bother me I don't know, but 13 to 17 percent is fine with me as a benchmark to trigger a consultation, which is what [the bottom of the "C"] range is I do not have a strong feeling that if money were really weak we would stop at 13 percent That's not my gut feeling at the moment But if that's an appropriate place for consultation, it's perfectly satisfactory to me  Well, it's a pretty subtle point, but we have sometimes had 4-point ranges and sometimes 5-point ranges  Well, I think one can argue just that It's what we said before and that [will be announced soon] It's not going to surprise anybody if we say 7 percent again I'd be a little concerned about the "or somewhat more" if that implied that 7 percent was the minimum to which we were going to push at all cost  As I said, we just cannot predict If the higher number came about without our pushing it that hard, that's one thing We'd accept it and say That's fine, we were low on the target; there's no great strain here and we don't have to tighten up promptly because it's above 7 percent or whatever  How much impact, just on a quarterly basis, say, are we talking about here?  I must say that I see little difference between numbers and the proviso They're both there in the directive  In fact in this last period, M2 would have been significantly--I guess that's the right word--above the proviso except for the information we got a week ago It suddenly revised downward in September 10 days ago  I do not accept that language, but in fact it was running higher than the top end of the range and we did not cease providing more nonborrowed reserves for that reason [unintelligible]  It was sort of in the range that was expected for August at the time of the meeting  Oh, I'll be back in just a second  Whatever way it goes in there, there ought to be some sentence to that effect We have to evaluate that  -47-    10/5-6/81  Let me just go back I still don't see particularly that it makes any difference how this is worded, frankly What we did last time was that we didn't react very fast to M2 being high, and the Committee understood it would be high in August What we did was pretty directly to follow the reserve path for nonborrowed reserves, which left total reserves short We would have had--if we were just operating on M-1B--a greater case for making a so-called discretionary judgment to push up nonborrowed reserves even faster They were going up at a rate of 20 percent a year For several months we did not take that discretionary action, partly with an eye toward the proviso; but since we thought it was strictly above the annual target until 10 days ago, the fact that it was slightly above the annual target didn't stop us from continuing on the full nonborrowed reserve path This business of a shortfall, if it holds up in September, brings us almost exactly to the top of the annual target  That's right, and we were aware of that, so--  But the recorded M2 figure undoubtedly understates the functional M2 figure because it just doesn't happen to have retail RPs defined in it and they should be in it So, we're really running above And that will be reflected when we talk about the change to the all savers; part of that looks like an artificial jump that's real It's just catching up to the recorded shortfall on M2 already  It depends upon whether you're worried about M2 running high enough The fact is that it's running high in a real sense  I certainly don't think we should react in that week in which they go in One can still be worried about M2 being a little high  -48-    10/5-6/81  I don't think I would say it that way What we really should be tolerating is the movement into all savers certificates from funds that aren't and shouldn't be in M2  We need some sentence to that effect in there, whichever way we do it We have to say we will evaluate M2 in the light of this I see nothing the matter with the language that [the staff] wrote here But some language to that effect, whatever it is precisely, should be there; people ought to notice that we may get an artificial bulge in M2 that we are in a sense discounting I have no problem with that, whether we put in the numbers for M2 and M1 directly or put it in the form of a proviso indicating a range around the annual equivalent or slightly above, if that's what you're suggesting  We won't have any difficulty making a numerical target, presumably, for M2  We are much more likely to be close to this number for M2 than we are for M1, just in terms of the randomness of the numbers We can argue about it; I frankly don't think it makes a lot of difference We can say "In the short run the Committee seeks behavior of reserve aggregates consistent with growth of M-1B from September to December at an annual rate of 7 percent after allowance for the impact of the flows into NOW accounts and growth in M2 around"--I don't know what are we saying  I'd rather put in a lower number and say "or slightly higher"  Even 10 percent or somewhat more bothers me a bit If we are going to say "somewhat more," we can always use a lower number  Does the 10 percent include the all savers or not? Is that where your--  We can say "10 percent or slightly more, recognizing that the behavior of M2 will be affected by the recent regulatory and legislative changes"  Recognizing particularly that in October  We have had trading at 14 percent as the low but the 14 percent range may be a little artificial today We have too many reserves out You are selling today, I take it?  It wouldn't lock us very tightly anyway Steve, you may be right I hope you are right in this sense But what we are probably running into here is this If the low money figure for publication this week is confirmed and next week is low, this $800 million that we started with will probably be lowered pretty promptly If we get a bulge in the first week of October, it won't be But if the first week in October is another low number--meaning it might be positive but only $1 billion or so--we'll probably get the borrowings down further  I don't know what the number is But let's say it's distinctly below $2-1/2 billion; we will probably gradually be lowering the borrowing right off If it's $4 or $5 billion, we wouldn't be  Well, we can do what we want to do there We can put in 12 to 17 percent; there's nothing to stop us from consulting before that if we don't like what is happening  That bothers me a little just because if we put in a range it sounds as if we are really in trouble on either side of that range  If we put in even a 3-point range, the probability, at least early in the period, is that it would not occur And as a result, [I would like to suggest that] we set the initial borrowing at something near the $880 million we have been experiencing--say, $850 to $900 million--rather than going to $800 million and risking a drop to 14 percent very quickly and having to take some action on the discount rate  We had borrowings over a billion dollars with the first figure, right?  I have no problem with $850 million  I don't think we have to decide that with any precision If it reached 13 percent in mid-November and everything is weak, nobody is going to be disturbed about it If it reached 13 percent two weeks from now, people would be disturbed You have to assume a certain amount of competence, some minimum level, in the Chairman  I'm not leaning either way  What I am suggesting is one version; let me just run this one up the flag pole and see who salutes "In the short run the Committee seeks behavior of reserve aggregates consistent with growth of M-1B from September to December at an annual rate of 7 percent after allowance for the impact of flows into NOW accounts and 10 percent or slightly higher for M2, recognizing that behavior of M2 will be affected by recent regulatory and legislative changes, particularly the public's response to the availability of the all savers certificate" I will modify my proposal slightly to say borrowing at $850 million and a federal funds range of 12 to 17 percent If the funds rate dropped out of bed here and got around 13 percent promptly, we would probably have a consultation We won't necessarily have a consultation if that arises at the end of October or the beginning of November when we have a lot of weakness in the aggregates and it's obvious why it is down there  Well, unless somebody has a strong preference for the proviso type language, we will proceed with this language Call the roll, Mr Altmann  Okay, thank you We can proceed to lunch  END OF MEETING       We need approval of the minutes  SPEAKER(?) So moved  SPEAKER(?) Second  Without objection There's a short report on foreign currency operations There weren't many operations  Any comments or questions?  You have a recommendation for us?  Are we symmetrical in all these now in terms of that?  Well, there's a question of the interest rate There's also a question of the exchange rate, which I now forget--  The exchange rate was different when one side was drawing than when the other side was drawing  Well, we seem to be in reasonable shape on these arrangements regarding the terms Do we have a motion?  I'm remembering the risk-sharing I don't remember the specifics of it at this point, but I won't--  Yes, 50-50 Well, do we have motion?  If I hear no objections, you are authorized to negotiate these on substantially the same terms as they now exist  Mr Sternlight  Questions or comments?  Now that Mr Axilrod has consulted all of us--  Mr Black  Mr Balles  Any other questions? If not, we can ratify the transactions if you are prepared to  Without objection; that wasn't enthusiastic on the [motion] and the second Mr Kichline    11/17/81  No Excuse me, Jim  If it's one short question  I might add that we always have the luxury here of looking at these things ex post As I remember this intermeeting period--and I may have my timing off a little--we had a big increase in M1-B early in October And the reason October turned out to be low was the figures late in October that we didn't know about until we were in November Now, in the middle of November, we look back and October looks low When we were in the middle of October, it looked high  Mr Kichline    11/17/81  Why don't we go ahead with Mr Axilrod and then we'll call it all open [to questions]  Well, both statements gave us a little menu of concerns I think the time has come for comments on the economic scene and related comments you might want to make on the financial scene  Mr Roos  Mr Ford  Having resolved that piece of arithmetic, we'll go to Mr Winn  Well, let me make a couple of comments on your comments On that one, I am somewhat encouraged in a perverse sort of way that the bankers I have been talking to recently realize that they may have some credit problems on their hands, if realization is the first step toward appropriate policies  On your first point on money market funds, I agree with the general direction of your comment It's very hard to make statistical analyses We've tried to make some I forget all the assumptions, but on what I think would be considered the most conservative assumptions that adds somewhat over 1 percent to M1-B in terms of transactions balances But that kind of calculation allows nothing for indirect effects, for example that an individual minimizes his transactions balance simply because he has a money market fund and knows he can draw upon it even if he doesn't draw upon it frequently or at all [The problem] is a matter of continuing concern But there's no figure that comes out that says this much of the money market funds is transactions balances and that much isn't because--  Well, these calculations derive--and I don't know how good the basic data are--[from information] that says there's this much turnover or this much check usage on these money market funds [That is, if] they had a normal kind of velocity and if they were NOW accounts instead of money market funds, they'd be this big And that accounts for a relatively small fraction of money market funds But still, they've been growing so fast it does make an impact  I don't have the figures with me to look at these things in a longer-term perspective, but I'd like to look at that I should get those figures, Steve  The year-to-year changes are quite orderly  Where?  These are adjusted figures?  We started high?  I might also say that I have no confidence in this shift adjusted figure anymore I think it was an appropriate thing to do earlier in the year But at some point it loses me, in terms of significance I think we have already passed the point where it loses me, but it's not--  -12-    11/17/81  Well, it had a quarter of a percentage point or more [effect] in the second half of the year, I think  It's nothing drastic  Well, that's the money market fund question  Mr Partee  Mr Boehne  What do you find to be the typical inflation forecast in these planning budgets?  That accords with my experience, but I find more outliers above than below  Mr Rice  Governor Schultz  Governor Gramley  Well, I don't know how many people we can get through here, but let's try a couple more Mr Wallich  Well, maybe we'll go drink coffee and then get through the list I won't blame it on you at all, Governor Wallich It's a rather long--  [Coffee break]  Let's welcome Mr Balles  I thought they were decontaminating the M1 figure That's what George Schultz said!  End of story?  Mr Keehn  Mr Morris  Mr Corrigan  Governor Teeters  Mr Black  Mr Guffey  Mr Roos  I think it's fair to say there are differences in emphasis  Governor Partee  Mr Solomon  Before we have a lot of debate back and forth, I think we ought to get through our list here with Mr Boykin Then we will attempt to draw all these conflicting stands into happy harmony  Well, let me try to summarize a bit There are some differences in emphasis, but I'm not sure--we'll find out--whether they're as great as they appear to be  Oh, let me ask you a question, a side issue, on this energy business You say there are some early signs of a much [less] rapid increase at the very least I've heard the view expressed that a lot of the activity currently in the energy area is based upon an assumption that the oil price is going to be--I'm trying to remember the figure now--$80 or $90 a barrel in the 1990s And then if that assumption is a disappointment--  In nominal terms Presumably, they're doing the drilling It isn't all that clear to me, but the point was that the price [assumption] was high enough that a lot of people might begin questioning it Do you have that feeling?  A price of $90 a barrel, if it's in nominal terms, isn't even an increase in real terms if these 10 percent inflation forecasts are correct  Well, I think there are a lot of assumptions in the gas business that the price of gas is going to be $12 or more a cubic--  Foot or MCO or a thousand cubic feet, whatever it is  Not in the 1990s but in 1985 or 1984  I'm not even sure what that director was assuming with regard to $80 to $90 a barrel I think it probably was in real terms  In ten years, 10 percent is nothing That's right He must have been talking in real terms  Let me just make one point We did an awful lot of talking about M1 It has been pointed out by a couple of people that M2 has been in the directive as well and that somehow M2 wasn't as reliable because [its relatively rapid growth implied] we wouldn't have had a recession I'm not so sure about that We thought the M2 range was very tough and restrictive when we adopted it We thought we'd be at the higher end of the range if we were within it at all I guess the velocity of M2 hasn't changed much, has it? This year the assumption was right on the button There wasn't much [change in] velocity Anyhow, that's a side comment  While I listened to all the comments around the table, I have the impression that there are some problems that only time will solve and I think we have one of those I don't think we should suffer from an excessive hubris that whatever we do is going to produce a nice, neat answer to our problems A sour view of business is rather common around the table I didn't hear anybody not express that And I heard quite a few views that, when one has to look at an uncertain world, the staff's projections are as good as any There was a certain amount of talk about the risks on one side of [the economy] getting worse Let's talk about the risks on the other side of it being better I think they exist, too There's certainly a view around--maybe the most common view--that the economy may not perform very well in the short run, but we're going to have one hell of a recovery in the second half of the year A lot of people are probably operating on that basis I'm not saying that's the right view, but it is a view that a lot of people hold And that probably has some implications for activity Currently, there is a risk of some cumulative difficulty, complicated not just by normal kinds of cumulative difficulties in recessions but by financial problems that we can't see very clearly but may be there We have an uneasy feeling they may be there  I don't think we can put a lot of money, speaking for myself, on any of these particular projections And while I agree that the staff view is as logical as any, the range of dispersion around any forecast, I suspect, is going to be pretty high In any event, we've got sour business in the very short run We still have high inflation expectations I suspect they may be improving a little, but I get the same kind of reports that Mr Boehne commented on, and I think inflationary expectations are going to be very sluggish to change Part of the nature of our problem is that the business picture can move much faster up or down At the moment it is down Then some other things may change, such as inflation and inflationary expectations and long-term interest rates in particular after all those markets have gone through That in itself means we're in a kind of no-win situation If we deal with the inflation and long-term interest rate problem, we cannot deal with the business problem; or if we deal with the business problem aggressively, we can't deal with the long-run inflation, long-term interest rate problem, I suspect There is no way we can do it with the limited tools that we have We can get more relaxed about the whole inflation issue; I'm not sure that would help But I'm not ready to go with, as Nancy was suggesting, a    11/17/81  basically new approach I'm not going to suggest that at the moment and [that is] a little outside the range of consensus for this meeting anyway  How favorably this will develop depends not only on all these uncertainties about business that we can't resolve, but on how fast people become more confident that we can get on an orderly long-term path I think a lot depends upon wages I alternatively get hopeful and discouraged about that depending upon the latest report In fact, we don't know much But in terms of financial dimensions, it does seem to me, in a sense, that the key is how to get long-term market rates down and bank rates down Those are the rates that are going to be most important for the economy But it's not really just a problem of getting them down; it's a problem of getting them down so they stay down I don't think any short-term relief on interest rates is going to mean a thing, if they begin bouncing up again pretty quickly or with any possibility of that happening And I'm not thinking primarily in the political terms that Fred Schultz mentioned Our basic problem is how we stimulate the economy That may be expressed more happily at the moment as avoiding an excessive decline, without the threat of interest rates moving right up again as soon as the economy levels off and shows some signs of life I think there is a real possibility of a turnaround at some point; how fast depends partly on what we do But at this second--to exaggerate just a bit-- we're going to run into a stone wall, assuming the kind of monetary targets we have for next year We will find markets very sensitive to an increase in the economy or an increase in the aggregates, which normally accompanies an increase in the economy And without either enough experience with declining inflation or enough confidence in the future generally [unintelligible] movement, as I see it at the moment, from being very abrupt  If we have a sizable turnaround in the economy in a hurry-- expectations of a buoyant economy and expectations of higher interest rates or whatever--I don't think we're going to have much time for all those balance sheet adjustments and changes in behavior that are necessary to restore more balance to the financial system And we'll be up against the same dilemma this year that we had last year I don't know how indefinitely one can go into the future There is a question of how confident people feel about the outlook for inflation  Not much has been said about the budget The question of the upturn in interest rates after whatever downturn we have is going to be importantly affected by what people think the budgetary outlook is That doesn't look very good at the moment But I must say it's also affected, at least as importantly, by what people judge our own behavior will be--whether we're going to react or come out of the shoot in a hurry the next time the money supply shows a little bulge on the up side, because that's the way they are sensitized to think we're going to behave And so long as the monetary growth rate is low, they are sensitized to think interest rates will go down, and that's what is happening In a way, if we want to get interest rates lower, the best thing that could happen is to have the monetary aggregates continue to look low, because the minute they begin to look high, I think that will be the end of the interest rate decline, at least in the long-term market In the space of some months, I doubt if that can be avoided If we were successful at the moment in getting a big increase in the money supply, I would not bet very much  -33-    11/17/81  on long-term rates coming down--for a good many months in any event I don't particularly think that's going to happen  There's great difficulty in knowing what the money supply is at the moment That has been adequately discussed I would just make one other general comment in reaction to what some people have said I do think that we've had too much interest rate instability and too much exchange rate instability If this persists into the future in the range that has occurred in the past couple of years, at some point we're going to shake these financial markets apart so much that nobody will know where in the world they stand and a long-term investment will be three days That's not very encouraging, particularly with regard to the long-term interest rate problem that we have  Something occurred to me during the discussion when Frank Morris accused--if that's the right word--Steve Axilrod of saying something I don't think was in Steve's mind But let me say that I don't think it's so bad if it was in Steve's mind, because it's somewhat in my mind We get a natural force toward moderation of monetary growth when we get downward forces in the economy We get a certain natural push upwards on the money supply when the economy is beginning to expand And if we literally [evened off] the money supply through those demand forces, we'd have a violent change in interest rates I don't see that there's any way to avoid it Let me come back to Lyle's point about how violent a change in interest rates we want and whether we really are achieving anything I don't think that calls into question in a fundamental way the trend of monetary growth over time What it does call into question is how hard we should fight against essentially cyclical movements in demand forces on the money supply When we get these waves in the money supply, we have lots of problems explaining ourselves to the iron-clad monetarists in the part of the market that's [persuaded] by that kind of argument But I don't think it is or fundamentally has to be interpreted as a departure from the general idea that we've got to get a lower trend It's not a question of how much cyclical amplitude we allow around the trend We don't allow any cyclical amplitude that's going to raise questions among the questioners But one has to ask what the lesser evil is  In any event, getting down to the nub of what we have to decide, let me try some verbal formulations We may have a problem writing a directive that people can understand and agree with But I'm not sure--we'll find out--how far apart we really are I think what we're debating is the aggressiveness, in a sense, with which we move to push the money supply up or deal with weakness, if that's what we're going to have I don't think I really hear anybody saying that we shouldn't move in the direction of easing bank reserve positions and be prepared to see some decline in interest rates if the money supply is on the weak side I don't think I hear anybody saying that if the money supply took a little jump, we should be sitting here resisting it in any sense Having said all that, we need to quantify what we mean and how we express it It's almost easier to talk in terms of the operational variables rather than the targets themselves, recognizing that the actual movement in the money supply over the next few weeks probably is not going to be affected much by what we do and we'll have to take the figures as they come Some consistency in our operations as we set them now--not knowing what those money supply figures are going to be--with further declines in interest rates of a  -34-    11/17/81  moderate character doesn't bother me I think that's probably appropriate in all the circumstances I would think that means something like a $350 million figure for borrowing or $400 million, or someplace in that area We'd be prepared to move down on that if the money supply is weak and not prepared to move up on it if the money supply is strong unless [it's extremely strong] But I can't conceive of it being strong enough so that we'd want to move [borrowing] up, frankly But we would have to be prepared, I think, to move it down somewhat if the money supply remained weak  Just how to define weakness is going to be an issue We have had the pattern recently of a 5-point band in the federal funds rate range It's an artificial contrivance in many ways at best because if we put a 5-point band on any of these numbers I'm not sure anybody sitting here would want to think of the federal funds rate going up to 15 or 16 percent as some of these [Bluebook alternatives show] In current circumstances the rate probably is not going to go up at all significantly from where it is for any length of time It is slightly over 13 percent now I suppose, on the convention we've used in the past, that would make the range 10-1/2 or 11 percent to 16 percent or someplace in that area; but the upper part of that range isn't very relevant I'm sure that this feeling would not be unanimous, but there is a considerable amount of feeling that we'd want to take a very hard look at this if the rate got down toward the lower end of the range, as it well could It is probably not apt to do that unless [the Board] reduces the discount rate in the near term I think the discount rate is clearly going to be in question during this period and should be in question in terms of a downward movement I think we would assume that that move might well come sometime before the next meeting, unless there is quite a change in the business picture When one thinks in those terms, we could begin getting down toward those funds rates quite easily but probably after a period of time The discount rate isn't going to be moved right away Now, as to how to formulate the actual directive, I think basically we have two choices We can put in a relatively low number and say we're not bothered if it's higher; or we can put in a relatively high number and say we're not bothered if it's lower Maybe we could have a little more discussion of those options  I had Steve draft a couple of alternative directives Let me read them to make sure I understand them first Well, let me just try this on you The concept is simple enough; the language can be worked on, obviously One option follows a practice we have used at least once and maybe more than once, and I think it's a good practice unless we have to deviate from it because it doesn't sound like so much fine-tuning It starts with exactly the same directive that we had at the last meeting, but it puts it in the past tense, so to speak It says that at the previous meeting we decided on 7 percent and 10 percent, [respectively as the quarterly targets for M1-B and M2] Then "In reviewing these quarterly targets, the Committee felt that shortfalls in growth would be acceptable if they are generally consistent with phasing into the tentative monetary growth targets set for 1982 and as they may occur in the context of declining interest rates" Then it goes on with the federal funds range So, it says in effect This is the target we had set for the quarter; we recognize we set it; it looks like we're low and we'll accept the shortfall provided interest rates are declining; and we're not too unhappy with the shortfall in the light of phasing into next year  The other option, presumably, would be consistent with doing something like "C" We'd put in those numbers for the next two months, but say a somewhat higher growth rate would be acceptable as consistent with the quarterly target set at the previous meeting and just repeat the targets of the previous meeting That doesn't say anything about-- What I was looking for was whether there's any interest rate allusion in that one There is not, I guess But in that one we put in the low number and say we're perfectly happy to raise it to where we set it at the last meeting The other says that what we said at the last meeting is okay, but we're happy with a shortfall [in money growth] if interest rates are declining, and it's logical for moving into next year anyway  If you're not happy with any shortfall, you're not going to be happy with either of these formulations because they both are low  Well, if you really want it much higher-- if you want a 7 percent target next year--then you wouldn't buy this one But I think all it's saying basically is that the number is  -36-    11/17/81  something less than 7 percent It's more consistent with what we're tentatively thinking about next year than 7 percent  It doesn't  It doesn't say we favor 7 percent growth next year What it says is that if we have 7 percent growth-- Well, the thought expressed around the table by a number of people was that if we push hard for large growth now, then we will have to slow it down next year, and that may be undesirable  Yes, that's for the quarter This is just repeating what we said at the last meeting  We've used language of this sort before, Chuck That's ridiculous, if I may say so  -37-    11/17/81  We are not when you take account of M2 That's just wrong  M2 is still in this directive M2, in fact, is currently projected to be on target  What are you going to do in your conception if growth comes in less than alternative C?  Unlike the other one?  A big decline in interest rates and a shortfall in M-1B in October  I may have to agree, but you asked me what justifies it  -39-    11/17/81  Well, do we have any other comment?  The basic problem we're dealing with is a repetitive problem We are setting a target for the next six weeks and nothing we do here is going to affect what those numbers are over the next six weeks We have to have a little longer perspective  I don't know We're not going to resolve this before lunch I guess I come back more strongly to my gut feeling that we're better off not horsing around with the target that we set last quarter in a formal statement But I'd clearly admit that we are prepared to see a shortfall under certain conditions It seems to me we clearly are  Well, I think that's about the same as saying we're willing  Let me talk a little less theology and a little more practically at the moment Suppose we start at $350 million as an assumption Make the figure a rounder number and start at $400 million, Mr Axilrod In the ordinary course of events, you set a nonborrowed reserve path You start it, just as an assumption, at $400 million and you will put in a growth path for M1-B Let me give you two hypotheses for that growth path you put in for M1-B One is 6 percent, just to keep the numbers round, which is close to "C;" and for the other extreme, say, 8-1/2 percent, or round that down Now, if the money supply comes in around 6 percent, the borrowings would remain at $400 million or whatever the [initial] level is, if we adopt "C Presumably, that's what would happen If we put in the [higher] number on the basis of "A" and the money supply comes in at that same 6 percent, how much would the borrowing level go down?  It would be $200 million lower by the latter part of December?  That is the range of what we are talking about in nondiscretionary action  What I think I am saying, in practice, is that we might set that path, depending upon where we start it, close to the "A" specification; we're probably not going to be very quick about making discretionary upward adjustments in the path if the shortfall is anywhere within the range of "A" to "C" We might consider one if it came in at 3 percent or less It depends on what happens in M2 and all the rest, but that's what we're talking about  There's not a lot of room; that's right And that's why we're talking about relatively small numbers here We haven't got a lot of room unless we really wanted to push extremely hard Precisely, we don't have much room  Well, that is one alternative one could take But we would not be very quick about making discretionary adjustments It depends upon where we start off or what people think about this If we start off at $400 million and it fell to "B" or "C" or a little less, we're going to end up with $200 million If it fell more sharply than that to well below "C," we're going to end up at a lower level and we may run into the federal funds rate constraint That's what the operational decision is Now, if we set it up the other way, it depends upon where we set the initial level of borrowing In either case, I think we're saying that if it runs above, we don't do a thing--we accommodate it--which we've done often in the past  I think that's the operative question And we're talking about a very narrow range  It depends upon where we set the initial borrowing  It moves in that direction We're talking about very small numbers in the next three or four weeks or so  The most important thing is where we set the initial borrowing  The discount rate will be an important consideration in where the market [goes]; in fact, that's going to be more important than this other thing I'm afraid that the only two things that are going to make any real difference here, in the range that anybody is talking about, are if somebody says we want to go all out and make sure we're going to hit 7 percent M-1B growth and we ought to start with zero borrowings Then we'd be talking about a very different kind of approach But with the initial borrowing level someplace in the range that we're talking about, these other differences are going to be minuscule in a mechanical application of this [directive] What is going to make the difference is if and how quickly the discount rate is changed and whether we make a discretionary adjustment as we go along  I wouldn't see the borrowings going above $400 million under any conceivable conditions that I can imagine over the next five weeks  Well, if we adopted a whole different kind of strategy, but barring a deliberate counter movement on the discount rate--  -44-    11/17/81  I'm assuming that is quite possible I will not make any premature assumptions  If we see both continuing weakness in business and continuing weakness in the aggregates, I think that would be a reasonable assumption  What you're saying, "in a deliberate, orderly way" makes a difference of maybe $25 million in borrowings in the second week in December  Is that wrong, Mr Axilrod?  I think you're focusing on the wrong thing That's going to be more affected by the way we set the initial borrowing assumption than the mechanical thing that falls out of this  In a 4-week period  Where is [the bottom of the range] now, at 12 percent?  -45-    11/17/81  Well, we're in a very narrow range here I have a strong feeling within the narrow range that we've discussed here All I'm trying to do is make the point that if we have to construct a reserve path, and that's what we're talking about, the difference between "A" and "C" at the extremes is not an immediate one; once we've set the original borrowing assumption, it can't change just mechanically by more than $25 or $50 million a week unless the money supply really falls out of bed It would be changed because the money supply fell out of bed not because of the difference in the assumption; there's only going to be a $50 million difference in early December  Oh, if it does, then the borrowing is going to come down But it doesn't make any difference whether we pick "A," "B," or "C" If the money supply is negative, borrowings are going to go way down That would be because the money supply went down, not because we picked "A," "B," or "C"  I must say that looks a little foolish to me  Well, I have a feeling maybe we ought to go to lunch and settle it after lunch  Well, we'll have a quick lunch  [Lunch break]  Let me consider the numbers, with an undue degree of technicality, because we're in a very narrow band I don't think there's much disagreement here on these details; whether they will work out or not is another question Let me just get clear in my mind again what I asked you before The difference, going all the way to the extreme, of something like an 8-1/2 percent growth rate and a 6 percent growth rate just in setting the reserve paths is going to be $2 billion, did you say?  Well, don't make the lower one what actually happens That's where we're setting the path theoretically now We don't know what is going to happen yet That's the next question I'll ask  -47-    11/17/81  Your path would be $2 billion higher in December  Well, is that because there's a bigger difference in--  Well, why not? I don't understand that  I'm looking at the December part of the reserve path The first period is not going to make any difference, because we're going to give you the level of borrowings I'm not talking about what the money supply actually does now  Right  Well, you'll hold the nonborrowed reserves that are consistent with it at the moment  It'll make no difference  That's what I'm asking--go ahead That will only be different in December  Are you telling me the difference in the theoretical money supply--not the actual--for December between 6 percent and 8-1/2 percent is only $400 million in December?  So, we're talking about a difference of only $200 million, which wouldn't really materialize all in December in choosing the path Now the much bigger difference in the actual borrowing is going to be [because of] what actually happens to the money supply  Well, that's what I am trying to see--how much room we've got for that  Unfortunately, with all due respect, that isn't worth much  Yes, that's the same $200 million I have here  Yes, but you're saying that's if it came in roughly around 5-1/2 percent If it came in at 3 percent or something, that's another $200 million  Well, I don't know how to avoid this We'd just run into the federal funds rate constraint then We have to consider what we want to do with any of these alternatives  I guess I can't convince myself that it makes all that much difference Unless it made a real difference, even if the money supply was growing someplace in this range, we wouldn't want to see the federal funds rate drop any more  But still, I don't think these differences make much difference in themselves The question is What happens if a real shortfall in the money supply is added on top of it? In that case we're going to run into [the need for] a consultation  I think that's probably the practical difference here I take it that everybody is agreed that, whichever  -51-    11/17/81  one of these numbers we put in, if the money supply came in higher in the short run, we wouldn't want to run up the borrowings, although it would be called for if we put in the low number We'd have to override the thing, but I think that's understood  Well, that's the only thing Of course, we can do that whatever we say in the directive  Well, the obvious in-between course is to draw the path just using the 7 percent That leaves it between the 8- 1/2 and 6 Something around 7 or 7-1/2 percent splits the difference; it sounds all right to me If the money supply really goes off on the down side, we're going to have a consultation anyway I think that's quite evident  I don't think in terms of "Bs" or whatever here  That's what we're talking about  We're talking about $400 million, which I wouldn't want to exceed in the short run and, say, 7 percent just for purposes of drawing the path That's all we have to do at the moment Then we've got to write a directive which encompasses this And we still have the choice of whether to put in a low figure and say "or higher," or to put in a high figure I tried to rewrite the one starting with the high figure I had some bias, I must confess, toward not changing the directive, which we can't meet anyway every month But let me try this wording on you "After reviewing the quarterly targets for M1-B from September to December at an annual rate of 7 percent (after allowing for NOW accounts) and for M2 at an annual rate of about 10 percent or slightly higher" And we probably should put a phrase in there "adopted at the last meeting" or something "the Committee decided some shortfall in M1-B, generally consistent with phasing into the tentative money growth targets set for 1982, would be acceptable in a context of declining interest rates and continued strength of M3"  M2 rather, yes I don't know; this seems fairly plain to me  Well, it relates to what we were talking about just now  Well, it goes on and gives the federal funds range, but that's--  It's the same language; we've got to fill in the blanks I take it we have a split between 11 to 15 percent and 10 to 15 percent, right?  All right My feeling in substance is that we ought to consult at 11 percent, but I--  I don't consider that entirely a bad idea  What is the substance of your comment?  Take out the whole sentence?  I don't know what people would conclude from our taking out the sentence entirely at this point  I think for sure, at this point  Well, I don't think that is essential, but I don't know how other people feel about it It gives some feeling of the dimension of what we're talking about  [To Mr Guffey] Are you going to vote?  Are we having a vote?  Well, I don't think we can argue out next year's targets here We have a wide enough range [of views] to start with All this is meant to convey is that we're recognizing that 7 percent is high and we wouldn't mind being a little lower That's what we're saying  Well, I don't think you're going to get agreement on that I'm allergic to [unintelligible] down every meeting, if I may say so, some target for the next 5 weeks that has nothing to do with [unintelligible] It's just the law of distribution; we don't come very close to it, whether we're above or below it I'd like to relate the actions in one meeting to the actions of the previous meeting It's just presentational We did that, I guess, last time I forget what we did last time in substance, but it was some kind of reiteration of the target at the beginning of the quarter  I don't know what "7 percent or higher" means If we get a shortfall, what do we do then? Does that imply real aggressiveness? It sounds like it to me You're saying now that we're starting out there; I don't think the staff projection is worth much, but I think the probabilities are we could well be below 7 percent Then we'd better be very aggressive  That's the problem Do we accept it if gets higher?  Who knows in this world? But I think we have to have agreement that if it's higher, we don't want to do anything  And I thought we had some agreement that if it's lower, we don't want to be all that aggressive either  Yes I said "not all that aggressive" We'd let them slide as they would naturally slide  Tentatively, I thought we'd arrived at constructing the path on 7 percent  No, we're talking about $400 million, as I take it  Well, if we had a strong reason for wanting to change it, we would change it, obviously But I think what people are saying here is that if we met that original target, everybody would be happy  I don't know what that means  We can say "The Committee decided in the light of the shortfall in October to accept a lower rate for the quarter" That we can say  We have several precedents for saying we accept this kind of thing in a context of declining interest rates, or the reverse, don't we?  Well, I have arrived at wording that says "The Committee decided in the light of the low rate of growth in October of M1-B, that some shortfall in the growth of M1-B from the target for the quarter would be acceptable, in a context of declining interest rates and continued strength in M2" That should be worded, I think, in a conditional way If M2 is--  That's in substance what you want to do  What?  Oh, I think that's what we're going to decide  That is partly what bothers me  We keep promising these short-term results that we don't get That is precisely what bothers me  We're not that far off in the sense that we'll probably hit the M2 target And what we're saying in this formulation is that we agree we will probably miss on M1 That is the purpose of this [wording]  Well, there isn't any what you call private understanding Yes, we have to set a reserve path, which we've just tentatively set; there's no obscurity about it The way to avoid these things in the future--but it would get us into other problems--is to say we're setting the reserve path at X, which we consider consistent with 7 percent We are not promising we're going to make 7 percent; that's just where we're setting the reserve path  That's what we're trying to do, as I understand it I think we have agreement on the substance; it's just how to describe it  Do you think you can give language for a directive, if I understood you correctly?  That's just the traditional form  This is the wording we have--that we provide reserves consistent with the 7 percent This says "behavior of reserve aggregates" We can do it just by putting in those numbers That's right And every month we're putting in numbers that we aren't going to make We can do that; that's simple enough But I don't think it conveys any more information  There's no question The more I look at this, the more I think we're arguing over nothing We act as if the only thing people read is this paragraph Whatever we say we're going to have to describe in the rest of the policy record, and we're presumably going to describe it in more or less similar terms  It's the traditional way of doing it I don't think it makes any difference in substance; we'll describe it all anyway [in the policy record] But it gives you less information and we're still back to this business about jumping up and down every time we have a 2-month target or a 5- or 6-week target over which we don't have much control But if you can rationalize it and say that's where the reserve path--  Well, that's what we say ordinarily That's the traditional form  But we don't have this kind of problem in January--at the December meeting--because we're starting a new period for which we have no targets So, we don't have the problem  I don't think we presented a quarterly target a year ago  The difference now is that we have put these things on a quarterly basis, and we did that with a purpose in mind--maybe it was only in my mind--which was to be a little  -62-    11/17/81  consistent over the quarter The concept was for the meeting in the middle of the quarter to review the target we already set for the quarter Now, this is a kind of reversion to taking a look at it--  Well, I don't think we're arguing about any substance As a matter of form, I don't like it But if everybody else likes it--  Well, on that, I would prefer the 11 to 15 percent just to get a consultation at around 11 percent If we were absolutely symmetrical around where we now are, we'd make it 10-1/2 to 15-1/2 percent, I guess  I don't see how anybody can take any offense at 10-1/2 to 15-1/2 percent That is absolutely the traditional--I'm talking about the outside reader A Committee member can, maybe  It's centered on where we are, which is what we've been doing  -63-    11/17/81  Yes, but that goes to the reserve path, I think, not to-- Well, one can argue that we might want to consult at a higher rate I'd just as soon consult at a higher rate myself But I don't think where we put this number is going to affect where the funds rate goes; it affects where we consult  I am sensitive to your point, but we still have to put some number in here In fact, we may consult before we get to that number That's always an option We can consult any time we want to consult  I have a certain amount of control over that  No Not for that reason alone I only feel constrained in the sense of wanting to consult if there were genuine confusion over what we should do, whatever these numbers are  Well, I am not in favor of that formulation But if everybody else loves that formulation--  It was essentially this, just a straightforward--  It puts in the "higher" It says the lower one won't be acceptable at 7 percent  I don't think so, but that's why I'm not crazy about it This one only had 10-1/2 percent for M2 as Mr Axilrod wrote it  Well, let's settle this federal funds range All these cosmetics don't amount to a hill of beans in some way, since we explain it all in the [policy record] Who wants to put the bottom at 11 percent?  The bottom of the fed funds range Well, we have a majority there, clearly  Well, the alternative is 10-1/2 percent Big deal! How many would prefer 10-1/2?  The only problem I see with 11 percent, which I prefer in fact on the lower end, is where to put the top A 16 percent figure looks a little ridiculous to me  SPEAKER(?) You've got it!  How about 11 to 15 percent?  An 11 to 15 percent range happens to be completely symmetrical around the present level of 13  Yes Is that acceptable?  Acceptable at this point All right Now, I take it there's agreement that we're going to set a path on the 7 percent and we probably won't be moving that discretionarily downwards very readily because we haven't much room to do so If it comes in weak, it will go down by itself starting at a borrowing level of around $400 million I think that's where we've been So, the only thing that remains is that we can just use this traditional format and say 7 percent for M1 and whatever we say for M2  11 percent  We can put the phrase that Chuck had in front of it "The Committee noted the shortfall"  "The Committee, after noting a moderate shortfall in M1"? Yes, but turn it around  No, we didn't have an overrun in M2  Well, the directive said 10 percent for the quarter  I'm glad somebody reads that!  No I don't think so  -67-    11/17/81  I don't think we want to say "somewhat more" especially because of what happens if it's somewhat less  What the directive will say is The Committee, after noting a moderate shortfall in growth in M1-B in October from the target path set at the last meeting,"  " seeks behavior of reserve aggregates consistent with growth of M1-B from October to December at an annual rate of 7 percent (after allowance forNow accounts) and with growth in M2 at an annual rate of around 11 percent" And we're at 11 to 15 percent on the federal funds range  This is just the way it was the last time They get equal weight  The other was within the target  We were expecting a higher number than what we got and we were 07 below the figure we mentioned in the directive  I'm in favor of that  So, there's no mention of a surcharge?  I think we can delegate to the Secretary to put in a mention of the surcharge in the appropriate place  Yes  Now that we have labored over this thing that nobody is going to see for six weeks and until it's no longer relevant any more--    We can come to order and approve the  minutes       With a motion and a second we will  approve the minutes, if there are no objections  Then we will have a  report on foreign currency operations or the lack thereof       Any comments or questions?       What was the question?       Well, we would have intervened if the  [mark] had continued to weaken  I am sorry I missed whatever you  said Sam, but we would [unintelligible]  After the Polish  declaration of martial law, the mark was very weak and then it  strengthened relative to [its level] in the Far East  We would have  intervened if it had retreated rapidly again after having  strengthened at around the 230 level or a little lower,  [unintelligible]       Where's the rate now?       I still think that was fairly abrupt       My sense is that this market has been a  very poor market--let me put it that way--right through this period  Is that still correct?       I guess I said something  I forget  exactly what they said       But when we asked them, the Federal  Advisory Committee members did say that banks not under the FAC might  have other views  I guess that is the way it was  As I recall, that  comment was in their written report but they weren't violent about  it       Well, I'd forgotten it  But it did come  up and I guess they did put in their written report a positive  recommendation that we ought to intervene  They were not frothing at  the mouth about it, but it was a positive recommendation  I asked  whether that view was generally held and they said they thought it  was by a lot people, but not everybody  And that was the extent of  it       I don't know what you mean by general  guidelines  We always have this problem  There is nothing I can  recite that is good in all seasons  We developed this interim  guideline following the Polish [action], that if [the dollar] took a  sudden jump up beyond where it was [against the mark], in essence  we'd intervene  That was after the dollar had already gone up; it  was already up about 4 percent from where it had been trading       We're developing case studies  We  intervene on assassinations and military takeovers!      Well, actually what happened is that we were quite ready to intervene and at the time I thought it would probably be necessary But in every one of these occasions recently the rate has reached its nadir in European trading rather than in the United States So every time we've gotten geared up to do something, the rates have come off the peak or off the floor  Well, that is what has been happening  We reserve the right to intervene when we find it necessary Sometimes our patience is more strained than at other times We also want to cooperate if possible And we have been cooperating, I guess We have nothing to approve here No recommendations?  The Poles [were given] a rather clear message just a couple days before martial law was imposed They calculated that they owed about $350 million of interest They did not have $350 million So, [they were told] they could pay the interest for 3 or 6 months, and then the rest of the agreement could go into effect  I think that situation is very much up in the air I find it a little difficult to see that anything is going to be done unless the Russians give them money to pay the debt and pay the interest between now and the end of the year I don't think they will last  Well, there was a date earlier in December, but now the end of the year is critical in that if [the lenders] don't get paid by the end of the year, then they will have to admit that the loan is in default--or at least that it is questionable--on the day that they have to make up their books for the end of the year and decide what to do about it  I wasn't aware anybody had done that much  Mr Sternlight  Any comments?  We look forward to it with our usual conviction  -6-    12/21-22/81  The answer is Nobody knows  Yes  Are there any other questions that can have equally enlightening answers? No other comments? We have a proposal on raising the [intermeeting] limit to $4 billion Is that acceptable? Hearing no objections--  Yes That is accepted We need to ratify the operations Without objection we will ratify the operations On my agenda I have next the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates and then the economic situation It seems to me that it may be a little better to take up the economic situation first If that seems more logical to other people, we will call upon you first, Mr Kichline Did I decide on the other order when we made up the agenda?  I'm just looking at the Greenbook It has national defense spending declining every quarter Is that correct?  Mr Keehn  I wonder whether this kind of thing is ever reflected in the statistics  That is right I don't see much in the nonmanufacturing area I was talking to some bankers out in Chicago and they were all reporting that they have in their plans 11 percent or more for wage increases I think they are a little behind the times, but so it is Any other comment while we are on the subject? Let's remain on this subject for a moment Does anybody else have anything?  SPEAKER(?) It's a form of rational expectations--that is, the expectation that your employer may go bankrupt  They wait for that expectation until he is practically on the edge That is true  Any other comment on the wage cost/price situation?  Are commodity prices still declining? I haven't looked at that for a couple of weeks  If that exhausts our wisdom on wages and prices, is there any other comment on the business outlook generally?  What does Texas say, Mr Boykin?  That is the story I hear when people from farm areas talk to me that there isn't much movement in the price but there sure aren't any sales, and don't try that price too hard  Mr Roos  Mr Winn  Mr Ford  Refresh my memory, Mr Kichline, if you can In the 1974-75 recession did wage rate increases actually come down appreciably?  Well, I know prices did; I couldn't remember how much wages did  I understand that, too I really don't know whether--  Wage and price controls were removed in the spring of--?  A bunch of the controls came off in early 1973; I remember that very well I remember very well when I thought the great bulk of them were sneaking off in January of 1973  I don't even remember that What were those annual numbers just for the heck of it?  So it was just a 1 percent decline even then?  Then it went up again or held steady or--  Mr Balles  Governor Gramley  Governor Partee  I don't want to [catch] you unawares, Mr Truman, but it might be appropriate for you to say just a word about what is going on abroad  And they are very worried about their exchange rate They figure they are in a "no-win" situation if they take a stimulative action, particularly in monetary policy Their exchange rate will weaken and they already think it is too weak That would get them in more trouble on exports, and they are already in a lot of trouble on exports So how do they stimulate is the question, particularly when the budget deficit might--well, I don't know what it  -18-    12/21-22/81  will do to the exchange rate But they feel they can't do it on the budgetary side and they can't do it on the monetary side because of the exchange rate  Well, we have lots of uncertainties and concerns in the business outlook And, I must say the mood in Europe is extremely gloomy--more gloomy than the actual trends justify, it seems to me, at the moment But their unemployment is very high and they are very aware of that; it is phenomenally high given past records during the postwar period  Yes, in many countries it is comparable to ours or even higher, which is very unusual just taking their raw figures On the other hand, I have a feeling that there is more movement here on prices than there has been for years, literally, in terms of a change in trend And that among other things could have favorable impacts on financial markets if anybody believed it I don't think the financial markets believe it yet I am not sure I believe it yet, but I must admit there is more gestation and more ferment and more talk about lower [wage] settlements than even that reduction in 1976 or whenever it was indicates [The staff has] some fairly optimistic price figures in its forecast We will see, but I am not sure they are out of sight Let's go to your commentary, Mr Axilrod  Let me say I don't anticipate getting down to anything very [specific] in the way of numbers on this particular longer-range exercise this afternoon or tomorrow There may even be conceptual questions that people may want to raise about how to present these, and I say that without having thought through any change myself So proceed, Mr Axilrod  -20-    12/21-22/81  Let me just make a couple of comments On the technical side, the possibility exists of some redefinition of M2 What sounds logical is putting in retail RPs, which would raise M2 some historically If we take out institutional money market funds, it's practically a wash That leaves us with some unknown amount of institutional money market funds in money market funds that are not labeled institutional and that we don't know how to break down What to do with IRA/Keogh accounts, which might change appreciably next year, is a confused subject I'll put it that way It depends upon what one thinks M2 is measuring and what a transition of money into those accounts may mean It might have been worth distributing, but I forgot about it, a little set of charts that Mr Truman's people circulated this morning [at the Board meeting] The charts were notable for showing that currently none of the main countries was near its monetary targets this year and that enormous discrepancies--larger than for the United States by a considerable margin--had developed between the different Ms There were actual minus numbers for M1 in some cases with 12, 14, 15 percent increases in M2 or M3 as the case may be The only country that showed a nice orderly pattern was the country which doesn't have monetary targets That was Japan I don't know what the lesson is to that But it was an extremely erratic picture It was poor--  Oh, you wouldn't think some of these other countries did either They have not had the swings in interest rates and they haven't had the swings in the economy, which may say something too These other countries have had some technological innovation but the impression is that they haven't had as much as ours But the discrepancies in the numbers were even larger than we had It is a startling picture of the differences between the various [Ms] in those countries  Well, let's have a little discussion in the remaining time  Governor Schultz  Mr Balles  With that I think we can agree Governor Partee  Mr Morris  That is an assumption the Committee made rather than the staff, if I may just put in a footnote  If that happens, then what? I am getting--  That is right There is a risk on that side But what do you do about the risk that Visa, Master Charge, and a bunch of other money market fund people will introduce sweeping of demand accounts and NOW accounts into money market funds next year?  It will widen the spread between M1 and M2, but--  Governor Gramley, I don't want to go on too long on this scene here  Mr Roos  I have three more names on my list I will not accept any more And if any of the three on the list-- Messrs Wallich, Solomon, and Black--wish to wait until tomorrow, that would be acceptable If you have an urge to say something, Governor Wallich is first  Mr Solomon, do you have an urge?  Because they are more like [components of] M3 than M2  Mr Black, do you want to--  Okay, we will meet again tomorrow at whatever time--  Well, I think we can proceed with the discussion of the longer-term ranges in a very tentative way Governor Wallich, you were cut off before  Mr Black  Mr Rice  Mr Morris  -31-    12/21-22/81  By this year do you mean 1982?  Let me linger on that point for a second [Let me ask] our staff experts Has it ever happened before? The same question has occurred to me We only have a month and a half of experience--  Which M1-B?  Mr Corrigan  Are you are talking about the short-run targets or the long-run targets?  Mr Keehn  Mr Solomon  They may even vary L  Well, you are treading on delicate questions of what M2 and M3 mean anyway But I think [unintelligible] the rationale [is that] M2 is more a household kind of liquid asset And there is no difference between any institutional money market fund and [an institutional] CD, let's say, which is in M3 and not in M2 You'd certainly put it in M3  Three months, four--  But where does it move to? It moves to a CD or 20-day commercial paper  Conceivably, yes Mr Ford  Nobody knows There is some of that, but I don't think they would tend to be the ones that label themselves institutional funds These are the Merrill Lynch accounts or Fidelity accounts or whatever  We are not going to find out We can try  How do you suggest we do that?  Well, I interjected my question because I am not sure the research supports anything And I am not sure we will have the research that is going to support anything The nature of the problem is that we don't know  We can learn a little something, [but] experience not only here but internationally suggests that we are not very good at predicting this [kind of development]  We won't know where the money comes from  Well, I don't think it is useful to speculate on this at great length at this point Are you finished, Mr Ford?  I agree with that and I agree we ought to do all we can to understand what is going on Mrs Teeters  Mrs Teeters  Mr Winn  That is the number of checks or--?  Well, instead of urging, I would suggest that if you have some practical way of going about this, reduce that to a piece of paper and tell us  Mr Boykin  Mr Balles  Well, we have data on some of this and we have done some analysis, good or bad, that takes as its point of departure how many checks, the value of checks written, or the value of turnover and says If that is representative of a transactions account and has a normal turnover of an individual's checking account, x amount of the money market funds are like M1 And it came out to about a little less than 2 percent the last time we--  Well, 4 percent of the money market funds, but adding 2 percent or a little less than 2 percent or a little less than 1 percent is a very [unintelligible] There are all kinds of questions that can be raised about the methodology There is some turnover to savings accounts that we don't put in at all; there is some turnover to CDs that we don't count at all On the other hand, it makes no allowance for the fact that if somebody owns a money market fund, even if he doesn't write any checks on it or doesn't take the money out except rarely, the fact that he has it and knows he can write a check on it induces him to hold a lower cash balance than he would otherwise keep Now, how do we measure that? I think it is  -43-    12/21-22/81  basically immeasurable, and it is undoubtedly there We have a spectrum of assets and we are trying to draw an arbitrary line through it and say this much is M1 and that much is M2 or M3; in fact the arbitrary line doesn't mean anything because it's a spectrum I understand the frustration We ought to know all that we can know about it; but in fact we are dealing with a spectrum and there isn't any answer Nothing is going to fall neatly into what is M1 and M2 and M3 We'd have a little trouble if we sat around this table trying to rationalize the distinction between M2 and M3 and M3 and L Any sense that after that discussion we're going to get a clean, conceptual difference between these Ms I'm afraid is an illusion  But it's a big check in that case The only explanation I have for the phenomenon that I think you correctly observed is that it is a mixture A large portion of that is basically savings or investment in the broader sense Some fraction of it is transactions accounts That is the nature of it M1 is only $400 billion and M3 is $2 trillion or whatever it is And money market funds are an indistinguishable blend of the two  Precisely, we don't know I am saying that I think it's a little difficult, however much study we give this, to say we're going to come up with a number that says this portion of it is M1 and this portion of it is M2 because it doesn't come that way It doesn't come in that kind of package  Well, I am not arguing at all over this; obviously, we should get as much information about this phenomenon as we can I just think people are suggesting more than is practically feasible to say that we are going to have some great study and somehow the numbers are going to come fluttering down and on this half of the table they are going to be M1 and on the other half they are going to be M2  Well, let me just inject a thought on IRAs Conceptually, the argument is very strong, as I see it, to take those out of M2 on liquidity grounds But suppose we went ahead and did that What we don't know is how much money is going into IRA accounts that otherwise would have been in M2 or is already in M2, so we'd get an artificial deflation of M2 in an attempt to improve the figure In some long run sense it probably would be an improved figure, but it is not going to help us in 1982 in understanding M2, I suspect  Right  But this is a reflection of a change in law It's like the M1 adjustment problem  I'm not arguing against taking it out I'm just arguing against the notion that it will give us a clean analytically nice figure when we take it out  With that comforting thought, Mr Boehne  Governor Partee  I would observe in this connection that I like to look at a somewhat longer perspective than these fourth- quarter [measures] This doesn't deal with the short-run problem of what to do when we have a sudden increase such as we have now We end up with a high December and all the rest But on an annual basis the table on page 6 [of the Bluebook] in a sense is another way of looking at what Jerry Corrigan was looking at; it overlaps, anyway If you look at these annual [growth rates] year over year, which are the number 2 figures here, [for M1-B] it's 82 percent in '78, down slightly in '79, down more in '80, and down more in '81 It's a fairly smooth pattern, though you can argue that it's too much, too little, or whatever But it doesn't give that extreme movement we get with the fourth quarter figures because that reflects the obvious; in fact we started high this year and ended up low [given] the declining trend during the year Last year we did the opposite When you average through the 12 months you get a reasonably smooth pattern  Steve has done that calculation If I understand it correctly, if we stayed exactly on the target quarter by quarter at the 4 percent midpoint of this tentative range, the annual average also comes out to 4 percent  But what's the meaning of that? It comes out considerably higher if you measure the actual M1 in '82 over the shift-adjusted in '81  I'm not sure I fully understand how we come out on the number 2 basis but any way we do it I take it that if  -47-    12/21-22/81  we stayed on path, we'd come out with another drop year over year on this tentative target  Where am I here? Has everybody said all they want to say on this particular subject? I am not sure I heard an enormous range of opinion on the targets themselves There is some disagreement about what to do with M2 I have a great deal of sympathy with the subject that Frank particularly emphasized and others have too I must say I have a great deal of sympathy with the frustrations in defining the numbers and knowing what they mean I don't extend my sympathy to a great antipathy about or not worrying about interest rates I think that is the obvious modification that one might introduce into our procedures in the absence of some magical other statistic I think we have had a problem with interest rates If anything, we probably should have paid more attention to them rather than less, I'd say That's a personal reaction anyway It certainly is not driving me back to being more precise about numbers that I don't understand  Let me give you the nature of the problem that I see in M1 I think some day, conceptually, if we didn't have any statistical problems, this demand shift that we keep talking about might go in reverse If people had more confidence in the currency and lower interest rates and we got interest rates paid on transactions accounts that would be by regulation or in practice much closer to market rates, we might find some day that we had to have a decidedly faster growth of M1 relative to nominal increases in GNP or other magnitudes I don't think we are there yet But some day that is going to happen Apart from that, what do we say about M1 next year? I could see it repeating [this year's experience] as some people have said, but it could go either way so far as I know, for purely institutional reasons If interest rates continue to decline, if the economy were somewhat on the soft, depressed side, if the ceiling rates go up on transaction-type accounts, we might get a big expansion in M1 relative to what we otherwise would contemplate or relative to past patterns because of money flows, particularly into NOW accounts, that otherwise might have been lodged elsewhere [That assumes] we don't get the aggressive competition from money market funds, we have a [markedly upward sloping] yield curve, and short-term rates are getting down toward what institutions can pay On the other hand, if interest rates remain relatively high, which might occur with a fairly strong economy relative to projections, we could get a great spread of sweeps into money market fund accounts, with practically every bank in the country offering that service M1 could get very depressed relative to other economic magnitudes I don't know which way it will go  -48-    12/21-22/81  We all want to be very precise about the money supply target and that's fine The effectiveness of that target may be more altered by a decision that we have to make as to whether we are going to permit sweeping of accounts or not than by the decision we make as to where to put the precise target We have to face that decision, which will be a very difficult one But I think we probably will have quite a different situation if there is no sweeping than if this [practice] catches on like wildfire There was something in the paper this morning about the Fidelity fund being all set up to do this with a large group of Midwestern banks I don't know what the implications of that will be but I suspect things will be different whether it's permitted to take place or not to take place I have a rather strong bias under these circumstances not to be more precise than we really can be in setting the targets and not to put all the weight on one monetary aggregate either because I find it very useful to look at more than one, whatever we say about the targets, in trying to understand what is going on in these very complex and difficult circumstances in which we live  On the substantive side, where I think greater problems lie, we may have an insoluble problem It is not impossible and may even be likely, apart from the short-run question, that we will have the immediate problem of a recession and not want to aggravate that and want to facilitate recovery and all the rest In that process, I don't think we can forget about what happens when the economy turns around and begins to rise again If it does, we will just run into another blank wall on sharply rising interest rates--with precipitous increases in money market rates and long-term rates, not just reflecting what is going on but in anticipation of budgetary deficits and economic recovery and restrictive monetary policy--and I'm not sure we will have served the country well We have to think a bit about strategies to minimize that possibility; we can't eliminate it The reason the problem may be insoluble is that the only way we are really going to deal with this, I suspect, apart from the budgetary consideration, is to convince people that we have a hold on inflation and have created a climate in which interest rates, particularly long- term rates, will tend to go down But how do we create that climate and that expectation without in some sense risking being overly tight in the short run? And because people are so skeptical about whether that is going to happen, the long-term rates won't come down fast enough to facilitate the recovery we want To what degree can we overcome that by being "easier" in terms of the money supply? Maybe that will scare people even more and work against the objective of creating a climate in which interest rates aren't going to bounce up again as soon as the economy turns around I am not entirely discouraged about this because I think, particularly starting where we are with interest rates so high, there is a possibility that confidence will return more rapidly than we could imagine now So we could get a situation where the economy could turn around consistent with declines in interest rates, if we can get the economy turned around at all But I think that is the chance we have to play for  Well, I don't know that we are going to be all that far apart in the mechanics On this question that Governor Partee raised, we could broaden that a little as to whether there is any better way of presenting our targets How we deal with base drift is one aspect of that I don't have any brilliant suggestions but it may be worth a little further thought We have to deal with this immediate problem  -49-    12/21-22/81  in setting the short-run target I don't know that we can go any further on the discussion of the long run This has been useful in some ways We will obviously return to it and will have to resolve it in early February Why don't you present the short-term issues, Steve, and then we'll have a coffee break  Let me make a couple of quick comments just in terms of presentation I am not crazy about that first alternative in the Bluebook, [shifting the base] from a quarterly average to a monthly number That looks a little awkward to me and I recoil a bit I don't like the December-to-March approach particularly because we don't yet know December It seems to me we have done that before and then gotten mixed up by the fact that December, or whatever the last month in the quarter was, didn't come in the way we expected This leaves me thinking that maybe the November-to-March method of looking at it is the most fruitful This is just arithmetic in presentation  On the substance, I find myself thinking these numbers mean something quite different if in fact we continue to get sizable growth  -51-    12/21-22/81  because NOW accounts are bulging--and we don't quite know why but it may be [related to] this interpretation of a temporary parking place-- than if NOW accounts are not bulging the way they have been in the last few weeks I guess that's all I have in the way of preliminary comments Why don't we have coffee  [Coffee break]  Let me make one other comment just to set the stage for what we're talking about and to give us a due sense of humility If I recall the discussion correctly at the last meeting, I don't think anybody around the table--I certainly speak for myself-- had any conviction that, almost regardless of what we did, we were going to have high money supply figures in the period from the last meeting to this meeting Everybody was worried that whatever number we put down we might fall way short even if interest rates declined Instead, we had interest rates tending to be under a little more pressure in the money market and the money supply figures moving significantly in excess of the target we put down I don't think that is a tragedy I am just saying that is an indication of the [limited] degree of precision that we have in setting the target for a one-month period; whatever effects there will be on the money supply in the next month are probably already [determined] in the market, rather than by what we do today But we are setting a money supply target here for a quarter Let's proceed with the discussion Is there a general agreement that we ought to use November as a presentational base?  SEVERAL Yes  It may just make it a bit less confusing if we--  Well, it's just what Steve said If you're looking at the fourth quarter-to-March numbers, take off 03 to get the equivalent number on M1 I don't know what it does--  Those are the equivalent numbers?  Let me just write those down  Mr Solomon  No, it's November to March  Or 10 to 14 percent  Mr Gramley  Just as a matter of clarification, when you say "B," are you willing to accept something like Mr Solomon's [numbers]?  Mr Black  Mr Ford  Mr Corrigan  Governor Partee  What are you looking at?  -55-    12/21-22/81  Mr Boehne  Mr Balles  Mr Wallich  Mr Keehn  Mr Guffey  Governor Teeters  I am not quite sure about one comment you made What you are suggesting is low relative to the targets, as I understand this, because if you are talking about next year's target, it is right on it  Yes Well, that's reflected in the second part of page 11  Mr Roos  Governor Rice  It depends  We have no more volunteers Mr Winn  We have a few precincts that haven't been heard from  Mr Boykin  [For M1 and M2] 4 and 9 percent and 10 to 14 [for the funds range]  This is for November to March, right?  Mr Morris and Mr Black haven't been heard from No, I have Mr Morris and Mr Black down  I'm ahead of the Secretary I guess everybody has been heard from We obviously don't have any very big differences here Where has borrowing been in the last three weeks?  I only have some very limited substantive comments to add to what has been said A premise of a lot of the comments was that nobody's dying to see interest rates rise at this point And there's a certain sense that people would feel a little more comfortable with a decline, I suppose, if I can summarize the atmosphere In that connection a number of people commented that they  -60-    12/21-22/81  are not going to be upset by a slightly higher growth rate in the aggregates Nobody mentioned the opposite, which I would now mention If interest rates really softened, I wouldn't be all that disturbed about some shortfall from any of these numbers we are talking about if, and I emphasize this, interest rates were declining in any very pronounced way during this particular period  Well, it didn't happen in the last part of November and December I just don't know It depends upon that funny demand for money that we can't fully explain in the very short run I would agree with you that it is not likely [to continue] over a longer period of time, but I don't know what is going to happen in the very short run  I wonder whether [my summary] is consistent in substance with what everybody in varying degrees seems to be saying Well, let me approach the funds rate first, where there isn't much disagreement I would think 10 to 14 percent makes a lot of sense just in terms of the form We're about in the middle of that now range and it allows [a decline of] 2 percentage point or slightly more in the federal funds rate I don't say that with any feeling that 10 percent ought to be an absolute floor in any sense; it hasn't been in the past and this seems a logical range to put down Almost everybody has said that with some exceptions I guess everybody on the Committee has said that I have no problem with that I wonder a little whether the borrowing level that people were talking about isn't a little high in terms of the balance of risks and possibilities here I'd be a little more comfortable with, let's say, a $300 million number than the $350 or $350 to $400 million that people mentioned, considering where we are now and considering this average pattern in the past, in order to provide a little more assurance that rates are not going to rise even if these numbers come in more or less as projected So, I would raise that question  We have a clear majority for around 4 and 9 percent [for M1 and M2] on a November-to-March basis In any event, I think that would be interpreted, if that's where we alight, as our not being unduly concerned by a somewhat higher number than that If we put down a higher number, I'd feel more strongly that if it came in lower and interest rates were declining appreciably, we shouldn't push any harder than necessary just to hit the 5 and 10 percent numbers But the 4 and 9 percent numbers suit me all right with the understanding that we're not going to be very upset by some overrun and starting with a slightly lower borrowing number than the weight of opinion has suggested here I'm just a little worried about that borrowing number being a bit too high And I think we do [need to] interpret these numbers--I don't know how to put that in the directive--somehow in the light of what is going on in NOW accounts, if we can make any sense of it, as opposed to a general increase  I don't think anything much would happen  This is obviously a fine judgment, but I'd worry a little about forcing the funds rate on the high side of where it has been or maybe even a little higher than where it has been, as opposed to making sure it doesn't rise in the very short run I'm not even sure $300 million makes that [certain], but it's just a question of where we want to take the risks My feel for the situation is that it is more consistent with the comments I hear around the table about not wanting an increase in the funds rate right out of the box or not even wanting it if money growth gets a little higher  Well, in that interpretation, I think we'd say something in the directive--I haven't got any wording--  I don't think I want to bias it to that extent but [I'd include] some language that this takes careful interpretation of the NOW account situation Maybe that's hard to do; I haven't worked out any language But whatever the directive says, that is what we mean  Yes, having "around" is fine with me and taking account of or analyzing the figures in light of the fact that these are not shift-adjusted and have a big NOW account component That's not good language, but that's--  On the other hand, if we went with a slightly higher number, I'd also put in the directive that this is taking account of the fact--and we can do it this way too--that we are not using a shift-adjusted number and that the discrepancy has been quite large recently and we assume it's going to continue to be sizable So, theoretically, we can do it either way It will be hard  -62-    12/21-22/81  to get that language in there but [we need] some allusion to the problem that we're moving from a shift-adjusted number We have had a long [explanation in] parentheses in the directive that we were talking about a shift-adjusted number; now I think we need a long [one in] parentheses that we're not  I'm a little bothered by the 5 and 10-- more by the 10 than the 5--which is above our long-range target and, unlike M1, coming off a high number not a low number  Well, I was just going to ask What, if anything, is your estimate of M2 based upon here, Mr Axilrod? What is the estimate for December?  And there is a chance that money market funds will really slow down now, because the money market certificate rate is at--and in the next couple of weeks may even be above--the money market fund rate for the first in a long time  Well, maybe  -63-    12/21-22/81  I didn't realize the December estimate was quite that high  Well, we can make the two we're talking about effective right away, I guess, because we have the numbers I don't think we have the numbers for--  Can you even do the IRA/Keoghs in February?  You raised another question, now that I think of it  We have a period here, [November to March], which encompasses a period of time when we used M1 shift- adjusted, and there is quite a difference What are we talking about here? A shift-adjusted figure for one month and a--  -64-    12/21-22/81  Yes, but what is this number we put down-- the 4 or 5 percent or whatever?  For December too?  Well, the only difference is what might happen in December How much difference is that?  Well, let me take this in an orderly way The funds rate range is 10 to 14 percent; it was at least among the members of the Committee I'm not sure there was any disagreement with that That is where we are on the funds rate, I think The borrowing really is the only operating decision we're making today I  -65-    12/21-22/81  gave you a little case for $300 million The great majority was for $350 to $400 million  Well, I think that's the way it will work out I wouldn't die if the federal funds rate was 11-7/8 percent or even 11-3/4 percent We're at $300 million on the borrowing?  All right, Now we'll talk about the cosmetics  The range here is not huge We can cut through it all if you want and say 4-1/2 and 9-1/2 percent  We've often used "1/2" and we're--  I think we have a long record of putting them in terms of halves, in my memory, but I--  Your mind is supposed to be open for a while It is supposed to be open for [unintelligible] too  It's all right with me But in any case we have an understanding that if it goes a little higher than that, we will not be too bothered  I don't know how to interpret that comment but The only reason I hesitate a little on the 5 and 10 percent is that the 10 looks a little high to me, just visually I think that is what we are talking about here  Right at the moment  Yes, and [consider] the problem we've got if that reverses itself We don't know what is going on here Suppose that suddenly reverses itself in January  We'll just try to arrive at the greatest consensus here If I get preferences, I'll know the answer Who prefers 4 and 9?  These differences are small What we're assuming is that we're going to continue to have a pretty big discrepancy if we shift adjust it, which we're not going to do anymore I think what we're saying with the 5 percent is that it [involves] an assumption in substance that there is a lot of NOW account [growth] in this  We can do that The only drawback I see is that in some ways one could argue that it sounds more precise--that somehow we're willing to tolerate 4 to 5 percent but we'd get very upset if it's outside But I don't know that that's such a big deal  Well, I don't know; that really doesn't sound too bad to me But I think a disadvantage of saying "around 4 to 5 percent" is--  Well, whatever we decide upon, we have to say here someplace in the directive or elsewhere that we have this problem with the fact that we think December is coming in high So whatever number we have here is in a sense not as high for January, February, and March as it appears on the face of it because we think we're operating off a high December number I think that ought to be clarified somehow in the record Mr Axilrod is trying to fiddle around with this language and it is so obscure that I don't understand what it means  "Taking account of the significance of shifts as they may develop between NOW and similar accounts and other assets"  My quick reaction is that we're not going to be able to do it in a parenthetic sentence We've got to write another sentence in there after the one that talks about "seeks behavior" etc Then we could say "In reaching this decision the Committee recognized that the target had to be evaluated in the light of the fact that shift adjustment was no longer being made and that the performance of the aggregates would have to evaluated in the light of NOW accounts, which have been exceptionally large recently," or some such thing  -69-    12/21-22/81  Let's decide upon what we want to say first before we decide upon what, in effect, the footnote says How does the around 4 to 5 percent and around 9 to 10 percent strike you?  Well, that's what I thought in a way, too But when I think about it more, I am not sure what your objection is to "around 4 to 5" Is it in substance that it is too high?  Well, clearly, we'd draw the path at 4-1/2 percent if we had "around 4 to 5 percent" initially  Well, how do we reconcile this small difference? After listening to all of this, how many still prefer 4  -70-    12/21-22/81  and 9? How many prefer around 4 to 5 and around 9 to 10? We haven't seen all the hands up  Yes, just voting members at this point That leaves two with a preference for 5 to 10, I assume  Well, all right [Our preferences] are almost symmetrical It sounds to me as if everybody ought to be able to live with the "around 4 to 5"  And 9 to 10  What is the principle?  Have we ever given a range before?  How many can live with the 4 to 5 and 9 to 10 [formulation]?  When I say this, somehow we are going to get in here that we think the December number is going to be higher than either of these numbers  I don't think we can be wrong Well, we could be wrong, but it would take a very sharp drop in both of them to come in below 4 to 5 percent on M1 It's now estimated at 88 percent, I think  Anything is possible I wouldn't promise you that it couldn't come in within that range but it would take a very sharp drop in the last two weeks of December  This figure is between alternatives A and B; what does that imply for quarterly growth rates?  Just taking the midpoint, the growth rates are a little over 5 percent and around 10 percent on a quarterly average basis, which is the nearest thing to a long-term target Whatever we put down will be high in relation to the long-term targets interpreted on a quarter-to-quarter basis  You know, we are now talking about very small differences here I am inclined to think that we are best off with the 4 to 5 and 9 to 10 [formulation] Whether we set that path at 4 or 4-1/2 percent is going to make what--a $50 million difference by 3 or 4 weeks from now?  But there will be an explanation in there that we were high in December, which encompasses this period  I think we can find a handle on that, too, Lyle  Well, let's go ahead with the 4 to 5 and 9 to 10 and see what comes up Before we vote, there is this question [of the precise language to use] I am afraid we are not going to be  -73-    12/21-22/81  able to draft this very well sitting here I may exceed the limits of your confidence and trust, but if you would delegate to me in consultation with the staff the task of putting another sentence in the directive, I would be pleased to undertake that responsibility It would say we are moving from a shift-adjusted number to a non shift-adjusted number and M1 growth running a little high in December because of this NOW account bulge We would get a little flavor of that in another sentence in the directive  I think the alternative is putting it in the policy record, which the staff will do anyway in other language This would be in the directive Is that agreeable? With that understanding, let us vote  Okay  Let me just interpret my comment I do not interpret my comment as meaning at all that these aggregate figures are not important The problem I talked about is that within a 1-month perspective what we do operationally to affect our reaching those targets is to set the path It doesn't mean that these other numbers are not very important in a longer-term perspective But the connection in any 1-month or 6-week period between meetings is very  -74-    12/21-22/81  loose It does in an operational sense come down to setting that reserve path--to state it more accurately--rather than the borrowing assumption The borrowing assumption is part of it It does not mean that we are operating on the basis of ignoring these numbers But the numbers are cosmetic They are not cosmetic at all in a longer perspective I just want that clarification in the record  No, the point is still--  Well, it is in the Bluebook, isn't it? I thought you were raising a question of whether it should be in the directive  If I understand what you are saying--I don't know what you have in mind in substance--in principle I think what you are saying is fine Whatever analysis we need we should have in there Maybe you should talk to Steve a bit more concretely about what you might have in mind I thought he did put in what he thought was consistent with these numbers The Committee has modified it a little today and on other days, on the basis of where we wanted to take the risk, so to speak But why don't you talk to Steve about putting something in  The Secretary raises the question of whether we are going to have a Monday afternoon session at the next meeting Normally we would in the light of the fact that we have to settle on the long- range targets So, I think you ought to assume that  The other item that we have is the release of the memoranda of discussion for early '76 Maybe you ought to describe this situation, Mr Altmann  You said something that confused me a bit, if I understood you I thought we were releasing these minutes in the past as entirely a voluntary act  Yes, but on this segregable facts issue, there was a case about that The only reason we haven't released the segregable facts is that nobody has asked?  Yes, I remember that discussion, but I thought the whole thing was dropped  I thought the only issue here was basically that we are releasing them now, though it is questionable whether we have to But if we release them now, we have continued the practice we had in the past Nobody can raise any question of our holding back something that we have On the other hand, if we release them, it calls attention to the fact that we no longer [prepare] these  -77-    12/21-22/81  documents And it may engender some discussion instead of letting the sleeping dogs lie What do you have to say?  And that has been entirely voluntary?  The question before us is Do we persist in our entirely voluntary policy, recognizing these three haven't been checked the way the others have been checked by individual members of the Committee? And we will just say that these three months are all we have Or do we forget about it on the basis that nobody has asked and who cares? I don't have a strong feeling one way or the other, but I don't think this will attract much attention Is Mr Coyne here? We put these out without an announcement as I recall  Hoping that Mr Coyne is correct, I have no trouble myself in putting these out with a notice that they haven't been checked the way the others have but this completes [the release of] what we have and is in accordance with [past practice]  There is this discussion of the Merrill case in them, but that doesn't bother me much  Well, if there is no objection or no contrary concern, we will just put them out as quietly as possible, which has been the case  While we are making them available, we are not announcing that they are available, if I understand this correctly That means if somebody asks, he gets it If nobody asks, I guess nothing will ever happen With that understanding we shall proceed I believe that is all the business we have Do we have lunch out there?   Do we have any comments or questions on how these people see things?  You have the line for compensation per hour going down pretty steeply; it's all in the future What gives you that great confidence?  The Federal Reserve had a bigger increase in compensation [and is] looking forward to a bigger increase in compensation on some catch-up theory How many other people are engaged in that?  Yes, we see some signs of this, and some wage agreements that are reported in the newspapers suggest that some industries are under very heavy pressure But I do hear a lot about other industries that in the total I'm sure are much more important I'm just wondering what other people hear Banks in particular tell me they are raising salaries by 11, 12, 13, 14 percent this year  You'll have to explain that comment  They will be looking at ours and then we will be in the hole next year!  They don't seem to operate very well in that sector Governor Wallich  Governor Partee  Mr Winn  Mr Ford  You get out of the model what the model says And what the model says is the more money, the lower the interest rates  Unless you provide more money  Mr Balles  What are you assuming here on the budget? You're assuming a higher level of expenditures than the Administration is going to project by a considerable margin, right?  That's what I was going to ask How much is the economy and how much is a difference in [the fiscal assumptions]?  You've taken half of what you expect them to propose?  That is if there is any tax left!  Mr Black  On that happy note, Governor Gramley  Are you saying anything different--in an elegant way--than that the deficit is pushing interest rates higher?  But you're going to get those same velocity shifts regardless of what the deficit is, on one theory anyway Well, you get it at lower interest rates  Well, you get the same velocity but at lower interest rates    2/1-2/82  You get a lower nominal GNP; you get more unemployment, too  SPEAKER(?) That's right  And you get lower [employment] and less growth  Why is it only in the short run?  Eventually prices will go up, too  Does anybody else have any comments? How full is the strategic oil reserve these days, Mr Truman?  How much are we putting in it now?  You have it going down  No  This last compensation figure--I keep staring at Mr Zeisel--you have plotted Is that the third quarter or the fourth quarter?  The fourth quarter  Let's take a couple of minutes [on recent developments in the aggregates], since it bears upon what people think about the long run--or at least what I do Although I don't know the answer on what has been going on in the money supply in the last 2 or 3 months, maybe you can say something, Mr Axilrod, in terms of the composition and the surveying that your people have been doing and so forth Then let's get comments from around the table on how everyone is looking at this  I don't quite want to get to those [issues] now But, obviously, what you think is going to happen in the next few months makes quite a difference in how you look at a lot of things Everybody has been looking at this to some extent We have this phenomenon of big NOW accounts in particular, although other things are mixed in with it We don't even know whether the seasonals are any good, and they may well not be Does anybody feel that they have any stronger insights into what is going on here? Mr Morris  We want a strong one  Let me just pursue that for a second as a possible explanation My understanding was that very few of you, if any, found much of the explanation in the opening of new accounts instead of [an increase in] existing accounts Is that true?  There seems to be a little inconsistency with that explanation, but that's an interesting phenomenon  Mr Balles  The trouble with that explanation is that we've been putting in reserves since July or so and it has only been in November, December, and January that money growth suddenly took off  Mr Ford  Mr Roos, as I remember, money growth wasn't very big in your District It probably means you have better monetary policy out there!  Mr Corrigan  We get explanations and counter- explanations for every phenomenon Mr Keehn  That's right That's all I want to know Mr Keehn  They had $60 million already in the IRAs?  Anything else, Si? Mr Boehne  Mr Guffey  This is known as the Auerbach theory  Another theory dashed, presumably Mr Balles  Hear, hear!  I'd be more impressed by these theories about reserves and all the rest if the increase in the money supply were not so divergent between the different components of the money supply That doesn't prove that it's wrong, but it's just a little suspicious when the NOW accounts are going up at the same time the savings accounts are going up And that's a sharp change in trend  Ten years from now we'll have a good seasonal!  Mr Winn  Yes, but that would have been in the same total  Are there any other comments on this or any other insights, which seem to add up to not very much? Did you want to comment?    2/1-2/82  Mr Black  Neither of them knows anything!  Well, there's a certain reality in that some of it seems to have gone up quite rapidly, whatever seasonal adjustment factor one uses But what is causing this is interesting, not just because of the short-run significance If we knew the answer, it would tell us something about whether money is too tight or not We have a system where the money supply balloons every time interest rates go [down] to 11 or 12 percent in the short run and the economy goes into the tank; when interest rates are 11 and 12 percent, we have problems at some point and it says the money supply is too low I don't know how or when we will arrive at that conclusion, and I'm not arriving at it now, but I think that's what we are discussing here under the cover of what causes a blip--or more than a blip--in the short run Does the economy want more money than we are allowing in order to grow in line, let's say, with the projections that Mr Kichline presented? You are saying, okay, the economy will make that projection anyway even with the interest rates that we have Now,  -28-    2/1-2/82  that remains to be seen, but it all bears on where the targets should be And I don't think we have much evidence to reach any sweeping conclusions on that point at this time  The worst kind of result would be if people had a bigger liquidity preference in some sense, particularly in NOW accounts, than we assume and interest rates were to go [down] to 10 percent [and those accounts] began ballooning What would they do if rates went to 8 percent even if the economy were shooting way down? And, of course, we would have this problem with NOW account interest rates at 5-1/2 percent If you dream of that day when interest rates get down to 5-1/2 percent, the money supply is going to balloon There is no question about it the way we now define [the money supply] with that [NOW account] component in there Now, when we reach that point--and I would have thought we were nowhere near it with market interest rates at 10, 11, 12 percent, but surely that would happen some day if interest rates got low enough--are we going to say there's an enormous increase in NOW accounts because we are now under the NOW account ceiling and that's an excuse for tightening up money with an unemployment rate of 32 percent, just to exaggerate a bit? We'd have a problem, right? I don't think we're there and I don't mean to suggest that But what is behind these forces is an interesting area about which we do not know enough I'm struck by the lack of the explanation that I would have thought would be the most common one That a lot of money is being parked temporarily not because interest rates are necessarily so low, but just because of uncertainty about interest rates and the fear--or not necessarily the fear on the part of the depositors but the hope--that rates will go up again and people could make a better deal on a money market certificate or something a month or two from now than they could in December or January I hear a little anecdotal evidence myself on that point, but I won't--  Well, with that much background and elucidation or lack thereof, [we will proceed] We had a discussion of long-range targets at the last meeting I guess it's appropriate now to ask whether anybody has changed his or her mind or wants to make further observations on that point  You don't want to do anything about Ml?  For M2? M2 did not go considerably over the range last year [It was over by] 03 of a percentage point as I recall  I'm not sure I understand the reasoning here Let me explore it You say there is a lot more interest- sensitive money; that is certainly true Why do you expect that to be more pronounced in terms of influence this year than last year?  Yes, but what do you expect could happen? If interest rates come down, what would happen to M2 all else equal? Or if they went up, what would happen to M2, all other things equal? Why is there a presumption one way or the other?  That means that M2 will go down if interest rates go down  Why? What's the mechanism?  Yes, but where else are people going to put their money?  But what if those rates go down just like the certificate rates go down? Now, if people put funds in long-term securities, that will make a difference But I--  But that's also in M2  I know what happened when there were ceilings on them, but the point is made that there aren't ceilings I don't know what will happen now  There is no question that when we had ceilings, [M2 growth] slowed when rates rose and increased when rates fell  It's not clear to me why it would do the opposite now  I don't know what the answer to this question is We have had 3 years since the market rate issue became important and in all of those 3 years the velocity change in M2 has been very close to zero That's not a long enough period of time to conclude too much on that, but the evidence that we have since that time is zero [velocity change]  Well, can the staff help here? Is there any evidence that they know about that says what the interest sensitivity on M2 is now?  You're losing me  What are you saying that M2 is just going to reflect nominal GNP, period?  But just to state the converse of that, would you or would you not make a presumption other than through the effect of interest rates on GNP that the interest rate level itself is going to affect M2?  Reducing it  All right, now you're saying there is a very small negative elasticity; as near as we can say it's declining If I understand this correctly, that's the opposite of the presumption that Mr Balles is making  M3, I think, is a different animal That shows you how fast bank credit is going up and how much financing is being pushed into banks, as one influence anyway The more financing that is pushed into the banks, the higher M3 will be If we didn't expect much bond financing, we'd expect high M3 growth  Just one more point on M2 I don't know how strong a case one can make in practice because I don't know how much of this is mostly individual money and how much of that would go long term But if you have a shift in preference toward longer-term securities, then I would think M2 would be depressed somewhat or vice versa  And if people really went out and bought bonds--but not many individuals buy bonds anyway I don't know how much else is in there that's not--  Governor Schultz  We may do that every now and then  Governor Gramley  What did we have last time?  Let me make just one observation on your observation about how little room we'd have for M1 in particular to grow between now and the end of the year if we're going to stick to the midpoint Your arithmetic is undoubtedly correct It makes a big difference what you assume will happen, let's say, in February or March If M1 comes down, we will have quite a different picture than if it doesn't If it doesn't come down, it certainly will look as if we are too tight by every evidence, but it's just hard to make that judgment right now That's where this explanation of the short run gets pretty critical  We have to do something Governor Partee  Governor Wallich  What Bluebook alternative are you talking about?  For a short-term target?  Mr Boykin  Mr Ford  Mr Corrigan  Would you amplify that last comment?  You remind me--and I will insert this in our consideration now, if you will permit me--that when I was testifying before Mr Reuss the other day he wanted me specifically to bring to your attention his recommendation that the M1 band be made the same as last year which was 3-1/2 to 6 percent He wanted that considered as a proposal from himself and maybe some of his colleagues  Mr Keehn  Mr Black  Mr Roos  Mrs Teeters  Mr Solomon  We're running late, but I think we are far enough advanced here that we may as well get this preliminary go- around out of the way Mr Morris  We seem to have contrasting views on what to do with M1 Leave it alone or throw it out  Mr Guffey  Mr Boehne  Mr Rice and Mr Winn haven't said anything Do either of you want to add a quick word?  Mr Winn  I am tempted to make some observations but I think I'll let them go until the morning, considering the hour  [Meeting recessed]    2/1-2/82  February 2, 1982--Morning Session  We had a considerable go-around yesterday on the long-term ranges There were some differences of view expressed, I think more on M2 than on M1 I don't believe we should try to settle this issue right at the moment until after we look at the short term because the two are interrelated in some respects We'll go to the short-term [policy discussion] and then come back to the long-term [decision]  Let me just say in general terms, so far as the long term is concerned, that I am aware of and sensitive to all the concerns about confusion and market interpretations of what we say and of credibility and all that More basic than that is that we ought to be doing what we think is appropriate, and we can live through the credibility problems In the end, our credibility will be related more to making the right decision than to worrying too much about what the market says about it in the short run Having said all that, I think we're in a peculiarly uncertain period simply because of this big jump [in M1 growth] in January If this growth were going to carry through, it would begin to suggest that something is going on here that we haven't fully been aware of in NOW accounts or otherwise If it were semi- permanent in some sense, given how little growth that leaves [within the tentative range] for the rest of the year, I would question whether we are not being too tight But I think a very strong case can be made that that judgment is premature; we just don't know Things will look quite different if we get a decline in M1 in February My expectations are not the greatest in the world; I don't think anybody else's are My [intuitive] expectations weren't very good at the last meeting, I'm sure, and they may not be any better at this meeting But one would think with the kind of velocity decreases we're getting now, and particularly a velocity decrease with the kind of interest rate movement we have had very recently, that it just doesn't seem to hang together all that well unless there is something very peculiar occurring in NOW accounts So, there's a pretty good chance of some relapse from that January M1 movement If there is a relapse, then this box that we appear to be in will disappear or dissipate--to a very considerably extent anyway  If we are going to change anything--and I thought about this for a considerable amount of time--I would argue that the advantages of rebasing rather than changing the targets are quite clear I say that for two reasons First of all, changing the targets in response to a sudden jump of the kind we have experienced--a short-term deviation or maybe a long-term deviation--may give the wrong impression It could be interpreted easily as our not being interested in bringing down the money supply growth over a period of time and it could have implications for 1983 and 1984, which we do not want Somehow, just psychologically, [it would appear that] we were off on a course of increasing the money supply More important than that, it doesn't really go to what I conceive of as the problem The problem is that we have a bulge right at the moment, which puts M1 above the target We can change the target, but [under any reasonable target] we would still be above the target by a [considerable] amount, as we were before And, if we leave the base the same, all the psychological and market freight of being above the target will be sitting there just as it is now, whether or not we change the range for the year as a whole    2/1-2/82  If we move the base up, what we will be doing is recognizing that we are starting from the higher point and we will be immediately back much more within the range of where we want to be in terms of the targets without changing those numbers I am constantly aggravated-- maybe other people are less so--by the amount of importance put on the three months that happen to be the final three months of the year I look at what happens over a longer period of time I meant to bring the figures in, but Steve may have them Starting where we're starting, unless we get a very significant decline in February or March, we're going to have a higher year-to-year growth in the money supply than we had last year, certainly if you look at the shift- adjusted numbers If you don't look at the shift-adjusted figures it won't be true because we had a 7 percent growth I think year-to-year on the non shift-adjusted last year That growth reflected the bulge of NOW accounts at the beginning of the year So, if you look at the nonadjusted figures, we started high and that produced a high yearly average growth of the money supply for the year as a whole even though the fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter growth was not very high The contour was a high [rate of growth] in the beginning of the year and then it leveled off for the rest of the year I think that gave a false reading because of the shifts into NOW accounts that produced the bulge If you look at the shift-adjusted numbers, what was it on a yearly average basis last year, Steve?  It looks now that we would be no lower than 47 percent in 1982 and in all probability higher simply because we're starting high Consistent with the present targets and growth anywhere in those targets except at the very low end and [in the absence of] a sharp early decline, we are going to have more monetary growth this year, looking at the period as a whole with the present target, than we had last year, if "reality" is a shift-adjusted number, without changing the target And, of course, we would have more growth on a fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis, too So, we have [more growth] both ways  Well, I'm assuming it doesn't go down very sharply That comment may not be correct If we had a very sharp decline--and by very sharp I mean more than a $5 billion decline in February--  Yes, we would have to have a fairly sizable decline for a month or two for the yearly average to have any reasonable chance of not being significantly higher than it was last year I can't predict every month but, just [extrapolating] on a straight-line basis, which may be unfair, it is equivalent on all these short-term alternatives except alternative A to ending up with 5 to 6 percent growth--I'm just going by memory, Steve--in the yearly average for 1982    2/1-2/82  That assumes that we don't have a great big decline in the short run But, one of the peculiarities is this Suppose October weren't there and suppose this increase had happened one month earlier The fourth quarter would be very close to the fourth-quarter base and nobody would be arguing that that wasn't the appropriate thing to start with [The bulge] comes a month later and results in a $5 billion difference in the base Should that type of thing affect us? That's the kind of consideration that I've been struggling with I have gone up and down on this, not knowing what is going to happen in the next 6 weeks My feeling is that we will pretty much know the story then, although we never know for sure because there's always another week out there But at least in 4 or 5 or 6 weeks, we will have a much better feel as to whether some of this has washed out or not If it has, the current targets may not be perfect but, given the problems of fiddling around with them, they would look entirely appropriate to me If that did not happen, I'd have a very serious question as to whether we were not being too tight--that something more basic and continuing may be going on here That would imply, as a matter of judgment, given what is going on in the economy, what is going on in interest rates, and what is going on in the money supply, that we would have to think seriously about providing a little more relief My tentative judgment is that that is a very hard decision to make right now and that maybe we should just say we are not prepared to make that judgment but will keep the matter under review and if we have to change it, we will change it And we will change it as soon as [the situation] becomes more solidly apparent than it is today  Well, you are raising the question directly that I want to go to now Larry, and that is What should we do in the short run? The issue on the table is how aggressively we want to move to, in effect, pinch the bulge off, as you put it I'd like to turn to that now, but before we do, let's ask Peter to give us the normal background But I think that is precisely the issue before us The only thing I would note is that in the last week, inadvertently, we already have moved more strongly to pinch it off than we really intended We moved some distance in that direction So, why don't you talk, Peter, and then we'll go right to that point and then come back to the longer-run decision  Will you defend the Bluebook, Mr Axilrod?  Mr Schultz  I think perhaps all of this will be made a little more concrete by examining what we want to do in the short run against all these alternatives, which have various demand and supply assumptions implicit in them But we can have any questions about the market and dispose of those  I think that's probably right, isn't it?  Mr Black  This situation has also been complicated by the fact that in January we had some reserve misses that went in a rather perverse way We didn't tighten up de facto as much as we thought we were doing earlier in January simply because we had more reserves in there than we thought we had And then this past week it reversed And while the market didn't tighten up particularly until the market [players] saw the figures, when they saw the figures they exaggerated how much we had tightened up It gives us a bit of a problem; maybe it does or maybe it doesn't, depending upon what the future brings But, statistically, we had much more but later tightening than we intended simply because of the way the reserve factors went  54-    2/1-2/82  We ran over in reserves and short in borrowings and then had the reverse That's--  That's one way of doing it; then we'd get a very strong one Anybody else?  We have to ratify the transactions Are there any other technical questions?  Without objection, we will ratify them and turn to the immediate problem before us In terms of what we were just talking about, Mr Axilrod, is it fair to ask if all your alternatives, A, B, C, and D assume no great change in the demand for money? You're assuming that the money created is in there and it's not going to relapse on its own accord?  Did you want to say anything in a more orderly way, Mr Axilrod, without my asking you a leading question?  It could go as high as what?  Let me try a common-sense interpretation of this--I hope  -57-    2/1-2/82  Of A, B, C, and D  I'll suggest a possible approach as a focus for discussion I think you're saying, Steve, that either because of transactions balances alone or transactions plus precautionary balances--depending upon what model you look at--the demand should not continue to rise at the rate it has been rising, but it is going to rise a little anyway, or hold stable perhaps Therefore, if we're going to get [M growth] down, we have to take some action to tighten up--well, for borrowings to be about where they are or higher, up to $3 billion That's the number you just gave in terms of borrowing Alternative A says, against the presumption which may be wrong--it may just relapse on its own--that if we really want to retrace January, we have to be aggressive in tightening up the market And that's going to push the funds rate way up because of this demand factor Alternative B says, if we stay more or less where we think we are--lower than where we were in practice last week and maybe this week, but where we were aiming--that we would get a leveling off, but that's it Alternative C says, if we're a little easier in terms of pressure on reserve positions, measured by $1 billion worth of borrowing, that we probably would get a small increase in the money supply but we certainly cannot retrace the increase we had And "D," of course, moves further in that direction It says that even if we were quite easy on reserve positions, we wouldn't get much of an increase in the money supply compared to what we have had, but we would certainly add to what we have had  Because it has already occurred, that's right Now, the question is what we want to do If we get any significant increase from where we are, I am suggesting that we have to resist it I would accept that as a starting proposition I think there is some chance it could happen by itself But who knows? Tentatively, anyway, I reject something like alternative A, [which implies] that we're just going to whack off a big amount in an effort to get a quick reversal that we feel we otherwise would not get One can take the view that it would tighten up the market very substantially in the middle of a recession I am not proposing that I do think we have to show some resistance, which means a tighter market than we now have, if the figures carry us up significantly from where we are And I interpret something like "B" or "C"--either one or someplace in between--as saying we can ride along and we would be satisfied It is not the happiest situation in the world, but we would be satisfied at riding along if we have to be someplace around where we are in terms--  --of the money supply, yes  No, the level We would be willing to ride along with that level without tightening the market further We will wait longer and make another decision, obviously, in 6 or 8 weeks or whenever we meet again But, in balancing off all these considerations, we would be content to see an eventual unwinding without any substantial changes in the level of the money supply with money market conditions more or less where we intended them to be, which is somewhat easier than they in fact are at the moment in terms of federal funds rates and borrowing levels We are talking about something around $15 billion in borrowing, which is lower than it has been for the last 10 days That seems to me a reasonable approach  But I would feel rather strongly about the caveat expressed in that second version of the directive That if the assumption of essentially unchanged demand for money proves to be wrong and, with that amount of pressure on the market, the money supply relapses, I would be delighted I would not say that at that point we would put in money in order to keep the money supply at an unchanged level or a +1 or +2-1/2 percent or whatever In other words, if we could accomplish that-- This may give too much weight to what we do in the short run, but if the dynamics of the marketplace produced a relapse in the money supply downward consistent with unchanged or even a reduced level of borrowing, we should just accept that and count our blessings and wait for the next meeting If it doesn't happen, if maintaining these pressures produced a result like "B," let's say, we would be content with the situation If the tendency of the money supply were to rise further, we'd have to act against it And that would send the level of borrowings still higher--maybe not higher than it is now, but higher than what our target is at the moment So, that is the approach that seems to me to make sense And we would incorporate--I don't know what the precise numbers would be--something like 0 to 2 percent or whatever number we wanted to put in there for M1 for the next couple of months with a borrowing level where it is, or maybe even a little lower than that, depending upon what weight we wanted to put on the possibility of a decline arising spontaneously And if M1 does decline, we would let it decline as a welcome reversal of what we had [in January]  That 12 percent assumes M1 is unchanged from now on  You've got us on that one!  The kind of consideration that you raise, Mr Roos, is what I have in mind If the demand were so strong that it turned out, let's say, that with the amount of pressure we now have, we were continuing to get increases in the money supply, I'd begin wondering very seriously about our targets for the year, because they wouldn't seem to hang together with what we know about the economy and all the rest Now, we'd have to evaluate the economic situation, but just sitting here now it doesn't seem to hang together if the demand for money were that strong But we don't know that yet Mr Guffey  Well, I'm not sure Let me just clarify that for a moment As I sit here gazing at these numbers again, we're essentially talking about how we are going to act between now and the next meeting, of course And given the great bulge that we've had, I'm not sure it's the right thing to say--we can have another discussion about what the borrowing assumption would be--but in terms of the right posture, maybe the right number to put in there is zero The breaking point for us on whether to tighten or ease is whether we get any further growth beyond this great big bulge that we've had What we would be doing is expressing some unhappiness with and some resistance to any growth above the elevated level that we now have  Yes, it's almost to "B" Of course, it is between "B" and "A" but it's a trivial distance from "B"  It just looks to me a little funny, now that I look at it, to say we want 1 percent growth That's just a fine [line] after this bulge What's so magic about one percent? We're willing to accept, if we have to, what we already have but we wouldn't like to see it going up any further [Zero] may make a little common sense  That's right Precisely  Look, this is about degree I'm saying we don't move very hastily if M1 begins falling If we got a couple of weeks of decline--let's say in a few weeks it fell off $6 billion just to pick that number out of the air--the market would be easing because we would be quite satisfied with that and could afford to be somewhat more relaxed about it I'm not making a fine judgment as to how much to let borrowing go down I'm saying we wouldn't at the very least begin making discretionary adjustments and we wouldn't begin pumping more money in than the path said with a fairly sizable decline in M1 We'd say we were happy about that We might let the automatic [response] that Bob Black was referring to work, but we wouldn't begin taking aggressive action to keep [borrowing] up while [M1] declined by $5 or $6 billion We'd be delighted If it began declining further, we might well [respond] Now, just where the number is, I don't know I have some figures that may not be out of the ballpark The preliminary figures have been very poor in terms of indicators, but suppose it came out [as a decline of] more than $2 billion--say, $2-1/2 billion, which it could easily do And suppose we had another decline of that magnitude the following week One can always hope  -61-    2/1-2/82  We would then have a $5 billion decline and a sizable decline may be in train for February and I think we just ought to be delighted If that continued, then we would expect to see some easing in the market, but would not be aggressive in trying to offset the decline during this 2- or 3-week period We'd welcome the decline  I don't think "rush" is the right word but we would resist, yes  We would certainly let borrowings go up at least, in accord with the automatic [mechanism] And we might have to do a little more than that  No, a billion and a half dollars I don't know how soon it would develop--we will want to discuss that explicitly--but I am talking no higher than $15 billion of borrowing, which presumably means an easier market than we have now even with zero [M1 growth] Just to be explicit, on the borrowing one could argue that maybe it should be even lower It depends on what kind of chances one wants to take  A billion and a half dollars as I recall  Essentially, what I am suggesting is retaining that with a zero number [for the M1 growth rate] If it began rising above zero, we would go above that If for a while it declined below that, we wouldn't be very quick about moving; if it declined enough, obviously, we'd move; but we wouldn't be very quick about it on the down side  Yes, but we would not be in too bad shape by the end of the quarter, or we'd still be high But that's compared to where we are now I don't think we should assume that we couldn't get a $5 billion decline in the money supply between now and March And then if March were stable, we'd look in not too bad shape We would still be high [relative to the long-term target]  -62-    2/1-2/82  One has to distinguish between the aim and the actual  Well, it depends upon what safety margin we're talking about I view the difference between $13 and $15 billion as no big deal But you're talking about a safety margin in terms of market reactions Other people may think of the safety margin in terms of what happens to the money supply, so it depends on where you're looking for the safety And that's what we're--  Before we get off on this question, let me ask in general whether anybody is radically out of the ballpark I suggested If people are, let's put it on the table and then dispose of that issue and then come back to the fine-tuning Mr Roos  Let's just put this on the table and dispose of it or not You are just an advocate of an aggressive move at the moment in the hope and expectation that that will help in the long run And you would take all the implications that that may have for substantially higher interest rates in the very short run  Well, this is clearly an aggressive view on the table It's a legitimate view Does anybody want to support it?  It's hard to see it overly weak in my way of thinking, but I--  Oh, if it persisted for a while--  Well, these are difficult matters of judgment The only thing I would say on the other side--without saying this view is wrong because we won't know until afterwards--is that we have had a pretty big tightening move in the market already and we haven't had much chance to see [the response] because it was delayed; in fact, to exaggerate, the market got no message at all almost until very recently We haven't had a chance to see what kind of reaction that will bring One can argue that being as aggressive as you're talking about, particularly against the business background that exists, takes too many risks That's what I feel  Well, we've had some expression of view on the more aggressive side I guess the next logic is to ask Does anybody want to be considerably less aggressive? Let's get that view on the table if it has any support Not hearing any, I think we're down to fine-tuning Just to repeat the specificity so that we have something to fine-tune, the proposal is to use a zero in there for the M1 number and I guess we can leave the M2 number where it is [in  -65-    2/1-2/82  alternative B] And we have a $15 billion and a $13 billion borrowing assumption advanced so far Mr Guffey  Mr Ford  I would say a purely cosmetic one That zero somehow looks more defensible than one percent in terms of what has happened  Well, no, I meant it to be the same  I meant it to be the same I think that roughly is until the next Committee meeting  Well, I didn't mention that but my instincts are against taking the last 2 days on the federal funds rate as the rate to bracket I would say the 14 percent is probably what we ought to bracket on those assumptions  I didn't say that I said I would worry if the federal funds rate were 16 percent now I surely would  But we're not talking about an intra-day touching  You can even leave off the "of balance" in that statement!  Let us defer this particular argument and settle on the other dimensions Mr Corrigan  Mr Boehne  You pointed out something I misspoke when I said 9 percent for M2 I was looking at the numbers down below  which were for November to March I just meant the same number as was in alternative B, which is 8 percent and not 9 percent  I don't think it's critical but I was just reading off a piece of paper and I read the wrong number Mr Keehn  Mr Gramley  I want any remarks of mine that you may have interpreted the other way stricken from the record because I agree with what you're saying I just misread the M2 figures It's not that I don't think it's--  Let me suggest this We're going to have a little time problem here; I'm going to have to do a little work during intermission The German mark has been very weak and there's a question of whether we should intervene or not I don't have any fixed view on this, but I want to talk to [the German officials] And I have to talk to a few people here So, I would like to wind up this portion of our discussion fairly promptly, if that's possible Let's see where we are  I just want to make sure that that's what we have Mrs Teeters  Well, if things really turn around I find it very difficult to specify just where we would be, but I might be very reluctant on that first $3 or $4 billion [decline in M1] to make much change If it went beyond that, some gradual response would begin to--  Well, certainly if this January [M1 bulge] washed out, borrowing would be down There's no question about that If it really washed out--I don't expect that to happen in that extreme form, but who knows, it might--  Well, I hate to get very specific about this, but I guess what I am saying is that I'm not sure I would react to the first $3 billion below zero Beyond that, yes  Well, it doesn't have to be completely discretionary Even in that first little margin we could take the position that we at least will let it go through to whatever extent it automatically shows through, which wouldn't be very much, unless we've got a big decline, right?  -71-    2/1-2/82  Mr Balles, I skipped you completely  I wish I knew how to do that  Mr Boykin  Does anybody else have any comments?  Anybody else? Let me try to repeat it and maybe we can vote on it What happens during this coming period will reflect on our longer-range strategy, but leaving that aside, what we're talking about is zero for M1, 8 percent for M2, and $15 billion as the initial borrowing assumption Allowing for Governor Teeters' and Mr Solomon's comment, let me modify what I said and say we would let [an M1 decline] show through in the purely automatic way but we would be reluctant to make any discretionary adjustment without a really big decline However, whatever presumably rather small adjustment comes through by itself, if we do begin getting any declines here, we let them show through It's a slight modification from what I said before And the funds rate range is 12 to 16 percent Frankly, I feel rather strongly that 12 to 16 percent is as high as I want to go on that funds range If we were going to go above 16 percent on the federal funds rate--maybe we'd do it--I'd want to scratch my head and have the opportunity to scratch my head pretty darn hard I'd scratch my head at 15-1/2 percent, I tell you At 15 percent, it's--  If M1 goes above the zero?  Well, we'd certainly do the automatic adjustment and we might have to do a discretionary one if M1 really is rising It would call into question this federal funds range and if and as it does, we'd have a consultation I'd be much more quick to make a discretionary adjustment on the up side, if we have to, than on the down side  Is that clear enough?  We might as well vote on this and have a recess  Well, let's have a recess and return to the other regulatory exchange  [Coffee break]  I think we ought to go to Mr Cross at this stage and dispose of his report It's particularly relevant in view of the question about intervention I will just bring you up to date The mark, of course, has gotten quite weak, with our interest rates going up; other currencies have moved to a lesser degree in the same direction; the mark had gotten to a rather high level [The Germans] have pretty much given up doing anything They made a great or semi-great stand two or three weeks ago but they think this [weakness] so much reflects interest rates and the uncertainty about what is going on [in the United States], that it's hard for them to do anything through intervention alone That's probably a correct judgment We have come to a conclusion with the Treasury that if the mark did weaken this afternoon or tomorrow when they probably will be announcing some economic expansionary measures--the latest movement of the mark has been toward some strengthening--we would look kindly upon an intervention gesture We are not talking about huge amounts but  -73-    2/1-2/82  about moving in the direction that indicates some interest on our part They probably have an interest, too, but they didn't want to do anything alone And that's the way it stands at the moment  Well, I think some mixture  I'm not talking about doing it on a really trivial movement; I'm not talking about a couple of pfennigs anyway  No, I don't think we give that away to any extent  Maybe  SPEAKER(?) Maybe  Well, with that background, why don't you go ahead, Mr Cross  Any questions or comments?  -74-    2/1-2/82  Proceed  I think we could live with--  It doesn't require a vote of the Committee This is purely an informal understanding I think we can just leave it the way you are proposing, Sam, and understand that if we do intervene, you are not going to exceed this [new limit] right away anyway  It's only $12 million at the moment?  When does that $200 million--  All right We can do it any way we want to, but I don't feel hard pressed [to change it] If we say this [increase from $3 billion to] $3-1/4 billion is generally acceptable, the understanding would be that if we intervene [the limit] is going to have to be more And the Foreign Currency Subcommittee would presumably review that Maybe we can [raise] it $1/2 billion, if you want to do that  I don't think there's any big issue one way or the other Which do you feel more comfortable with?  Is that acceptable? With that understanding, we will proceed  Now we can return to our long-run ranges in the light of the decision we just made Let me describe one variable that if I were doing it today I'd do differently than I did a few weeks ago I agreed to testify on February 10th, which isn't very far off I wanted to do that in part because I just don't like the idea of a long lapse between our decision and the time that it's announced I think we should try to get it out of the way as soon as possible Then there's a recess of the Congress, long in this context, for Lincoln's birthday and Washington's birthday The alternative, if I don't testify on the 10th or 11th, is that I can't do it until the 23rd or something like that At this point, if I hadn't semi-committed myself otherwise, I'd just as soon wait until the 23rd and see what happens to these numbers over the next three weeks I note that because it's not impossible to go back and change that if we want to There's no point in changing it if everybody is happy with the decision today But if there were a view that minds could be swayed strongly one way or another by what happened to the money supply over the next-- We would have three weeks more of data, Mr Axilrod?  If I didn't testify until [later]--is Mr Winn here?  The 23rd is the alternate date, which is a Tuesday, isn't it? We would know--  The 23rd is Tuesday So we would have partial data for the 17th What do we have now partial data for the 3rd? So we would [know] two more weeks' data  We don't have partial data for the 3rd yet? So, we'd have three more weeks' data if we waited  Well, we'd use that as part of the excuse for delaying I wouldn't delay unless there were a strong feeling that it would add a great deal Before you respond to that, I'd note that in a more general way, as I suggested earlier--based upon what we know now and a feeling that there is some reasonable chance, though I don't know where I would put those odds, that a considerable amount of this January surge in particular will wash out--I would feel comfortable with essentially the same targets we announced before with the same base I think that would minimize the difficulties all around What I would be inclined to say is that we would feel quite comfortable as we see things now--I am issuing a nuance statement-- [with growth] in the upper part of the range, if that's the way things came about on M1 That's not quite the same as saying we would aim there deliberately I don't think we can aim that finely a year away but we could say that we find that quite acceptable based upon everything we know now I think that is consistent with what I said overtly before--but I don't remember precisely the reason we put in a bottom [for the range] as low as [2-1/2] percent--that the only purpose for the lower part of the range was the concern that a technological change, such as the rise of money market funds and sweep accounts and so forth, might have such a depressing effect on M1 that we would want to allow for that It wasn't a policy assertion; rather than being a sign of a real policy objective, it was a concern that [M1 behavior might reflect] a technological response All other things being equal, we wouldn't have growth as low as 2-1/2 percent  On M2 we have a set of projections, for what they're worth, that say as I understand them that the range is more or less adequate In other words, even at the upper end of M1, we'd expect to be within the M2 range; that may be a good or a bad judgment And if we were in the middle of the M1 range and were presuming implicitly all other things equal--technology and everything else--we would expect more likely than not to be in the upper part of the [M2] range We would certainly be in the upper part of the range on M2 and maybe threatening the upper limit, which is where we've been all along And I would say that Now, one can obviously argue logically Why not just raise the M2 range? I wonder a bit what we would gain by that as against the explanation that we have been running slightly above the    2/1-2/82  upper end of the M2 range for recent years and as a result of that I think it's understood in the market that the operative part of that range is around the upper limit One could argue that raising the range puts us nearer the middle, but I'm afraid we might get some interpretation that the operative part of the range remains the upper part So, if we moved, let's say, to 10 percent as the upper end, people might say 10 percent or slightly above is what we're aiming for because that's where we've been in terms of that range And that would give us a higher M2 [growth] figure than we have had in any recent year We also have this pattern where we haven't had any real declines in M2 [growth rates] for a number of years as I recall In fact, we've had increases I think It has been fairly steady for three years as I remember, but if you go back to the mid-1970s, M2 growth was much higher That was back when we had this large component of fixed deposits It got high when interest rates went down; it got low when interest rates went up And since basically a flexible rate [has been paid on M2 deposits], M2 has closely tracked GNP very well I don't know whether that will last, but it has so far It has been hanging roughly just above 9-1/2 percent, plus or minus every year for those three years Now we have the staff telling us--for what it's worth and I assume it's worth a lot--that M2 growth should be lower, consistent, of course, with the lower nominal GNP that is being projected  I think that was reflected earlier when we were at this position The staff told us we'd be threatening the upper end quite clearly and maybe would exceed it That's not impossible this year, but as I interpret it you feel more comfortable about the range this year than you felt at any time in the past two years anyway  Now, there are these arguments that were presented yesterday, which I think have a degree of theoretical validity There were two that I recall One was that if we get more savings, we may get more M2 because that's a savings vehicle for individuals; the second is that if the IRA/Keogh accounts pull money out of what is [not] now encompassed in M2, we would get an upward bias--assuming that we continue to count IRA/Keogh deposits in M2, which is a doubtful proposition But we'd have the opposite problem of a downward bias if we took [those deposits] out I was thinking about that just last night and maybe somebody can confirm my off-hand judgment that either of those events would involve literally tenths [of a percentage point] because we're not talking about the whole increase in IRA/Keogh but only about the part pulled out of market instruments and into M2 If the saving rate went up 1 percentage point, let's say, it doesn't mean a one percentage point increase in M2 [growth] by the wildest stretch The saving rate is first of all calculated against disposable income, which is much lower than GNP A one percentage point increase in the saving rate isn't one percentage point against GNP, which is where we are measuring this And it's not all going to go into M2-type deposits It can go into housing equity    2/1-2/82  or into many other things So, I think we're talking about tenths in either of those things, although they probably work in that direction and they're theoretically correct observations as near as I can see But it has struck me that they are not the kind of thing--and I'm just getting a staff comment on this--that would have a really large impact on M2, although, if they happen, they would tend to go in that direction I don't know if there is any equally clear offset One could argue that on technical grounds, but we'd be arguing about an adjustment in the nature of 1/2 percent or something of that kind to allow for those things That is my feel for it, but I don't know whether the staff has any other view Of course, the staff made an estimate I don't know to what extent you consciously took these things into account  Yes, but we're not going to get that I don't know what your estimate is for IRA/Keogh deposits, but certainly a large proportion of what goes into IRAs and Keoghs already would have been in M2 anyway  Yes, but how much of that would appear in M2?  Why?  People just don't borrow We know one thing, which is that borrowing is going to be low in that area I'm not sure I've thought this all through, but I think the major change there is how much new mortgage [financing] somebody puts on in exchanging houses and so forth  When one increases the equity in one's house, it shows up in the saving rate, right?  Well, that's what I'm saying I don't think this is a year in which people are going to be consuming by borrowing on mortgages and in effect running down the equity in their houses and building up consumption They're going to be paying off those mortgages because they're stuck with them And that shows up with an increased saving rate, I think Right, Mr Zeisel?  What is the form in which that savings is lodged if one is paying off mortgage debt? It's a decline in indebtedness rather than an increase in--  And I'm saying it's not unlikely that that's going to happen because ordinarily we get some new borrowing, which people in effect can use for consumption This year we're not going to get the new borrowing side of the equation  That's right  Some portion of it We're just talking about the magnitude of this effect  -80-    2/1-2/82  I think we are to the presentational question Is it worth it? If we were going to aim at the midpoint as you say, does that follow the record? I don't think that's the way it will be interpreted because people see that growth has been around the top of the range And it just looks as if we're raising the target I think we would have to say that we expect [M2 growth] to be toward or at the upper end of that range I have no problem with that because it has been there for three years  I'm not saying we wouldn't use it as a constraint again I'm not saying we will ignore M2 The relevant issue is where it becomes a constraint I'm saying a constraint is someplace in the neighborhood of 9 percent I'm not saying it's a constraint at the logical midpoint, which is 7-1/2 percent I'm not saying that And then we have a presentational problem  Well, I'm not saying that There's a difference between being at 93 percent and being at 105 percent That is a difference  No If the range goes up to 10 percent, I think it will be read that 105 percent [growth] is okay And that's the issue Obviously, we can we raise the range and say cross our hearts, hope to die, we're going to stay in it; we won't be [above] it That's the alternative  Before we elaborate any more on M2, let me just complete my story and go back to the [presentation] problem As I said earlier I would feel very uncomfortable with this M1 target if I thought that this bulge were semi-permanently built in I do not have the evidence for that now, but if we just go ahead with our targets on the same base, I would be inclined to say--and it is not a very easy thing to say and get it just right--that if it turned out that this bulge more or less stayed in, this Committee would be prepared to review that target rather promptly, particularly in terms of this basing problem that we have And we would report back even before the normal midyear review if we have sufficient evidence that this is a more permanent kind of--  A shift that we did not anticipate With the passage of, say, a couple of months, one way of looking at it would be that on balance we would conclude that coming up to last year's target range right at the end of the year was a more meaningful [event] than the earlier declines, in terms of the basic outlook regarding the need for money I'd just lay that out on the table and say that if that is the kind of evidence we get in the ensuing couple of months, we are prepared to review that target We are not making that assumption with regard to the target right now, and that is why we are sticking with the convention  Now, one thing we could do is to delay the testimony; it would give us three more weeks and maybe we would have a little more evidence one way or another I guess everybody would feel more comfortable if [M1 in] those next three weeks showed a decline; then this target would look much more reasonable If it showed no decline over those three weeks, I would feel more uncomfortable with it than I do today We still would not know It might decline in March,    2/1-2/82 -83-  obviously, but I would have substantially more uneasy feelings that we are too low on the range So, we could play around for another three weeks before making a judgment if you thought that added something But the alternative--this is just the way I feel--is to go ahead on the present schedule but just say reasonably clearly that this is our feeling at the time based upon a feeling that there is a temporary element in that figure and that it does not reflect a lasting [phenomenon] I don't think I would use the term "shift in demand" but some English that reflected that And I'd say that if it does not wash out with the degree of pressure in effect that we judge is right in the market, we would sense that something more fundamental is going on here, which would suggest that we may be using the wrong base for this year's target And we would be prepared, as I said, to report that  Obviously, these questions are interrelated, and you raise the issue in a more fundamental way Let me just say that, mechanically, the impact of changing the base is just a little over a 1 percentage point [increase] in the targets In terms of the end of the year, the contour is different than raising the target, but mechanically it gives us the result of being up 1 percent at the end of the year, because we are up 1 percent at the beginning of the year and it just carries through  Well, I do not know I did not hear him, and I do not know what to answer to that question  Oh, there is a disadvantage in that we would have to change something that has been announced I think that is a disadvantage  I do not think that is the excuse we would use  I am not sure how credible it is because they assume we know what it is anyway  Yes  Well, the date of my [testimony]  I am saying that if we delayed the testimony, what I would do is attempt to arrive at a very clear tentative decision today but we would then confirm it [later]  That is right; we would not have made the final decision  I presume they must I do not think there is much public discussion, but--  SPEAKER(?) They may not  I think they must know about it I assume that if we change the date, it will be known that we have changed it  Just to give an extreme view If I saw a continuing tendency for the money supply to rise despite the actions that we have taken to reverse it It is hard to predict everything else that could go on, but if I see no sign of liveliness in the    2/1-2/82  economy and we have rising interest rates and a rising money supply over the next three weeks, I'd be ready to change  SEVERAL Which way?  I would rebase  That is right  I am not saying that If we go ahead right now and I testify on the 10th and then the same thing happens that I have just described, I wouldn't change it right then I would wait another month or so, having already been on record, before I would make the change But I might be prepared to make it if we had announced nothing at that point  Let me just say, too, that there was some comment yesterday about rebasing being hard to explain I do not think it is at all hard to explain The explanation just flows as smooth as silk Or maybe I am overestimating my capacities to explain But I distinguish that very sharply from the market reactions and suspicions we would get They would understand what we are doing; I do not think there is any problem with that And we do have a logical explanation for it That does not mean that there are not going to be people in the market who will say that we used this particular technique in order to ease [policy] That is what they would say, but they would understand  No, that is the problem  But this has always been discussed as a possibility and then we have not done it So it is not a new concept  The criticism that we would get is that we did not adjust for the base drift when we had it on the up side but now when we have it on the down side we are adjusting for it  SPEAKER(?) [Unintelligible] be the other way    2/1-2/82 -87-  It is not that they would not understand; it is that they would say there is a bias  Some people will say dishonest, but the explanation is--  When we set these targets, we say we expect [growth] to come in around the bottom of the [range] We just say we would like to be around the bottom and that's what we're assuming That is what we assumed when we set the target and we did not change our mind That is what we say  Even there, my inclination would not be to raise the band It would be to change the base and say we think we are operating off the wrong base  I don't think it is [the same] That is my point If we raise the band, we are saying that from now on we want a higher growth rate If we change the base, we are saying we do not want a higher growth rate from now on; we have forgiven what happened I think that is saying two different things  It comes to the same thing for the number at the end of this year  I think that is right It is the implication for the trend that we are on, not the--  To exaggerate a bit, it may be that what the Federal Reserve Board does on sweep accounts for money market funds and what the DIDC does on a new short-term instrument may have more to do with what M1 does this year than any decision we make  SPEAKER(?) Sure  SPEAKER(?) I would second that  There has been an element of that in our targets right along, because that kind of change has led to this persisting increase in velocity And we are assuming it is going to continue  No, I want to reject that I think the implications for savings and loans are very important, but it is not all that clear--I will join Mr Roos to some extent here--whether the savings and loans would be better off by greater or lesser expansion in the money supply and what that means for interest rates over a period of time That is a dilemma we are fighting all the time If we literally believe the savings and loans that it takes a bill rate of 8 or 9 percent to save them--I do not know about that but we will    2/1-2/82  have to redo these estimates--then the only way to save them is by putting the economy in a real--  [How to] save them, that is the problem  SPEAKER(?) When the FDIC--  Let me make one other rather psychological observation Bill Ford raised it yesterday If we are going to rebase --and I do not think we would do this--it would look nicer if we rebased both M2 and M3 M2 does not make that much difference, but it happens to go in a direction that a lot of people are uneasy about anyway It is only what--a 4 difference? That is not terribly important; it would not be important except for the concern of overshooting there anyway And since that concern exists, it is important That would make it more logical in some sense  Yes, slightly  I know; that is what I am saying People are concerned about whether it is too tight to start with, so it runs    2/1-2/82  against that grain And that is why we presumably would not do it even though it looks better  Well, we would rebase at the top of the range; that is what to do But even rebasing at the top of the range costs 4 percent  I will make one more comment and then get some other comments All this worry about our credibility is there, but at some point if we think we should change, we have to change We do not build up credibility for the sake of building up more credibility We build up credibility to get the flexibility to do what we think is necessary If I were convinced now--more convinced than I am that this change is appropriate--I would say the heck with that point My trouble is that I am not convinced [the bulge] is going to stay And if we rebase and then find [M1] falling on us, we would have [allowed for] quite a lot of growth--too much in my judgment--between now and the end of the year We would have a possibility of growth of a little over 6-1/2 percent, which seems a little too much to me, if M1 declines [and the bulge is washed out] And since I think there is a good chance it will decline, I would hate to present that now  Well, I agree with you on that  No, I agree  I do not disagree with that  I believe that  It depends upon how things go, but I could well see circumstances where we would want to do it before midyear  Well, the contemporaneous reserve accounting issue is going to be on our desks very quickly I will tell you my view of contemporaneous reserve accounting very simply I do not think it is going to make a lot of difference in and of itself There is a certain logic in doing it And if we were living on Neptune, I would do it because I think there is a certain logic just in terms of being consistent with our present techniques My concern is that people will read into it more than it is worth and we would get more flak rather than less But that is a psychological point and not a technical point They will say "Now that you have contemporaneous reserve accounting why isn't everything perfect?" And since I do not think it is going to change things very much, we may end up even more on the defensive Now, that may not be persuasive as a reason for not doing it because just looked at as a purely technical matter it may well be desirable but marginal So, my main concern in doing it is only that it will get over-interpreted If we do that and combine it with some other things, such as closing up the discount window, that would be an entirely different kettle of fish I am just prepared to argue against that  To make it very much tighter Yes, obviously, it is [an] extreme view to say close it altogether  Well, we are not going to resolve that problem this morning  Let me just put this question on the table and dispose of it one way or another Do we want to try to delay the testimony and delay the decision? Do people think that is going to help them enough so that it is worth whatever public question that arouses?  All right Let us dispose of that option then We are left with making a decision today, essentially What I would put on the table is what I said earlier--we can skip to the fine-tuning--that the basic decision would be to keep the targets the same as we already said, or very close to that, with a statement that we are prepared to relook at this, particularly M1 in the relatively near-term future, meaning probably a couple of months, in the light of the concerns I expressed  We do not actually have to commit ourselves to that, but I would throw that out as the logical possibility without committing us to it  Well, I would not do it in an even-handed way in that I do not visualize any possibility that I would say we would come back in two months and lower the [ranges]  Well, I would distinguish between two things In describing the range, I would say that the lower part of the range is basically designed to take care of the innovations that might appear and that we would not be at all unhappy, as we now see things, to be in the upper part of the M1 range and, indeed, we would expect to be toward the upper part of the M2 range Okay, that finishes that discussion Then I would go on to say that if this [bulge] in M1 is more permanent than we think, we would come back to Congress with a new M1 range--presumably rebased, but not committing ourselves to that--in the space of a couple of months If it became clear on the basis of the evidence that accumulated over this period, that the November-December-January spurt was more indicative of the underlying demand relationship than the August, September, and October low levels--  Well, I am leaving that question until we get to the precise part I presume we are going to have a [detailed discussion] on exactly what those numbers will be, so I am just talking generally about something the same as or very like what we have That is the next thing I will take up  That is a--  Well, whatever we say other than that these are the ranges and come hell or high water we are going to be within them, we are going to raise some questions in some people's minds There is no question that people will be talking about it, for two weeks anyway, if we say anything but that But the problem is Do we want to say that? We also may get ourselves in so deep that we can never change the darn things and we may be doing things substantively that we do not want to do So, we have to balance that off The fact is that there are going to be a lot of people out there who would heave a sigh of relief if we said that, because a lot of people think policy is too tight  I think that depends on what has happened You cannot just give me the figure on money growth What is happening in the markets? What is happening in the economy?  -94-    2/1-2/82  I cannot answer your question precisely But if you say zero growth from now on and that is accompanied by interest rates as high as we have them now and a weak economy, yes, I would question whether we might not want to ease up on the range I would begin getting pushed on that I already have the question, and I would have more questions then  That is certainly true in your assumption of velocity But let me put it the other way around If I understand those staff forecasts as best judgments, if in fact we sat here now and said we were content with being in the upper part of that M1 range, we would have a better business outlook than you have  With all the other assumptions you are making And that is reflected in these alternatives that you give It is scenario 2 instead of scenario 1 We would get a 1 percent or whatever it is higher nominal GNP  Yes, I know That assumption may go wrong, but just holding that assumption  I thought you were going to say if we are unlucky enough to do worse, we would have a bigger problem  Both statements are true  We will get to it in good time  I think so, yes  Yes, I think we could sell it The problem is that it may be the wrong decision We would have committed ourselves, then, to the decision I have no problem with that if this [bulge] is going to be semi-permanent But suppose it does wash out in February and March? Then I think we have too high a target  People would be looking at the upper ends  It probably is going to happen anyway Senator Baker has been saying it is going to be done all along So, there is going to be a natural response to that I would not read anything more into that than when people like Senator Baker are all over the paper saying it should be done I see him sometimes anyway and there is going to be a certain amount of hullabaloo about it  But the problems that Larry mentioned are, of course, there It just depends upon the setting If we came out of the clear blue sky and said we are going to change them, that is one thing If people saw the economy in bad shape, interest rates at 18 percent and so on, we have a different setting It is awfully hard to predict these things  Ordinarily I would agree with you that it is better now But then, better now in which way?  Well, let me come back and see whether we can resolve this We have a proposal on how to present this on the table There obviously are pros and cons There are problems with it, as expressed by Larry Roos and others; they are clearly there There are also, obviously, some advantages If we contemplate that approach, to some degree it is going to affect how people look at the precise decision, which I want to get to next Do we proceed on the basis of making that decision against that kind of background or not? What is the consensus?  [The issue is] whether we open the possibility of coming back at midyear or before and in effect confess that we have some question in our mind about whether the range is too tight on M1  Well, whether we rebase or not, we just exclude that point and we do not express any doubt about our target That is the only question on that Then we get into an argument about whether to rebase now or not  That is, I think, precisely where we are I am just asking for people's judgment on this One is going to be affected by the next question, so all we can do is ask for a preliminary view on whether that generally makes sense and whether for the moment that is the way we want to approach the other decision  Where the target should be precisely  -99-    2/1-2/82  Or we can change them We have three alternatives; that is right Can we pass on to that decision, operating on the presumption for the moment that there will be in the statement something to the effect that upon further examination of this recent bulge and depending upon developments, we would be willing to consider the possibility that the M1 target might be too low?  Presumably I am not committing ourselves to that, but I would refer to the base question  All right Well, I just did not want to prejudge the Committee I am willing to state it as the target, with the base the [fundamental] question  Well, I am sure some have that preference, but I take it that it is not the prevailing preference So, let's go to the targets We have 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent [for M1], 6 to 9 percent [for M2], and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent [for M3] I must say regarding that 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent What is your projection for next year?  And there we probably have the clearest technical reason for saying something; there's just more [financing] running through the banking system Why were bank credit and M3 so divergent this past year?  We had a big differential between M3 and M2, and one would think that that would reflect the banking component  100-    2/1-2/82  Well, I know what it is statistically Why are large CDs, Eurodollars maturing more than overnight and so forth going up so much more rapidly than bank credit?  Well, that is what I assumed was the answer, as a matter of fact  Eurodollar borrowings are not in M3, right?  And they went down, in effect, or rose slowly That is the answer, I guess  I have already said this but just to get other responses, assuming what I took as the consensus The argument seems to me pretty strong not to horse around with the figures  I think there was a majority for not changing it, but there was quite a difference A number of people did suggest changing it; that is true At least five of the whole group and some [voting members] did not address themselves to it directly  Let's just take the whole proposition that we say we do not change any of the targets Who would have a preference for that?  Well, let's take voting members first Six This is all against the background of admitting that we might change later I do not know how the nonvoting members feel about it That adds a little weight here when we--  Well, I prefer not to say it in terms of seeking that, which just implies a degree of fine-tuning that I think is beyond this I have no trouble saying that the upper end is perfectly acceptable and that it may well come out that way, as we see things at the moment It is just a subtle distinction from saying we actually will aim at the upper end But I have no problem at all saying that as we now see things the upper part of that range would be perfectly acceptable I think the open question may be what arguments people want to make for changes and we'll see whether that can command any more people than we now have What would be the nature of [any proposed] change in the ranges for M1 or M2 or M3?  You want them all higher?  No matter what we say about the future, you want to increase everything?  We are going to get statistics on it, though  We cannot identify them, as I understand it, without collecting more statistics  There is a good logical argument for taking them out But, of course, then we have the opposite problem I think one could say flatly that in taking them out there would be more distortion in the trend--but we could adjust for it--than in leaving them in But it moves in the opposite direction  There is an implicit tradeoff in your proposal, as nearly as I can understand it You want a little higher number but you would make it more rigid, in effect, than it has been  I have no problem with that Maybe that is the practical alternative on the table Let me leave M3 and bank credit aside for the moment Let's not get into those; whatever we do with them is literally almost insignificant I think what I have heard, obviously with the exception of Nancy Teeters, is that if we have this note of reservation, nobody wants to argue about fiddling around with the M1 range Do I hear that correctly? I will proceed on that assumption  Quite clearly, there are people who want to raise the M2 range Let me give you two alternatives that I see now One, consistent with this idea that we open up the possibility of rebasing and review, is that we stick to the targets we now have with the comment that Governor Partee made about M2 What concerns a lot of people about fooling around with any of these is whether we are going to rebase The alternative is to go ahead and change M2 and not make the comments about rebasing Would anybody prefer that? Let me put it this way We stick basically with the M1 range; we raise the M2 range by 1 percentage point; and we do not say anything about the possibility of rebasing Does that seem preferable to anybody?  I saw three people saying yes; I did not see any others  Okay  We are not going to do anything about it today We never do anything about it because we never consider it until we get there But what we do now seems to me rather silly, frankly We do it all the time because we get trapped into it; I just regurgitate every time we have to put all this emphasis on what happened in a particular three months of the year We get locked into that We say Well, that is what we did before, so we have to do it again But that is where we are There is some sentiment, though I do not detect a consensus, to go that way, which is a possibility That leaves me with the degree of consensus we have on the other [alternative], which is basically leaving these ranges and making a specific comment about M2 and the savings connection and that we think it is quite likely M2 will be near the top of that range We say that is perfectly acceptable and, in any event, M2 could be over [the range] if the savings and the IRA and Keogh accounts turned out to be significant Thus, we are putting you on due warning That is what we say on M2 On M1, based upon what we know now, we think this range  -105    2/1-2/82  is appropriate We do not exclude the possibility that, if this recent development seemed to be of a more permanent character, which bears upon the basic demand for money, we would come back to you at midyear or before and change that That carries some connotation, but I think it is consistent with the decision that we just made that we are not going to fight tooth and nail to reverse January We already decided that, so I think it is perfectly consistent with what we have already decided What is the degree of consensus as to how acceptable that is? I want to put it in terms of acceptability at this point It seems we have the voting members I guess what I hear is that it sounds pretty acceptable,  All right, I do not detect any other course that is more acceptable at this point In the absence of any comments that [some alternative would be] more acceptable, let me just describe it again so there is no doubt in people's minds This is what would appear in the record We reviewed these targets; considerable concern was expressed about the recent developments in M1 which suggest that some relationships could be developing that we did not anticipate We think it is too early to make that judgment We want to reaffirm the continuity of policy, but if we get further evidence that the presumption upon which we established this target is wrong, particularly considering the fact that we ended up below the target last year, we would be prepared to reconsider this matter But we think it is more likely that we will have some relaxation here, which would make the present target appropriate On M2, we say we think it is likely and desirable that growth be toward the upper end of the range; it is possible that a higher saving rate combined with the impact of IRA and Keogh accounts would introduce an element here that has not been there in recent years, which would change this relationship somewhat If that were a discernable influence on M2, we would be satisfied with being somewhat above the upper end of that target I think that is about as clearly as I can state it And we just leave the M3 range [unchanged] Does it make any difference to anybody where M3 and bank credit are? What do you have for bank credit [growth]?  That is your projection?  And what is the range you are suggesting?  A very small wrinkle If people wanted to raise the range for M3 on the very simple argument that we expect more financing to be done through the banking system and that affects M3--  We might raise the bank credit range slightly, too, then  Well, I guess it is not important to me one way or the other  I do not think it hurts anything to have [them] So, forget about M3 and bank credit; we just take what falls out Leaving the ranges unchanged is the preliminary suggestion  Well, maybe it would be a good idea just to change the base on that to get in the idea of changing a base Here we have such a clear technological change that hardly anybody could question it,  Yes, because of the introduction of IBFs Okay If there are no other questions, we can vote  Thank you very much You wanted to say something, Governor Schultz?  We might have an emergency shortly  Well, Fred, without prejudging any comments anybody may want to make later, I think your contribution on this Committee has been immensely important to all of us and I think we can acknowledge that around this little circle now before we go to lunch where, prejudging it, we can do you a little honor We appreciate very much those comments on what has been a variety of experiences in your life and your full devotion to this one in the past 2-1/2 years We ought to adjourn to lunch but I am reminded that I have forgotten two things that we ought to do in the nature of cleaning up  I mentioned Mr Reuss' proposal to you yesterday and I understood from the reactions that you did all consider that in your minds and did not choose that as a desirable course I just want to be able to report that to him Can I take that as a--  Your position is clear and I can report that his proposal was considered and that one person rendered rather strong support to his point of view, but it did not command the support of the group I think that is a fair representation of what I have heard  The other thing to clean up relates to the short-term decision I assumed that what we were talking about was the second version of the directive Mr Altmann has a slight revision, which I have not seen It says "for the January-to-March period no growth in M1 and growth in M2 at an annual rate of around 8 percent" That is a slightly different way of saying it  "No further growth;" good Maybe we can just stick in a phrase "Considering the size of the recent growth, no further growth" Maybe this is better "Taking account of the recent surge" And then the next sentence is about as he has it Some decline in M1 "would be associated with more rapid attainment of the longer-run range and would be acceptable in the context of declining market interest rates"  Well, one could catch a nuance here which might not be in the sentence; but if it declined in the context of rising rates, we would presumably ease  I do not know whether there is a technical word or not I guess it is not a full description of what we mean It certainly would be acceptable in the context of rising rates, except then we presumably would move to ease I do not know whether there is a better way to say that This is basically a phrase we have used before, isn't it, Steve?  Why don't we say "in the context of reduced pressure in the money market" instead of "declining interest rates" I think that is a little more polite way of saying it Okay, then we are agreed and we can go to lunch  Well, I guess I would just leave it It is a long time, but if we want to have a meeting in between we can obviously do it on the telephone I do not think we need to decide this, but if we felt like having a meeting in person four weeks from now, would that be welcomed?  Well, what we can do is just pick out a date Maybe I will send you two dates or something and ask you to make sure your calendar is clear We will not call a meeting, but if we want to call a meeting, you would have kept a clear calendar  SPEAKER(?) Four weeks would be around March 1st?  Well, presumably it would be approximately four weeks from now I will look for some dates about four weeks from now if that is desirable, but I do not know what my calendar is  Why don't you look around March 1st I will not call a meeting now, but I will not be allergic to calling one if it seems at all desirable  Yes, I do not know about my own calendar, but I do not see any reason why--  As close to March 1st as I can make it I may say March 1st if it looks all right from my standpoint  March 2nd, I think When is the next meeting?  SPEAKER(?) March 30th  No, I think we would have a more informal meeting than usual More precisely, we would not have the full panoply  END OF MEETING  -111-       We have some items to take care of at the beginning of this meeting First, the election of officers We need to nominate a Chairman and a Vice Chairman in case you--  Is there a second?  Are there any other nominations? If not, we assume we have a Chairman and I'm the Chairman We need a Vice Chairman  Apparently, Anthony M Solomon missed the shuttle I don't know whether that's appropriate for a Vice Chairman! Do we have a second?  If I hear no objection, we will proceed I have a list of a good many staff members as proposed officers that I would ask the Secretary to read, including Mr Altmann as Secretary  Would someone like to move those?  If there are no objections, we will have the officers duly installed as of this moment We need a Reserve Bank to operate the System Account  Do we have a second?  With no objection We need a Manager for Domestic Operations and a Manager for Foreign Operations; perhaps someone would like to nominate both at the same time  Objections? In the absence of any objections, it's unanimous I'm skipping now to the end of the agenda you have--we might as well get this all out of the way--to the review of the domestic authorization and the foreign currency instruments Nobody has proposed any changes in those Does anybody have any objections or questions on that second, or third part? If not, hearing no objections, they are approved As for the authority for lending securities from the System Open Market Account, we've been renewing this for some years Any comments? I take it there was some suggestion earlier to make this permanent Does anybody want to talk to that point?  The lending [authorization] that now has to be approved every [year]  And we approve that every year anyway, don't we?  As nearly as I can see, no major policy issue is involved It gets approved every year anyway I guess it's just a question of which document we put it in  I think that's the net difference involved here I have no strong conviction on this point Does anybody have any conviction?  Do you want to propose it?  If we have no objection,--  My understanding is that it would be approved every year anyway It's just a question of what document we're putting it in  Henceforth it will be part of the authorization And we look at it separately anyway That is approved The final item is a review of the agreement with Treasury to warehouse foreign currencies I have had no comments on that reported to me I hear no objections to the warehousing agreement That will be approved I guess I skipped over the foreign currency authorization, the foreign currency directive, and the procedural instructions On the review of those, again, I have heard no comments If there is no objection at this time, they will be approved So, all this is unanimously approved We can now be very, very approving of the minutes, I guess Do I have a motion on the minutes?  Without objection, the minutes are approved With that out of the way, we will have a report on foreign currency operations Mr Cross  Comments or questions?  I'm not sure I follow your explanation as to why the yen is so weak Would you--    3/29-30/82  We have a lot of things to worry about and that's one that I worry about a bit  What has the recent inflation rate been in Mexico?  What was it last year?  Any other questions or comments? If not, we'll go to the domestic open market operations  There is so much talk in the market about this April [M1] issue, why don't you tell us what you know about April, Mr Axilrod?  They're infinitesimal!  Mr Axilrod can only talk in annual rates, I'm beginning to think  Why would it be May and June? Why wouldn't it be March and February?  Well, it makes us a little suspicious If I remember what you told me correctly, April in every year since 1975 has been higher, seasonally adjusted  Except for 1980, which we threw out And then 1981 gets thrown out by the machines  The last two years aren't in there And it looks as if--  [Unintelligible] at the moment now  We're worse off than if you hadn't It just would have thrown it out if you had left it alone  Mr Winn  It doesn't allow for crediting of interest on NOW accounts either  Mr Winn  Any other questions? Well, we will expose you all to Mr Kichline's forecast  Yes, we have to ratify the actions  SPEAKER(?) So moved  SPEAKER(?) Second  Without objection Mr Kichline  Well, let's take a little time to discuss the forecast or raise any questions about it or put forward any dissenting or agreeing views  Mr Balles  Mr Solomon  Governor Partee  Mr Black  -16-    3/29-30/82  Governor Wallich  Mr Corrigan  I thought for a moment you were going to say in the Federal Reserve Bank experience  Mr Keehn  How much do you see those attitudes reflected in wage bargaining, let's say--whether it's union bargaining or otherwise?  Do you hear any gossip about the Harvester negotiation? That's in process now, isn't it?  -19-    3/29-30/82  Quite a lot more, I would think  They finally can get by with great big increases  We have to quit in a minute, but in your survey of land prices in Chicago, you survey prices of actual transactions, don't you?  Well, I guess I was wondering how it showed up in your statistics  I hear those stories I just wondered why it didn't show up in your figures  The fact is that if the land price goes down 10 or 20 percent, that means it's going back all the way to where prices were 3 years ago, I guess That's the problem you have here?  Well Mr Winn Mr Roos, and Mr Ford, are you going to be relatively brief?  Well, if you are relatively brief, we can just dispose of this tonight; otherwise we'll wait until the morning Are you going to be relatively brief, Mr Winn?  We may quit after that!  I think it's perhaps appropriate that Willis Winn close this evening's affair He's more reassuring about the economy, even more reassuring about the deficit, and then he plans to go off and leave us!  Well, we will be saying goodbye to Willis tomorrow I'd like to have an executive meeting at 915 am tomorrow, if that's okay  [Meeting recessed]  -22-    3/29-30/82  March 30, 1996--Morning Session  If I recall correctly, and I'm sure I do, we were discussing the business picture Mr Kichline had given us what by some lights is a fairly optimistic picture suggesting that the risk may be on the down side, and a number of people had commented on that And Mr Ford and Mr Roos were about to say something I gather for purposes of secretarial summaries that there wasn't a lot of disagreement with the staff outlook but a lot of worry That's the way I would summarize what I learned yesterday, anyway  You produce a third of the world's carpets?  Does that mean there's a big export business?  What kind of wage settlements did you feel the labor union leaders were looking toward?  Governor Rice  Governor Gramley  When do the leading indicators come out?  They'll be a little on the down side Mr Solomon  If it isn't, we probably have the targets too low  Mr Morris  Governor Partee  If that concludes the comments people want to make-- Mr Boykin  I thought it actually had turned down  Mr Balles  It undoubtedly is  Do you suggest they sell one to find out?  Well, I don't think we're going to resolve this question, so we will go to Mr Axilrod  Well, I don't know where that all [leaves us] The big question is with respect to M1 and we live in a kind of morass that leads one to put a certain amount of weight on M2 In looking at what has been happening in the first quarter, you said M2 is running a little high Well, it is, I guess, compared to the base of the whole [fourth] quarter, but if you look at the last three months its behavior has been pretty orderly from what we know now And I don't think it would require a slowdown in the growth--I haven't done the arithmetic--in its nontransactions component if you look at the last three months as compared to the quarter-to-quarter [growth] I don't see how it could So, we have had a big M1 growth and the monthly figures have been more or less in line for M2 If M2 were weak and M1 were high, which has not particularly, if ever, been the case, I'd say we might have an argument for looking at the long-range target at this meeting But I don't think we have that argument and I would not propose to do so Anybody can have their own opinion But if things grow a certain way, it's going to have to continue to be on our agenda for the next meeting in May or the following meeting I suspect We do have a situation, to put it bluntly, where NOW accounts are way up and the rest of demand deposits are at least being slightly squeezed They're fairly level or down depending upon what week one looks at And I continue to have a very large suspicion that there is some liquidity preference shift, at least temporarily, that has been going on The whole question, when you look at the M1 figure is how long [its rapid growth] will last, as Steve suggested Who has a comment?  I'm somewhat uncomfortable with too precise projections of what any of these numbers may mean and of the interest rates that really may come up The difference between "A" and "C" is $3 billion on M1 in June That's one week's fluctuation    3/29-30/82  Mr Morris  It could have shifted into M1 if we didn't have NOW accounts We never will know that it wouldn't have It wouldn't have been a nice figure  Well, what all this demonstrates is that these movements preoccupy us and they preoccupy the market But we know very little about them except that we generally accept it as a change in liquidity preference But we certainly can't identify that very closely I hope some work is going on that  We may be in better shape--I hope we are-- by the time of the next meeting from various directions whether through surveys or otherwise to maybe find out nothing But if we have satisfied ourselves that we tried a little harder to find out, maybe we will find out something Mr Guffey  Governor Partee  Mr Solomon  Governor Wallich  Targets? It doesn't say [that] about M2  Mr Winn  Well, we'll have Mr Ford, and then we'll have breakfast  Unfortunately, when we get back here in May, I think we'll just have the April figures, basically  What was that last comment you made?  Why don't have a coffee break Preston Martin has been confirmed by the Senate this morning, and may even have a signed commission We'll go out and see where he is  [Coffee break]  [We're in] a delicate stage here Preston Martin, whom I introduced to all of you who have not known him--you can talk to him after the meeting--has been confirmed by the Senate He has a commission signed He is not sworn in, so he doesn't have to vote but we thought he could observe this strange [unintelligible] I told him we are in midstream I guess we will swear him in tomorrow We are halfway through people expressing their opinions in varying degrees of precision about what we should do in a very imprecise art Mr Black  Governor Gramley  If I may interject There's just one factor here that hasn't been mentioned, which I want to mention for the sake of completeness I think it's probably largely liquidity preference Part of it may just be a plain bad seasonal We may not know how to seasonally adjust the OCDs And maybe the distribution is really different than we think it is  What nominal GNP growth do you have for the year?  What is it on an annual average basis?  Mr Corrigan  Governor Teeters  Mr Boehne  -45-    3/29-30/82  Mr Keehn  Mr Balles  Governor Rice  Mr Roos  Governor Partee has an additional comment  That's a little high on a quarterly average basis If you look at it on a December-to-March basis, it's just about at the top of the range  We haven't heard from Mr Boykin and Mr Morris in terms of specifics  I thought you were against a leaning in the wind policy  It depends upon how strong the winds are blowing I guess we've been through everybody with a little variety of opinion  Members of the Committee are nicely split and nonmembers of the Committee are nicely split We have an odd number of nonmembers, so they're not quite split evenly; there is a small majority  Let me say just, in terms of changing the targets and how temporary this NOW account phenomenon is and whether it's partly seasonal, that I have a little suspicion that we're not going to know by the next meeting, unfortunately My suspicion is that if it is partly seasonal, we ought to begin learning about it rapidly after April That's because it may be partly a tax phenomenon Individuals build up their balances--and they always did, we just didn't know it before--as we move into April But the timing of the next meeting is going to give us maybe one week's clue to that, I guess, the way it works out We are not going to have much of a track record, but we will have to live with that  Well, it depends We can [change the ranges] any time But by July we certainly ought to have a handle on that We may not know all the answers; we may not know why; but we will have more suspicions and we will have some results of whatever analytic or survey work we do  Just in terms of the economy, I share the view that was going around earlier The staff has [projected] a pretty good recovery, considering the circumstances and considering that we don't want to lose the progress on inflation But there are a lot of doubts that tend to register on the low side rather than on the high side If we got that much, I wouldn't be unhappy I don't think we are in a position where it would be wise to try to manipulate interest rates overtly downward I'd love to see them come down and stay down I  -50-    3/29-30/82  wouldn't love to see them come down for a month and then have to go up again That would kill us for a variety of reasons, I think  Anyhow, we have this great variety of opinion I think what is of operational significance before we meet again is largely going to be how to handle this April situation We don't know in which direction it's going to go We have a great split in opinion on the Committee I must say I reconcile that in my mind very nicely, but I don't know whether the rest of you do Given all the problems we have, I think it may make more sense in the short run--or even in the long-run period given the doubts about what M1 means in some cases--in effect to watch pretty closely what is happening to M2 For M2 over the course of the year as a whole we've been anticipating growth of something between 8 and 9 percent; I suppose slightly below 8 percent is the staff's forecast for the year as a whole Nobody knows for sure whether it's reasonable analytically or not, but with the kind of nominal GNP that results from a quite reasonable economic forecast I don't think it's a bad forecast in terms of our objectives and where we want to go And M2 in the 8 to 9 percent area seems to be [viable] against recent experience Maybe recent experience is no good, but in the last 3 years M2 has been within 1 percent of that and we have never had a decrease in velocity of more than 1 percent And if it came out in the 8 or 9 percent area, it would seem to allow enough for this forecast, if nothing else went wrong Given all the uncertainties in M1, and given the doubts in the economy, I would not feel comfortable about tightening up in effect to chase too hard at an April M1 figure if M2 is also running low I don't know whether that's going to be the case; I have no reason to believe that it will be the case, but I would feel very uncomfortable about "tightening," in the common parlance, with a low M2 figure at the same time So, I come out close to the A alternative so far as M2 is concerned Let's say around 8 percent I'm not sure I'd want to push on M1; it's very doubtful where it's going to go, but I don't know that we have to set out for a 4-1/2 percent M1 figure I don't even know what it means in the context of dealing with it before the next meeting if we are going to allow for more [growth] than that in April because we will come back by the time we know April and then re-decide on the basis of what we know about April But the more orderly thing for M1 somehow does seem to me to be something like "B," which on the face of it brings us back about where we want to be, if you take the numbers literally By June or July it follows what the midpoint of the range would have been if we had started from the base of last year's target rather than from where we did start It doesn't say we can't raise it if all the analysis shows [the need for] that But I feel a little more comfortable with something on the lower side for M1, particularly if M1 produces a little miracle for us and comes out lower than we now expect in April and early May  I don't know whether either of those is right It seems a little strange, putting all our money on somebody's judgmental correction of a seasonal adjustment which is doubtful It is piling doubts on doubts But I think we have to reach some judgment as to how we want to accommodate or not accommodate, how rapidly we respond to an increase, and where we set the borrowing in  -51-    3/29-30/82  the first place If we set the path consistent with a lower level of borrowing than we now have, which is what--$1-1/4 billion roughly?  Well, let me finish If we [set the borrowing level] below that, theoretically we produce a little easing If the April bulge is [large] enough, we might have to respond to some degree; it would give us a little more room for responding without being any higher than we would have been in the first place I don't know whether that is a good idea or a bad idea But I can imagine that in a difficult circumstance it might give us a little leeway without sending things through the roof If we have to respond to some degree, maybe it does make some sense to start out at $11 or $12 billion or something in that area I guess that's what I would propose and we'll see what happens I'd leave the federal funds rate range where it is I'm not sure at this time that I would want to announce a higher fed funds rate range If anything, I'd rather announce a lower one, but I--  Well, 12 to 16 percent happens to be where it is now [Not changing it] in some sense just doesn't raise a question I surely would feel uncomfortable about raising it  I'm not among those who are enamored of an enormously wide range, but I wouldn't object to that Well, let me throw something like this out on the table Something around 8 percent for M2; something close to, say, "B" for M1; and 12 to 16 percent for the funds rate range--I don't feel strongly about 11 to 16 percent; and for borrowing let's say $11 billion, just to pick a figure out, to start the path off The operational question is whether we build into the path some allowance for a bulge in April If we do and it doesn't appear, then we get the borrowings dropping pretty fast  I guess we can make it asymmetrical, if we want to  You can see the difficulty of this business just in that figure We had a $17 billion increase in the money supply in one week last April that came out to $5-1/2 billion or whatever seasonally adjusted They sit there and guess Well, maybe this week it will be $18 billion Who knows when you get that big a figure?  And they have made a good estimate if it is anywhere between $5 and $20 billion, I suppose But that's going to produce all the difference between a minus and a big plus number in the seasonally adjusted figures  Well, I am not sure Is that right?  A lot of it does depend on how the tax checks are handled and that would be after the 15th If they sit on them for a while, then we get a big increase after the 15th  What we have now deals with hopes, but we have a minus coming up this week We expect--we have a string of "ifs" here--if it held the following week, we would have room for some increase in the first week in April without making April high  SPEAKER(?) That's right  But who knows whether any of it will hold?  That isn't very low compared to our targets  Yes, if it doesn't go away But how do we know that it is going away?  We don't know the meaning of that April phenomenon We'd have a very strange result if M1 in April were going up by 9 percent and M2 were going up quite a lot and we got an easing market  Well, wait a minute I think I'm saying the first half of what you are saying The second half is--  I wouldn't mind M1 coming in lower than that I tell you, I'd be delighted if M1 came in lower than 9 percent And if M2 were coming in around 8 percent, that would be fine I wouldn't react to that all that quickly I would lower that bulge path because the bulge didn't take place And then if we get weakness coming into May, that's the time to ease  Well, by coincidence or otherwise, I wrote that sentence in myself That is what I am saying Just to clarify the issue Let's cite this "A" and "B" combination for the quarterly target and say $11 billion in borrowing, which raises the path from where we now have it It says, okay, tentatively construct the path, believing in a bulge in April If the bulge appears, we have no tightening of that general magnitude If the bulge does not appear and M2 growth is running reasonably high, we change the path to make it a more even path If M2 is running weak, we may keep the path up there  Ipsy-pipsy, so far as I'm concerned  Well, on balance, I agree with that argument My own attitude would be that if the federal funds rate began going below 12 percent, consistent with everything we have said, I would be in favor of a two-second consultation or none at all If it began going up in the 16 percent area, I'd be extremely worried  How is it running this week, by the way?  Where is the funds rate today?  Well, you have a point I don't know whether I'd worry about it or not Mr Solomon characterized our proper attitude earlier as alert but relaxed, or relaxed but alert Maybe it would take some of the steam out of all this worry about April if they felt we were indeed a little relaxed I don't know  -57-    3/29-30/82  I suspect the difference is so small that they won't notice it much because they haven't seen $14 billion recently  Well, what I wouldn't particularly like to see happen--but we can't play it all that finely--is to have the market rally a little and the short-term rates go down and that lasts three weeks and then goes back the other way  If we don't get a bulge in April, I suspect we will get a rally in the market regardless  You're looking at different figures I get confused by that, too You are looking at pure adjustment borrowing Apparently the figure we use is adjustment borrowing plus seasonal borrowing  So, you have to add $150 million or so  I think your point is right But we are a little lower relative to the recent average than those figures say I don't think [the difference] is big enough to be terribly noticeable  Well, the difference between $11 billion and $12 billion is not going to make or break me I think the lower we go the more quickly we may have to snug up a little if April comes in high So, you play one of those off against the other  You can argue that we'd have a little more room [to tighten], that's right We have to show a little more motion--  Well, I think that is what it comes down to We have to balance a small chance of a false signal against buying ourselves a little more flexibility by moving [borrowing] up again It is not driving things through the ceiling I'm not dying to give false signals, and that is a consideration if [the bulge] is going to be temporary We have more room for flexibility and false signals; [we'll have] real signals once they get that budget in place  And it's not going to make that much difference We're playing at the margin  The proposal is to put in around 8 percent [for M2] and around 3 percent [for M1]--either "around" or "about," one of these terms of art that we use--for the quarter as a whole And I'd slightly prefer just staying with the 12 to 16 percent funds rate range because that's where we are and recently we have been about in the middle of it, roughly I'd make one wording change I'd say "probability" instead of "possibility" in this sentence that's proposed "The Committee also noted that deviations from these targets should be evaluated in the light of the probability" That suggests a little more weight on the M2 number I also thought of putting in some sentence, as Bob Black suggested, to the effect that a shortfall of M1 growth, consistent with progress toward the upper part of the range for the year as a whole, would be acceptable in a context of appreciably reduced pressures in the money market, which is very similar to what we had last time Operationally, what I am saying is that we tentatively allow for some bulge in April in making the target In other words, the borrowing would not go up with an [M1] increase in April of a magnitude of 9 percent at an annual rate, which I guess is what Steve is suggesting I gulp a little at something that big, but that's what he said I'll take it That's what we would do if M2 in fact is somewhere around this number that we are talking about  Well, I was thinking of that  Theoretically, all else being equal, that is right I don't know what it amounts to quantitatively when M1 is $400 billion and [its growth] is 6 percentage points high relative to the quarterly target, 6 percent or 1/4 of the whole, less than 1/4, 1/5 of the whole, 6 percent at an annual rate I don't know what that amounts to What is 6 percent of 20 percent? I guess it's about 1 percent  I will moderate my comment by saying for the month of April "around 9 percent" is set for M2; it begins to get me a little nervous, but I guess that's all right Now, I lost the context of where I was We have that path for M1; if [its growth] just for the month [of April] is around 9 percent, we hold to it If it's above that, the suggestion is that the borrowing level would go up If it is below that, and M2 is also around--I guess in this case someplace between 8 and 9 percent, depending upon how much M1 is below--we might not ease up on those borrowings very much at all until we saw M2 coming in low too, so long as M1 were around the 3 or 4 percent area If M2 began actually going minus, we would be easing up; or even if it went below 3 percent, we would be easing up  Yes, depending upon what M2 is doing we'd have to be redrawing the path If M2 were weak and M1 were coming in at 9 percent or maybe even higher, we would accommodate it  By the middle of the month or a little after the middle of the month we should begin getting an idea  For the record we do not prepare a weekly M2 number, but we get some hints as to where it might be in terms of trends We do not have a weekly M2 number  Well, wouldn't you expect to see that a little in M2?  Well, I don't know what we're going to know from a weakening in M1, either, for a couple of weeks  Well, I'd certainly look at that within that total, too But I suspect this early part of April is going to be so mixed up that we won't be able to make anything out of it  Well, around 3 percent is a flex point in terms of this prescription I had Unless M2 looked pretty strong, we probably would begin easing, just in terms of what I said If M2 looked strong, we would not [ease], taking literally what I said  Yes  Well, higher than 9 percent even at some point, if [M2] is weak enough I think that's what we are saying  It comes into that application of judgment that somebody made a plea for  Oh, I don't think so, necessarily But if there were any confusion about it, we might well do it  -63-    3/29-30/82  I think we are talking in the first instance about a very small change  Sure We're talking here in the first instance about adjustments of $100 million or so  Oh, yes  If M1 is coming in at 15 percent or at minus 5 percent or something--  It well might I would not discount either of those possibilities  I must say that I think we have nailed them down beyond what the situation probably can stand If we do that, there has to be a certain reliance on judgment I agree with that  At this point  Well, I guess I didn't get to that point There is some disagreement about $11 or $12 billion I can live with either  Well, that's an obvious solution Why don't we put in $1150 billion That's my solution  SPEAKER(?) I'll vote for that  That's a beautiful solution I was going to ask for preferences, but-- Partee's solution is never quite right but it's just a little bit wrong all the time!  I'd put it a little lower in April It is just so close, what difference does it make? Put in 9 or 9-1/2 percent; you are not going to judge it that finely anyway halfway through the month  All right Is it understood or shall I run through it again?  For the quarter, it's "around" 8 percent  I interpret "around" to mean that I would not be very upset if it went a little above 8 percent for the quarter  I'd put it at 8-1/2 percent, but that's fine-tuning too much I don't have to repeat it again What it amounts to is With something between 3 and 9 percent on Ml, we look very hard at M2 And we look at M2 when we are outside the range there, too, as to how hard to move, but we would move [if it were] outside that range I think that's what it means in practice That great discrepancy between 3 and 9, 6 percent at an annual rate, is judging the money supply within one half percent a month We have allowed ourselves all of $2 billion leeway  Well, actually I meant to comment on that earlier and I did not I just want to take note of the fact that for this period since the last meeting, which was exceptionally long, we came about as close to the M1 and M2 targets as I can ever remember  Yes, both M1 and M2  Probably Shall we vote?  SPEAKER(?) Yes  Okay, thank you  END OF MEETING  -66-       I want to start off with a couple of special items The first item is welcoming Mrs Horn to our little group This is going to be a slightly abnormal meeting for you, as you will see in a minute I may be leaving intermittently most or some of the morning But we welcome you anyway We have the females gracing the right side of the table except that we have Ms Greene on the left side of the table to balance it off The reason the meeting is going to be a little abnormal is that we have a rather abnormal development in the market to say the least I know very few facts about this, unfortunately, but there is a firm--I guess we'd call it a firm--[involved in] highly speculative [transactions] that apparently has a large and highly leveraged position and can't meet its bills  I don't understand it all They have a big long position  It's not a recognized dealer It is a fringe operator who apparently operated in very large size The varying estimates of his long position are between $2-1/2 and $4-1/2 billion He has been financing himself, or raising capital, with some kind of rinky-dink [scheme], taking advantage of conventions in the market where he borrows securities on the face value of the security; he turns around and sells them and gets the coupon and has pocketed the difference, apparently to finance his other operations Everything was fine except that the coupons came due yesterday and he didn't have any money to pay the coupons So, we have a potentially large amount of securities overhanging in the market in a distressed situation, and we're trying to figure out what to do about it Chase Manhattan is in the middle of this as the middleman in the shorted securities The people they borrowed the securities from claim that Chase is liable and Chase claims it is not, so we have a [mess] there Losses are well in excess of $100 million just on that set of transactions, and we don't know what else is involved; we're trying to find out I'm told that the bond market was off a little last night and off a little more this morning I don't know whether it's due to this situation, but if we get a depressed market, I'm afraid we're going to have to support it At this point, and I assume it's consistent with our Committee rules, I took some steps to get order in the market anyway if it goes off much more And that's all we've done so far  Well, not public in general I don't know when it's going to come out and when the rumors are going to start I'm sure there already are some [rumors], but I don't know how many We'll see that in the market This [situation] came to our knowledge at four o'clock or so yesterday afternoon Chase and others held a meeting this morning; they tried to make a pro bono publico contribution [by providing] money to meet this payment yesterday Nobody else volunteered because they all think it is Chase's    5/18/82  liability And Chase hasn't come up with [any money] yet I don't know whether they will  This is the coupon due Now, whether there are other financing problems, we just do not know It just smells as if there may be in this situation, and that's what we're trying to find out This was pretty much a fly-by-night concern by all indications They were obviously operating in very large volume  The latest report is that they "only" have $2-1/2 billion, so we'll see But they may be put into bankruptcy for that, in which case everybody who is financing that position is going to be frozen And it will ricochet back into other financing arrangements, I'm sure, in the government securities markets So, it could be a very large problem Ultimately, if there's no other solution, we might just have to stabilize this market for a period of time At least I can see that as a possible scenario So, I just took this very preliminary step of keeping in touch with the market if it really goes off I think the next step, if the market comes under more pressure, is that we'll just have to go in openly and buy some bonds That is very insufficient knowledge, but it about summarizes what I know, frankly The other lenders involved in this particular short-selling operation are apparently major security houses in New York There is a group of 7 or 8 of them; they're all well-known firms They should be able to withstand the loss if things ever settle, so far as we know about the loss But that doesn't mean it won't send ripples of very deep concern all through the market Any comments or questions that I won't be able to answer?  Well, my concern is just a very--  Well, we may want to adopt one; I wouldn't suggest that we do so right at the moment Let's see what happens and we can adopt one if we have to Our general responsibility is to the economy most broadly Larry [That calls for] some judgment about what is good in terms of the economy The problem in this case, as in all cases, is that the guy who is responsible is only the smallest    5/18/82  part of the problem If all of the financing arrangements in the government securities market are disrupted, we have a major problem  Well, Chase is the only bank involved in this particular operation But we don't know what else is involved I suspect there are perhaps many billions of uncleared transactions sitting out there where other banks would be involved  Well, there are two threats One is that not only they, but everybody else who anticipates the side effect will be dumping; they will sell their own That's the market effect, which I think can be withstood in and of itself The more dangerous thing is that nobody will want to finance anybody anymore  "A little" I agree with  This one apparently took advantage of the market convention What I don't know is the [nature of the] financing of the rest of the position--the long position--and whether that's a standard financing operation in which there would be a reasonable margin or whether they cut corners there The margins [in the market] are all low, but there is some distinct margin If there is a normal margin on the RPs, there's a little margin of protection If there is not a normal margin on those RPs, bigger losses are staring us in the face out there from a variety of people we don't know about There's some indication, and it's subject to confirmation, that the major lenders are New York banks We may have to get the banks together at some point along the line  Yes  There is no way to avoid that  That is the nature of being a lender of last resort  As near as I can figure out, the short sellers, the lenders of the securities, will benefit from a market drop But lenders on the long side will be hurt by the market drop  They are aware of the situation There's no question in my mind that this is a matter of judgment If it gets bad enough, we can't stay on the side or we'd have a major liquidity crisis It's a matter of judgment as to when and how strongly to react We are not here to see the economy destroyed in the interest of not bailing somebody out The market was still going off the last you heard, Mr Sternlight?  And there weren't any rumors of this or gossip in the market yet that you were aware of?  That is the approach for now I just wonder how bad this is going to get and I don't think we can answer your question for the reason that Lyle suggested If this is a minor thing, and we buy some bonds and the situation calms down, of course, we'll offset it If it turns into a major liquidity problem--just to put it at the other extreme--we not only want to offset it, we will liquify the market That's the judgment that has to be made at some point along the line  That's one of the mysteries of this  I wish I knew  They're not in bills; they are not largely in bills  We are operating in considerable ignorance But the heart of this problem is not the immediate impact on the bond market; it's a loss to lenders who are not used to taking losses on financing US government securities, to say the least  Well, I don't think we can tell; we don't know what the problem is In the extreme, I think we have to stabilize the bond market In stabilizing the bond market we might have to liquify the money market in the process; it's at the opposite extreme We'd pull out every tool we have if we got an extreme enough situation  Well, that concern is not foremost in my mind I don't say it's impossible, if things got bad enough, but the most immediate risk is a freezing up of the whole market  Well, yes In a rational world they'd increase the margins a little We'll see what happens I don't know  I would remind you that there may be a good many money market funds that are making RPs in the market and it may have been far from their imagination that they or their customers were ever going to take a loss  All we've done at the moment is to take a precautionary step I don't even know whether we've contacted a dealer yet, but we are prepared to contact a dealer if the market seems to show some--  Meanwhile, I will have to pursue whether we should talk to the New York banks or what we should do in this situation Considering that point, and in the absence of Mr Solomon who is ill, I will leave this meeting to Mr Martin for the time being Are there any other questions or comments that anyone would like to offer at this stage? When I know more facts, I will tell you We literally don't know whether this is limited in terms of actual losses to Chase or whether the Chase operation is one example of four other messy situations involving this guy  One possibility is that somebody is going to put the guy in bankruptcy within a matter of hours and, if he is put into bankruptcy, all those creditors are frozen And there are a lot of them Nobody quite knows what will happen As near as I can understand, nobody has ever tested legally what happens to a repurchase agreement in bankruptcy  Yes, but we can't avoid that implication [unintelligible]; if we do anything, somebody can accuse us of a bail- out  All I'm talking about now is the possibility of buying some bonds But, yes, we may well have to help people with their financing problems But the market [people] generally are the people directly affected  Using the discount window or an RP, depending upon whether it's a bank or a dealer  Well, if we have to, it could be through the window; but I think we can just do an RP quickly with the dealers But it's clearly a situation where we may not wish to be constrained by an operating directive on precisely how many reserves to put in on Wednesday afternoon We may end up putting in one heck of a lot One can visualize the situation where prices are falling and rates are rising, with the federal funds rate very high and a lot of reserves out there  We can't deal with it too late; and we don't want to deal with it too early  Well, we may have overdone it in that case But that's the judgment one has to make  There wouldn't be in ordinary circumstances If we determined that this [situation] gave rise to a change in liquidity preference, for which there is already some evidence, we would want to change the amount of reserves we put in more or less permanently  I don't think we're suffering from a situation where the economy is verging on too much ease  This guy was apparently a real believer in the fact that rates were going to fall  Well, let me go find out what is going on Why don't you return to the regular agenda if you have no more questions [Mr Sternlight and I] will be back  We can turn to Mr Axilrod I guess that is where we are, right?  Oh, you haven't had that report yet? Well, we will turn to Mr Sternlight That reinforces my feeling that we may run over into this afternoon  I didn't mean to cut off Mrs Teeters and Mrs Horn from the earlier discussion  You'll make your comment later on it  We'll turn to Mr Axilrod at this point Excuse me, I forgot that we have to confirm the operations  Without objection Now, Mr Axilrod  Well, we had a lot of "whereas" comments in this report on the possibilities, anyway Mr Morris  -25-    5/18/82  Well, who would like to comment on this statement and on this great economic monetary policy problem?  Mr Black  -27-    5/18/82  Mr Boehne  Mr Morris  Mr Guffey  Mr Roos  Governor Gramley  Maybe just for my benefit--I am sorry I got called out here--your concluding comment was "B," I take it?  I didn't hear any of Governor Rice's argumentation You reported that you were for "A"?  I hope I don't get called out again I should report that the market on the surface is behaving normally enough Bond prices are actually up today I guess the federal funds rate hasn't behaved very well; it remains around the same level or a little higher, but I don't think that has anything to do with this little flurry in the market I wouldn't think the funds rate is affected We get contrasting reports about whether the market clearing arrangements are affected They are not drastically affected at this point, but there's a lot of nervousness about them And still nobody knows anything about the position of this firm, as near as I can figure out So, so far so good  On policy, I was going to interject a few comments of my own here I don't know whether it's time to do that or not but I heard some concerns, which I well understand, and I heard various bits of analysis I'm sorry I missed the earlier discussion I think we are in a stage where we could tell ourselves that nobody said it was going to be easy to change these expectations and behavior patterns I don't think we have changed them completely We have a situation where prices are moving much more favorably than can be sustained on the basis of cost trends, and we have costs rising at a somewhat slower rate of speed, but a modestly slower rate of speed There is a real prospect, I think, of further progress in that direction over a period of time It is going to take some time and we can't count on surface price improvement to continue Meanwhile, there's a horrendous squeeze on profits and all the manifestations of that around the economy And I think we are vulnerable to the kind of thing that is happening in the market now in some form of another as time passes I would also be concerned, and have been for some time, about influences on M1 of the liquidity/uncertainty/precautionary motive that Steve referred to Did you refer to this survey? I didn't hear it  We can always reevaluate our longer-range targets at any meeting I haven't heard anybody pressing that at this meeting and I think that's probably appropriate because it's very normal to do it at our next meeting But we have to do it with some care at the next meeting, particularly against the background of the behavior of M1 Steve has outlined the possibility that M1 growth will be quite modest as soon as the economy turns around and as the precautionary motive unravels I think there's a reasonable chance of that happening It probably will once the economy turns around, but that assumes that it turns around and, of course, that people perceive that it has turned around It is devoutly to be wished at this point that interest rates come down And even more so, I don't think we  -33-    5/18/82  have much leeway for surprises in the aggregates that drive [interest rates] up through a too mechanistic interpretation of the aggregates  I put this all together in two ways, which isn't unique from the comments I've heard already I've argued the case before--not always successfully--that unless we have a good reason, we shouldn't change the quarterly targets However, there are all sorts of ways to interpret that and the operational decision is where to set the borrowing path I don't know whether Steve is right or wrong; I presume that there's at least a 50-50 chance that he's right that a considerably lower level of borrowing will be accompanied by a growth path in the aggregates that is consistent with the target we already set In any event, that is basically a two-track strategy that has some appeal to me Fine-tuning the aggregates in the middle of a quarter I'm not sure buys much I am not going to [be greatly upset] if M2 growth comes out at 8-1/2 percent instead of 8 percent or even 9-1/2 percent instead of 8 percent or if M1 continues to run somewhat high under a pattern of liquidity pressures as reflected in NOW accounts in particular I'm right in the middle of something, tell him I'll call him back in just a minute [Secretary's note The previous sentence was an aside to a messenger informing the Chairman of a phone call]  In effect, I would at this point take the chance from one point of view or buy the protection from another point of view-- however one wants to express it--of easing the pressures on bank reserve positions along the lines of plus or minus what is suggested in "B" If it turns out that the figures are more favorable in terms of restrained growth, we could move more aggressively pretty promptly I think that would bring some easing sooner or later in the funds rate The borrowing is substantially lower than we've had for a long time But I am not persuaded that that has to be reflected in precise changes in the targets I'd be inclined to leave them where they were and then take the chance that that will turn out to be consistent with an easing of money market pressures for which I think there is a reasonable chance That's how I'd play the risk situation There is a risk in the sense that whenever we set these reserve paths we never quite know where M1 and M2 and the rest of the Ms are going to come out I'd play it in the sense that we will take some chance that with a lower borrowing figure, they will behave If they don't behave, we might have missed a little low on the borrowing side but we don't have to react too quickly on the other side either if there's no very extreme movement within the confines of any of these numbers we're talking about Well, with that much introduction or comment, I will make a telephone call and return very promptly Next on the list is Mr Ford  Mr Martin Is that who we're up to?  Was there any particular comment of great acuteness that the two last people wanted to repeat very briefly? I see where you came out generally If not, Mr Martin  Mr Balles  -37-    5/18/82  Nope  Mr Keehn  Governor Wallich, you have your chance to defend "C"  A billion dollars is where we are now in fact  Well, borrowing, let us not forget, is in any case the residual; what we are aiming at is the reserve path And if the excess reserves vary from their assumed level, we will get a different borrowing figure simply because excess reserves are off  Mr Boykin, would you like to contribute to our--?  Mrs Horn, you are left either to pronounce the benediction or to change everybody's mind, or to bring a fresh point of view in any event I don't know whether your view is from Cleveland or Philadelphia at this point--perhaps a mixture of both  Well, we seem to have some considerable, but not unanimous, consensus around some variant of "B" with a plus or minus [or] in the middle I take it a number of people have made the point, and I made the point, that we face the possibility of surprises and uncertainties along the line, which might require a deviation from a strict application of a reserve path But we have to assume we're talking in the usual manner There is one consideration that would bear upon me, which I didn't mention earlier, and I don't know whether anybody mentioned it explicitly I'd like to get interest rates down; it wouldn't hurt my feelings at the very least to give the market a little sense of a lead in that direction On the other hand, it would be unfortunate if we gave it such a strong lead and created a sizable risk that we would have to reverse it in a considerable way That would damage precisely what we're trying to do; we always have that risk to some extent  Borrowings have been around $1 billion and very briefly have been a little below that Actually, the Desk has been aiming at a path consistent with $1 billion Such a level has been very slow to affect the federal funds rate so far, but presumably at some point it should The federal funds rate is about where it was when the borrowings were $300 or $400 million [higher] Sometimes it takes a few weeks All I'm saying is that, balancing all this out, maybe the $800 million in the Bluebook is a reasonable compromise between a bit of a lead and not being so aggressive that we maximize the chances of having to turn things around on relatively short notice I really hadn't thought of it before particularly, but as I sit here, I feel that if we promote a great rally in the bond market and have it disappointed in three weeks, we may be better off with a little more moderate increases in the first place We can't control that because the market has a mind of its own We can't control it fully, but we can try to avoid giving a false lead And if we have to go lower [on the borrowing], I'd go lower a little more gradually That is my sense of that  As for the federal funds rate, it's hard to put the limit below 15 percent when it's above 14 percent right at the moment But I would not have a comfortable feeling if the federal funds rate went above 15 percent at this particular juncture, and I would want to review that pretty carefully I am inclined to think we ought to say 15 percent; we should review it if it goes to 15 percent I wouldn't expect it to do so but I would want to think a bit if it did The lower end of the range on a 4-point range comes out to 11 percent, which gives us a lot of room from where we are I don't feel strongly about the lower part of the range But just to give you something to shoot at, we're at "B" And, picking up on John Balles' point, which I think had some echoes elsewhere, I personally do feel more relaxed about M1, given the various influences or uncertainties bearing upon Ml within limits It's a great source of comfort that M2 is somewhere near the upper end of the range I have made this point very frequently in informal public and private discussions, though I have not done it in writing or in a big public speech I think it might be  -41-    5/18/82  useful at least to suggest in a public speech, of which I have a plenitude still on my calendar, that one should not be too literal or too aggressive about M1 when there is all this uncertainty about the precautionary effects in M1 and so forth I also would note that that figure gets interpreted in the light of what is happening in the other aggregates and is not looked at just as a figure itself  I have to discuss a bit a letter from Mr Reuss discussing various resolutions in Congress and what we would do about them I want to take that up with you I can do it now or after we make this decision I don't know whether it's relevant to anybody's decision So, let me just introduce it I have been abroad, but he sent me this letter, which arrived on my desk Monday morning, May 12 That means it was sent on Friday It's a six-page opus Page 1 says the Senate Budget Committee has tentatively adopted a budget resolution and he's urging the House Budget Committee to have [such a] resolution; they hadn't adopted it at the time he wrote this letter, I guess Since then the House Budget Committee, in Committee stage, has adopted the same resolution, with the same language as the Senate resolution It says that it is the sense of the Congress that if the Congress acts to restore fiscal responsibility--that's a big if--and reduces projected budget deficits in a substantial and permanent way, though I don't know how one makes that judgment, then the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee shall reevaluate its monetary targets in order to assure that they are fully complementary to a new and more restrained fiscal policy It seems to me a fairly unexceptional kind of resolution and one that can be lived with, since it's entirely appropriate that we reexamine our targets on our own initiative with or without the Congress speaking for this and for other reasons Obviously, we are approaching the midyear date to make that an explicit part of the [agenda]  Now, Mr Reuss has been trying to get in a much more specific resolution, and page 2 reviews the background for that He [unintelligible] it in other ways; he didn't say how specific a directive or resolution at least, but it comes down to a more specific resolution He says he thinks that is going to prevail when the budget resolution is finally enacted That's not the resolution they adopted in the Committee He says here or elsewhere that he's going to press it as part of the debt ceiling legislation If it appears there, I would note that that is legislation and not just a resolution Then he has 2 or 3 pages about how the Constitution says that Congress shall have the power to coin money and the Federal Reserve is its agent He notes that that is in the preamble of some resolutions that he has introduced and he reviews [comments by] past Chairmen [of the Federal Reserve] I don't know whether he quoted some language from me--he could have; somebody should look it up--but he could have mentally, though he didn't But he quotes Mr McCabe, Mr Martin, and Mr Burns as saying that yes, indeed, if Congress appropriately by law ordered the Federal Reserve to do something, the Federal Reserve would do it I don't think he gets right to the point of what we would do if there were a resolution [He says] it is vital for the Congress to know whether the Federal Reserve will now accede to the directive of Congress or instead assert that it is a fully independent fourth branch of government accountable to no one [He notes that] the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee is on May 18 and that it would be in the public interest to give the Open Market Committee an opportunity to vote on this question So, I'm  -42-    5/18/82  going to ask you to vote on--not seriously--whether we will obey the law or not  He suggests a rather vague resolution--well, I don't know whether it's vague or not "Resolved that the Federal Open Market Committee will comply with a directive in a concurrent resolution requesting the Federal Open Market Committee, if the Congress substantially reduces budget deficits, to adjust its present monetary target range in order to permit lower interest rates" That leaves open the question of whether adjusting the monetary target range will in fact speed up the achievement of lower interest rates or not; that is a matter of some controversy I do not think it's appropriate that I take a vote on this particular resolution that he has proposed, but I wanted to expose you to it And I wonder whether I can report to him that we have discussed this matter and I will tell him that it is clear in the minds of the members of the Open Market Committee that indeed we follow the law If Congress had a law that told us to do something, we'd have to do it But a resolution is a much more tricky thing to handle I think we probably ought to duck the question of how binding a resolution is, in the last analysis But obviously we'd have to take it seriously and I'd say so I would propose to point out in a letter that it would be a very difficult matter if they got very precise in a resolution It would be a departure, I think without precedent, if there were a really precise resolution It would create a very serious dilemma if we didn't happen to agree with him But I would not say what we would do However, I would like to report that we take their [views], however expressed, very seriously and would certainly give them our fullest attention without [directly addressing] the issue of whether we really would feel compelled if they say that our target should be 8 percent or whatever, to say that our target is 8 percent  Well, one hears all kinds of mixed arguments I don't disagree with you in one sense But it's not quite as simple as that, I'm afraid They can put resolution language in a law If it is resolution language, such as "It is the sense of the Congress that the Federal Reserve ought to do something," which doesn't sound like a law, but is signed as a law, what do we do with it? There is also the more subtle question, when we have always claimed that indeed the Congress has the power and that's in the Constitution and all the rest, of whether they need a law if both houses pass the same resolution I just don't want to meet that question at this point It would pose a very difficult issue for us  He's not likely to do that My own judgment is that we can't evade this issue that fully He's going to come back He's going to come back in another letter or hearing very  -43-    5/18/82  quickly if he thinks our response is too obviously evasive Now, at the same time, I don't think we can answer the question And we should not, in my opinion, prejudge precisely what we would do without even knowing what the resolution is  There is no question that they will pass a resolution The sentiment is very strong The question is whether we will get a resolution of the type that the Committee has adopted, which I think is the probability The danger is something much more specific But it depends upon whether it's said precisely; I don't think we can answer It could put us in a very great dilemma It has to be taken seriously; I don't think there's any question about that Also, some of us have to go to a lunch and we have to quit for the time being Maybe we can think about this over lunch and come--  Well, I don't think it's going to take very long, because I think we were very close to concluding We have to resolve this issue in general terms and I don't think we will need more than a half hour, I would guess, and maybe less  Well, okay, if you're willing to go that fast Let me just repeat What I'm suggesting is that I would prefer just to keep the wording of the directive with a modification in the time period That's where we are Instead of just rewriting it, we'd have the same substance with a different time period I would take out those intermediate sentences that we had before and just say this is it I'd make clear, not in the directive but in the interpretative language on the Committee discussion--the policy record or whatever we call it--these nuances that we're a little less worried about M1 and that if it went a little high we wouldn't be all that concerned, particularly provided M2 is okay I'd leave that to the policy record Is that what it's called?  Mr Altmann has suggested that we put in a phrase that for the short run the Committee reaffirmed its decision of the previous meeting It's 50-50 for me We are in one of these peculiar cases where we are right on track with what we said at the previous meeting in terms of the aggregates We can leave in that first sentence--well we can't really say the tax date--but we can leave in the sentence  -44-    5/18/82  saying that M1 is affected by these liquidity shifts and so forth, if we want to  I don't have the precise language We'd have to modify that language  Okay That's consistent with--  Drop the next sentence The borrowings are $800 million and the funds rate range is 11 to 15 percent, if that's the most natural thing to say here Do you want this clause saying we reaffirmed? I'd be inclined to leave it out  I said 11 to 15 percent Governor Partee is suggesting 10 to 15 percent  Well, I'll see Is that the majority sentiment--to go to 10 percent? It seems to have a fair amount of support That's the proposition Is it clearly enough understood? We will vote then   We can call the meeting to order and seek approval of the minutes, if someone wants to propose that  Without objection, we'll approve the minutes Before I go any further I want to make a remark about confidentiality There were some articles about the last meeting; I don't know whether they were based upon any confidential information or not I have some other indications, not very serious, of numbers that may have come from Federal Reserve meetings of this sort I don't know where this stuff came from--maybe no place But it presents an occasion to say again that we cannot operate, or at least I cannot operate effectively in this room, if I have the sense that there are going to be any leaks There isn't anything much we can do about them in one sense, certainly not ex post I would only bring this to your attention and note the great importance that I, and I'm sure you, put on this matter There's only one recourse, which is obvious, if we have some sense of lack of confidentiality There are a lot of people in this room and we could make it quite a few fewer; we can't make it less than the Committee members  There's no other way--except that maybe we could bring the Committee members in one-by-one!  I don't mean to make light of this because I don't think it is light I would just note that there's no recourse if we get some sense of this happening It's still very stultifying in any event I will say nothing more We can go to the agenda and the staff report on the economic situation  If I may just interrupt a minute, Jim Of that roughly 4 percentage point [difference in the projections of] nominal GNP, how much of that is prices and how much is real?  And what do we have?  About half the difference is real and half of it is prices  Well, I suppose we might as well go to you, Mr Axilrod, even though it may be a little premature We'll go back and discuss the economic situation after you are finished  Well, who would like to make some comments or ask questions, particularly about the economic situation but even general questions or comments on the strategic decisions facing us? I'm not looking to rush to a decision on this matter necessarily this afternoon, and I want to get back to the foreign side I'll just cut this off in a while and get back to the matter we have to take up in the international area  Mr Balles  Let me make a comment We're supposed to be undergoing this exercise by law in the light of what the Administration is projecting and what its plans are and so forth I don't know of any different plans in terms of any legislative initiatives They are working on their forecasts I don't know the exact [numbers] or, if I knew, I've forgotten But they are subject to change anyway They have a forecast which is I'm sure in real terms somewhat higher than the staff's forecast, but it's not out of sight It probably has a higher [real] GNP and higher prices, which also makes-- [Secretary's note The Chairman, speaking to a messenger who informed him of a phone call, asked "Is he on the phone?"]  MESSENGER I don't know, sir  I guess it's not urgent  So, they probably come up with a significantly higher nominal GNP from the combination of the two, although I don't think the differences are going to be tremendous in either element But putting that into a budgetary picture, they are closer to the staff estimate than to the budget resolution  They haven't settled on it yet But they are not down at $104 billion, where the budget resolution is, by a very considerable margin Now, just what they're going to print, I don't know But in general terms, apart from the economic assumptions, I don't think they would deviate widely from the kind of assumptions that the staff has made as to how much of the budget resolution's specific actions will be converted into real actions  Governor Partee  Governor Wallich We're still at a very preliminary stage, I think  I thought you were going to suggest we need more than one tool of policy  Governor Gramley  Mr Solomon  Is that for '83 or '82?  You're talking about the GNP deflator?  Mr Roos  Mr Black  It can't be well above Of course, that does depend upon what one assumes for June but it can't be well above I don't know what your interpretation of well above is This week we'll be within the range  Mr Guffey  Mr Keehn  Mr Ford  It may last one week  There is also another possibility obviously, just mechanically, which is raising some ranges and not others But on rebasing at the second quarter, as a matter of reporting to you if nothing else--and it may be more than reporting to you--Mr Reuss had a suggestion for us as usual when I was testifying a few weeks ago and that is specifically what he said He said "Why don't you rebase on the second quarter and adopt a range specifically of 2-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent for the second half of the year?"  We have more than four already!  Mr Morris  That's rather an overstatement  If I may just interject, Frank What were the probabilities of having an acceleration in M1, a declining economy, a declining inflation rate, and a rise in interest rates over the first half of the year?  You have the statistical data to back that up, so we can all look at it carefully?  It has the great advantage that we don't know the figure for three months!  How has L been doing?  We'll ask you to do that research for tomorrow  Mr Martin  Even though they don't understand them?  Mr Corrigan We have just two or three more speakers to go and I want to turn [our attention] to our friends south of the border here before we get finished today and maybe say a few things myself  No Well, it depends upon what your base is If you go to June--  No, what I mean is that it depends on where one is going from That 7 percent may be right for the second quarter, but looking from June to the rest of the year we're going to be very close to the target in June, if these numbers hold up  We don't know But if you just look at [growth] for the rest of the year from June, I think--no, it depends on what you use as the base  Draw a chart with a zero base line next time  -19-    6/30-7/1/82  Well, we don't want to get into that Mr Boykin  Governor Rice  You may provoke a longer discussion!  Just for purposes of clarification, when you say none of these things in your opinion has a probability of lowering interest rates--  What you're saying is that there is nothing we can do by ourselves to do that; I presume that's the implication You're not holding out on us with some other plan that would do this?  I guess I'm not worried about that Governor Teeters  Mr McDonald, you bring a message from--  Let me turn to Mexico because we have people waiting for an answer here We distributed a paper on Mexico and people presumably had that last night  Well, you have it You've all read it and studied it carefully Let me bring you up to date We are providing essentially some window-dressing money and it's only window-dressing money We'll keep it in the bank tonight It is less than the full amount of the swap You were asked for your approval of that yesterday or the day before, whenever it was, and that has been done The more important question is the need for real money I don't know that anybody knows how that stands precisely But there's a clear possibility that they may need some money, if not today, tomorrow or the next day These days are particularly critical with respect to Mexico because there happens to be an election over the weekend It's their quinquennial event It's always troublesome in Mexico not because they don't know the victor, but because they have some concern over the size of the plurality and they have a long electoral process which stretches out They are somewhat limited before the election as everybody is They have an electoral college vote late in July, so they don't like to upset things too much before the electoral college meets There is a state of the union message in September by the outgoing president, who never likes to bring up any bad news or make any big policy changes; and the new president doesn't come in until December So if you think our process of changing command is lengthy and has its inhibitions, theirs is worse They have obviously tried some borrowing in the private markets They spent a lot of time negotiating a big loan of $2-1/2 billion and they signed up the lead banks well over a month ago as I recall The banks went out and tried to syndicate it And I might say it has a very liberal margin, higher than they had been paying, but not a Brazilian standard of 2 percent or more It was around 1 percent or a little less  I forget the exact [margin]; it doesn't make any difference The banks found out during this period in going out and syndicating the loan that there was very little response, which I think is symptomatic of banking attitudes toward Mexico at this point So the leaders in the syndicate got stuck with most of the loan because they had agreed to underwrite it The loan presumably went through today finally It was going to be signed every week and never got signed I presume it got signed today But by this time there is no money left of the loan because half of it goes into refinancing short-term debt that these same banks had put on some time ago and the other half goes to repay a bridge loan that they had made when they agreed to make the loan in the first place So, there isn't any cash from the loan And it's all symptomatic of the international financial markets closing up pretty tightly on Mexico now  -23-    6/30-7/1/82  Mexico has a program that is described in that paper It's hard to tell, but the sense is that they're not having a big run or outflow from Mexico; such an outflow was not unlikely before the election And the fact that they got through apparently without [outflows] of big size anyway before the election is somewhat encouraging But the sense is that there are a lot of short-term as well as medium-term loans maturing and they can't roll them over now So they have a cash bind To give you some idea of the overall problem, which probably is in the memorandum, their plans were to borrow $27 billion gross this year as I recall That's over $2 billion a month That would lead to a net increase of about $11 billion in outstanding indebtedness, which is less than they did last year But they have to get almost $1 billion a month net to [finance] their balance of payments [deficit], and that doesn't assume a big outflow from Mexico Against all those numbers our swap is not overwhelming in size It can help them get through the election; it may help them some days thereafter, if we do it, or intermittently thereafter But they obviously have a basic confidence problem they are going to have to deal with And they have begun to deal with it I think it's at least a token of good faith As was noted in the memorandum and the telegram, Mexico's finance minister and central bank governor have gone around saying more openly than in the past according to my memory "Too bad, but no growth for a year or 18 months because we have a big adjustment problem here" And that has been said quite publicly and openly But they have come to us; they haven't much other recourse that I know about for getting money in the short run It's not quite clear what they are going to need in the very short run Our problem, of course, once we get into this morass, is How do we get repaid when they have that kind of borrowing need? And the loan is not going to be repaid unless they have access to public credit I don't mean public credit; I mean access to the market I don't know of any access they have to public credit in big ways The United States government may lend them a little money, but that's not going to amount to a hill of beans  SPEAKER(?) The IMF?  Access to the market is what I mean And, of course, from that point of view the question arises about the IMF The IMF doesn't have enough money to take care of them for very long, but the IMF can be critically important in terms of encouraging reinforcement of their program and encouraging confidence so that the market is reasonably open to them I might just mention that on top of all this they have the de facto bankruptcy of the biggest company in Mexico complicating all this with its many outstanding international loans  The reason Sam Cross isn't here is because he is in Mexico City with a proposition for our lending them some real money as opposed to just window-dressing money if we can get a satisfactory commitment--to the degree one can get a commitment now as a practical matter--that the loan will be of limited duration, that in the last analysis they will borrow from the Fund as a means of repayment, and that if they are going to have to borrow from the Fund that implies some approach to the Fund before the maturity date of the loan We have talked with the Treasury about this--both the Treasury and the Administration more generally one might say--because this obviously has broader ramifications It is the kind of thing that we would  -24-    6/30-7/1/82  naturally want to get their view on in terms of its other implications, and they also have some lending capacity The Treasury has a swap agreement with Mexico of only $300 million, which is now written and has been for a number of years to say that they will only lend to them if Mexico has an IMF program in place And there is some much vaguer language in the statute that doesn't say that an IMF program has to be in place but to some degree restricts their flexibility on how the ESF lends money The upshot of all this is that Sam went down there to find out whether they would agree to a letter in effect saying that they would borrow from the IMF in the last analysis if they have to in order to repay this And we have asked the Treasury whether they are willing to send us a letter that in the last analysis, assuming that Mexico has an IMF program which is consistent with their swap terms, they either would join us in lending to Mexico or help take us out if that were necessary Probably if they do borrow from the IMF, under IMF procedures, the IMF cannot in the immediate instance lend them enough money to repay our swap in the full amount because the tranche that they would in normal circumstances be eligible for without some passage of time is what-- $300 to $400 million?  There's a little room for flexibility here, but we can't be certain We would have to wait another quarter or six months or whatever for the next tranche We have a [draft] letter that apparently they are prepared to write, which surprises me a little just in terms of the tenderness of the political situation there, two days before an election That's a tough problem for any country, too I did not mention in the background that the present president of Mexico on a number of occasions said he would borrow from the IMF over his dead body I can read the letter to you Did you give me a copy of that letter?  I will read to you I will not go down this word for word in the sense that there may be a little room for changing it slightly, but I think it has the essential elements that we were looking for And this would be a letter to me, presumably "I'm pleased that an agreement has been reached in reactivating the swap arrangement In order to bolster market confidence and strengthen Mexico's reserve position, the Government of Mexico in coming weeks will accelerate the implementation of its stabilization program that was announced on April 21" I might say they have said that they were going to do that anyway That's nothing new The letter continues "and, as necessary, intensify that program The Banco de Mexico intends to repay its drawing as soon as its reserve position permits" Now, let me just put a little gloss on that sentence They think they're going to get a loan--what amounts to a loan, I guess, in that it's a prepayment for some oil sales in Europe --next week so we could be repaid as early as next week if that goes through And that's the intention But that doesn't mean they wouldn't be back They need $2 billion a month And all they are doing is anticipating next month's oil sales They won't come in the normal way So, we may get repaid next week, but it's not the end of the problem by any means "The agreed drawing will have a maturity of  -25-    6/30-7/1/82  one month, subject to one additional three-month renewal on mutual agreement In any event, any and all drawings made under the swap arrangement will be finally liquidated no later than October 31, 1983" That would be the one month plus the three months That's an earlier date than we suggested to them I don't know why that ended up being earlier "The Government of Mexico and the Banco de Mexico will take all actions required to meet these obligations including, if necessary to meet the final liquidation date, timely drawings from the International Monetary Fund Accordingly, if necessary to meet these obligations, the Government of Mexico is prepared to undertake detailed discussions with the International Monetary Fund with a view to establishing an International Monetary Fund program for Mexico in the fall" Basically, the only difference in this from the letter we suggested to them is that we tried to pin them down a bit more as to when in fact they would walk in the Fund's door and say "We want to talk" This is a little fuzzier, but--  It's very sensitive; there's no question about that The other letter is a letter from the Treasury saying that they recognize this other situation and some language we haven't fully worked out to the effect that they think the drawing is appropriate and they would participate in credit to Mexico as soon as the IMF has agreed to a conditional credit program for Mexico [Secretary's note Copies of the letter from the Treasury and the letter to the Government of Mexico in their final form are included in the Appendix] That's the background I would propose approval  [Yes], that in the present circumstances and with these understandings, subject to agreement, the drawing seems clearly appropriate  I guess the idea is that both Mancera and Silva Herzog will sign the letter  I don't know that I can answer that question and I'm not sure it's appropriate to ask  Well, I don't know because they changed the date [in this letter to October 31st] Obviously, that's a possibility Why did they advance the date? Maybe they want the outgoing president to do it  Well, I don't know what--  Well, I don't know how you want me to divide up my answers For the rest of this week it avoids all that chaos that you're talking about on the eve of the presidential election And thereafter, a number of considerations enter in Do we have an interest in encouraging them to take further measures and to go to the IMF? I think our presumption has been "yes" Is this a lever to accommodation that is consistent with that increasing possibility? I'd say "yes" One can argue about it If they run out of money, they can do nothing but let the exchange rate go, and nobody knows where it will go It at least gives them a little money in the short run to maneuver and, if that's going to happen, hopefully to arrange things in a little better way than would happen otherwise  I don't know what is going to happen with regard to the flight of capital As I say, in some ways it's surprising that they haven't had more before the election There is the theory that after the election there will be some reflux On the other hand, one can make the argument that nobody thought anything was going to happen before the election, so the capital flight will come after the election So, we can speculate about everything But in terms of your general vision, I don't know how to do this, but all those bases have been touched  Mexico has become the world's largest borrower, exceeding Brazil in the past year And what is the amount from American banks alone?  Well, that's big  And that is part of their problem--that the banks are nervous anyway They have lots of reasons to be nervous both domestically and internationally They are choked up to the back of the throat anyway and they feel a lot more choked up now than they did last year when they were getting there  Well, of course, even that is a [unintelligible] The amount of money involved from the Fund isn't going to solve their problem either  Who knows? I don't know these people well, but in this context I think they have been as frank and open with us as we could expect and with their own public before an election  -28-    6/30-7/1/82  Oh, they've engaged in a little window- dressing  Well, a very similar situation arose at the time of the last election when he was the incoming president I'm not familiar with all the details of that, but there was a long negotiation and they had some considerable difficulty They had a big devaluation--at the time they had a fixed exchange rate--and broke a record of several decades of keeping a fixed exchange rate with the United States And it was a troublesome program, as these always are, once the program was in effect Whether there's any cause and effect or not [I don't know] We had lent to them before that, too; the timing was very similar, a few months difference We got repaid essentially out of a combination of IMF-Treasury funds The timing wasn't precise And the Mexican economy began doing better thereafter Now, they were greatly helped by the fact that they happened to discover oil shortly after the IMF program went into effect And the oil in the end may have proved to be a much better good housekeeping seal than the IMF program in and of itself I don't know what particular scars he carries from that, but he obviously carries some  The opinion is very similar in Brazil But as Tony was just mentioning, this kind of approach has almost a precise precedent--the last time we lent I don't know whether we ever extended any money, but we agreed to lend to the United Kingdom prior to their going to the IMF 4 or 5 years ago That was part of a bigger international arrangement But the basis of it was virtually identical to this one  Oh, they said they will sign the letter I suppose we will, but that doesn't--  -29-    6/30-7/1/82  I don't think we'll lend them any money today What?  Yes, that's the line, but I don't think they'll have to draw on that fully before the election And they say they expect to repay it next week But they will be back  No  That may arise, but we don't have to face that now; that question has not been raised  I don't think we want to volunteer it  The question has not been raised  They may not go to the IMF But what they are saying is that they will go to the IMF if they have to They are not admitting that they will have to  In the absence of any objections, we will approve it Now, whether we actually will extend any money before the weekend is something of an open question  I think that is implicit The essential element is this reference to their willingness to go to the Fund  With that understanding it is approved might as well wait until the morning to make any remarks I have at this stage Thank you We will quit for the night  [Meeting recessed]    6/30-7/1/82  July 1, 1982--Morning Session  I will briefly return to the saga of Mexico They now think they are getting their advance oil payments today, so they don't need the swap drawing before the election That's all off, but we can assume that they may well be back very shortly under the same conditions, so I think we can let the approval stand It doesn't look as if they will [need to draw on the swap line] this weekend  On these long-term ranges, I detected--I think accurately--a good deal of consensus in thinking, even if there were some differences on the mechanics of how to present this I might say initially that I have a certain sympathy for Frank Morris' suggestion of clearing the mind by forgetting about all this I follow the philosophy that if we didn't have any of these ranges and [Congress] just left it up to us, we'd be better off But I don't think the world is ready for that I don't think it is going to have that requisite degree of confidence in our judgment, unencumbered by some numbers  In that connection, I forgot to mention--I didn't exactly forget, but we haven't done much work on it--that we're going to get questioned about why we don't use a credit aggregate and what that would mean and so forth For lack of preparation, if nothing else, I don't think we're ready to discuss a credit aggregate in great detail this morning But I have to look at some of those numbers and see how we rationalize what we're doing in terms of credit numbers My inclination would be to say that they are useful to look at but are not going to add much in terms of targeting--in the short run anyway Statistics are not as readily available in the short run for us to see what we're doing But the past evidence, so far as I remember it, is that if we look at the credit numbers we don't get much different answers than if we look at the broader monetary aggregates anyway We will do a little more exploration to see whether I can justify that position and talk about it when I have to testify because I will have to; I've been asked to do so specifically  That implies we can define real interest rates I thought we made great progress in reducing real interest rates last month We reduced them by about 10 percent at an annual rate  Somebody mentioned other ideas about getting interest rates down It's a relevant comment in the sense that, obviously, there is a lot of concern about interest rates and a lot of ideas or non-ideas being circulated about what to do about interest rates, such as credit controls One idea I have heard is  -32-    6/30-7/1/82  that the Democrats are going to have a push to reinstate the Credit Control Act We're going to have to testify on that, right? National usury ceilings and a tax on interest rates are two others; I don't know whether there are any others I don't see much promise in those ideas, but they are circulating It's symptomatic of the time I don't know whether anybody around here has any bright ideas But, that's the background in which we're working  I don't have anything to say that differs much from what people were saying yesterday in terms of general business conditions and, indeed, the monetary side Everybody talks about the risks on the down side and I agree that the biggest risks are clearly on the down side But I don't think we can discount the possibility that the economy might do better than we're talking about If we get a recovery, we may get some unanticipated inventory movements and a better GNP number than we're talking about The important risks are on the down side, though Nobody is going to mind if we get a flukish inventory number and GNP looks bigger than any of these projections  People talk about interest rates being the key, and in one sense I agree with that But I think we're talking more generally about financial constraints the liquidity problems of the economy; the concerns that many businesses have about their own liquidity positions and investment programs and their balance sheet constraints, to the extent that they are distinguished from interest rate constraints All those risks would be maximized by some major increase in interest rates during this period because of the psychology as well as the real effects involved I don't know how one can be sure that that is not going to happen, but [that possibility] is tied in with the business risk and, of course, with the budget problem In an ideal world we could do something about the budget maybe, but there is no practical chance of doing anything about it in the next six months I found myself asked by an Administration official very recently "Ideally, what can we do to help?" And I was almost speechless when it came to the budget because I couldn't think of anything practical that could be done in the next 6-month period  As a matter of fact, let me say that I think the problems of the business world and financial world are partly accommodating to high interest rates and trying to cope with them and the balance sheet pressures It's a big intermixture of problems that involve just plain adjusting to disinflation I was struck recently by an example of that In general terms we have a potentially serious banking problem that some of you know about arising out of a bank in Oklahoma that's teetering, or more than teetering The bank itself isn't all that significant, but it has participated in oil loans mostly and some real estate loans all over the country in very concentrated lots and in very large amounts It's a small bank participating in huge amounts of these loans, and we don't know quite what their quality is at this point But there is a major question about the quality and conceivably maybe even some fraud in the situation These participations have been building up apparently right through recent months in very large volume I mention it not only because [the situation] is potentially serious in itself but because here we have banks making these loans overly casually, apparently The loans are largely in the oil area, reflecting a psychology I suppose that anybody who digs a hole in the ground now or even promises to dig a hole in the ground had a bonanza because the price of oil was going to  -33-    6/30-7/1/82  go up forever And the price of oil suddenly doesn't go up forever and all these loans look awful This has nothing to do with the interest rate--well, it may be modestly complicated by the interest rate--but much more with the fact that all the casual presumptions were that the price of oil would be $50 a barrel or whatever in 1984 and $90 a barrel in 1990 Those presumptions no longer look like such good bets, and there isn't any money to deal with the loans And there were a lot of dry holes, I'm sure, at the same time It's a striking case of people making investment plans and lending plans on the presumption that they were going to be bailed out by higher prices, and that presumption is now in doubt I suppose it's inherent to some degree in the disinflationary process that people haven't really believed it up until now  I share the general view about the likelihood of an economic outlook somewhere generally along the lines that everybody has been talking about But whether we can negotiate our way through this period and whether we have a soluble problem or not remains to be seen I can spin out this nice scenario of what is going to happen this year and later in the decade--and I think it's plausible and not even unlikely in one perspective--but there are a lot of risks I don't know whether we're dealing with an impossible dream or an impossible problem in trying to get through this period to a noninflationary economy without still more problems than we have And we have plenty already  Everybody is focused on the question of whether we have enough money and what is going on in terms of liquidity demands I don't have anything particularly to add there I share the general feelings that have been expressed by most people, I think I read an analysis the other day of this kind of problem, which I'll read to you "Other things being the same, it is highly plausible that the fraction of their assets individuals and business enterprises wish to hold in the form of money, and also in the form of close substitutes for money, will be smaller when they look forward to a period of stable economic conditions than when they anticipate disturbed and uncertain conditions After all, the major virtue of cash as an asset is its versatility It involves a minimum of commitment and provides a maximum of flexibility to meet emergencies and to take advantage of opportunities The more uncertain the future, the greater the value of such flexibility and hence the greater the demand for money is likely to be" That almost sounds like my recent testimony But it happens to be from Friedman and Schwartz, A Monetary History of the United States 1867 to 1960 The problem is that it's one thing to look back in history and say in the light of hindsight that we had all these shifts in the demand for money, which we should have taken care of, and it's another thing to recognize them as they are taking place And we're in the midst of trying to recognize them when they take place I feel quite confident that we have an enlarged demand for liquidity due to the uncertain future A greater than usual value of flexibility is attached to cash and near-cash assets The problem in a cyclical context is largely, or maybe entirely How do we measure that? And, of course, we have the problem of overfeeding or overaccommodating it, which can build up more inflationary potential than we want in the future The targets for the money supply are supposed to brake that, I suppose Their value is that we don't jump too far and we think hard before accommodating that [liquidity demand] too much  -34-    6/30-7/1/82  When I look toward the longer-term targets--and this is somewhat premature, but I think we ought to have it in the back of our heads--we have had an upward trend in velocity for many years now, but that trend has accompanied rising inflation and rising interest rates generally, and one would expect to see both of those factors reducing the demand for money If we were really successful in getting inflation down, and presumably that should be accompanied by lower interest rates over a period of time, I don't think it necessarily follows--abstracting from institutional change, which of course we're also having--that that long-term trend in velocity would disappear The historical trend in velocity before the postwar period was toward decreasing velocity rather than increasing velocity  As I say, it's premature to suggest that that is where we are now, when we have such strong cyclical factors, but it bears upon how indefinitely into the future one might logically reduce [the growth in] the money supply One has to look at that factor and keep it in mind at some point along the line When you look at the next six months, presumably velocity will go up Everybody is more or less assuming that with respect to this year's target But, as has been said by practically everybody, making a judgment of how much is extremely difficult Looking at history, it is unambiguous that velocity goes up during the early stages of a recovery This is an exceptionally weak recovery that we're projecting, as has been said; I don't know how that bears on it Since the '54 recession, the average increase in velocity for the six months after [the beginning of] a recovery has been something like 5-1/2 percent We are projecting something in the neighborhood of-- Wait a minute; I'm not sure about this number If money increased something like 5 percent or a little less on a quarterly average basis during the second half of the year, with the kind of economic projection we have, velocity would be what, Mr Axilrod?  The lowest velocity increase we've had during the first two quarters of a recovery in this period is 3 to 3-1/2 percent The highest we've had is 8 percent  Well, I don't know what the interest rate pattern will be in the next six months  Well, I don't say we should count on these higher velocity figures I'm just citing the figures We are in the neighborhood of the lowest velocity increases that we've had, if you just look at that particular set of figures mechanically I don't think the M2 velocity is very relevant during periods when we had interest rate controls on so much of the M2 components The only  -35-    6/30-7/1/82  recovery in which we didn't have a lot of controls was the one in 1980, when the velocity increase in M2 was enormous I don't think that tells us much about M2 In view of these uncertainties, a lot of people have talked about flexibility, and I think that's the key to the whole thing We need a certain degree of flexibility in trying to judge things as they occur The Ms at the extreme might slow down because of this liquidity desire, particularly as reflected in NOW accounts if that reverses itself But I wouldn't want to count on that in the next 6-month period So, that leaves a large element of uncertainty  We have a lot of options as to what to do, as was made clear What I would suggest at the moment is that we return to the issue of the longer term after a discussion of the shorter term because that discussion may give us a little enlightenment on what we want to do I would also say that I'm not at all sure that I want to reach an absolute conclusion on the long-term ranges at today's meeting because there is a long time lapse between now and when I have to testify And twice now we have had informed press reports between the time that we met and the time that I testified, which in my view is unfortunate I'm not even sure [whether the information was leaked]; the reports may have been based largely upon speculation by the reporter rather than anything else They happen to have been very close to the mark I don't think it would be entirely bad to get a good idea of where we're likely to end up but I'm not sure we have to say that we made a decision It might be good to be in a position to say we actually haven't made a decision and, if we're close enough, we can confirm it by telephone closer to the time I actually have to testify  Either the 19th or 20th of July I was intending originally to do it earlier, precisely to cut down on the time period [between our decision and my testimony] But now it appears that the Administration estimates that we are supposed to be considering and integrating and so forth aren't going to be available until the 15th I was going to testify on the 14th or the 15th, so that doesn't look possible If we put the testimony off until the following week, that creates a much more substantial gap in timing The Administration hasn't settled on its own estimates yet, so technically in terms of our charge we're a little in the dark I don't think there is going to be anything startling I think they're debating about an economic outlook a bit better than ours in real terms and a little worse than ours in price terms--meaning a bit higher--as I suggested yesterday Just where they're going to settle, I don't know We will see in the end But, let's go to the short term and see what enlightenment that casts upon the long term Do you have some choice words for us in that respect, Mr Axilrod, or are you finished talking?  Let me just interject Bearing on this issue--you probably didn't bring the figures along and I didn't either--just for the interest of the Committee, the staff has been experimenting with seasonal adjustments, which they were forced to do by Governor Gramley's suggestion that when we publish a four-week average we compute a new seasonal For some reasons that are unfathomable to me, they couldn't use the regular famous Census X-11 method so they have been developing or bringing to fruition some work they have been doing that involves an entirely different method of seasonal adjustment In seasonally adjusting the figures, one can apply the same method to the monthly figures and the weekly figures as we get them And it results in ironing out these bumps that we get in the first month in a quarter largely by taking it out over the following month of the quarter We've been getting big increases in the first month of the quarter, particularly in April and January, and then declines in the following month Lo and behold, this new seasonal for this year indeed shows a sizable increase in January but about half what it was It was a 21 percent annual rate of increase and the new method cuts it to 10 percent And the money supply growth  -37-    6/30-7/1/82  is almost as flat as a pancake thereafter, or rather a rising pancake I mean that it shows a very steady growth rate after January It takes the April bulge out completely, as I recall And instead of having a minus in May, it shows an annual rate of increase of 3 or 4 percent in May, after an increase of 3 or 4 percent in April I think the increase runs at an annual rate of between 2 and 6 percent It's a trivial difference every month since January with this new seasonal So, we've had a very steady monetary policy!  It doesn't make such a dramatic change last year The major change is basically that it has a bigger seasonal adjustment factor for the first month in a quarter and a smaller one, or the reverse, for the second month in a quarter The change is less in July than in these other quarters, but it is significant in July too  Well, to the eye, it's a better seasonal pure and simple I think there is an inherent flaw in the method we use now in that it never catches up to reality I will present [the experimental seasonal] in an appendix to the testimony, anyway If we didn't have the problem that people would think we were pulling a fast one, we'd change to that seasonal right now because it does look better in terms of this repetitive pattern we have involving the first and second months of a quarter But it bears upon July because that new seasonal would show a smaller increase in July  Well, we might [publish it] in a somewhat subsidiary way In effect by putting it in the testimony we would do that We can put it in and say that people ought to look at this and give us any criticisms they have of it I take it that it is quite a radically new method of computing the seasonal  It does some but the basic pattern looks--  -38-    6/30-7/1/82  Of course, the further back you go, just theoretically, you would expect it to make less improvement because the seasonal is adjusted as it gets later information Allowing for a bulge or lack of a bulge or whatever, depending upon which way you look at it, obviously creates problems in setting a path for the near term So, I guess we have to discuss two things What kind of general growth we would like to have ideally in the next 3 months; and how to handle the uncertainties surrounding this year's seasonal and other impacts and why What?  I don't know if he's done either Do you have anything else to say?  Let me be unduly suspicious My vague memory is that our estimates of M2 at this point in the month are not very reliable We don't have very up-to-date information On that June figure I suspect there is more uncertainty about M2 than about M1, isn't there?  I guess we're getting--  All right Let me just make one further comment about what seems to me to be the nature of the problem--I think this corresponds with what many people said--with respect to the long-term ranges Apart from focusing on the numerology, what may be equally important or more important is how we react to whatever happens, particularly given this uncertainty about the seasonal in July We may want to be more passive in some sense in reacting, depending upon what happens or doesn't happen in the early weeks of July Now, with that much introduction who wants to say something? Mr Black  First of all, let me say that we don't know what these numbers are late in June and we have had very large revisions in these preliminary numbers Before we conclude this  -40-    6/30-7/1/82  meeting we will have another reading on this week, but next week is very uncertain  Yes Assuming the June figures are right, I don't know what that translates into in terms of a growth rate  From June?  Let me just make sure that arithmetic is right because--  Yes, it sounds to me like too low a growth rate, if June wasn't absolutely right, but I may be wrong  I think that's about right  6/10ths In dollars, it's a billion above, isn't it? June would be $1 billion above the implied June target level, wouldn't it?  Yes, and I think the target for June is 4505 billion, isn't it?    6/30-7/1/82  Well, I guess we can do either, but I suspect that that's putting undue importance on any particular number The May number isn't very high either and the difference in these growth rates we're talking about-- As this conversation illustrates, if we get a $1 billion revision in a number, which is nothing in the larger scheme of things, and blow that up to an annual rate, it looks like something significant  Okay, with that clarified, let us proceed  Governor Martin  -42-    6/30-7/1/82  I hear your music and understand your music as implied in general terms to the next quarter At some point we have to make a reserve path and come up with a borrowing number or something I don't know whether you want to throw out a number now or later  In the short run, anyway  Governor Partee  Governor Gramley  -44-    6/30-7/1/82  Isn't it only 6/10ths, if this other calculation is right?  What is the borrowing in "B"?  Governor Teeters  Mr Guffey  Mr Ford  Mr Boehne  I ran out of names Mr Roos  Mr Keehn    6/30-7/1/82  Mr Balles  It could be double-digit, I'm afraid  Governor Rice  Governor Wallich  Mr Corrigan  I am out of names at this point Mr Boykin  Mr Solomon  I think that depends heavily on what kind of increase we get [in the money supply] in the early part of July If we get a great big increase, the funds rate is going to stay up; if we get a small one or the expected increase, it probably will plummet Governor Partee, you wanted to--  -54-    6/30-7/1/82  Mr McDonald  Mr Morris  Well, I've completed my sheet except for Mr Volcker, at which point I will declare a recess    6/30-7/1/82  [Coffee break]  The numbers we are looking at seem almost ridiculously out of proportion because they come in the middle of our discussion about the weekly figures The figure that we have at this time, which usually holds up pretty well--within a few tenths by the time we publish--is the same for this week; and for next week it's the same as we had it yesterday The preliminary number, which is worth very little for the next week, is down a little more than we thought yesterday It's in that direction, but that is subject to a margin of error of a couple billion dollars So, it tilts a bit more toward the lower side than we thought yesterday, but the significance of this is not that it changes the June level, although it may change it by a tenth or two If anything like that happens, we get a little cushion for a bulge in the first week or two of July because we're going to be starting July from a considerably lower level than we anticipated a week or two ago anyway And it could jump by $4 or $5 billion in the first week in July and only get back to the level of the first half of [June] I don't know where July will actually be And I certainly don't know where the first week is going to be Occasionally in a week like this we've had increases of [up to] $9 billion, but it could be much less If we get anything less than $2 or $3 billion, I imagine the market would go through the roof because--  --it would be so much better than they thought We have to keep in mind that this is a preliminary comment, as you obviously know, and that any of this numerology we put down either for the paths or for the federal funds rate will not be announced for 7 weeks on our present schedule in terms of any direct market knowledge, barring anything I would say in my testimony Let me also make a note of reservation that applies to all of these targets, but I think it's relevant in terms of the concerns that have been expressed about the bulge in interest rates or financial circumstances I do not find it at all difficult to imagine that we would have some financial events to which we would appropriately respond by putting in a large amount of liquidity--something that may turn out to be far in excess of anything we're talking about in terms of the fine distinctions that we make at these meetings We obviously can't talk about that much, but I think it is just a fact of life If we have a financial crisis, we have to respond to it, and those numbers have very different meanings in those circumstances than they do otherwise  Sure, it's quite possible I'm not saying we would do it with great eagerness We would make a judgment at the time But if we have a crisis, we would respond to the crisis And we may respond to it on a net basis if we think we can get by with that; if we can't, we won't I go back to the very first lesson of central banking, which is that in a crisis you lend freely It's a matter of judgment when that arrives We all obviously would love to see interest rates down Barring any great crisis now, the question is how much we can do [to achieve] that by, to overstate it a bit, force majeure--in a way that looks artificial, if that's the right word That's because the risk is that whether we're successful or not  -57-    6/30-7/1/82  in the short run [the effort to reduce rates] may backfire because it won't look sustainable to the market [The market] itself will react or [the decline] won't look sustainable in policy terms or we will damage our long-term policy objectives Put another way, to the extent we can encourage or nudge interest rates down, the more support we have from observable events, such as what is happening in the money supply or elsewhere in the economy, the better off we will be rather than trying to make it a decision that appears ex cathedra and discontinuous in terms of our own policy It just may not be very productive however much we care  In approaching these variables and trying to put it together, let me try to suggest--for something to shoot at, anyway--several things Let me go directly to the interest rate question A number of people have said that it would be a mistake to signal a great change in our structural policy There might be some dispute over what that is, but I share that [view] implicitly for the reasons I just suggested It may not be very productive over a period of time in terms of impressing the market and it may create more doubts and uncertainties than we want to, whether or not they see it 7 weeks from now or see it in our actions in the market That does not mean that I don't have a lot of sympathy for the substance of what those people have said regarding their concern about higher interest rates I'm not sure that the way to handle this isn't to keep the same [funds rate] range we have now, without changing its statement in the actual directive, but to include to a limited degree the discussion in the policy record, against the background that I myself would be very hesitant, unless there were overpowering reasons, to see the federal funds rate go above 15 percent I would want to think twice, three times, four times, or whatever, before condoning that for any period of time Circumstances may be such that we don't have much alternative in the end Maybe the economy will be looking reasonably good and the money supply will be going wild or something and we would have to tolerate [a funds rate above 15 percent], but I would want to think pretty hard about it  So, I would put in the same range we have now, 10 to 15 percent, without changing the wording but with the knowledge that I would feel very hesitant [to accept it] if in fact the market produced rates of 15 percent continuously for any period of time, and I would certainly want to consult reasonably promptly I'm not talking about a window-dressing week or day; what I am talking about is something that looks more lasting than that In terms of the numbers, we have to consider this a little in terms of how consistent it looks with whatever we're going to do in the long run, which we haven't fully decided on by any means But there was a majority opinion yesterday to keep the long-run targets the same for this year And that is my instinct, too, bolstered particularly by the other members of the Committee And a tentative view I had of the need for flexibility and tolerance of growth above those ranges was somewhat reinforced, certainly, by our discussion and what I think was the general opinion yesterday I doubt that we can keep the range the same and then credibly say at the same time that we fully expect to be above it There's a nuance or more than a nuance of difference to say that we kept the ranges the same because we do expect and would like to be at the top end, let's say, but that we also would tolerate under a lot of circumstances coming in higher I think "tolerate" is the key word; I can imagine a lot of circumstances in which we would say that It's a  -58-    6/30-7/1/82  loose toleration, if I can state it that way, as kind of a general background But assuming we keep the range the same, I have the feeling that we shouldn't adopt a short-term range that on the face of it raises a question of inconsistency Now, we're all roughly within that ballpark; it's just a question of where we come down precisely  I'm still a little confused about the precise numbers now and we don't know those for next week for sure and all the rest But what it comes down to is that growth around 5 percent--maybe a bit above or below--brings us very close to the top of the M1 range in September Maybe we can tolerate a little more growth than that It seems to me to be consistent in a visual sense as a reserve path determinant Now, whatever we say about the long-term ranges, such as a willingness to tolerate an overshoot, we would say about the short run, too, I presume There may be some difference of opinion about that, but certainly if July comes in high, I sense that there is a willingness not to put much weight on July alone--that we would have a sluggish or passive reaction, as a number of people have suggested That is, July would have to be quite an extreme number to push us off whatever borrowing path we set  I don't see any reason not to put it in there  I don't know exactly how to word it, but what I'm saying, particularly if we go a bit skinnier than some people have suggested on the [M1] number--and I'm in the 5 percent area--we need in the directive itself a clear indication of tolerance for an overshoot in the next month I'd put down a reasonably liberal figure for M2, but something that is judged reasonably consistent with that for M1  I think [M2] does reflect some of the same liquidity [preference motives] that M1 reflects and, indeed, one would expect it to Most people when they go liquid don't actually go into transaction balances I think we're seeing individuals do that Businesses go into other kinds of balances  Then we're left with the borrowing level This is not exactly the way to express it, but we went fully--I suppose with some qualms about whether the scientific projections of the staff were right--with the staff [view] last time in reducing the borrowing level in the hope that interest rates would go down a little and the money supply would stay down As it turned out in the end that has been correct except that we had an intervening increase in the money  -59-    6/30-7/1/82  supply We had a [pattern] of movement that was not the most felicitous, which sent [borrowing] up a bit in the intermeeting period Now we are back pretty close to where we started out, and borrowing has been a little above $800 million I would go down at least to $800 million in borrowing on the same theory; we can argue about whether we could tolerate something a little lower than that on the theory that it would be a good idea to create some conditions that presumably would be reflected in a lower funds rate and would encourage a market [rate] decline But overdoing it would create a substantial risk that we'd have an adverse reaction ultimately, being followed up with what is deemed to be by the market, if not by us, an excessively rapid increase in the money supply; and we would lose, on balance, instead of gaining But then the question becomes How do we act thereafter? I wasn't exactly sure what Governor Gramley had in mind, precisely, in his suggestion But the sense of what I think he was saying, qualitatively, I would share I don't know how to reduce it to a formula, but if the money supply came in on the low side, we would let that be reflected in a decline in interest rates up to a point But we wouldn't mind taking a little of it in the form of a little slower growth in the money supply, too, if interest rates were going down rapidly We kind of [split] it, as he said I don't know whether we can reduce it to a formula, but we might reduce the reserve path a bit if interest rates went down sufficiently and welcome a slightly slower growth in the money supply during this period We'd be very reluctant and sluggish and passive on the up side if the money supply came in high in the short run So, let's have a little discussion of these variables just to--  Well, that's what I'm not sure about Is that what it comes out to--that at 5 percent M1 would come out a little less than the target?  What is the target level for September?  I see So we'd still be a bit above it  Well, my concern is not so much [how] we can trace [the right number] through all these mechanics I don't think we know down to the last billion or two It's just a question of selecting ranges that appear more or less consistent with what we say for the longer run; obviously, there's no certain answer to that within a narrow range Saying something like 5 to 6 percent isn't so bad But if we said 6 percent, where does that leave us in September? Is that going to be considered consistent with the long-run target? That's my problem I do want to say we're going to be tolerant of an overshoot And if we make the number too high and say we're tolerant of an overshoot, what message are we conveying? That's the kind of--  My sense is that that argues against [your suggestion], Nancy One can argue it any way but if we say that's a big number, then we have a problem If we say it's a relatively small number and in fact we overshoot it, we're right back into that calculation If we're a little vaguer, we avoid that arithmetic or we try to avoid the arithmetic We never avoid it  I think what we have to say in terms of our tolerance--whether we're talking about the short run or the long run--is that we can only judge that at the time in the light of all the circumstances If we observe events that suggest the overshoot is originating in a precautionary demand for balances, we are going to be more tolerant than otherwise And how do we judge that? We judge that by what the economy is doing and what interest rates are doing-- I get interest rates in through that avenue--relative to what our internal analysis of the figures suggests, as we have in the past I don't know what else we can say  I mean that to the extent that the July problem is seasonal, it is not what I was just talking about It's just pure uncertainty about July in terms of seasonals and the tax cut and so forth At what point we accommodate that absolutely and completely, or stop accommodating it absolutely and completely, I don't know You say 9 percent; starting from such a low level, 9 percent implies a bigger increase during the course of July than Steve was assuming in the Bluebook The 9 percent now becomes a bigger increase for the monthly average for July than it did when the Bluebook was actually written because we're starting so low with the same--  Yes That sounds right  My only difference with you is that we may be in really big trouble, but I don't think it's going to involve a difference of 1 percent in the growth rate from June to September  -62-    6/30-7/1/82  Oh, we can get that; it depends upon what you mean by a July surge If we get the same July surge on a weekly basis, we will come out with a smaller monthly number  We can have quite a large surge in the weekly sense in July and come out where we expected We'd have to have quite a big increase in July now, I guess, to go above a 9 percent growth rate on average, if next week's figure is right It's obviously not impossible If we started out with a nice $9 or $10 billion figure, I guess we could get that But that's what it would take, wouldn't it, because we had a $4 or $5 billion figure in [the projection]?  For the first week in July  So, it's now $3 or $4 billion lower than you expected it to be?  So we would have to have an $8 or $9 billion increase to have the [previously expected] July level?  That isn't impossible; it's quite possible  Yes, we're right on the target we set for the quarter  Unfortunately, the path instead of being a U is a hump  It may be We just don't have the next quarter yet Well, there are too many permutations and combinations to decide all of these things, I'm afraid, but I am talking about accommodating a real bulge in July should it develop We could say 5 to 6 percent for the quarter My only hesitancy is Is it worth having somebody coming back at us saying 5 to 6 percent is clearly inconsistent with your saying that you are not changing the targets for the year as a whole  And even then I would want to put in some tolerance numbers because I don't know what the difference between 5 or 6 percent is in this kind of period It's a shot in the dark anyway  That's right If we were squarely on the target in June, 5 to 6 percent would be something like the right thing to say It just says we're going to stay right around the upper end of the target  Well, I'm going a little beyond that in a sense I'm suggesting that we say about 5 percent--and "about" may be the right word--but I would say something explicitly about tolerating some overshoot  One way of playing this is to set the borrowing level slightly below $800 million The more we go below, the more it increases the risk that we might have to reverse it instead of opening up room for coming down further quickly if things develop in a satisfactory way  Not on last month's figure Not on most people's figures, I don't think There's always a question of the rate of speed and how far to go, but I suppose we would only worry about it to the extent that we thought what was going on was so temporary that the rate was just going to rebound If we thought it was going to stay wherever it went, we wouldn't be concerned about it  Well, before we get to that, on the [M1 growth rate], I suppose one way of stating it is 5 percent or more The only thing I don't like about that is the connotation that we wouldn't tolerate any shortfall; I think we would tolerate some shortfall if things went the other way, as you have suggested in--  My presumption in saying $800 million is that if things behave more or less as we're thinking, the funds rate is going to be--though heaven knows what it'll be on July 4--below 14 percent and the dollar will probably weaken Who knows? The problem is not the desirability of getting interest rates down; the question is whether by reaching too fast for that objective we may not be able to keep them down  Well, I think we have to say we will be tolerant early in the period, but my tolerance extends beyond that and is not just a technical judgment affecting July But if the whole thing looks too low after July and interest rates are under great pressure and the economy is going no place at all, I would also be tolerant apart from the July bulge to a degree    6/30-7/1/82  How will you control that--to come back to the other dimension? That's why I'd keep this federal funds range lower than some other people would That is the occasion for considering precisely moving somewhat above the path, if we wanted to implement the judgment of being tolerant  But don't be absolutely sure Industrial production will probably decline in June  Then the arithmetic is wrong  The difference between 5 and 5-1/2 percent for the number is very small All I'm concerned about is how to visualize--  Well, I think what you are stating is where I started off  Well, let me have Steve address that because he told me the opposite It's just an interpretation of what is liberal I can agree with the liberality, but I take it from what Steve told me before that even 9 percent in July seems terribly liberal at this point just because we're starting at such a low level at the end of June  Yes, he's saying that July would be lower and August would be higher than he would have thought before  Let me word it this way What we're talking about is that we're not setting the base from right now We're setting the base--within limits--from whatever happens in the first week or so in July When we talk about a borrowing level, that's what we're talking about, within limits I hate to just throw out a figure here but, given the low level from which we're starting, if the first week or two of July came in at as much as $6, $7, or $8 billion, we're still talking about $800 million of borrowings If it came in at less than $4 billion, considering where we're starting from, we're probably talking about a lower level of borrowings right from the start The question of a higher level would only be relevant if [the M1 bulge] were really something extreme, such as 9, 10 or 11--  Or even in the short-term market It is not just the speed of the reduction; it's whether the reduction is convincing in terms of what the market itself observes  I don't remember  I hate to try to be so precise with all the permutations and combinations but I think what we're talking about is this Let's take $800 million, if that's the number We have to operate a week before having any indication of what is going to happen in the first part of July So if $800 million is the [borrowing] number, what I'm talking about is keeping that at $800 million, which would require an adjustment in the reserve path in the first week of July if the number in the first week in July is as high as X, given that the last week in June holds up I guess that figure might be as high as $8 billion And then take off [from there] If it came in below $4 billion, just for purposes of example, we'd lower [borrowings] right away because it would look as if we were heading for a lower July than we expected If it came in above $8 billion, then we'd have a question Then we'd come to our federal funds limitation, anyway, at some point Even then we wouldn't move very vigorously So, we would readjust the reserve path in any event the next week, depending upon how July starts, with a very broad range of tolerance and a presumption that borrowing is going to be around $800 million; we're much more likely to lower it than raise it if the first week of July came in low I think that's the operational significance of what we're saying  Well, we don't have to bother with that in the directive, I don't think It's just a--  What we're saying is that we're not going to react to any figure for the first week of July, given how low [a base] we're starting from, unless it's enormously high  Well,--  Look, I threw that figure out, but I-  You might draw the path today, but you'd change it on the basis of whatever things look like It's not an operational path beyond this week  Depending upon what happens in July, with the presumption that we start the borrowings at $800 million, if that's what we decide on--$800 million being attuned to the first week in July, not this week  Well, we're in a window-dressing period, so I don't know If we were not in a window-dressing period, I would say a little lower They probably will be a little lower anyhow with these money supply figures we're publishing We just don't know I'd  -72-    6/30-7/1/82  be quite confident of that if it were not for the window-dressing and the July 4th weekend What are we talking about--tomorrow? So, I don't know what the funds rate will be tomorrow To give you the honest answer, God knows what the funds rate will be tomorrow  Release the money supply figure earlier than usual? How do we do that?  Oh, you mean actually releasing the numbers  [As far as] collecting the numbers a little early, it would solve all our problems if we could collect the money numbers before the numbers existed!  Well, before I reformulate all this, does anybody else want to comment on the federal funds rate range? I drew one response out of Mr Ford  Well, I think it's more significant than that, Henry I agree with you, in general terms, but if the funds rate gets toward 16 percent, it may trigger a 1 percentage point increase in the prime rate, which I think would have very considerable significance psychologically for the economy, for financial markets, and for other interest rates It would not be a very happy situation  I think they've been quite sensitive to it That's part of the reason the rates are where they are now But they probably have discounted it pretty well And this is enormous Well, let me reformulate this; I'm not sure I'm saying anything much different from where I started On the [short-term M1] range we're saying "about 5 percent" I don't know whether to put it in the same sentence or different sentences but we start with a figure of about 5 percent We certainly add the thought "or somewhat higher" with some language not only about the arbitrariness of the July bulge for seasonal reasons but an assessment of liquidity pressures and demands or whatever in the economy I think we'd probably do it in two sentences We will put down an M2 figure that is reasonably liberal; I wouldn't mind putting down a 9 percent M2 figure Does that bring us within the M2 targets by--? No, the upper end of the M2 target is 9 percent, isn't it? So it wouldn't because we're above it now  We're above the M2 range Just mechanically we can't [move into the range if it grew at 9 percent] That might be an argument for leaving it at 8-1/2 percent, but I'd say 8-1/2 or 9 percent  Obviously, we have to examine the 10 to 15 percent or the 11 to 16 percent alternatives on the federal funds range I still prefer the 10 to 15 percent We have borrowings starting at $800 million and they're going to remain at $800 million within a very broad range, particularly on the up side, of whatever happens in the first week of July I mean that we will allow for a big bulge in the first week of July If M1 for the first week of July comes in weaker than expected, we would consider reducing borrowings We will proceed That's about all I have to say  A show of hands on what?  Well, let's see whether we can deal with this federal funds rate range  No, 10 to 15 percent or 11 to 16 percent Either leave it the same as it is now or raise it  Well, I must confess that I'm not either In the end we might well have to, in some sense, let it go to 16 percent But I feel strongly enough about it that that is a point where I would want to take a look at it  Well, I think the understanding is basically the same All I'm telling you is that, indeed, I would want    6/30-7/1/82  to consult, which carries some implication that in consulting I might be biased toward making some allowance for it, as things now stand Now, heaven knows what the conditions will be If our money supply went up $15 billion in the first week of July, I might feel differently But right now I don't I would not want to let the federal funds rate mechanically go up to 16 percent, I must confess  My reason, just to repeat, is that I would be concerned substantively if the funds rate went above 15 percent Whether we ultimately permit it or not, I'm concerned enough so I'd want to consider it carefully I also think it conveys some message of being asymmetrical If the market interprets that as our being more concerned about an increase than a decrease, I would say that's not inappropriate So, how many would find 10 to 15 percent acceptable?  How many prefer 10 to 16 percent?  Well, I don't know whether I'm talking about 8-1/2 or 9 percent on M2; I guess I don't care that much Let me just take M2 What do you want to put in for the upper limit on M2? It seems to me it's either 8-1/2 or 9 percent  Oh, I wasn't intending a caveat of the sort we had then We have whatever it is implied in the normal course of events; the tolerance sentence would apply to both  I don't mind 9 percent; I'm not sure how valid that reason is We exclude the institutional funds from M2 now don't we, which is why we got that May--  SPEAKER(?) Institutional--  But presumably [for households] it will come out of other accounts that are in M2; that's a different thing  -78-    6/30-7/1/82  Some; I don't know how soon it would come in  Is the preference 9 percent?  On M1, we're trying "about 5 percent" I suppose we say both--about 9 and about 5 percent--in that same sentence, immediately followed by a sentence saying a somewhat higher growth rate would be acceptable What we can do is write something out and look at it immediately after lunch But it would be something along the lines [that somewhat higher growth] would be acceptable "depending upon an evaluation of liquidity pressures in the economy" or "if demands for liquidity appear to be related to uncertainty and precautionary needs" or some language of that sort  Yes, but of course we haven't really set those targets It depends upon what we do with M2, but if we kept the ranges the same, we would have to do something presumably The arithmetic works out better, as you say, but you're getting within a range of tolerance where I don't really care that much And if that makes people happier, I think we can live with that  Well, that has to be mentioned too I just don't know how to construct it It might take another sentence,  -79-    6/30-7/1/82  such as "It is also noted that in the short run seasonal uncertainties combined with these other things might lead to a bulge in July, which would be tolerated" That's the sense of it I think we need that in there  Let's say "in the immediate future" or something like that But both thoughts--the seasonal uncertainties with the social security and tax cut effects and the more general liquidity issue--will be in there  That leaves the borrowing level Is $800 million the right number? Or conceivably $750 million--  Yes, what's the significance of that?  Let me make this great refinement We'll make it $800 million with some effort to stay with $800 million and take the risks on the low side rather than the high side of $800 million in this very short-run period we're talking about  Is that clear? Should I attempt to repeat it all again?  Let's vote  Okay What happened?  We are back on the long-term ranges As I said, I don't think we have to push to a conclusion, but I'd like to have a little better feeling [of the consensus] than we have at the moment I've been operating on the assumption, implicitly, that of all the various alternatives we have, which are considerable, we won't change any of the numbers for this year, but we will give a rather clear explanation that in the light of the uncertainties of the situation we are obviously prepared to tolerate some overshoots And within that context, while we're prepared to tolerate some overshoots, we're not exactly aiming at them; otherwise we would change the target There's a difference between tolerating and aiming But we don't think an overshoot is wholly unlikely, and the Congress and the public ought to be duly warned that there could be an overshoot if developments continue the way they have in the first half of the year  -81-    6/30-7/1/82  Well, the NOW accounts are a subcomponent We can certainly point that out, but in that context we also would point out that we had the alternative, as indeed we said in February, of choosing a higher base and choosing the lower end of the target And we cite that as giving some sense of the dimension of this That if we had chosen the other base, we would still be within the range and so forth and so on I might bring other analysis to bear, but that's the essential message that would be given  Well, NOW accounts are certainly going to loom in the analysis  Well, I don't know that I want to face that problem explicitly In a sense we're talking about temporary overshoots but with some warning that the overshoot may be long enough to extend through the end of the year But that's a fine balancing I don't know exactly how to word it  Well, that comes back to Mr Corrigan's point about presentation, which we can think about a bit It's a little harder this year in some sense than last year Last year we were well within the implied annual numbers, as I remember We ended the fourth quarter low but looking at the year as a whole it was fine This year it won't be the reverse, I don't think; maybe it will I wouldn't say until I look at the numbers more closely I don't know if there's anything else to be said for this year For next year, my own inclination is that the simplest thing to do is just to say that, as we've shown this year, there's quite a lot of question about how demand for money will go for a variety of reasons that we have illustrated, so tentatively we're just going to keep the same ranges for next year that we had this year Obviously, that's subject to change We consider [next year's ranges] more tentative than usual, but obviously keeping the ranges unchanged for next year allows a lot    6/30-7/1/82  of room for slower growth next year than this year which, if velocity patterns are normal, is what we would expect  What I would suggest is that I will hear any comments you have now, but I will reduce some of this to what might be in the actual language that we would adopt and circulate it to you over the next week or so And that will be the precise focus for a discussion over the telephone, leaving open the question of whether we have a bright idea and may want to change one of these targets But that's the direction we seem to be going in at the moment, if I read this right And I will give you some alternative language that we could adopt over the telephone  That's right We said in the earlier testimony that we expected growth to be in the upper part But do we gain anything by raising the lower limit? I guess in a way if we raise the lower limit, people take it more seriously The reason I look somewhat toward not changing the range is what everybody said, which is that we don't know how to change it without possibly getting ourselves in more difficulty A half-point change seems trivial If we go one point, I think we have to hit it And we may not hit it But then all this arithmetic will be running on full speed The instant it's running close to 6-1/2 percent, everybody will be [focusing on] what next week's money supply figure will be In a way, we have less flexibility if we change it than if we don't That's my view; it's anybody's judgment, I guess  -83-    6/30-7/1/82  Well, have we concluded our discussion? Okay I'm sorry, we skipped right over the Managers' reports Do you want to have some rapid reports by the Managers? We have to ratify the transactions  -84-    6/30-7/1/82  SPEAKER(?) They want to change everything!  Why don't we have somewhat abridged Managers' reports?  SPEAKER(?) Very abridged  We've had them implicitly  Why don't you go ahead, Ms Greene, and then we'll ask questions on and discuss all markets  Typically, we don't operate with a particular amount or number objective in mind We wanted to keep it modest if we could, but we operated when the market was moving in whatever small amounts seemed to be helpful in terms of stabilizing the market It just happened that by the time the Desk got to $21 million the market went the other way  Any other questions? Comments? Elucidation? We need to ratify We'll have a joint vote, if that's conceivable We don't have any controversy on ratifying both operations in the same sweeping action  Do the majority join Mr Black? We have a motion  Hearing no objection, they will be ratified I will get some language to tell you what you just voted on if you don't object  We have a sentence that starts out with the ranges that we discussed This would be inserted "Somewhat more rapid growth would be acceptable depending on evidence that economic and financial uncertainties are leading to exceptional liquidity demands and changes in financial asset holdings It was also noted that seasonal uncertainties, together with increased social security payments and the initial impact of the tax cut on cash balances, might lead to a temporary bulge in the monetary aggregates, particularly Ml" Well?  You agree Do [the rest of] you agree that that is what you voted for? I would note, just in the interest of completeness, that we will make a technical change in the boilerplate part of the directive In referring to the long-run objectives, which we did not change at this time, we insert "At its meeting in early February, the Committee agreed" to all these things and then we add at the end "These ranges were under review at this meeting" And when we agree on them, we will insert an amendment Is there any further action that we need to take?  This will all appear in the discussion but it doesn't say we reiterated the ranges It says this is what we adopted in February  It says we are in the midst of a review When the directive comes out, it will have the other language Well, with that understanding, I guess we have completed [our agenda]  [Lunch recess]  We are resuming the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee Would you read us that resolution exactly, if you have it, Mr Winn? You were there  Well, they've completed action on this resolution I think this is a substantive--  -89-    6/30-7/1/82  Obviously, there are several points in our discussion [We had] an analysis of the budgetary situation and some budgetary projections presented to us that were not the same bottom line as in the budgetary resolutions But I think we might just indicate that we were aware the resolution existed and that we had some discussion of this at the meeting but didn't fully address the issue perhaps I just think we should be a little more self- conscious And maybe we need do nothing more than confirm what I think was implicit or even explicit in our discussion earlier Whatever comment people want to make about the budget situation and its relevance to the monetary targets is appropriate Of course, we have not yet adopted the targets that are at issue here  Oh, I don't know if we have an obligation to volunteer a response We obviously face a question as to what we thought about this and I want to be sure about what we thought about it Let me just say that I think what we were saying implicitly earlier-- explicitly but implicitly tying into the resolution--was that there was great skepticism We can say we welcome any restraint that that resolution signifies or will result in and we encourage the action in that respect, but we have a good deal of skepticism or questioning at this point It could be put more strongly Or put more politely there was no assurance, if I may put it that way, that the budgetary figure was going to come in at $104 billion or thereabouts next year Part of that to be sure was a reflection of different economic assumptions; part of it was not But certainly there was some concern over the net result of the resolution It is constructive in the right direction but a concern was expressed by a number of people about the budgetary outlook Now, anybody else can say anything they want to say But explicitly we haven't adopted any ranges as a matter of fact This is further background discussion for the final [decision] We will take into account the budgetary resolution itself but, obviously, the evaluation of its practical effect and the practical budgetary situation apart from the resolution is a factor in our thinking Different people weigh it differently, I suppose, but that's what I can say so far I [don't] think we're subject to any further--  -90    6/30-7/1/82  Well, I'm not really prepared to work on that assumption I will not psychoanalyze them But they did pass a resolution and for that reason I think we have to take it seriously  Well, let me put the other side of this forward I'm not talking about the substance of what they've done which, with obvious skepticism, is clear I'm just looking at it in terms of the analytics There is a respectable body of economic opinion that says there is some degree of tradeoff between fiscal policy and monetary policy I'm not thinking of the structural business, but that theory is that the tighter fiscal policy is, the more room there is for increasing the money supply without any net inflationary impact Now, individual members of the Committee may not believe that theory, but it's not a totally unrespectable body of economic doctrine One answer to them would be that nobody in the Committee believes that particular theory But I don't know whether you want to go that far  Suppose one assumes that spending or revenue [measures] of some cyclically adjusted level were going to be substantially approved by something like what is implied by the budget resolution Would that cause people to think differently about these targets, which we haven't decided upon yet?  I think I may have to volunteer  I reserve the right to handle that in the way I think appropriate but I think I may have to volunteer something  That's what I was suggesting earlier--that there is a respectable body of economic doctrine that suggests that And everybody said no, that's not true I'm not sure it's altogether not true  I'm not even sure about that, but I--  Look, I think any Congressman would I don't think it's entirely a political maneuver Obviously, that is in some people's minds and some of their political coloration But I suspect that if you ask a typical Congressman whether he thinks this is a real issue, he is going to say yes  Who's passing the buck? He says he wants to be responsible and he asks straightforwardly How much easing of monetary policy can we get when I commit political suicide by tightening the budget? I want to do the right thing for the country But I'm not going to go through all this agony if I don't think it's going to make any difference in monetary policy It's a very--  Most of the economists in the United States are telling them that is right--that it's a relevant question    6/30-7/1/82  Well, we've told them that any number of times They go on to say Can you help it with increasing the growth of the money supply?  Thank you, Governor Wallich  This is a view that is very widely held, I would say, in the market as well as in the halls of Congress  Some distinguished members of the business community as recently as last week [suggested] this approach  SPEAKER(?) But they're not--  I think they are subject to it Well, some people have hinted at the point or approached it in a different direction In terms of all the psychological signals we're sending, I would feel more comfortable about taking chances when we make all these tactical decisions on monetary policy against a background of a strong budget than I do when the budget is not strong And there's something real in it too If they suddenly cut $100 billion out of the budget, I think we would have a lot more psychological freedom, if I may put it that way  Oh, we could discuss different tactics, Henry, but I would say what I feel  Are there any other comments that people would like to make? I assume that when we vote on these [long-run ranges] you will all have the Congressional considerations in mind, however you may dispose of them I heard a variety of views I don't think I can report a conclusive opinion on the part of the Federal Open Market Committee as to precisely what it would do if it were convinced that the budget was going to be substantially better But I certainly hear a certain amount of opinion that it's something to be taken into account  Yes, I think that's unfair I don't think it's a phony resolution They probably will pass the tax measure in the next few days in the Senate, but they wouldn't pass it without going through--  And [there likely will be] some spending cuts that they would not have done otherwise These are not easy decisions for them  I don't think there is any question that we can legitimately express some question about the whole thing But that's not the same as saying "You didn't do anything and it's a phony resolution" I don't think it is  Well, it's a political question There wasn't a very big margin in getting this one passed; and the alternative, I suppose, would have been to be left with nothing They did what they could do  No, but I heard a lower figure recently  They may be reducing their projected deficit I think maybe they are nearer the Administration's estimates now How much they believe it--  Obviously, we're not alone in terms of the market and all the rest But I tell you, the Administration faces a substantive problem, obviously, in terms of what they really think I'm sure they will then [unintelligible] to think about what they want to say as opposed to what they think I don't know where they're going to come out precisely on those grounds But I think we have considered this about as much as is fruitful at this point, unless somebody wants to put anything else forward And while we are meeting we can confirm the date of the next meeting  August 24th is the date of the next meeting and we will now conclude the Open Market Committee meeting  We will have to have a telephone meeting in the next two weeks How many people are going to be on vacation in the first half of July?  [Secretary's note The transcript ended at this point]  END OF MEETING       Are you ready? Well, ladies and gentlemen, greetings I sent out this wire I'm sorry I am so late but I thought it might be helpful just to get some words in front of us so we know what we're voting on, assuming we want to go in this direction [Secretary's note A copy of the draft language sent to Committee participants is included in the Appendix] Before getting there we might just have a little updating on where we stand in the more immediate sense We have been putting a little money in the market, as you know, and putting borrowings down That would have been implied by the money supply developments, in any event, and we were more alert to do so than we might otherwise have been--to keep a little ahead of the market in putting some money in I don't think the market reacted all that well For a while rates went down and then there wasn't much carry-through and some reversal I don't know quite where we are at the moment We ended up with borrowings at around $500 million last week, if I recall correctly They were a little lower than I might have aimed at on path grounds alone but, since we're in the process of increasing the nonborrowed reserves path in any event in response to the money supply figures, they probably will be still lower this week  The latest money supply figure is not nearly as favorable, unfortunately, as the preliminary indication It appears to be [an increase of] between $5-1/2 and $6 billion--that's just among us-- which is certainly in the range of market expectations, and it's not a bad number put together with those of the past couple of weeks It shows, I think, essentially no July bulge What it shows is an erratic downward movement last week replaced by an erratic upward movement this week, both in demand deposits rather than in NOW accounts where the bulge was supposed to come So, in itself it doesn't look like a confirmation of a bulge It's not really I suspect the money supply in the first week in July will be slightly below the June average level As you recall we were anticipating a bulge in July I guess it's too soon to say that that possibility is eliminated entirely But the kind of pattern we foresaw would have    7/15/82  allowed for a pretty big increase in July and then much smaller increases in August and September July would have to be bigger than projected at the moment to get up to the path evenly distributed over the 3 months And that is a basis for increasing nonborrowed reserves even apart from disturbances we have had elsewhere in the market  I don't know what I can say about the Penn Square fallout Having heard of the name of this bank only a couple of weeks ago, I have tried to forget it But I think the obvious thing to say is that we haven't heard the last of it We have had some repercussions in scattered banks, particularly in the Southwest, of a more or less direct nature in uninsured deposit withdrawals We have some local banks that were affected by the participations themselves But the bigger questions, of course, are how the large participants will fare and how it will affect the whole tone of the market--the nervousness in the market about financial institutions in general We have not had a rapidly unravelling situation but it is far from a normal situation and there is a lot of tentativeness in the market, particularly with respect to the obligations of the institutions directly affected And enormous numbers of rumors are being generated, which get reported to me regularly, about other financial or nonfinancial institutions I think there is an undertone of nervousness in the market That is a very general summary I don't know whether Mr Axilrod wants to say anything more precisely and then we'll turn to Mr Sternlight  Slightly below Mr Sternlight  Are there any questions or comments on recent developments? I assume all this discounting of the receiver certificates is going on smoothly or otherwise--    7/15/82  There have been a number of inquiries, haven't there?  Issued?  Well, let's turn to completing the meeting that we had earlier and the portion on the longer-term ranges The language I sent you attempted to encapsulate my interpretation of what we said What I have in mind in adopting the decision is that instead of just flatly having ranges in the directive--it appears essentially as boilerplate in the directive--we would repeat the ranges as usual but add this bit of gloss to it Of course, something similar would also appear in the report we make to the Congress and in my testimony But I think it's just as well to put this--whatever we agree on--in the record so that there is some reflection of the interpretation in the directive boilerplate as well as just the bare numbers  Tuesday  Do you see any significance in saying continue the same ranges and saying--    7/15/82  I haven't any strong feeling about it I think we ought to have separate votes when we get around to the vote-- I guess that has been the tradition--for the remainder of this year and for next year Since you raised the issue, let's discuss next year and get that settled for a tentative decision anyway The point here, and there was of course a lot of support for it before, was that we would retain the same range in the knowledge--and this would be in the report too--that continuing the same range gives us ample scope for an actual reduction, if that seems appropriate And that would be mentioned I don't think it has to be mentioned here but it is mentioned in the Humphrey-Hawkins report, and my testimony says there is nothing inconsistent about this and having lower actual growth next year, if that's what we want to do But it is worded to make it a little more tentative than usual That was the effort, and if "continue" helps, that doesn't bother me Any other comment on 1983?  Well, I have a little problem, which I mentioned in my own testimony, in that someday this velocity may not increase so rapidly If we had, let's say, 5 percent [M1 growth] next year--which may turn out to be right and it may turn out to be lower than that--that assumes, in order to get any kind of economic recovery next year, that we have to have a higher-than-trend velocity figure It would have to be well up into the ranges of what we get with a good recovery and rising interest rates I gulp a little at this stage in saying that that is necessarily consistent with even the projections that we have, in the light of all the uncertainties that exist about this We sit here and imply--if we want growth above 5 percent, which I guess is what you're saying--that we have to have about a 4 or 5 percent increase in velocity through the year to get real growth in    7/15/82 -5-  the economy of 3-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent That's assuming that velocity is absolutely normal And I don't know that we can make that assumption  I think we have to say that anyway A 1/2 percentage point [reduction] isn't enough to make a difference there It just aggravates the problem  The program is not to reduce the money supply forever; it's to get rid of inflation and have a little growth  I don't know If velocity ended up at zero, I wouldn't want to end up much lower than that  We tried that once but it didn't work  Well, I happen to agree with that rather strongly The weight of the opinion last time was to [adopt the same ranges for 1983] We've heard from a couple of objectors Do I assume that the others who were in favor of doing this remain in favor of it?  Are there any other comments? I conclude in the absence of any other comments that the majority wants something about the way it is, with some little fiddling with the language, and we'll test that later But let us look at it in light of the near term The first question is whether we keep the targets the same [for this year] Any comment on just that point? This is not language, now; this is simply saying we're going to keep the same targets that we set in February To some people it may depend on what the subsequent language says  I'm talking about '82 now  I'm only talking about the numbers at this point  Any objections? Well, we'll turn to the supplementary language now, but I'm presuming that we will keep the same ranges  My only problem with that is that right now we're within the targets I certainly will argue in my testimony that we had unusual demands earlier in the year, that we may still have them, and that we have to be wary about them But--I'm being very technical in some sense--we presumably allowed for that in our operations and right now we're within the target Just as you were talking I thought of a more neutral word instead of "arise" First of all, let me say that in the absence of hearing anything else on the numbers, we are now passing to the gloss If we say "should unusual precautionary demands in money and liquidity be evident," that's rather neutral as to whether they are now or have been or will be It's not so future looking  Yes, I understand your point And the only reason I am a little hesitant about it is that if we have those unusual demands now, why aren't we above the target?  Well, we're in a dilemma here I don't disagree with what you're saying in some sense We can put in the word "somewhat" or "some modest" growth On the other hand, [I'm] trying to get away from this feeling in the market that every time we're $1 billion above target--or even $5 billion above if it came out    7/15/82  that way at some point--that it's something terrible and we're immediately going to react to get it down So, if we put in the words "modest growth" or "somewhat above" or something--  I don't know; that goes a little far It sounds a little more aggressive  Well, this is a fine distinction we are dealing with here at any case I think the market will read "acceptable" as saying growth is going to be up there But I don't know what is going to happen  I'm not sure my ear heard any substantive difference in that  I must interject I see no substantive difference If there's an unusual demand for liquidity whether we call it precautionary or liquidity, I don't know what the distinction is If you're making a distinction, I think you have to raise the targets If the economy needs more liquidity, it needs more liquidity and we should raise the targets  The term "liquidity problems" to me means that people will temporarily want to run into money, which is what precautionary balances mean  I guess that's my sense of it, too The economy clearly has liquidity problems and if we're worried about those liquidity problems just in the general sense we ought to be raising the targets  We have got trouble beyond what we've yet seen; I tell you, we have trouble  We have had a massively expansionary policy this year!  That's our dilemma  Are there any other comments? Does anybody else feel strongly about some part of this? We have to return to Mr Partee's suggestion, I think, and analyze that But are there any other comments to be put in the hopper here?  Mr Partee suggested changing it basically by taking out the word "acceptable" and replacing it with "appropriate" I think the market will read this as it is worded as our being quite content with the top of the range, but he converts it technically into aiming at very close to the top of the range  That's no change from what we said six months ago That doesn't say it's wrong, but this is precisely what we are doing I don't know what precise wording we used, but the indication was that we expected [growth] to be in the upper part of the range  Well, I don't know That's probably right or I wouldn't use this language But if we get a distinct surge in the economy and interest rates are going down and somehow M1 is not at the top of the range, I wouldn't be too unhappy I don't know that that's going to happen; I don't think it's going to happen But stranger things have happened  [Secretary's note The transcript for this conference call ended at this point The two decisions on the longer-term ranges reached at this telephone meeting were recorded in the Committee's Record of Policy Actions as shown below  (1) The Committee reaffirmed the following ranges for growth of the monetary aggregates over the year from the fourth quarter of 1981 to the fourth quarter of 1982 that it had adopted in early February for M1, 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent; for M2, 6 to 9 percent; and for M3, 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent At the same time, the Committee agreed that growth in the monetary and credit aggregates around the top of the indicated ranges would be acceptable in the light of the low base period for the M1 target and other factors, and that it would tolerate for some period of time growth somewhat above the target range should unusual precautionary demands for money and liquidity be evident in the light of current economic uncertainties  Votes for this action Messrs Volcker, Solomon, Black, Ford, Mrs Horn, Messrs Martin, and Partee Vote against this action Mrs Teeters Absent and not voting Messrs Gramley, Rice and Wallich  (2) The Committee indicated that for 1983 it was tentatively planning to continue the current ranges for 1982, but would review that decision carefully in the light of developments over the remainder of 1982 The vote for this action was unanimous  It was also noted in the policy record that Messrs Gramley, Rice, and Wallich, who had been unable to attend this meeting but had been present for the main discussion of the longer-run ranges for monetary growth held at the meeting on June 30-July 1, associated themselves with the Committee with respect to the ranges for both 1982 and 1983]  END OF MEETING  -13-       Would someone like to propose approval of the minutes?  SPEAKER(?) So moved  SPEAKER(?) Second  Without objection Foreign currency operations, Mr Cross  Let's ratify the exchange market transactions first and then we will discuss Mexico  SPEAKER(?) So moved  SPEAKER(?) Second  That's ratified I didn't mean to shut off any questions, but let's discuss Mexico Who is going to present a proposal here--Mr Cross or Mr Truman or me?  Well, we discussed this late last week What has happened since then is first of all the bank rollover and the bank discussions about putting up additional money, which I'm sure will be continuing [for] some time The calculations are a little slippery at this point, but the presumption is that our present swap [loan to Mexico] of $700 million has a priority claim on any Fund drawing, assuming there is a Fund drawing in the next couple of months And, therefore, Mexico would get no net money--or very little, depending upon how that worked out--from the Fund during this period And without any net money from the Fund, even with some additional official assistance during the course of the next two or three months, they're going to need more money That proposition-- that the banks would have to put up some additional net new money in addition to the rollover--was put to the banks and they have studied it That was presented to a degree as a--well, "requirement" may be too strong a word--but an expectation of what would lie behind official assistance, so that to some degree these things work in parallel In fact, I don't think the banks will make up their minds about this for some days or maybe a week or two, and some additional official assistance will be needed before then I might mention that at a meeting in New York where there were maybe 200 people and about 90 banks or whatever represented--  It got up to 115 banks? Mr Solomon made a little introductory statement describing the nature of the official program and indicating that there was some expectation of some private bank new money as part of this I don't remember anything else that    8/24/82  was of particular significance, Tony, but my memory may fail me and you might want to comment  Just to clarify, we're looking at this in several stages When we talk about the Fund program, that in itself will be in two stages, hopefully There was talk that sometime in early September--how soon it actually will take place, I don't know, but I suspect it will be later than they were indicating a couple of weeks ago--agreement in principle on a Fund program could be reported to the public and the outline of the program would be known, but it would take another month beyond that to go through the process of actually getting the Fund agreement locked up, executive board approval [obtained], and the money ready to be disbursed So, we're talking about Fund money not being disbursed before the middle of October at the earliest But the hope is that there would be an understanding on the terms as early in September as possible And this bank money that is being talked about presumably would wait for that first phase of the Fund program, not the second phase But that's temporary money; I don't know what the terms would be It's clear that Mexico is going to need more money next year--not just the Fund money, which will largely go to repay the short-term official assistance, but money on which to survive for a period of time next year And that will take another negotiation after this initial $1 billion that is being mentioned here or whatever it is That presumably would be a negotiation that would proceed during October and November and maybe December    8/24/82  Well, you say no small banks I think that's an obscurity The banks don't want many [current bank lenders] to be paid off, that's for sure When there are a thousand plus banks out there, the problem is How do you control them all? But if very many of them wanted to get out, the whole [deal] might blow up  That brings me back to the swap line I forget just where we were when we talked on the telephone but there was an agreement in principle in Basle early last week for [official loans totalling] $15 billion, meaning $750 million from the United States and $750 million from the other countries Those countries are insistent upon a basically equal sharing that does not take account of the $700 million of new money we already have in there The $750 million consisted of amounts as high as million for Canada and Japan, million for the United Kingdom and million for Germany Then the amount pretty quickly drops down to million for essentially all the rest of the G-10 countries I think they're all in, aren't they? Well, with an exception of one or so, that was tentatively agreed on The reason it was $15 billion was that that was all the Mexicans asked for, even though they think they need more Mr Silva Herzog, the Finance Minister, sort of clinched that by saying in his television address in Mexico that he was discussing $15 billion because he wanted to put a figure in his speech and he didn't want to ask for more than he knew he could get That was the explanation, I guess But once the Europeans heard that, they said no more than $15 billion but with some understanding, at least among some of them that I've talked to, that the Mexicans might have to come back for more  Now, subsequent to that and subsequent to our conversation, the Bank of Spain, or the Spanish authorities anyway, who did not attend this meeting in Basle have volunteered million as a gesture of good will to their Spanish-speaking brethren in the New World That is the biggest single amount that any country has come up with They have had a swap agreement with Mexico, and apparently that swap is more meaningful than I might have thought, or so they have interpreted it So that would bring the European amount up to $925 million and they want us to match it I have, of course, discussed this with the Treasury and they have agreed to put up $600 million That leaves us with $325 million if we fully match [the other countries] The idea here is that we will all go in together The European side will be done through the BIS, and the BIS is technically putting up the money with various kinds of support from the central banks or the governments We will not be in that technical arrangement, but the understanding is that we will provide the money in parallel to their providing the money They don't have the same degree of flexibility that we do in timing because they have to raise the money in the market, and they like to go by a schedule and have some warning as to when they're going to put up the money They just can't sit there and say "How much do you need this morning?" and put it up the way we can But the understanding at this stage is that they will put it up in three tranches, and this is deliberate so that at no time are we providing much more money than the Mexicans need And we will put it up with a mutual understanding, which will be written into our swap agreement and into the Treasury's swap agreement and reflected in some way in their agreement, that this money will be    8/24/82  provided over the coming weeks as they need it but with an option on our part to evaluate the wisdom of putting up any amount of money in the light of progress on negotiations with the Fund, with language about looking toward an agreement with the Fund by the middle of September You may have some exact language there that you can provide, Ted, but that's the general concept We may not put up our money dollar for dollar with theirs, because theirs will come in lumps We will put it up as it is needed from day to day and the Europeans won't come in with a second tranche until we catch up with them on the first tranche or maybe exceed them by a few million dollars And then they will come in with a second tranche and we'll catch up with that and proceed in that manner so that Mexico at no time will have any very great amount of money in the bank while we are observing progress with the Fund What is that language you have or the nearest approximation you've arrived at now, anyway, Ted?  And the date mentioned is September 15 Also, we do look forward to some private money here but, in my judgment, that's probably not going to be before the middle of September It likely will be triggered by the same agreement with the Fund That's probably desirable at this stage because it's nice to get private money in there in one sense; on the other hand, I think they need all the encouragement they can get to reach agreement expeditiously with the Fund, and that is one way of putting more pressure in that direction Any questions or comments?  We are precisely there They're in financial difficulty; there's no question about that  Well, I forgot to describe the collateral side I think the fundamental point is the one you just made None of this is going to work unless there is a good [economic] adjustment program And it's going to have to be a very draconian adjustment program I think we have to recognize the full extent of the limitations on that program, which I'm not in a position to judge, certainly at this stage I'm not sure that anybody can judge how much the country can take A country can have a fine-looking draconian adjustment program but if the country goes up in revolution, it will be unsuccessful And I'm not sure the Mexican citizenry is fully aware yet of what has hit them, to say the least But that has to be the fundamental backstop of any credit We have labored long over the collateral issue and there aren't any terribly satisfactory answers because Mexico doesn't have that much collateral But there are answers, satisfactory or not The idea of this is that our present swap will remain secured, if that's the word, by a Fund agreement that doesn't exist yet But if it does come into existence, our swap will have first claim on it This second loan--and the proposal is that this would be a separate swap--will be secured along side the BIS arrangement with the remainder of the Fund drawings as they are available over time I guess we have the gold [collateral] by implication They are willing to pledge $250 million in gold, which doesn't go very far, but there it is And by some assignment yet to be worked out, oil revenues are an ultimate backstop if nothing else works Ted, maybe you're more up-to-date on that negotiation than I am The BIS people are in Mexico City discussing that now  It's assigned to the BIS but we get a share of that to the extent that our--  I don't think there's any way of getting absolute protection against that kind of eventuality Let me also recognize another bit of reality Whatever arrangements we make for collateral, including our own swap, we may get to the point where Mexico has no money to pay, in effect They may have some oil revenues, let's say, but whether we demand the oil revenues under those circumstances is going to have to be a decision made at the time If we're going to bankrupt them by demanding the oil revenues, we may want to roll over the swap and make a new oil revenue deal later That's not the intention, but I think that's inherent in the situation When a country or a borrower doesn't have any money, he doesn't have any money no matter what kind of--  If the oil showed up  I'm not sure anybody does  They have done a lot of these deals-- increasingly in recent months--but they told us that a relatively small fraction has been placed Now, whether that's true or not, I don't know; but that's the story they gave  They get $15 billion dollars a year, roughly, from oil at current levels of production and current prices So there's quite a lot of flow there The monthly flow is--  That's exports  It's anticipated now, but I can also anticipate a problem If that money comes through on November 1 or October 15, say, and they have no other source of money and don't have the money to pay us, we may be faced with a decision on a rollover  Everybody understands that we have a prior claim on IMF money from the earlier swap Whether we can cash in on that claim or not remains to be seen But legally that's the position I also want to mention the rate I don't know whether we finally settled on this, but ordinarily we lend essentially at the Treasury bill rate on these things; the BIS is going to lend at LIBOR plus which raises the question of whether they should be getting more than we would be getting; right in today's market it's several percentage points More normally it would be a significant margin but not quite as big as it is at the moment So, we have discussed a possibility--this is the BIS agreement and I presume ours would be parallel--that the second swap would have a 3-month maturity and could be rolled over 3 times, which makes it a 1-year loan potentially And thus there might be some logic in using the one-year bill rate and marking it up point or something, which comes much closer on average to where LIBOR has been in the past Nobody knows what it will be in the future But it is natural to do the same thing as the Treasury I don't know whether we've resolved this with the Treasury yet or not  Plus    8/24/82  It probably will come out cheaper than LIBOR, but that depends upon the shape of the yield curve If we had a steeply rising yield curve, it would not; if we had a relatively flat yield curve, it would be less than LIBOR But it's someplace in the ballpark So, that's the interest rate that we are talking about  Let me ask whether there are any other questions or comments about this in general If there aren't, we're only left with the decision of whether to do $300 million, which makes [the total] a nice round billion dollars, which is what I was thinking of when I talked with you before I guess the Europeans will live with that So, the US share would be $900 million and the European share would be $925 million Or we may want to make a grand gesture and throw in another $25 million and make our share equal  No, it's a new swap  This is a different swap as we have it structured now so that it can be parallel with the BIS lending and the [original] $700 million swap will be held where it is  The only consideration I can see on the other side is that we will be discussing this with the Europeans in Toronto, I'm sure, and I can see how things go If they have really shut off the principal payments on their loans, this should be enough, particularly if we want private banks to come in But there's always a possibility that there will be a need for a few hundred million more along the line here someplace, so I want to warn you about that But this should be enough as I now see it Well, I'll put it conservatively The calculations now assume that they get a pretty full rollover from the private banks; assuming that the private banks do come in once there is a Fund agreement, this should last them through the Fund agreement if that's successful And after the Fund agreement in principle, at that point if the banks come in for some more, I do not see that we're going to have to put up any more That's my judgment at the moment, but I would not promise you that the Mexicans are not going to run out [of dollars] during the next two to three months  Argentina is the most imminent of those, I think It's a different situation in many respects, but just in terms of our own posture--and it's worth discussing briefly--we have no swap agreement with Argentina We have always refused to extend [the swap network]; this [swap line] with Mexico is somewhat of a special deal with a neighbor The Mexican currency was convertible That is not true generally of Latin America in the same sense I think we have reason to hold the line as the Federal Reserve What the US government would want to do in the case of Argentina is something else again I imagine that if Argentina gets into this kind of jam, the question is going to be raised But we do have a distinction in what we have done in the past and in our general attitude between Mexico and Argentina, just to take the next most imminent [problem economy] Brazil, Venezuela, and others could be involved, too, but I think Argentina is the most imminent Now, their debt is a lot smaller, of course It's very sizable, but it is less than half the size of Mexico's It's not all that much less than half, I guess What is it--about $30-odd billion?  $35 billion; it has gotten big, too  Our banks are heavily involved, but not as heavily as in the case of Mexico; I presume about half as much The $325 million proposition is on the table; it may even have been seconded To make it a little more formal than was expressed, it makes some sense to me, so long as we have these understandings, that we don't appear to be chintzy for $25 million  What do you mean by solid? They've agreed to it right now I don't know if the paper is signed yet, but I--  They don't do it It's the ESF  Yes  They have put up $1 billion for this for a week or so to bridge the Department of Energy's payment So, they have a billion dollar swap right today Now, that will be repaid today or tomorrow Did they reach agreement on that oil thing?  They are still negotiating the details of this oil thing But presumably that will be settled in a day or two    8/24/82  Their billion dollar swap will be repaid and then they will come back in proportionately  It was supposed to be agreed to yesterday, but I know it was put over until today It sounds as if it's being put over until tomorrow  Now, under the law under which the ESF currently operates, if [the loan] is outstanding for more than six months, they have to get a Presidential determination that this is a special situation that justifies lending for more than six months I think they intend to get that Presidential determination right now  Yes, we're going to get it anyway  Well, we have a motion for $325 million The exact [terms] I'm going to say are available to you; I'm not sure the language is all worked out to the last comma The main elements have been touched upon the rate, the collateral, the term of 3 months, and the rollovers for a year The implication is that we would be repaid during the course of the year, as the Fund money becomes available, but that's not promised  Yes, out of the same pool equally  It would be a little more than that if they front load  Well, we don't know; it depends upon whether they get a compensatory financing facility [drawing from the IMF] and how much is front loaded But with $18 billion and $700 million you have $25 billion That is more than front loading alone would provide out of the Fund agreement  Well, if it really worked out well, we would get paid out of private financing The banks would put up more loans and Mexico would repay us; but we may be dreaming, too  We have gotten 9 different stories in the course of this negotiation about whether they can, among other things, increase their oil production or not Two weeks ago they were going to increase it way up; this week, no It's going to be a difficult negotiation Do I take silence as assent?  Well, we'll have a formal vote if anybody wants to object Not hearing any objections I think the Secretary can record it as unanimous  Yes, I think we need it recorded Okay, we will turn to domestic open market operations  -11-    8/24/82  I'm assuming we won't have any other action and that it's understood that this will be paid out over the next few weeks if all goes well--if, in the combined judgment of the BIS, the Treasury, and ourselves there is suitable good faith in the Fund negotiations Now, if we reach the point of mid-September and those things have not been completed, then we will have a real decision to make; we'll have a decision before that but a more certain--  A more precise checkpoint--that's all one can say Okay Mr Sternlight  I don't think you mentioned the tax bill How did you think that--?  This will have to be handled with a certain degree of flexibility  We have to ratify the transactions if there are no further questions Do I hear a motion?  Without objection We'll have the staff report on the economic situation  Mr Axilrod, why don't you give us your blessing and we'll go not to lunch but to a donut break  I think we'll go for a little recess  [Coffee break]  Well, I don't know what I can add to Mr Axilrod's astute dancing around the issues We're in a very sensitive period, not just economically, but in terms of the markets and interpretations and in fact concern--and I'm afraid to some degree justified concern--about the stability of the banking system I am sure that this is a time to be delicate and sensitive How we express that and how we approach it is what is at issue Very technically, as Steve mentioned, we're in one of these phases when it's hard to set a reserve path with great certainty because we're on the margin of losing touch with rates in the market This problem occurs if we get extraordinary borrowing from some particular banks that have their own problems, and that can't be considered borrowing in the ordinary way we usually consider it Just how it should be considered is a little hard to tell in advance, I think, before we see it and before we see the timing and the amounts But it's another complication in [the way of our] being mechanical in this process at the moment I don't think we can afford to be overly mechanical  I would just make one further comment with regard to the growth in the money supply in particular Considering that we're in the middle-of-the-quarter meeting, my own bias, which I've expressed before, is not to change these numbers unless there's a strong reason for changing them If there's a clear-cut reason for changing them, we should change them, but fiddling around with a half percent or so on the growth rates is hardly worthwhile With that much introduction, who would like to make some astute comments as opposed to ordinary comments?  Let me just make a couple of technical comments, so we don't have to keep repeating it or raising questions about it The present [short-run] targets are about 5 percent [for M1] and about 9 percent [for M2] Steve, under alternative A, had put in 10 percent for M2 At this moment in time [M1] is running below the 5 percent, but that target is for the quarter as a whole and it's not clear it is going to run below 5 percent for the quarter as a whole That depends upon what we think is going to happen If September continued more or less the way August is going so far, I suspect growth would be up to 5 percent But we are clearly above the 9 percent so far on M2 It's a matter of choice here We have a directive now that says immediately in the next sentence that somewhat more rapid growth would be acceptable [depending upon certain developments] So, I think one could interpret this M2 running a bit high as basically being in line with the existing directive given that second sentence  It might be, to some extent; and nobody knows just how much But that may just be some special case of a more general interest in liquidity and for locking in some of these rates while they last All I'm saying is that I'm not sure we have to raise the 9 percent to 10 percent in the light of that next sentence that is already in the directive I'm just making a technical point  Mr Roos  Governor Rice  Well, it depends upon how we play it Mr Balles  Governor Martin  Governor Wallich  Mr Corrigan  -23-    8/24/82  Mrs Teeters  Mr Black  Governor Partee, you already have had one bite at the apple  I'm not so sure about that observation I'm not sure about that change  I think they're scared, but whether that is translated into not making loans, I'm not so sure  SPEAKER(?) I've heard that too, Chuck, from businessmen in our area  Mr Keehn  Mrs Horn  Is there anybody else who wants to say anything? Mr Ford    8/24/82  That's unlikely  Anybody else want to say anything? It's up to me?  I think we have a problem that is not very amenable to a Committee decision that lasts for six weeks I'll say that first of all On these monetary growth targets, in substance, I don't care I think either of these two sets of numbers will make no difference, virtually, in what we actually do On balance I'd just prefer to leave the directive as it is, which I guess is a compromise between "A" and "B," with the next sentence which allows us to go above [the target] on M2 If we were publishing this tomorrow, I would be a little hard pressed to explain why we put in a lower money supply target this month than we had last month We are not publishing it tomorrow, so maybe that's not totally persuasive, but we are within the limits of the growth targets anyway I don't think this argument depends upon how much we're in, but a 5 percent M1 leaves us within the target in this quarter, doesn't it, Steve?  I didn't even look at the chart I just thought we set it last time so that we would be within by September It's 01 over?  Boy, that's pretty close figuring!  SPEAKER(?) That's what we are doing  But I don't care a lot about that I think how we manage ourselves is quite important in these coming weeks Let me state my position very simply I would be totally unable to defend a policy on our part that brought the federal funds rate up to 11 or 12 percent in the coming period I would be very hard pressed to justify in my mind a pronounced downward shift in the federal funds rate in the near term from where it is I think we'd have the gold price rising--it's already rising--and an awful lot of commentary about what the heck the Federal Reserve was doing in terms of doing a real somersault We already get that commentary I think it's unavoidable and it would damage us  What we are saying in substance, I hope, is that if we don't get a continuing growth in the money supply in coming weeks, interest rates probably should go down some I should take out the "probably" If we literally didn't get any growth in the money supply in coming weeks, we'd presumably continue to take some combination of measures on reserve paths and discount rates that would produce somewhat lower interest rates If the money supply came up rapidly enough to reach 5 percent so that we get a pretty big increase in September, which raises some of these problems that people have been talking about as to where we go then, I don't think we would get any further decline in interest rates and we might get a little increase in market rates from their present level I think basically that's the way we ought to play it If money growth came in distinctly weak, we would ease up by some combination of measures, which would produce a little lower interest rates If it came in as strong or stronger than 5 percent, I would suggest that we probably would get some backing up of short-term rates through some combination of higher borrowing figures and not reducing the discount rate, or maybe just reducing it once instead of twice as we might do in other circumstances I think that is what the decision ought to be in substance; we can look at it again in a few weeks  I, frankly, cannot live in these circumstances, given what is going on in the money markets, with violent moves in short-term rates in either direction It would just be so disturbing in terms of expectations, market psychology, and fragility that it's just the wrong policy, period, during this particular period Again, that is not inconsistent with more moderate movements in either direction depending upon what happens to the aggregates But I just think we'd end up in sheer confusion--more than confusion; we'd end up with an atmosphere in markets that deteriorates rather than improves things I don't know how to word all this, frankly, but what I would be inclined to do--let me experiment here a bit--is to take out that last sentence entirely and replace it with something like this "The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with  -29-    8/24/82  unusually volatile conditions in credit markets" That covers a multitude of sins The reason I'm reluctant to put a federal funds rate range in there is that I don't think it's realistic--I just speak for myself--on either end of the range, particularly the upper end  Yes, that's right  We could put a narrow range in there, but I'm not sure that people want to do that But, in substance, I think for the weeks immediately ahead that is about where we are  That is correct But how we lean would be guided by the money supply, assuming that something drastic isn't going on in the rest of the market  Well, I'm not very happy about the speed with which they went down, frankly, because I think it raised some questions But it was at least in the direction that was acceptable I'd be more disturbed if they suddenly went bouncing up again Now, when I say suddenly bouncing up again, I'm not talking about the federal funds rate going up [a little] Where is it now? It is below 9 percent now If it went up 1/2 or even 1 point, particularly if the money supply were rising, that wouldn't bother me  I think it's going to be read--  We would have had a consultation and gone through it That's right  I don't  Well, I don't understand your point, but I'm in a somewhat different position than you are in understanding perhaps What it is meant to say is that we're going to conduct operations so that there isn't undue volatility in the federal funds rate but that the direction in which the funds rate will go in the first instance is determined by developments in the aggregates I think in substance it means something like 7 to 10 percent probably  That, I think, is a little different question That goes to how we establish the borrowing level more immediately than the federal funds rate On the borrowing level, I'd be a little reluctant to move it up very much unless and until we reduce the discount rate Then I think we might do it and try a very modest snugging to offset the downward impact of a discount rate change I would not want to do it tomorrow, have the rates go up, and then reduce the discount rate--  A small part of the world?  What did it say?  Specifically, what I would do is to leave the first two sentences in the present directive as they are In fact I'd put a few words in there like "continues to seek" and "as indicated" or something  And I'd leave out the next sentence, which is crossed out in the draft Then my proposal was to replace the last sentence with something like what I had suggested Now, the nearest equivalent to that, I think, is just leaving the same sentence but putting in 7 to 10 percent, which conveys the same flavor I think either way of doing that--  -32-    8/24/82  I don't like this idea of 7 to 12 percent, which gives a public impression that is different than the private one I'd have a little difficulty defending it I don't know as it has become a big issue of why we said 12 percent in the first place on the credit conditions  SPEAKERS(?) Yes  It has to be pretty darn unusual to be unusual compared to what we've had!  Well, they already think that I've looked at this from that point of view I'm not sure that that will aggravate what they already think  I think it sounds more exceptional the way I suggested, in a temporary sense, than narrowing the range Both ways substantively are pretty much the same thing I think what the market is going to say is that we had had a sharp decrease in rates and we were a little concerned about the volatility in rates That's given against the background of the markets and everything else I think that's a correct reading  "In credit markets" is what I have  "The Chairman may call for consultation if it appears that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserves paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with unusually volatile conditions in credit markets"  Well, I'm leaving that out, yes  Yes, if we had better technical apparatus, I assume  Well, the most important thing is agreeing on the substance My sense is that there is a considerable area of agreement on the substance anyway I'm not sure it's unanimous, but is that a correct reading? Are we reducing our focus to how to word this?  Yes, I'm now talking about the substance, before we get to how we state it  Well, let me resolve the substantive issue As I say, I'm not all that concerned about the precise numbers we put down here But just for lack of anything better, I'm assuming we will keep them the same as before with the modifying sentence that comes afterwards, which says that at the moment we're not too concerned about M2 at the very least running high And if the aggregates appear to be running low, we will lean on the somewhat  -35-    8/24/82  easier side, which presumably would be accompanied in the first instance by some continuation of the decline in money market rates, some easing pressure in reserve positions, a decline in the discount rate or some combination thereof If money growth seems to be exceeding those numbers and getting a certain amount of momentum, we would snug up a bit But we are not going to react very drastically one way or the other in these coming weeks That's the substance of it  And we keep an eye toward the market Now, you may or may not accept that I wonder how many people find that substance generally acceptable  No, I might not if--  Well, I can't define every possible hypothesis that one can put forward This is operational I would not necessarily find it volatile if it happened at the end of six weeks; I'd find it pretty volatile if it happened in the next two weeks  Express your view, Mr Axilrod Mr Axilrod has a concern; I'm not sure if he will share it or not I'm not sure I do, but--  How do we use both?  I'm not sure I understand the point  Oh, boy  It depends upon what else is happening during that period  Well, I'm not very impressed by putting down language we don't believe  Yes, I think that's worse from that standpoint  We can use this phrase about a distinction between monetary policy and something else I know what you mean, but I don't think the distinction exists in reality It's all monetary policy  Oh, we've had it many times  It's not unusual at all We've had it as much as not  -40-    8/24/82  Well, what do you want to do?  Well, I don't like it much, but if that's what you want to do, let's do it Let's have a vote  $300 million or a little above  $300 to $350 million Vote  The same as it was, 5 and 9 percent [for M1 and M2 respectively] The second sentence has "continuing;" the third sentence is out; we put in 7 to 11 percent down at the bottom; and initial borrowing is $300 to $350 million with appropriate adjustments for exceptional borrowing  Okay I guess we will eat in here, right? Do we have anything else?   Well, you have had a description, on the technical side so to speak, of the money situation, the market situation, the government securities market, and the general stability elsewhere I suppose it's fair to say In terms of the general background, my own conclusion--and anybody can comment on this a little later--is that it is clear that any sense of economic expansion has been delayed Immediate signs of economic expansion, apart from as a matter of faith, are sorely lacking Investment is declining and is going to decline for some time The atmosphere, if anything, seems to be weakening, and survey data seem to show a weakening Consumption is rather flat; there is no sparkle to it and that's the [sector] we have to look to for expansion It is a situation with some risks, looked at it just in terms of the internal economy  As I look at what is going on abroad The problems of Mexico have in no way cleared up; the problems of the rest of Latin America are clearly being compounded by a general economic slowdown and recession; there are very few signs of life in Europe; and there's a weakening, if anything, in Japan from an already not very strong situation One gets the same sense [abroad as here] of where the risks and concerns seem predominantly to be at this particular stage in development  I think we have a pretty good record on the inflation side and, on balance I suppose, things seem to be getting more entrenched there The weaknesses in the financial system remain very evident both internationally and domestically although I sense--and Peter might want to comment on this--that there's a little less feeling of people being right on the edge of their chairs in the financial markets this week [than there was] maybe two weeks ago But they are not very far back from being on the edge of their chairs There is still a lot of differentiation in markets; there is still a relatively calm and easy situation in the central money market, which has a sense of calming things, but a very uncertain, nervous atmosphere is continuing  To get to the point, in the end, I think this is a situation in which I would not find a mechanical application of the reserve provision rules suitable, given the certainty that that would lead to a decided change on the tightening side from recent money market conditions In terms of what seems desirable, that runs against any other broader background that we see going on I feel that at least for this brief period before we actually meet in a Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which is about a week and a half off, or seven working days off, we should not follow--and I would not intend to--a mechanical application of those reserve provisions but rather stabilize market conditions somewhere close to where they are presently or even slightly below where they have been in the last couple of weeks  Minus $13 billion on M1, unless that has changed  But the report will show an upward revision for last week, and that upward revision is related to the quarterly reporters Whether it reflects reality or not, I don't know, but we have what--a $600 million revision?  A $700 million upward revision  I would not call it a policy change I would say the operational variable would essentially be borrowings of around $500 to $600 million  It was $350 million when the period started but it actually has been higher than that We are in a situation where it has been very difficult to judge the impact of the borrowings, particularly because of the two special situations The level of borrowings that we have depends upon what weight we give those But it's clearly higher than it was when we started the period, though much more moderate than it would be if we literally followed the path  We are moving the nonborrowed path up, yes That's correct  No, I'm not saying that, but [the higher path] obviously will have some impact in that connection I am saying--let me not [unintelligible] anybody--that I think it would be a misguided policy to follow a direction right now that is likely to create a pronounced increase in interest rates  Let me just throw in a quasi-fact with respect to the outlook The Rinfret survey, which is the first survey of plant and equipment spending that comes along--I don't know what reliability our experts would put on it--shows steeper declines this year and next year than anything that has come out so far  Yes I don't think there's any point to discuss beyond that That is specifically what I am saying I don't think we should let the mechanics drive us before we meet next, a week from Tuesday  I left myself a little range to cover that possibility; I don't think I want to be that mechanical, Karen I said $500 to $600 million roughly, including it But if special borrowing jumped up--if Continental Illinois, say, came in and borrowed $2 billion tomorrow--I'm not implying that we would [unintelligible] to offset that We'd let that go and print a much higher borrowing figure  I said raise I suppose the technical way to put it a little more clearly is that we would raise the nonborrowed path by a few hundred million from where it would be And the calculation would be in line with what we think would be, by accident    9/24/82  or otherwise, somewhat consistent with the current amount of pressure on the money market  Well, I wouldn't put that fine a measure on it There is no doubt that if we followed the path absolutely literally and didn't use any judgment, it would drive the funds rate decidedly higher With what lag I don't know, because it may take some time for the market to realize it More important than precisely where the funds rate is, I think it could well lead to an impression in the market for the moment that the whole trend of interest rates would be reversed I just could not predict what impact that would have on long-term rates and the whole structure of rates generally or what impact that would have on something like the bank CD rate, which clearly is affected now, and could be affected a lot more, by simple nervousness about banks And the difficulty banks with any kind of special unfortunate relationship with the markets feel [would be] even stronger We have had enough indications recently of a tendency [for investors] to walk away from CDs In fact, we now see that, I might mention, in the aggregate banking data We see it in two ways in an aggregate decline in CDs, which could be related to other factors but is suspiciously correlated with the market developments; and we see it particularly in the troubled banks The three or four banks that tend to get mentioned have a rather noticeable decline in their CD takings  In a sense they already do because the big increase came in the first week [of the month] and we are not expecting any increases beyond that But they are not coming down enough to give us a low figure We had some increases at the end of August and we had that big increase in the first week in July And despite some subsequent declines, that gives us a big September  The current trend is not [unintelligible] is a message that the System is [now] trying to get out [assuming] we aren't going to be mechanical about business And it's very helpful It would seem to me that it would also be helpful if in the coming days the message could also get out that there may be some special factors at work here, and in fact that strengthens the case for why we're not adding a mechanical response I think that could be a positive message to get out  No, I don't think that's necessarily true The federal funds rate has been as high as 10-1/2 percent; more recently, it has been as low as a little under 10 percent All I would say is that I think it probably would be comfortably within that range If you look at it at least over a period of time, I don't think I'm talking about any distinct difference in the federal funds rate At least I would not expect that  Well, where [is it]? I don't know  Yes, in the absence of--  If we had the special or quasi-special deals waltzing in here, with big amounts of borrowing, it would be high And that, of course, was particularly prominent in that one week when it was over $1 billion  SPEAKER(?) That's right  If that happened again, we could get a bigger borrowing figure But I'm talking about what we would aim for If those come in, we wouldn't offset them unless we thought there were some particular reason to  Oh, now you're talking about risks Let me leave no doubt I see it as extremely negative in terms of actually precipitating a change in the interest rate quiescence that we have at the moment Precisely what level of borrowings produces that I do not know But I'm quite confident about what direction the risks lie in    9/24/82  Drop it from where? The last figures the market has were $11 billion or something and $700 million If those figures persist, we'll get a rise in the federal funds rate and other interest rates if there is no special-situation borrowing  I'm saying we exclude that And if we end up at $700 million to $11 billion of borrowings, we're going to run a substantial risk of precisely the type I don't think should be run  You may not then achieve your objective on the federal funds rate  We're not talking about that  Well, the more cosmic issues we can discuss a week from Tuesday Unless somebody wants to say something more, I think I have a sense of the general thrust of things  Yes, sir  Well, my sense is--and I recognize your point--that that is a little difficult to do without lending more confusion Let me think about it a little more We don't have to do it today; if we want to come back and do it next week, we can do it When I went back and looked at the directive from the previous meeting, what we are talking about seemed to me to be amply covered And the facts will speak for themselves We have a sentence almost directly to this point in the directive  I will tell you, when I first thought about this, Roger, that the idea of having a special decision published--and it would be published only two weeks from today--as to why we had to meet specially and change the directive roughly one week before the next Committee meeting lent a tone to it that I didn't think would be helpful  Well, I don't think we can write it today, anyway Let me think about it I really do not think it is technically necessary, given the way the directive is written Let me    9/24/82 -8-  turn it over in my mind again over the weekend as to whether there are positive advantages in it Any other comments? If not, thank you   We need to approve the minutes  SPEAKER(?) So moved  Without objection Next is the report on foreign currency operations  Questions or comments?  That's the understatement of the day, if I must say so  Well, I want to come back to some of these questions later I think it's better to take them up later in the context of the whole policy problem But immediately, we intervened yesterday, as Sam said, and we may intervene today The market is still high Technically we have to approve yesterday's transactions    10/5/82  anyway So, do I have a motion to that effect?  SPEAKER(?) So moved  SPEAKER(?) Second  Without objection, it is approved As for the Mexican swap [drawing], whatever our "druthers," the situation is that I don't think they have any money to pay it off So, I don't think we have much alternative to rolling it over As I understand it, that doesn't take a Committee action but I think you should be informed If somebody wants to object, he or she can object, but the intention would be to roll that [drawing] over as it matures, noting that we still have first claim in effect on any Fund drawing that the Mexicans make, assuming they come to some conclusion with the Fund We'll consider that at the time But as to the immediate rollover, we can roll that over cooperatively since otherwise With that understanding, I think we can return to some of these other problems later in the midst of a more general discussion, as I said Mr Sternlight  Comments or questions?  Any other comments or questions? I might say that I think this surveillance business involves a moving target [if that] is the right term; we are feeling our way  We have to ratify the transactions  SPEAKER(?) So moved  Without objection, they are approved Mr Kichline  I'm inclined to suggest short comments or questions and we can return again to the general problem a little later  Mr Balles  Governor Wallich  The answer is he doesn't know  I heard a commentary on the radio when I got up this morning indicating that fuel is in ample supply for this winter season I don't know the survey, but what surprised me is that they said prices are going to be--I forget precisely what number they used--6 to 12 percent above last year That surprised me a little because I thought that oil prices had leveled off during this period  This was oil  Yes, it was about oil supplies  This was home heating fuel that they were talking about  This was a two sentence comment in the news They said they had done a little survey and stocks were ample People were going to have plenty of fuel this winter but the price was going to be 6 to 12 percent higher  I thought it had been level for a long while but it may be that it got back to where it was a year ago It surprised me that they were up that much in a year  Governor Partee  Yes, sir  I never figured out where that expansion [went] from the monetary expansion still earlier in the year  Mr Black  If no one else has an immediate comment, we'll turn to Mr Axilrod  We don't want to prejudge these things too hastily    10/5/82  Well, I might feel differently if I thought they had the same degree of credibility I don't think the staff is capable of making them with the same degree of credibility, however great that was, as last time  I think we may be getting a little ahead of ourselves in this  It doesn't make any difference where we put it  Yes, but I'm not sure it makes any difference analytically It makes a difference in the number, obviously But in either case we won't know what the heck the number means  I don't think you touched upon the problem that may begin in October  What's informed about it? Steve did a survey of four people all of whom are going to put it into M1, including himself!  It's a little late, I'm afraid  Mr Black, please  If we counted it in M1  Theoretically we could get an increase in M1, I guess, without counting it in M1 if it was so attractive that everybody went into NOW accounts for their basic account and got an automatic sweep arrangement into these new accounts We would get more increase in the below $5,000 portion of NOW accounts as a kind of tail on the dog of this new account  I don't know how we'd ever measure it  Yes The law says so There's very little left to decide on this I think the size of the check is the only thing that will be--  -11-    10/5/82  Well, yes and no is the answer, I think Obviously, we can study the matter I see no prospect that any amount of study is going to tell us what the behavior of M1 is going to be in the short run It is unknowable, in my opinion, to all the best brains in the world It's going to be an empirical question; we will discover what happens when it happens And we have to look at it over a period of time But I don't see that any amount of rumination--is that the right word?--is going to produce an answer to a knowable question but an unknowable answer The wish for a study is fine; but the sense that it's going to give us an answer in a month before we    10/5/82  get the new instrument I think is totally unwarranted just by the nature of the problem that we face  I don't think there's any question, however, that Roger is right The impact is going to be much less on M2 and M3 than on M1 The only place it can come out of basically is Treasury bills  We will get to the issue of what to do with M1 a little later, but I--  I think there will be a tendency among some to pay a money market funds rate plus; the question is whether the market gets driven there I'm just guessing Among other things, we approved what I think of as the "bucket shop relief regulation" at the last DIDC meeting, where an institution can broker all of this money So, we'll have people advertising all over the country These will be insured deposits and people will keep it with the guy paying the highest rate And that will tend to force the rates higher I would think there would be two tendencies initially To pay a money market funds rate plus, or to pay something related to the Treasury bill rate My guess would be that the bill rate fellows might get forced higher In a tight money situation, I would feel rather confident of that result With rates going down, if they are going    10/5/82  down, I think banks would be cautious But I think those will be the two polarities The question is where it will end up  If this had been done three months ago, I think it would have been an utter disaster It may just be a disaster now You know, I joke with the banks at times I tried it out with the banks this morning and they said fine; they haven't thought this out But I said that the simple way to do this and be perfectly consistent with the law is to say [to a depositor] "If you have a NOW account or a savings account [with a balance] above $5,000, it no longer has a ceiling rate and it's checkable" If a financial institution thinks of it in those terms, immediately that puts its cost of funds up by a significant amount I'm sure when they think about it, they won't want it that way It will take time for the savings depositors to pull out their money and go to the bank and say instead of my savings deposit, I want this new account Some of them will never get to the bank, so the banks will retain some of their savings deposits and NOW accounts by a kind of "discrimination by ignorance" approach And who knows how long that transition period will take!  I will mention one other aspect of this and then I want to go back to somewhat broader subjects If there is a big drain on money market funds, there probably will be a big drain on bank CDs Money market funds have become the major source of bank CDs for a group of major money market banks who are already in difficulty in the CD market And since I'm almost certain that bank CDs would be the favorite instrument for money market funds to cut back on now, there is going to be a squeeze [on] banks and possibly commercial paper; there will be a squeeze in the other direction, too, on banks that are not anticipating or have not thought through that particular consequence of re-intermediation  In any event, as a setting for reaching a policy decision or a broader discussion first, let me try what I might term from my international experience a tour d'horizon because I think we have a rather wider setting that has to be brought to bear [on our decision] A large part of that, of course, is the domestic business situation, which we've just gone over to some extent We can discuss it further but I don't have anything particular to add there We have been disappointed at least on the timing of the recovery The inflation picture is going well but the business picture certainly is not Everybody looks to the consumer I don't see any place else to look    10/5/82  Whether he will appear or not is necessarily in some doubt We have obvious pressures on the investment sector and the commercial building sector and the agricultural sector It's hard to see any of those pressures going away in any short period of time, and I have to agree with the conclusion stated earlier that the risks here, just looking at the domestic economy, are quite asymmetrical  But let me look around the world and say what somebody did mention--I guess, Sam Cross--right at the beginning We are in a worldwide recession I don't think there's any doubt about that Mr Truman's imagination may be larger than mine, but I don't know of any country of any consequence in the world that has an expansion going on And I can think of lots of them that have a real downturn going on Obviously, unemployment is at record levels It is rising virtually everyplace In fact, I can't think of a major country that is an exception to that There are particular sore spots in the developed world France is a leading example where they have tried to expand over the past year or more and they have been forced to reverse that They are in increasing trouble internationally, although it hasn't been the focus of the same attention that it has in some of the countries I will get to shortly But they have a rather massive current account deficit and heavy external borrowing needs They have come through a couple of devaluations with the question [remaining] of whether they can hold the franc at the current level The German situation is rather sour looking, with political uncertainties affecting that country and its prospects The British have had momentary signs of advance off and on for the last year but the latest signs are negative there as well Japan has caught a kind of sour despondency as well I mention all this because it does affect the prospects for our own outlook as well as the world outlook; there is obviously a feedback among all the world markets World trade is doing poorly and our exports are doing poorly It also contributes to a feeling of nervous uncertainty throughout the world And I think it all has had an influence on the exchange rate, the next subject I will get to  One can have different opinions about the exchange rate but I think it is an obvious fact that we have had a considerable narrowing of interest rate differentials in recent months and the dollar has gone up instead of down I saw a comment yesterday on the ticker from Jacques Delors, the French Finance Minister, who said that something has to be done because whatever news comes out of the United States the dollar goes up If it's good news, the dollar goes up; if it's bad news, the dollar goes up And that's about right these days It is very hard to argue that the dollar is not out of line, with very serious repercussions for our export industries I can't think of any advantage, really, to the rest of the world of our present situation, partly because it is obviously a factor inhibiting their own monetary policy flexibility The only explanation that one can see of the dollar's behavior in a very nervous and uncertain world where everything looks bad is that the dollar looks less bad for political and economic reasons and may even look good Maybe I ought to put a positive cast on that, but it is a situation that itself is an important distortion in world markets  When I look at developing countries, there are well known problems in Poland that have not been of largely political origin in the sense that Poland has very serious economic problems but they are    10/5/82  terribly complicated and sui generis in terms of the political problem There are other problems in Eastern Europe in that the Polish situation is to some degree infectious there The problems in Eastern Europe should be manageable in magnitude, but initially the throw-off from the Polish situation affected them and they are now being affected by the more general world situation More acutely, we have the situation in Latin America, which is an interesting panorama We have gone over the Mexican problem as nearly as I can see on the basis of inadequate information It may not be at dead center, but it seems to be at dead center for the moment That's the best guess that I have in a period of very difficult political transition, strong differences of opinion within Mexico about what to do and, in the best of circumstances, an extremely difficult adjustment problem within Mexico with important social and economic consequences Whether an orderly or halfway orderly solution to the Mexican problem, with its $80 billion--or probably realistically $100 billion--of external debt, can be foreseen in the next weeks or months is problematical I hope so, but I don't think anybody can bank a lot of money on that particular situation  When one looks elsewhere in Latin America, at the other end of the continent we have Argentina, which is basically unable to finance its needs in the markets and is in substantial arrears on its indebtedness The financial officials there are willing to go to the International Monetary Fund Fund negotiations are starting with rather an unknown situation as to whether Argentina has a government of sufficient strength to sign a reasonable Fund agreement even if they want to, or to carry out a Fund agreement if they do That is a situation that in some sense doesn't look unmanageable economically, but there is a question as to how manageable it is politically When one goes up in that continent, there is Ecuador, which may be facing an inability to service its debt in a matter of weeks We have Chile, which as nearly as I can see is unable to finance itself at the moment and is rapidly depleting its reserves; and at the rate of depletion of reserves one can perhaps measure their debt difficulties in a matter of months, if not weeks We have Bolivia, which has had chronic problems for years and is no better; it is basically in default Costa Rica is in the same position Peru is not much different And then we come to the strong countries in the continent like Brazil! That is another $80 billion debtor, which in my eyes has undertaken a strong adjustment program for the past 18 months, has had a recession, has had monetary restraint, and has attempted to get its budget in shape Their balance of payments deficit is as big today as it was when they started the program, reflecting in considerable part the sourness of the world economy Then of course we have Venezuela, the premier country in terms of financial strength of the continent It is a relatively small country with big oil reserves, but it also is apparently unable to finance itself freely in the market currently [despite] more substantial reserves; it is not an imminent problem in the same sense that the other countries are, but it is affected by the total situation Those countries have a collection of debt of what, Ted--about $300 billion more or less?--of which a sizable fraction is owed American banks But every big bank around the world is more or less equally committed All of these countries are dependent upon sustained borrowing to maintain a semblance of equilibrium during this period; indeed, all of them are dependent upon sustained borrowing simply to keep the loans that are now on the books in a semblance of good order    10/5/82  All of which brings me to the banking system We have had some rather well-known problems with respect to individual institutions, stemming largely from domestic concerns in the United States Those particular institutions have had financing difficulties in the market for some time They are basically unable or unwilling to sell any substantial amount of domestic CDs and are having their lines from other banks cut back in the day-to-day market There is concern, obviously, more generally about banks with large external exposure And when we talk about banks with large external exposures there are no exceptions among the major American banks or among a good many of the regional banks There has been a tendency quite clearly in this circumstance not to test the domestic CD market and a feeling that everybody could run to London for the money That [approach] is a little more anonymous; it isn't [unintelligible] futures markets, and what premium which bank is paying above the prevailing rate isn't gossiped about to quite the same extent as in the American market But it is quite apparent that the Eurodollar market is in a state of some confusion and concern One can see that specifically in the fact that the Eurodollar rates have a margin over domestic rates that is not explicable by normal arbitrage calculations between the two rates And we have a situation in the Euromarket, according to my understanding, that normal trading procedures--somewhat like in the US CD market--have now broken down Trading that used to be done more or less anonymously or indifferently among banks is now done on a personalized basis with each bank rated on its own and differential rates among particular participants, and there is a sense of a contracting market Whether it is really contracting ex post seems to be problematical The volume is probably going up because that is where the demand is going, but there is a sense of a contraction in credit I might say that it is complicated by the fact that some American banks that have liquidity problems have chosen to do placements in the Eurodollar market as obviously their only source of liquidity, so they're running them down  I think we have, as I mentioned, an unwillingness to put pressure on the CD market domestically not only by the particular banks that have been in everybody's mind but much more generally in recent weeks as the international problems have gotten more severe Tony mentioned earlier the particular problem that is beginning to stick out like a sore thumb with what I think of as motherless banks, by which I mean banks whose home country either doesn't exist in any real way or doesn't have any dollars or doesn't have any means of putting its hands on any dollars These banks are funded in dollars or other foreign currencies but largely in dollars Their assets are nominally in dollars but often are in effect in frozen form because they are backing a country--Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Korea-- that hasn't the money to make those debts liquid if they had to We have had further attention to this kind of problem from the Banco Ambrosiano affair where subsidiaries of a good--at least "good" in quotation marks--G-10 country were in the position of not having a mother, so to speak, because they operated through a subsidiary And when liquidity pressures began in that case, or when the bad loan became evident, there was no obvious recourse to provide liquidity to them  In these circumstances, I think it's fair to say that the rates of interest on government securities that we tend to look at very frequently are not a reflection of what the rates of interest are    10/5/82  in the market because the spreads are substantially wider even in the quoted rates both on government rates and private rates, reflecting a tiering of successive risks or precautionary premia There is the situation, for instance, in financing developing countries now where the CD rate is high relative to the bill rate by a considerable margin The Euro-rate is high relative to the CD rate These countries are financed at LIBOR plus a margin; those margins are increasing So by the time you go from the bill rate to what a foreign developing country actually is paying, there hasn't been a decline in interest rates; the decline observed in our market has only a pale reflection in the actual interest rates paid by those countries There is a sense, repeated to me again this morning by an ABA group that I had breakfast with--it's put quite openly on the table by some of the banks--that they are attempting to withdraw from international markets They say "We are doing our best to do so We realize everybody can't do that, but we have our boards of directors and that's what we are doing"  It was a group of ABA bankers, but that's incidental It is going on That is why all these South American countries together suddenly can't find financing or financing in anywhere near the volume that they were anticipating And to the extent that that financing demand is going on, that presses more and more on a relative handful of major money market banks that are already, of course, very heavily extended The extent to which this is going on in domestic markets is less clear, but I would sense that some of this atmosphere is developing in domestic markets In a sense that means that market rate quotations don't mean quite the same thing as they meant some months ago, because there's a question of who can get those rates and with what degree of aggressiveness All of this in a way, it seems to me, is explained in the velocity numbers There is a little liquidity preference or desire, or however you want to put it, which is why the relationships that we look at all the time between liquid asset totals and money narrowly or broadly [defined] do not seem to bear the same relationship to economic activity that we might have anticipated I find it difficult or impossible to explain that except, in part, because of a change in liquidity preference People want to be liquid; they want to hold as many liquid balances as they are permitted to hold and the constraining factor is how many of those are made available to them  I'd say all of this leads to a considerable feeling in financial markets and elsewhere of developing disarray, a certain floundering And that in itself contributes to uncertainty, which feeds upon itself And it is dangerous in and of itself I don't mean to suggest going back to point number one about the domestic outlook and saying that the prospects as a matter of probability aren't along the lines that Mr Kichline suggested Hopefully, as attitudes change, it could turn out to be significantly better than that But I do think we are in an extremely tricky period of transition that is complicated enormously by the factors not just of a period of potential transition for us, but for the world economy as a whole There is not a single source of real strength or certainty out there    10/5/82  So far as the international situation is concerned, let me just suggest that we sorely need a victory, or a series of victories, in terms of stability in some key countries We would like to have that in Mexico Whether that's possible or not I already expressed my uncertainty about If it's not going to be in Mexico, there had better be dikes built pretty promptly around some of these other countries so that there is not a feeling of absolute inevitability, which is developing rapidly in the market, that all of these countries are going to go down like a bunch of tenpins If we cannot deal with that prospect, we are going to be in sorry trouble indeed There are obvious cases in point; Yugoslavia and Argentina are both now in negotiation with the Fund Neither of those countries has [irreparable] economic conditions by any means, as nearly as I can understand it The amounts of money involved are relatively small but not exactly trivial in either case Right behind them is a country like Chile, and not very far behind that, of course, is the big one, Brazil I don't see how any of those situations, with the possible exception of Brazil and conceivably Chile--if the dikes are strong enough around Argentina and Yugoslavia--is going to be handled without Fund assistance and without further official assistance outside the Fund I think this is logically the Treasury's job Whether the logic is going to prevail in the end here is something that at some point we're going to have to consider, given the stakes involved  Domestically, I would simply say that I don't think this is any time for taking any great chances There is a substantive need for a relaxation of pressures in the private markets in the United States How best to achieve that seems to me is the question before the house I will cease and desist at this point I note that coffee is ready and maybe this is as good a time as any to have it  [Coffee break]  We can now have a general discussion At some point I will give you some directive language that is somewhat different [than shown in the draft provided by the staff] But before that, we can have a general discussion of the business scene, the international scene, or whatever I would like not to neglect the international situation with respect to some of these countries This is not a time, as I undoubtedly implied--that's a mild word--for business as usual, certainly, in the international area I don't think it's time for business as usual in the domestic area either Extraordinary things may have to be done We haven't had a parallel to this situation historically except to the extent 1929 was a parallel  And I might say that I commend you all I detected no leaks after the last meeting We are discussing obviously highly sensitive subjects in this particular meeting and I can't impress that too strongly upon you I'm talking about some of these international financial problems, especially their domestic ones Any one of these things can be blown by inadvertent comments There is discussion going on, particularly with respect to Argentina and Yugoslavia, of central banking monetary authority packages The  -19-    10/5/82  question is whether those packages are big enough for the situation in both cases As I said, they are in negotiation with the Fund Yugoslavia has been operating under a Fund program, but it's a rolling one-year [credit] The third year of it is under discussion at the moment These are in theory governmental matters and in our institutional structure more appropriate for the Exchange Stabilization Fund than for the Federal Reserve I think the Treasury would say that, too But they have concerns and limited amounts of money, and at some point I think it's possible that we will have to make a decision within the confines of this room as to whether we contribute to them too, simply in order to get the money big enough And that raises issues that we have not had to face before--except perhaps marginally in the case of Mexico I don't know if it's going to come up; I hope it doesn't My position is that it should not come up On the other hand, I cannot exclude it, given the nature of the problem  Well, with difficulty  Obviously, you give some sense of confidence as best you can  Let me say in that connection--and I should have said it more clearly before--that I think this situation is manageable In a very big sense, I think we are on the verge of victory in what we've been trying to do It's a delicate situation, but it's also a very risky situation  No, though it could turn into a Pyrrhic victory  But, in my opinion, it's only going to be manageable with unusual exertions And in the end I'm afraid this institution may be called upon for unusual exertion simply because there is no other in a comparable position It's the only possibility in terms of having the leadership and the resources necessary to deal with some of these problems I don't know whether we can [unintelligible] that issue But I think that is the nature of the problem  I think all of these problems in a considerable degree emerge out the inflationary situation most broadly --a decade or more of loose practices, if that's the right term Sooner or later Mexico was going to get in trouble They borrowed $20 billion last year And they borrowed heaven knows how many billions of dollars net this year when they still could borrow--before they got in trouble The timing of it is affected by recession, high interest rates, and all the rest But I think it's patently obvious that Mexico was going to borrow all it could borrow and all the banks were going to give them and at some point that was going to come to an end And it was going to be a crisis situation I think one can say that about most of these other countries So we may be talking about the timing, but we are not talking about the essence of the matter in that many of these countries, as are companies at home and banking practices at home, are on an unsustainable course We can't have a banking system that's totally loaned up to Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela, Argentina and Yugoslavia, but that's the direction they were going in And some day that had to stop  Yes, the current ones are under discussion with the BIS but there is the inherent management difficulty of these problems There are very substantive economic problems and, underneath that, social problems and political problems But from the management standpoint, the difficulty is that there are so many actors Mexico is the extreme case, but it's only a more extreme example of reality In Mexico, we are dealing with 1,100 banks or something like that When you're dealing with that many banks around the world, not just all over the United States but all over the world --and I mean banks you've never heard the name of in [Saudi] Arabia or the Far East or wherever--getting all those banks to sit in the canoe together is a little difficult The same problem exists when dealing with the BIS or in any cooperative international effort There are a lot of actors They don't all understand the problem in the same degree and they all see a little different self-interest in the situation I think almost all the central banks recognize some common interest in seeing an overall solution to the problem, but they have a lot of individual interests, too, and getting them all to negotiate together is difficult Everybody wants all the countries in; that's the tradition And we get into this ridiculous situation where a country that is putting in $12-1/2 million has the same voice as the United States does That's a bit of an exaggeration, but there is that kind of problem They are all dealing with their own institutional structure No central bank wants to touch these situations in the sense of a traditional central banking operation They all would take the same attitude that we probably would take It's a governmental problem And some of them have institutions to do it and some don't In virtually every case the central bank has more flexibility in the short run than the government; some governments have none Some central banks may not have any We have this kind of problem, of course The US government itself is like dealing with four different countries! But you multiply that and the difficulty becomes geometric, I guess, even when we're only dealing with 10 or 12 countries It's obviously important to get not just a facade but the reality of some international cooperation in these things--not just because of the money, which is significant, but because of the general  -21-    10/5/82  feeling of solidarity, a common problem, a common approach, and all the rest And the banks, of course, are distributed among all these countries, too, including some countries that are not involved, and we need the support of the central banks in dealing with their own banks  I agree with that; that's another way of saying the situation is manageable But they all do have very heavy debt burdens And it gets into political questions as well as economic questions at some point The country may say "Is it worthwhile to meet them?" whether they can or cannot theoretically [The problem] is exponential for some of them; they have gotten so deeply into debt But, of course, in that sense, there is no question that lower interest rates, to the extent that is reflected in their borrowing, are very important For a country like Mexico or Brazil their debt service--not their total debt service but their external interest payments for a year--are $10 billion plus  And their exports are $20 billion  I would not propose reducing interest rates simply as a method of getting their interest burden down It's a by-product there  Well, I don't know that I can give you an adequate answer I suppose the answer must be that it's going to be that much less than it would otherwise be  I think the more important thing would certainly be a sense that there is at least enough money to lend here, given the bank liquidity incentive that they don't have now  Well, I'm not disagreeing with the thrust of what you're saying That is very important in setting the climate of the whole thing But I don't think one can honestly say that some of these countries [around which] you could build a dike, are totally dependent on world economic conditions I think of Yugoslavia or Argentina in particular, where the balance of payments is not in that bad shape to start with Wheat is a big export in Argentina; that's not, I think, terribly sensitive to world economic conditions I don't mean to detract from your point about a climate of expansion; particularly for a country like Brazil, it's critically important But I don't think one can argue that we can't deal with a lot of these individual situations without an absolute necessity of having strong world economic expansion, although it obviously may [help]  I don't disagree with your basic comment  On a global basis I don't disagree with you  It's a nice semantic question, I guess, of whether the attitude has changed or whether the circumstances have changed We are certainly intervening  Not aggressively, no We have this not terribly aggressive [unintelligible] But I think the attitude to begin with is that there is a concern about this repetitive appreciation of the dollar and the dollar reaching levels that seem--  SPEAKER(?) Overdone  --unusual, overdone, or whatever the right word is So, there is a more sympathetic climate There is no great feeling, which I share, that this [intervention] is going to revolutionize the world in and of itself, by any means But that--  And at the very minimum that at least reduces the [tensions] in international relations at a time when we don't need any more  Yes, but I don't want to suggest that there is great eagerness to intervene It is a reluctant willingness  Not yet    10/5/82  I'm afraid that this [discussion] is getting a little ahead of us in some sense I don't know whether there are any policies that support it now There's something to Delors' statement that whatever happens, people want to go into dollars In the long run obviously one can change that, but whether or how changeable it is in the short run [involves] some fairly basic premises Germany may not be able to have a stable government because it is going to get polarized politically or the French may not be able to manage their internal situation or whatever other concerns there are in the exchange markets may change rapidly but are not amenable to obvious kinds of policy measures  There's no question that that thinking is widespread Somebody was telling me the other day, a member of an investment banking firm, that he had visited a number of companies and was struck by one fact These companies were in various businesses Obviously, everybody is affected by the business [situation] to a greater or lesser degree; these happened to be profitable companies And at company after company, they were all building up cash liquidity He was just amazed at the size of their cash balances    10/5/82  My mental image of the business world is that those that are profitable are sitting on cash Those that are not profitable are being squeezed  This isn't a comment that they are not experiencing malaise; their sitting on cash is an indication of a malaise  Of course, the discouraging thing is that their workers are out on strike I don't know what they're asking for, but--  I ran into a fellow the other day at dinner--unfortunately I think this is an atypical experience of a major multi-national company with a foreign base with a big US operation--and asked him how things were going and what his inflationary expectations were and what else was happening This guy is obviously quite conservative, but he said he had just come from a meeting of his American managers and the purpose of the meeting at least in part was to decide upon what he called "merit increases" next year It sounds like the Federal Reserve! He went around to the managers and asked them what they thought was appropriate for merit increases this year They all gave him figures of 10 to 12 percent, and according to him he started off by saying "Are you laying off workers?" And all the managers said "yes," they were laying employees off He suggested to them that merit increases this year should average 3 percent so long as they were laying off workers I said to him "Managers don't like to do that because it may affect their own salary scales What did you do about that?" He said "Oh, I forgot to tell you! I told them they were getting zero" Unfortunately he is a Frenchman, not an American I don't know how typical that is  Did you give him a lecture?  Catch-up for the executives right now  I think that's right  I think there's something to that Maybe we'll add that to our directive today [Unintelligible] salary surveys  -27-    10/5/82  I'm surprised it's so common in the financial world; they give the same kind of argument Well, what other general comments are there?  This situation is exposing, in my view, the structural weaknesses in the banking world of which these motherless banks are one example But this kind of thing is another that gets these small banks in that kind of a market The problems in the Eurodollar market to which I alluded are not confined to American banks by any means North of the border, they have had problems in spades domestically and that has not gone unnoticed in international markets, and one can make the same comments about some banks in other areas  If we are ready, I think we ought to return to the policy discussion The staff can distribute this draft text that I have for discussion purposes anyway I have not read [the directive] probably  -28    10/5/82  literally for years; I don't know whether I've read it since I've been here But for some reason I got this boilerplate part in front of me, which goes in front of the [operative part of the] directive, and it seems to me singularly inappropriate It probably always is, but it is more so now I think this could use a judicious sentence or two, making some allusion to the strains or pressures or whatever in the banking sector these days and to the problems of foreign lending in particular--it needs to be expressed very judiciously--just to indicate that we are someplace in the real world And I would suggest that it might possibly be left to the Chairman to figure out a sentence or two to stick in there at an appropriate point  Well, I'm not quite sure where I would put it  I'm talking about something called the general paragraphs  Well, I'm talking about the first two paragraphs I think [the additional sentences] would go appropriately either at the bottom of the first page or in the top paragraph on the second page I'd add just a sentence or two saying that the markets were influenced during this period by concern over international lending--something expressed very calmly, but not ignored entirely  You are ahead of us I'm just referring to this general boilerplate now, which I will cease talking about with the understanding that you may see a new sentence or two in there, if that's acceptable  Yes, I think-  -29-    10/5/82  No, but we can put in something like "The unemployment rate in August was unchanged at 98 percent but there were some indications of a deteriorating labor market situation"  We can do a little editing of the whole thing Everybody has a copy of this now, except for me I guess I will open this for a general discussion when you're ready  That's for the fourth quarter to the fourth quarter?  I don't know what the Act particularly requires, but if we change the annual target rather specifically, then I think we would report it I would not interpret this that way We said we would run around the top or were willing to run above for a while, and this is willing to run above for a while  I assume there will be some occasion, probably fairly soon, for describing in general terms what we are doing  Certainly before it's published  Long before it's published  Oh, I don't think there should be any implication here of more than a one-quarter problem It may be more than that, but this isn't meant to carry any implication of that But I would like to separate the substance from the presentation In substance what I feel very strongly about is that it would be a mistake to have any kind of directive that would drive us deliberately or otherwise to higher interest rates I think it was a mistake to have that kind of directive last time I think it would be more than a mistake this time, and it's not going to be acceptable to me Beyond that it is desirable to get some easing in this situation  Let me clarify my comment A 12 percent federal funds rate currently is totally unacceptable to me  Eleven percent is also unacceptable to me  The central point is that whatever the [monetary variable] is that we are operating on, it is a staff guess, which may or may not be right I'm saying that I am not willing to stake my life, so to speak, on that guess being right The risks are too great  I don't want to respond to the particular wording at this point Obviously, we have to get into that But what this is meant to convey is an operational approach that modestly moves the federal funds rate down Whether it involves a discount rate change or not is something the Board is going to have to decide But that is the tenor meant to be given here, rather straightforwardly, I might say  Yes, I am totally dissatisfied What we did last time was unacceptable to me I just want to make that plain I think we made a mistake last time I think we would not have so difficult a problem psychologically this time if we had not done what we did last time It wasn't that big a mistake in some sense But it's unfortunate that we ended up at this meeting with the federal funds rate and private rates about 1 percentage point higher than they were at the time of the last meeting because we had a high M1 figure in September That was the only reason it happened  I'm not going to cry over last month's decision All I'm saying is, looking ahead, that I don't want to end up a month from now with a 12 percent federal funds rate I don't even want to end up with an 11 percent federal funds rate, based upon    10/5/82  everything I know about the market situation, the national situation, and the world situation  I surely do not  Drive them down? I'd like to see them a little easier, yes, if we can get by with that  That's an enormous concession  We may have a $10 billion increase in M1 in the first week in October  Your vision of our integrity  We haven't suggested that we won't publish the number, Larry  That's right I think we probably have not adjusted for NOW accounts correctly The total growth in M1, almost, has been in NOW accounts this year To what extent does that reflect real money? Who knows?  Milton Friedman wrote a big book on the subject  It depends upon which analyst looks at it  Mr Guffey  I might remind you of the probable setting in the next few days Indications are that we will have a very sharp decline in the money supply for the last figure that means anything And we probably will have an unemployment rate well over 10 percent published this week  No, but that is the last number that will have no distortion from all savers certificates in it  We have to decide what to build the path on Mr Black  You won't find that quotation from me There was a quotation to that effect cited at this meeting before, which I must correct for the record I have said upon a number of occasions that the way we have lost this game is by staying with an expansionary policy too long during a recovery period That statement also says the mistakes were not made at the bottom of a recession  It's rather significant  Governor Gramley  Mr Corrigan  Governor Teeters  Governor Martin  Of course  This isn't the problem, I'm afraid Those figures may show a bulge and it may have nothing to do with pumping money into the economy It may show a bulge because $22 billion of all savers certificates are maturing, some of which are temporarily being lodged in M1 Now, what do you do with that figure?  Oh, I agree with that  Of course it will wash itself out That particular phenomenon will wash itself out in less than 60 days  But I don't know that for sure  No, I agree with that  We have to say something if we get a big figure in the first week of October We have to say that so far as we know that figure is an all savers phenomenon and we're not going to pay any attention to it or to the M1 figures in the immediate future  Governor Wallich  At the beginning of what sentence?  It could be up  Well--  Mr Boehne  Mr Balles, I have you on the list, but you have already commented Or do you have something more?  I have an open mind about that I didn't mean to infer one thing or the other; I don't know whether it's    10/5/82  necessary but I have no problem with it I do think it has to be a bit lower than we had before if we put it in  I don't have any problem with the traditional sentence  Mr Keehn  Governor Rice  Governor Partee  The existing phrase I would remind you says "The Committee also indicated it was tentatively planning"-- this is enshrined in our decision--"to continue the current ranges for 1983 but it will review the decision carefully in the light of developments over the remainder of 1982" That's not exactly the most ringing [endorsement]  Mr Boykin  Mr Guffey  I will respond to that shortly, after Mr Roos and Mr Morris get finished with their comments  Either order; I have Mr Roos first on my list  Mr Morris  I have a late starter, Mr Solomon  Well, let me make a few not so random comments Tony Solomon and others have referred to the role of the Chairman Let me just say in that connection that the Chairman is unable to explain and defend a policy he doesn't understand or agree with Larry Roos referred to the concern about the interpretation of recent policy and made a short but impassioned statement that we are seeing the results of ten to fifteen years of irresponsible monetary policies around the world I think there's a lot of substance to that I wouldn't narrow it to monetary policies I don't want to be associated particularly with that part, but I think what we are seeing is the culmination of ten or fifteen years or more of a set of attitudes and behavior that had to be changed And that is difficult, but we've seen some progress  I think we're also in a very critical period right now for all the reasons I suggested I don't myself perceive that the risks of misinterpretation are as great as some people think Obviously, they are there But I don't think many people, if you take this out of the election atmosphere, are going to interpret this as a cave-in, in and of itself Most people in the financial markets at least, to put it bluntly, think we've overstayed the course now It gets into this great question of credibility that I suppose we're taking rather personally At the risk of being misunderstood, following a mechanical operation because we think that's vital to credibility and driving the economy into the ground isn't exactly my version of how to maintain credibility over time Credibility in some sense is there to be spent when we think it's necessary to spend it and we can carry through a change in approach I don't think this is all as extreme as some have painted it But I don't think we're just dealing with the theory here We are dealing with a real world and assessing where the risks are It's quite clear in my mind where the risks are I think I made it quite clear in terms of economic developments around the world But if one wants to put it in terms of risk to the institution If we get this one wrong, we are going to have legislation next year without a doubt We may get it anyway It's a matter of judgment as to how that might come out and where the risks are, but I think I know where the risks are I'm not sure how it looks just in strict electoral terms, since that question has been raised, to sit here in some sense artificially doing nothing and then    10/5/82  have to make a big move right after the election I'm not sure that would wash very well in terms of anybody's opinion of our professional competence as an institution, if one were convinced that this [change was appropriate] Obviously, that depends upon the substance and how strong the case is for making a change at the moment I'd prefer that this problem didn't arise now If business conditions looked a little better and interest rates were a little lower--and I wouldn't care where the interest rates were if the economic situation looked a little better--and if we weren't going to have to deal with a succession of sick foreign countries in this time period, if the dollar were not rising into the wild blue yonder right now, and if I thought that all these accumulating problems that we face could wait for a while, we'd have a much easier decision Under present conditions, four weeks looks like one hell of a long time to me I don't know what is going to happen in a number of directions over the next four weeks  In terms of what specifically this means operationally, all I can give you is an opinion of what I had in mind in looking at this kind of language and putting a gloss on it The first paragraph is meant to say nothing more than that we don't know what M1 means over the next quarter for two reasons, period Therefore, since we don't know what it means, it seems a little fatuous to put down a number pretending we know what it means when we don't It is no special prejudice against M1 If we had some experience to measure what it meant during this kind of period, we would, but we don't  The first sentence in the second paragraph is basically meant to be the operational sentence I think that is fair It is meant to convey the impression that we seek some expansion, however measured, in the monetary aggregates and in reserves and it is meant to reflect and note some concern about what is going on in the private credit markets and that that will have a bearing on what we do I think that is understood or assumed by sophisticated people in the market, at the present time anyway They have assumed that we moved as alertly--if that's the right word--as we did during the summer because we were operating against the background of Penn Square and Drysdale and accumulating international problems This is in a sense a confession, good for the soul, in making that a little more explicit And it has some connotation without saying it directly that we certainly are concerned, among other indicators, about the pressures in those markets and what is going on in interest rates  The next sentence is meant to be a straightforward estimate of what we think and is put in there to show continuity with the present approach This is consistent with what we have been saying, anyway, about the measures that we think are the most reliable, not in any theoretical or long-term sense but during this particular quarter That is where we get the sense of continuity with the past and that is meant to illustrate or to make that point I might point out in that connection what somebody has already mentioned That in the near term, in fact, my guess is that M2 growth is going to be very low and that of M3 might be low, too My interest in that phenomenon is that I don't know what is causing it We had a very high rate of growth for a couple of months and it may just be a statistical thing It went up rapidly for a couple of months and now it is leveling off for a couple of months To the extent that it reflects some sense of tightness that we don't know we have--incomes going down or banks    10/5/82  can't finance themselves so readily--it's an indication that we are tighter than we think we are Now, I'm not adopting that theory But I just point out that in the very short run, before we meet next time, my guess would be that M2 and M3 are going to be low rather than high relative to these numbers And I don't think the numbers we put in there are terribly sensitive for that reason  As for the last two sentences, I'm inclined to think they're optional The flavor is this If they're helpful, put them in; if they're not helpful, take them out And I think it is somewhat optional whether we put in a range for the federal funds rate If we do, I'd make it, say, 7 to 10 percent As for what we would do operationally, and of course we'd have to discuss this a little more, I would propose that we drop the borrowing level To precisely what level, I'm not sure; $200 million seems to me the lower limit of what we would do; $300 million may be an appropriate number; one could argue for something slightly higher than that The borrowing figures are confused to the extent there is so-called special borrowing in any event And I don't know quite how to assess that It's like M1; there is no right answer on how to assess it precisely We can't escape that problem I don't have any particular interest rate in mind in setting forth this kind of directive I've expressed the opinion that I don't think we should create an atmosphere or the reality of rising interest rates, insofar as we can reasonably avoid that I'm not talking about every conceivable contingency that may arise in the real world But based upon what I know now, the implication of the borrowing level is that we would get a somewhat easier tendency in the federal funds rate in any event Where it really is would rest upon a discount rate decision and not this decision, I suspect, except within a very narrow range I do not mean to imply any feeling as to where interest rates should be a month from now Beyond what is implicit in what I've already said, if things look the way they do now, I wouldn't like to see an increase and I would feel more comfortable with some decrease But I haven't any particular target in mind The implication is that we would keep the borrowing level more or less the same until something happened to throw us off--in economic activity, in financial markets, or in the actual growth of M2 and M3 We would have to reconsider that in the light of all these factors, and consultation from time to time would probably be appropriate in those circumstances What else can I say to be more specific?  I think we would tend to have an easier funds rate than we had just recently if [the Board] did nothing on the discount rate If the discount rate were reduced, I think rates would go down Again, we have a setting here where these numbers, even when we have them on a preliminary basis, are about as reliable as I don't know what But over the course of the period that we're talking about here--in the next couple of weeks up until the Friday when the figure is published that will include a presumed distortion from all savers certificates--we may have an M1 figure that is on target in the latest weekly figure We probably will have an unemployment rate that is up significantly and an industrial production figure shortly--I don't    10/5/82  know when that comes out--that is down and, hopefully, a good price figure in there someplace, too I don't know what other critical numbers are coming out in the next ten days  Well, I don't know I don't have any particular guess We can turn to the staff We know that the unemployment claims figures have shot up enormously I think the general assumption is that it's going to be 10 percent plus, and I'm not sure that anybody can be much more specific than that  Well, I have a tentative date with the Business Council at the end of this week where I have to appear at a little press conference after I talk at any event So, that's the easiest occasion just because it's already scheduled and comes in the normal course of events and we don't have to make any big deal about it  What I might suggest, since it's 120 pm, is that people go out and get some sandwiches There may be some desire to discuss this further in substance And if there is going to be some effort to fool around with the language or drop sentences or whatever, it gives us fifteen minutes or so to think about it  [Lunch recess]  This need not be taken as strikingly as some people either fear or hope, depending upon which side of the spectrum they are on I don't consider anything in here very inconsistent with what we've been doing We have said we are going to interpret the aggregates somewhat loosely in effect--I'm now interpolating--in the light of our judgment as to whether there are unusual precautionary demands for money and liquidity The market has assumed we are operating that way quite comfortably and this is an extension of that idea What it does is to take out M1 for a very particular reason I raise the question because there is this talk about how to say it publicly If we write a letter to the Congress, for instance, and say we've changed the targets or we have some new operating approach or some such thing, I think that makes it much more grandiose than is intended in my mind I am reluctant to have a specially called press conference or a speech or something for the same reason It just makes it sound as if we're off on some entirely new course I think we have to get the message over publicly that, indeed, we're not going to be worried about the M1 figure in the short run, if we're not We have in effect said--and we are repeating and amplifying what we said--that we would tolerate for some period of time growth somewhat above the target range should unusual precautionary demands for money and liquidity be evident Going back to my testimony [in July], I know I had a lot of criteria--the performance of the economy, interest rates I deliberately put in, the availability of bank credit--all of which I said bear upon that  -53-    10/5/82  judgment That's what I said in the testimony We think, yes, all those things are operative now and we are willing to tolerate a bulge in the targeted growth if that is necessary in this time period It is precisely the circumstances that we foresaw as a possibility I don't think it's that big a deal Other people put other interpretations on it I just tell you that I don't think it has to be read as too big a deal In any event, assuming that we are in this general neighborhood, let us pin down the operations more specifically, which comes down pretty much to the initial borrowing level, I think We've had proposals from $200 [to $300] million and now we have proposals above $300 million, too  I don't think it's going to be $500 to 600 million What was it yesterday?  I may not be up-to-date on it We have more reserves in there than we should and deliberately haven't taken them out, given the market conditions so far this week We just leave them, I guess; I don't know what borrowings will be They can't be much below that, but the excess reserves may be very high  I don't think there is any mechanical relationship with these special borrowings I must say that is difficult to handle; the bank in the weakest position gets hit and the markets are a little tight If that bank didn't borrow, others would have to borrow, in part  Well, I think $400 million is too high myself  Let me get to the directive later  Well, how many like $200 million? How many like $300 million? How many like higher than $300 million?  I have determined that $300 million is the arithmetic average of--  Assuming somebody is going to vote for the directive, let's take that poll again  Are there other operational questions?  No, let's get to that as part of the directive  Yes In effect, we're in an area of judgment depending upon that happens to the aggregates and the economy and interest rates and so forth  Well, it's an interesting question if in fact [the M2 figures] run low for a month There are two possibilities, I suppose Let's assume they are running low but the evidence that we have currently is that it is a temporary phenomenon and [the rate of growth] doesn't look unreasonable for the quarter It is stated as a [rate for the] quarter Then, I would think we probably would not do too much If they are running low and we thought they were actually running below these figures, the implication is that interest rates will come down We would ease the position; that's what it says  What do you mean by "worsens"--that we would get really slower growth?  Well, I don't think the staff thinks so, but I would raise a very interesting question as to whether we haven't been too tight because higher interest rates bloomed--  Yes, but we don't have to say it Whether that is in or out, my interpretation would be that if [monetary growth] is running low, we are not going to be pushing terribly to get it up within a limited time but would go in the direction of easing  Well, as I say, we judge this in the light of what we think is going to happen in the future too  This is a matter of judgment I don't think we would ignore M1 either if we thought it was giving us some evidence A lot of things could happen with the all savers certificates Suppose, after all this talk about all savers blowing M1 up, that there's a relatively modest increase We have a big    10/5/82  decrease this week; suppose we get a relatively modest--say, an offsetting--increase the following week and then it falls down again the week after that I would say that's a pretty weak M1 and it would influence my judgment as to what to do, even though we're not following it in a mechanical way  Well, I think we would try to get some evidence from that as well as we can  Well, I don't know whether we can clarify that any further Let me just look at the first paragraph as a whole, which is meant just to be a straightforward--  Sure It's not my paragraph  Well, no  "Reinvestment of funds from"  I don't know what the best phrase is there  No, I don't think we're quite doing that  I just gave you my interpretation I would want to look at M1 for what information we can get from it What we are really saying here is that we don't want to pin a mechanical target on it or have a mechanical path for it I don't want to say much more than that really  I'm just starting the first paragraph  It sounds to my ear like less, but I--  "Much less than usual weight" is all right with me  You mean just an English problem  "Much smaller extent"  "These developments"  First of all, there's an interpretation of them--of what all the circumstances means In my mind that means the previous paragraph but more than that I assume that this mental image includes the discussion of all the economic problems, the international problems, and all of it This refers to everything But it's obviously not clear when it just sits there, and that raises the question of whether it should be more explicit or not  Just leave something like this  This wouldn't be put in as any echo of what happened earlier  Where are you going back to? I'm sorry, I just don't know where you are  Well, there would be a little more emphasis earlier Obviously, that phrase is a term of art What it is meant to refer to is the fact we have some pressures in private markets that aren't necessarily apparent on the surface because of all this disturbance in the financial system and we are aware of it and concerned about it And we take that into account in the--  Well, I think one can interpret it either way The reason we're concerned about this is because of the economy But it also works in reverse The economy, and the international economy in particular, is giving rise to the pressures But we're concerned about the pressures because of economic conditions So, I think it works both ways  But we always want an orderly and sustained flow of money and credit  I'm not sure I like it terribly, but at the risk of making the whole thing more cumbersome we can put "In all the circumstances the Committee seeks to maintain expansion in bank reserves needed for an orderly and sustained flow of money and creditconsistent with growth of M2 and M3 in a rangeand taking account" If we want to blur it a bit, we could say "taking account of the evidence of pressures in private credit markets in the light of current economic conditions It combines the sentences  They could  Yes, there could be some transfer out of Treasury bills or other highly liquid instruments, particularly if they pay a higher rate than Treasury bills  Well, one way to do it is just to say "in all the uncertainty" and leave the other wording as it is  Yes Just leave the first phrase as it is through money and credit comma, then "consistent with growth of M2 and M3 in a range of around 8-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent at an annual rate from September to December and taking account of the desirability of somewhat reduced pressures in private credit markets in the light of current economic conditions"  You're in the next sentence Well, tentatively that first sentence is all right Then there are all sorts of suggestions about these last two sentences and whether to leave them in or take them out I don't think it's too critical one way or the other if we understand the thrust of what it's all about  You had a suggested rewording in that last sentence which I didn't think changed it much substantively but made it read better  Yes, that's what I was looking for  Yes I think it's all right the way it is, if I understand this correctly "In the light of evidence that economic and financial uncertainties are continuing" We leave that open as to whether it is continuing That does say they have happened in the past, which I have said  The last month's number?  But not the previous two months  Well, I'm not sure that's right Their velocity is rising  Falling, I'm sorry Changing, anyway!  Well, I'm not so sure this is any big deal, I'm not quite sure what you had, Henry, but let's change it "In the light of evidence that economic and financial uncertainties are leading to" That puts it in the future  Not the second one It doesn't say lower; it just says they wouldn't be as high as they otherwise would be  No, no I think that's unclear yet, [though they are] easier than they otherwise would be The first sentence says interest rates would be going down and the second sentence presumably says they wouldn't be  Than we would otherwise have, but higher than--  No, the thrust of the second sentence is not for easier conditions in the market  No, there is nothing in the second sentence that says the more rapid the growth the lower the interest rate will be  It [needs] something a little less awkward but "in the presence of" sounds like the presence of a--  -65-    10/5/82  Maybe everybody is going to vote for it! "Should economic and financial uncertainties lead to exceptional liquidity demands, somewhat more rapid" Is that what we're saying?  Actually, that previous sentence almost goes without saying and I don't know whether that's necessary  Okay What about the federal funds rate sentence? In or out?  As we're meeting here, the federal funds rate is roughly 10-1/2 percent I guess I don't have any problem with leaving in the sentence if you want to and saying 7 to 10-1/2 percent  No, I really--  Well, there are arguments on both sides I don't feel strongly at all Leave it out?  SPEAKER(?) Put it in  SPEAKER(?) Leave it out  They won't know By the time this comes out, we may have the same level or a different level  How many want it in? How many want it out? A lot of people are indifferent  How many are indifferent?  I guess I'd prefer slightly to leave it in No big deal Okay, I guess that's it Any other comments?  That's what I guess is in  It's where it is; that's all We will have a consultation if it goes above where it is now That is what we are saying  Okay Let's vote  Okay, is that the end of our business?  November 16 is the next meeting date  END OF MEETING  -70-       We have a number of things to deal with apart from policy today I am distressed about what happened after the last meeting, as you well know, and I am distressed by the actions that had to be taken for this meeting We will return to that subject after we complete the policy discussion But I think the procedure [regarding limited attendance during the Committee's discussion of monetary policy at] this meeting has been outlined to you Now we need to deal with the minutes  Without objection, we will approve the minutes Next we have the report of examinations, which has been distributed to you Do I hear any questions?  If there are no questions, we can have a motion to accept it  It has been moved and seconded and without objection [it is approved] We will go to Mr Cross  Questions or discussion?  Well, we could put them in default Do we have a motion on the recommendations [for renewal of all the swap lines for one year and renewal of the drawings by the Bank of Mexico for three months]?  SPEAKER(?) So moved  It has been moved Without objection, we will approve that No other commentary? We will go to domestic open market operations  Oh, we have to ratify the [foreign currency] operations  Probably it will all reverse itself very suddenly and give us another problem Mr Sternlight  Questions? Discussion?  I don't know what you have in mind  It might as well be raised here  Do you want to make any comment, Mr Axilrod?  Let me just make a couple of comments I don't think there's any question that the mechanism creeps when it is adapted to this purpose I would not overestimate the precision of our control technique on M1 either, but there is no doubt that it looks more strained when we are doing it this way I was going to mention later, but I will just mention it now, that we will have a paper prepared for the Committee looking toward the targets for next year It will not be primarily on the control mechanism, although it may get into that It seems to me almost certain now that [as a result of DIDC actions] we shortly will have a full transactions account with a market rate of interest We are very close to that now anyway, and we'll have another account We may have very close to transactions accounts without any reserve requirements on them We virtually have that now It raises all kinds of questions both about the impact this will have on differential growth among the aggregates and even total growth of the aggregates during some perhaps lengthy transitional period And it also has a bearing on the control mechanism I don't think we can solve those problems today; I'm sure we can't But we can get this paper prepared well before the meeting at which we have to set targets for next year We will get it distributed before the meeting and have a discussion then; I don't think we will resolve it then but we ought to be in a better position for resolving it at the following meeting  I've been assuming we will put them in M2 and it probably is premature to say that It's a very ambiguous account Beyond that, I don't know when it will be introduced But there is a meeting of the DIDC not very far off--in three weeks or something like that I don't know whether the DIDC will approve what in effect will be a lifting of the interest rate ceiling on NOW accounts, but I think it will go a long distance toward that In two or three months prospectively, I think we will have that This thing is so much like a transactions account now If banks use it as a sweep account--it's not quite clear that they will--it's on the margin there If it were any more liberal than it is, they would certainly use it as a sweep account and I don't know how one would distinguish it from a transactions account I'm not sure we'd stop short of that margin  That may be reversed, but that's the way it is now--[unlimited] telephone transfers into one's own checking account  Well, a personal visit was always allowed    11/16/82  That decision will [be reviewed] One of the people who voted for it immediately wanted to change his mind after the meeting and he was not allowed to change his vote So, it may be reversed in a subsequent meeting But that bears upon how transaction-like it is, of course  It must have been, because the one vote would have swung it Now, we still have a decision to make on that, frankly According to our present rules, an account of that sort will have a reserve requirement I think that is correct And if we just keep the reserve requirement on it, I presume that banks will not offer that service I doubt it would be worth it, in terms of paying the 12 percent reserve requirement  Well, "We don't look at M1" is a little strong  Well, that's right But let's see where we want to go from the preliminary paper I think we're going to get it done by the next meeting We can't be too cumbersome at this point, but any Reserve Bank that wants to contribute should be in touch with Mr Axilrod He has already been in touch with some people at the Reserve Banks  The first focus is on which aggregates [to target] and how to interpret the aggregates And that is partly--I suppose entirely in some sense--because M1 has problems at the moment that are looked at as a transitional thing But it's very easy to get into a more general discussion, starting with a transitional problem, particularly when whatever else happens to M1, it looks as if there is going to be interest paid on it, which is going to change its behavior soon  We need to ratify the transactions, and Mr Sternlight made a recommendation to you  SPEAKER(?) I move approval  Well, I don't think this is the most vital issue of the day If there is a lot of discomfort about doing it today, it will be done presumably on Thursday or Friday  If that makes people feel more comfortable, we can do that  Do we have a motion?  I wasn't sure what that motion was  Well, we also have to ratify the transactions and I didn't ask anyone for--  Any objections?  I don't think we really want a vote appearing in the record that we voted on a particular operation and had an objection If you want to persist in your objection, I think we ought to defer the whole thing  The action has nothing to do with coupons; it's just to increase the limit  SEVERAL That's right  We also need a motion to ratify the transactions  SPEAKER(?) So moved  SPEAKER(?) Second  [Approved] Mr Kichline  Why don't we just go on to Mr Truman and get the complete picture  Well, I won't describe the picture domestically and internationally but open it to discussion  Who sees the recovery beginning?  SPEAKER(?) Beginning?  SPEAKER(?) Some flurries  Let me ask the question the other way in the interest of even-handedness Who sees a continuing momentum of decline?  We'll come back to you in a second  -12-    11/16/82  Governor Martin  -13-    11/16/82  Mr Guffey  Mr Balles  Mr Keehn  Mr Boykin  There is a lovely countryside  People aren't buying; they're looking  Mr Ford  Mr Solomon  Are you recommending it?  Mr Roos  Ms Horn  I'd say that you weren't talking to the New York bankers  We can turn to Mr Axilrod  Well, we have to come down to making a decision The assumption of the Bluebook is that we will keep the same general framework we had last time I thought this [distortion in] M1 from the all savers certificates would sort itself out by this time I'm not sure that it has; it appears that it has not We still have that problem A much more fundamental problem, implicit or explicit in the earlier conversation, is that the business situation doesn't look red hot It has a lot of international complications And, certainly, the relationships between the money figures and the economy have run way off the postwar track We may be ending up with a tighter policy than we intended for that reason and not because we let [the aggregates] run above track That's a judgment that has to be made Without any question, they are off track; and whether they are going to return to track in the foreseeable future is a matter of faith It doesn't surprise me, particularly, that they are off track now, but one can't judge the amount I'm not so sure if we're really going to disinflate We have all kinds of institutional problems with M1, but extracting from the institutional problems I think the basic trend in velocity might change I've said that before, but I can't prove it It certainly has changed in the short run and I'm not sure why I would think that the basic trend in M2 and M3 ought to change But that's really a problem for next year and not for next month It's just a matter of judgment how much we allow for these liquidity pressures, and I suppose that gets mixed up in interest rate judgments Who would like to approach the problem? Mr Boehne  Mr Morris  I will be making a little speech tonight Mr Roos  Are you talking about 1983?  Mr Guffey  I don't think that's quite accurate, Roger, if I may interject Speaking for myself, I would have lower interest rates if these aggregates weren't rising so darn [fast]  It's not exactly what I would target  Mrs Teeters  Let me just say a couple of words about the international situation We have an IMF agreement--letters of intent anyway--with Mexico and Argentina Their problems are far from being solved, but that's a very important step Mexico still doesn't have much money and their economy is winding down for lack of imports and other things There is going to have to be a big negotiation with the banks to get them to put up some credit I don't anticipate that we will be asked to do anything more but it's not inconceivable [that we may be asked] I just don't know how much [it might be] in the short run The US government is certainly going to be asked to do something on Argentina I don't think it necessarily is going to involve the Federal Reserve I have taken the opposite view It's a very complicated situation It depends upon what kind of security arrangements can be developed and it depends upon whether any foreign central banks will join in It's in a state of being unresolved  As for the Brazilian situation, they had their election yesterday I don't know what happened It probably will take them a week to count their votes, but at least they have that behind them They may have special vote-counting techniques for all I know  That comment doesn't go in this report  My only point is that it may clear the way for a more open discussion of the Brazilian problem There was an article in The New York Times a day or two ago, which you may have seen, that is fairly accurate That is going to burst upon the world's consciousness a little more fully in the next few days The Treasury has provided $500 million to Brazil already and probably will do another $200 to $300 million very shortly just to keep them afloat until the timing is right for them to go to the Fund and try to deal with the problem more openly, which is certainly going to have to be done It is still a very uneasy situation The IMF negotiations, on the other hand, are being speeded up, and that should be of some assistance I think that will be resolved in the next month or so in terms of enlarging quotas in the special fund I interject that because it arose in a couple of comments Mr Gramley  -24-    11/16/82  Mr Keehn  The consensus is mostly among non-voting members  Mr Solomon  Why don't we defer that question until we get into an elaboration and just get the general views now Governor Wallich  Mr Corrigan  Mrs Horn  My comment was a casual one, not an analytic one, but I will try to make a more analytic comment I just meant to say that if I were plucking an interest rate out of the air, I'd pick a lower one if I weren't constrained by worrying about how fast the aggregates were growing I don't know how responsive I can be to your question Somebody--I guess it was Frank Morris--said that there may be a perversity in the aggregates' growth at the moment I think we do know at the moment, whatever it means for the future, that there has been an increase in liquidity preference It almost seems to me tautological that we would get a decline in [velocity] of the kind we got People want to hold more money; they want to hold more M2 and more M1 relative to economic activity And it has persisted long enough so that it has been of some cyclical significance What motivates that? Well, Steve gave a complicated explanation, which I'm  -28-    11/16/82  not sure I followed entirely, about the differences between liquidity preference and spending preference or whatever I'm sure it was analytically all brilliant But there is some element of uncertainty here People want to be more liquid but that is something I can't measure To the extent that is true, I don't think it's inconceivable that if people had more confidence and saw the economy growing, at any given level of interest rates we would get less growth in the aggregates because they might invest in stocks, for instance, or put more in bonds, or lengthen maturities, etc People would begin to look at assets that are outside these very liquid assets I guess that's what Frank may have had in mind in part I don't think it's the interest rate itself so much as a general feeling about the economy, which may be tied into interest rates It isn't 100 percent certain, but if over a period of time--I'm not talking just about the next month--we got a different set of economic expectations, we might find these aggregates growing more slowly rather than more rapidly simply because of a return of confidence One could argue--I don't know how far I'd want to carry this argument--that by taking a chance in the short run and departing from the usual analysis or the usual expectation of the way these things work that we might end up with lower growth in the aggregates than we would expect if indeed there were a change in the atmosphere and people had some confidence in the economy looking out three or four months ahead But I can't prove that  Well, I can imagine it, yes Things could just get better at current interest rates What I'm saying is that if we chose to be more liberal on the reserve-supplying side in the short run, though this analysis suggests that that would produce higher aggregates we might be pleasantly surprised over a few months and find that it didn't work that way Nobody will ever know because we won't know what would have happened if we had done the opposite But the differences in these aggregates projections are so small; they are well within the range of our capacity to foresee developments, within a month anyway  Yes, [though] we may be in an impossible situation The economy does not always develop in a way that there are any answers except after the passage of longer periods of time than we are thinking about And I think that is a danger That's why I pay some attention to these aggregates What we have to balance is how much we think we can get away with, even if we recognize the dangers in the business situation and want to get interest rates lower Even if we think that's where the balance of the risks is, we can't throw discretion to the winds for the reason you are suggesting Where is that balance? I think that's what we are talking about I think one would have to conclude from what has happened in the market that people haven't been that upset by what they've seen so far I don't have the figures right in front of me but in fact the surprising    11/16/82  thing is that while Treasury bill rates and the funds rate are [not much] lower than they were in early September, CD rates and private rates are And bond rates are way down, which seems to be the inverse of what you would worry about if there were, at this point anyway, a great fear about what the monetary expansion was doing to us Now, there are obviously anticipatory effects, but that is roughly right, is it not, Mr Axilrod?  Once we get out in the maturity range, including as short as 6 months, rates came down [more]  Well, that's the judgment we have to make The biggest protection we have against that is that things have changed I suppose what the market is telling us is that people are not going to get worried about that when they have a sense that the economy, if anything, is still declining That raises the question of what will happen as soon as they get a sense that the economy may be in recovery; but we've got to get to the recovery first Everything else is just an extreme example of what we are doing, which is balancing risks If we had a clear answer, it would be easy to dump it into Mr Axilrod's computer and he would tell us But I don't think his computer is that good  Well, they have seen what is going on But what I am saying explicitly in answer to Mrs Horn's question is that I do not discount the possibility that with a feeling of economic recovery we could get a very rapid reversal of this velocity movement in M2 I wouldn't be so certain about M1 I think M1 is just [in a whirl] with interest being paid on it and a change in inflationary expectations and all the rest, so I don't have the same feeling about M1 But for M2 it's a little hard to see why the velocity should go down indefinitely--why people should change permanently the relationship between their liquid asset holdings and income One could argue, I suppose, that institutional competition has made those instruments so much more relatively attractive than they used to be that we have had a structural shift in terms of how much of that kind of money people want to hold as opposed to stocks, bonds, or whatever else they can hold their money in  Maybe I wouldn't dismiss it The interesting thing is that M2 really hasn't budged for three years in terms of its growth rate, including this year It has been practically the same every year while the economy is going up and down and generally trending lower in terms of inflation and in growth We have had some tendencies toward a decrease in velocity for some time, although it has only been this year that it has become really pronounced So, maybe there is a structural change here  It is rather interesting Nothing could have been much steadier than the growth in M2 over the past three years while all this other stuff has been going on  We keep the target the same and only slightly overrun it One would certainly think, given that inflation is down, real growth is down, and nominal GNP is down, that if M2 growth remains at the same rate, obviously something structural is going on But this year it must be something cyclical, too I don't know whether that helps you You pay your money and take your choice! It comes down to balancing out, as so many people have said, the need for providing some protection on the down side, so to speak, against the danger that it's possible to overdo it, as Larry Roos keeps reminding us The way to reach that judgment is what we're trying to do today Governor Rice  And if all these other assumptions are correct  Mr Ford  Governor Partee  Governor Martin  -34-    11/16/82  Mr Balles  -35-    11/16/82  Mr Black  Mr Boykin  Well, let me make a couple of additional comments I gave you a finely balanced statement of pros and cons before, I suppose I have no doubt in my mind that we've had a change in liquidity preference The argument is over how long that will last, but it has lasted for five quarters Well, I don't know if one can say it has lasted for five quarters; the numbers always have bumps up and down in a quarterly series But when velocity has declined for five [successive] quarters for the first time in the postwar period, something is different  Mr Axilrod told me it was five  He's projecting this quarter  He went backwards only with quarterly figures I used to watch velocity figures in the '50s and I will tell you they were rising, because I used to write stories about the belief  -37-    11/16/82  that they had risen so much they had to stop rising And they've risen every year since then!  That shows you how great an expert I am on velocity! I remind you of Milton Friedman who, looking at a hundred years, wrote his book and said that velocity will always fall Money is a luxury good and the most certain thing about monetary policy is that velocity is going to fall Like all scholars he has caught up I used to write internal memoranda; he had to get a book published By the time the book came out velocity was already rising and it has risen every year since then, until last year I think something is going on there; that is the only point I'm making I have no doubts about that, but that doesn't tell you how long it will last  In terms of the business situation, and putting the international dimension into it--I'm not thinking just of the financial strains, though they are very real--we have a world in recession the way we have never had it before And now we have additional deflationary pressures rising in a developing world that are very strong and certain There's no escaping them In talking to my foreign central banking colleagues, which I have done a bit recently, they are approaching the stage of being--if I wasn't going to be recorded, I would say frantic Discomfited, maybe, is the better word There is virtually a unanimous feeling that some efforts ought to be marshaled to push--if that's not too strong a word-- interest rates 2 percentage points lower I don't share that feeling, but I cite it as a symptom of the atmosphere in the rest of the industrialized world based upon their observations and their appraisal of the prospects in their own economies They may all be wrong The picture is very sluggish and I think the risks are on both sides, but predominantly on the down side  For better or worse, we're faced with an indefinite period that we are not going to be able to figure out M1 just purely for institutional reasons I think there is a case to be made that it was the most reliable variable in the past, but I don't think that case can be made looking into the future simply because of the institutional changes, even abstracting from the issue of whether there has been any basic change in velocity on an unchanged concept of M1 We are not going to have an unchanged concept of M1 I think we have to hedge the risks a bit; it's a question of to what degree  That brings us to the specifics I think we have a choice, given where the weight of opinion lies Mr Solomon long ago suggested that we stick with the 9-1/2 percent [for M2 growth], which is within the range that we had last time We could eliminate the 8-1/2 percent side of it, if I followed him correctly There's quite a lot of feeling that we ought to reduce the borrowing level, starting off anyway That is a feeling I share and it is the principal hedge that I would recommend  I don't know where it is now, frankly, but we have had various proposals $150 million is the lowest one I see in my notes; more people mentioned $200 or $250 million; and the  -38-    11/16/82  highest was $300 million among those who in general wanted to make it a little lower Some people may not want to make it lower  There's no question about that To put a number on the table--it is around the midpoint of what a number of people suggested and leans [in the direction favored by] those who wanted to hedge the bets this way--I'll say $250 million  No, I assumed the 9-1/2 percent meant September to December  SPEAKER(?) Right  For the lower--  I can't find [my copy of] the directive  That is not true We increased it--in a muted way, I think it's fair to say--but we increased it from the way we [started out]  Well, virtually unaffected pushed the funds rate up and stopped the interest rate decline and reversed the stock market  The stock market is way down today  SPEAKER(?) It was against inflated expectations But there certainly has been a trend in recent weeks toward a firmer tone rather than the reverse It is quite noticeable in the market  Well, all those federal funds ranges encompass anything I could see happening, so I don't feel terribly sensitive to it I'd say it's at least time to knock the 1/2 off the 10-1/2 percent  I personally don't have any big problem with that, but with the present situation we aren't going to get down to 6 percent, given anything I see developing Maybe we should, but we aren't  We're considerably closer to 10 percent than we are [to 6 percent]  Where the range is now  Well, I assume more specifically that the funds rate is going to be within range of wherever the discount rate is What is going to happen--  Going back to what I said earlier, if I were picking interest rates out of the air, I'd make them lower So, I have some predisposition in that direction Whether we have the stage set for it properly against all these other considerations, I don't know But I wouldn't let a good opportunity pass  Personally--I can't defend this very strongly, but just as a matter of tactics--I'd rather have the discount rate down and the borrowings higher, for any given constellation of forces I feel a little more comfortable when the banks have to borrow a little  The trouble with that is that it gets too fancy and is hard to explain We'd have to face the fact that we would reduce the discount rate [without] a clear signal from the market But I wouldn't be unhappy to end up in that position somehow  I think the crucial point is where we start the borrowing Frankly, I wouldn't put it above $250 million I wouldn't be unhappy to go lower than that, the way I see things  I suppose I am affected by believing that in the short run the economy is still declining and industrial production is going to be down in November Maybe I'm all wet there  I really cannot over-emphasize the extent to which my foreign brethren feel strongly about this I don't care how conservative the central banks are, they are all in that direction and very strongly I also do think that the current level of the dollar is catastrophic As surely as we are sitting here, it's not only depressing the economy today but it is going to turn We talk about the kind of current account deficits that are projected I find them almost unbelievable because I don't know how we would finance them We are going to be in Mexico's situation The implication is that we are going to have a declining dollar and expect to raise $50 billion in capital abroad Well, who is going to put money into the dollar when they sense it is on a down trend?  Well, we can do the Carter bonds once the dollar has dropped by 30 percent That atmosphere is going to be awful if it develops  If the discount rate were reduced, I think we would have to explain it as a straightforward concern about the economy and, in part, the dollar  We are not going to be left alone in any interest rate decline that develops here And, of course, that's one of the reasons the exchange rate stays so high I guess Ted or somebody mentioned that there is--  And maybe more than that  I'm repeating myself, but there is a deep degree of depression and feeling of disturbance in every other industrialized country  Oh, it would take the edge off the federal funds rate, presumably It may not right away; we're going to publish a high borrowing figure this week, but I presume the funds rate--  Yes, and I think this might be consistent with the funds rate going slightly below the discount rate It has been below it for months It does not imply a change from where interest rates have been for the last month, in my opinion That in itself [would require] a reduction in the discount rate Even then I'm not sure it's a lot  Well, I think we would tell them that we don't like to see them going that way  It's a more difficult decision  Let me sum up my own view another way I think this general pattern is acceptable It is playing it very close to the vest, considering what I see going on The risks are unbalanced but they are on both sides The risk is that this is not enough  One way of looking at it, I think, is that what we have been doing for some time is letting these aggregates run a little high because we recognize that there are liquidity pressures and we haven't wanted to move strongly against that We haven't been very forward in pushing them higher If we really felt that liquidity was changing and the market was terribly sour and it was going to last for a while, we would take that additional step and push them higher  -44    11/16/82  We haven't done that and I don't think what we're proposing does that; one might argue that "A" verges on that If it turns out that velocity keeps declining, we should have done that  It's easier to communicate the sourer the economy, I can tell you that  I don't discount that [scenario] entirely It is complicated by the budgetary situation I don't know that it would happen as soon as this spring, but I think it is possible As I said before, we will not find this particular monetary growth [pattern] again I don't know what M1 is going to look like then I'm not sure we're going to find M2 all that rapid in those circumstances, but we'll have to wait and see  I'm not so sure what would happen with reducing the discount rate by 1/2 point They have all been expecting it and for that reason it may have very little impact  Well, let's just see where we stand Looking back at the directive, if I can find it, what I suggested and others have suggested is to put in 9-1/2 percent [for M2], which is within the range that we had but it looks a little easier We can put the funds range at 6 to 10 percent if that's where the--  Well, we could say "around"  I don't know about that phrase, just in terms of its internal consistency, "taking account of the desirability of somewhat reduced pressures in private credit markets" I'm not sure we're saying that this is going to produce in and of itself lower interest rates We might just leave that phrase out  Actually, the private credit markets, as distinct from the public credit markets, have improved during this period This great tiering and backing up tendency we had in those markets is not evident today  Well, does this suit, as well as anything is going to suit?  Let me just raise a question Why do we need this paragraph at all now? We needed it the last time to explain  -47-    11/16/82  what we were doing Would we lose anything by just dropping the whole paragraph?  Well, presumably we will say something about this in the [policy record] discussion But is there any operative need to put it in the directive at this point?  The only significance of taking it out-- maybe it is too much--is that it says "much less weight" The fact is that it has some weight If M1 had happened to be dropping off the table in the last couple of weeks, we would have behaved somewhat differently If we leave it out completely, we lose any flavor of that  I'm not quite sure what your particular suggestion is, John  Suppose we leave it the way it is now and just say the difficulties of interpretation of M1 continue to suggest that less weight--I don't care whether we say "much less" or "less than usual"--is being placed on movements in that aggregate during the current quarter And we can forget about that M2 sentence, if that's troublesome  Well, that's a bit of an overstatement of my feelings at the moment I'm not saying never; never is much too long a period The question is how soon we are going to be able to make some sense out of it, which is really the subject of this paper we are going to get next time I wouldn't be too sweeping about any judgment until we have had a chance to consider that explicitly  Yes, I know What I'm concerned about is what we specify next year, because I anticipate that probably by some time next year we will have full interest payments on transaction accounts at least of individuals I think we are hanging by a thread, frankly, in terms of having reserve requirements on individual transaction accounts at this point The new account is so close to it that I can see the lobbyists saying we have this account, which is practically a transaction account without reserve requirements, and you can't go back and put reserve requirements on something that is only marginally different from what Congress just told you to give us without a reserve requirement  -49-    11/16/82  This new account, depending on how it's developed, is going to be so close to a transaction account that maybe we ought to put it in M1  I would be inclined, in the interest of completing this [discussion], to modify this language to a more minimal degree I'd say "considerable" or something like that instead of "unusually great" The second comment is not a sentence is it?  I'm looking at the present one  I have done a great sample of two people who had all savers certificates I was not making the survey, but much to my surprise in my sample of two both put the funds in demand deposits and still have it there One of them is my wife The other is a distinguished ex-member of the Federal Reserve Board  I have it left alone in my present version All I have is "Specification of the behavior of M1 over the balance of the year remains subject to considerable uncertainty" I think that's singular--["uncertainty" rather than "uncertainties"]  "Substantial uncertainty," I think  -50-  It says "remains" "Subject to substantial" is it?  "substantial uncertainty because of special circumstances in connection with the reinvestment of funds from maturing all savers certificates and the public's response to new accounts directly competitive with money market funds mandated by recent legislation The probable difficulties in interpretation of M1 continue to suggest that much less than usual weight be placed"  Yes  No, I meant to leave out "probable" Well, unless there are some other proposals on main points, we are talking about 9-1/2 percent, 6 to 10 percent, and $250 million Any comments? If not, we will vote  Okay I have a few things I have to do We have to discuss a couple of things  I guess we better discuss that while we are in this limited session It occurs to me that I have a speech to give tonight, unfortunately Let me just read what I have here; I don't know whether I have to alter anything Frankly, I think we ought to say something; I don't know if we have to, but this is how I started it  -51-    11/16/82  As you know, most of the monetary and credit aggregates that the markets watch so closely are running somewhat above the targets we set for ourselves at the start of the year So far as M1 is concerned, the data plainly came to be distorted by institutional change--particularly in October by the flow of funds into checking accounts Prospectively, the introduction of new forms of transaction or quasi-transaction accounts is likely to distort the figures further, although the direction of impact is less evident In the circumstances we have had little alternative but to attach much less weight to that aggregate in guiding the provision of reserves until the institutional changes settle down  More generally, current developments with respect to the growth of money and credit have had to be interpreted in the light of all the evidence we can gather with respect to the economy, price developments, interest rates, and financial pressures Taken together the evidence is strong that the desire for liquidity has strengthened appreciably this year, as sometimes happens in periods of exceptional economic uncertainty The turnover or velocity of M1, for instance, has declined appreciably this year instead of trending upward, as has been the pattern throughout the postwar period M2 velocity--generally stable in most recent years--has declined even more sharply In all these circumstances, the Federal Open Market Committee remains willing for a time--as we indicated at midyear--to tolerate monetary expansion at a somewhat higher rate than the targeted annual rate That approach, in the light of the evidence of exceptionally strong liquidity demands, should in no way be interpreted as a lack of continuing concern about inflation--and happily I don't believe it has been so interpreted by the markets The fact is that, with velocity patterns obviously shifting at least for a time, rigid pursuit of the targets would have the practical effect of a more restrictive policy than intended when those targets were set out It's not without relevance, in that connection, to note that growth in bank credit, or private credit generally, has been relatively limited this year, tending to confirm that the greater liquidity provided has not spilled over into inflationary private credit expansion  -52-    11/16/82  What recent developments do emphasize is that, in a time of rapid institutional economic change, we must be wary of highly simplified rules in the conduct of policy That is why we have always looked to a variety of monetary and credit "targets" and retained elements of flexibility and judgment in pursuing those targets  What we do not have the flexibility to do is to abandon broad guidelines for monetary and credit growth as the means of judging policy over a period of time The danger of creating excess liquidity is not so much immediate when there is so much surplus capacity and unemployment, but rather when the economy begins to regain forward momentum That is why we must continuously balance the need to meet liquidity needs today against the risks of building in fresh impetus to inflation tomorrow  Then the speech goes on to talk about the budget imbalance  Well, let me talk about the public side first What is distressing about this to me is that it obviously affected the markets and affected policy Maybe we came out of it all right and maybe we didn't; I don't know But it certainly gave rise to more dangers about misinterpretation of our intentions than I had bargained for I might also say that we had a leak--and maybe more than one--about the Greenbook, as you know I don't know whether it was from the Administration or the Federal Reserve I have heard all sorts of allegations from the market--they may be without substance, but it worries me every time I hear this--that there has been an occasional leak of an M2 figure or an M1 figure, or whatever I hope that is wrong, but it makes me uneasy when I hear about it What worries me, just looking ahead, is this lack of discipline--if I can put it that way It's like the vultures going after carrion Every reporter in the world is challenged to make his own story, and the reporters who may have been involved the first time are all the more challenged to keep it up I think there is a tendency on the part of any organization, for people to say "Damn it! If somebody else is leaking, I'm going to talk to a reporter, too, and get my story out" Unless this is stopped, it's just going to cut us up  I am convinced that in a way it enormously complicates the policy problem because so much of policy is what people think it is or think our attitude is over a period of time as opposed to what we do  -53-    11/16/82  This whole situation is intolerable to me This organization, above all others in Washington--I used to think the Treasury was this way, but certainly do not now--does not leak And I think it has been to our advantage to have that be both the impression and the reality It has enormously increased our credibility, the credibility of official statements over the years, and the credibility of policy I don't see any way we can operate other than on that presumption We are dealing with a Committee; we are dealing with a lot of people We can't have a lie detector at the door coming in or out of the office We ultimately have to do what is right because there is a consensus that that is right and an understanding of what the rules are--an understanding of the people around the table and our associates Frankly, I think we perhaps should tighten up the distribution of some of the materials--to go to your point--partly as a reminder of the sensitivity of this business And we will be proposing some changes in that connection Joe Coyne might just talk a minute about his understanding of the rules and then we'll have a more general discussion of this or of any ideas anybody else might have  We are now talking I think about the outside world  What I think I am bound to suggest at the moment is that we just don't talk to reporters for some interval after the meeting, however innocuously The Washington Post this morning had a comment attributed to a Federal Reserve source It was not the wildest thing in the world, obviously  Well, no There was one comment that said "a Federal Reserve source" And it was the kind of comment somebody could make The article is a little odd because it makes it sound as if the Federal Open Market Committee sets the discount rate It said some Federal Reserve source said the option was between blank and blank or something In the present environment even that kind of comment just feeds this atmosphere I think it's fairly simple for us, let's say in the first week, not to talk to reporters People talk to reporters once in a while, and it has to be done, I suppose But it doesn't have to be done that first week We typically meet on a Tuesday; it doesn't have to be done during the course of that week  Just to repeat the obvious You could make a comment that seems pretty innocuous to you, and the reporter finds three more people to make a comment that is pretty innocuous to them And then if he is any good and knows what the issues are, he begins putting together a story which may be partly right, as that one in The Washington Post was; but the total essence of the article I think was substantially misleading And that's where we are going to get torn apart even with the most innocent of motives  That is something I want to talk about during lunch or whatever, but let's assume that is not going to happen  Well, I didn't mean that Does anybody else have any [comments]?  These are very vague comments as you heard  No, we are talking about a specific decision at a specific meeting Obviously you have to talk about the general policy line, so to speak That's quite a different category But you have to be careful about it There is a real distinction between that general policy line and this--what the argument was at the Committee meeting, with views attached to individuals The most damaging thing is to say "This is what we really meant or somebody really meant" and getting into that kind of thing  Well, it's certainly a relevant question You obviously have to talk to your senior people I guess we have to leave it to you to talk with discretion and convey to them certainly the essence of the message that is more or less the common ground here I would talk with each of those people specifically about this problem Make sure they understand it And if you are satisfied they understand it, you obviously have to talk about the policy decisions I think you could use a certain amount of discretion in [not providing] blow-by-blow accounts, which are inevitably distorted Everybody goes out of the meeting with a different impression of what was said or even what was decided in some sense except to the extent that it is written down And people interpret every comment in the light of what they think; in some instances it may be quite different from what the fellow talking thought he was saying And it might get dangerous when this kind of stuff gets talked about I hope that we can get away from [attendance at] these sessions being as narrow as it was [today] But maybe we can have it someplace in between for a while  I think your senior people have to know about the mechanics of the decision and the essence of the decision  I would welcome any suggestions that you have Let's not deal with them at the moment, but you can contact me later We'll pick up this other issue later Let's go eat  [Lunch recess]  [Unintelligible] tell it to me with enthusiasm and let me just give you one point that may or may not be in this memorandum [Secretary's note A copy of the memorandum, "Immediate Release of FOMC Decisions Pros and Cons," from Messrs Axilrod and Sternlight and dated November 12, 1982 has been placed in the Committtee's files] I can understand an argument that the way the directives have been written it would be much less of a problem than in other instances But once that precedent is set, whatever operating technique we use, whatever kind of directive we use, we're stuck with it, I think, forever If we really were operating as we used to on an interest rate target and we announced a different interest rate every month--in effect came out of the meeting and announced an interest rate--we would then be stuck with it and we couldn't change it without a subsequent public announcement Then I think we would be in great trouble That's just one other extreme form When we are giving a directive of the sort that we've been using, it doesn't have quite the immediate interest rate implications; it doesn't freeze us in quite the same way But it does require that every time we have a special meeting in which a decision is made-- however much of an emergency the situation is--we would have to put something out right away And it might be exceedingly inconvenient  I think they found out; they obviously groped for it But those [directives] were not worded in such a way as to [suggest that we would] stay there until the next meeting There were certain criteria under which we could change It wasn't    11/16/82  that the interest rates changed; they changed very little typically But there were changes during the period which the market always was searching out  Well, that's great! Everybody just has to stay in this room and go three days without any [unintelligible] We have a bathroom facility right across the hall!  If they don't, I'll disappear soon!  That is correct  There is no leaks  Again, I think it would invite a lot of probing at the bottom [to determine] what the real decision was  Yes, I share your instinct  The Congress would just tell us to target interest rates also  I tend to agree with that, but I retain this great hope that it is going to settle down some day  If we have any reserves left at that point!  Let me point out that we live in a world, a Washington world anyway, in which somebody has to trot up and testify about last month's consumer price index, which has no policy content at all If we are going to announce our decisions after a Federal Open Market Committee meeting, I don't think it would be very long before we had a congressional hearing scheduled that afternoon  John Balles  That's right  You're talking about Wednesday?  Well, these are the suspicions that I've had reported to me recently, more or less casually, but they are worrisome They are statistical, such as what the money figures are going to be tomorrow The last one was what the M2 figure was going to be Just to clarify what I know about this last episode I had breakfast with the Secretary of the Treasury the morning after the meeting, as I do every week The only thing I told him concerning what we had discussed was that we were going to put a lot less weight on M1 because of all the problems he knew about We had a very short, two-minute or so discussion; he knew what the problem was I also said I was going to explain this to the public on Friday because I would be going to the Business Council and it would be a good opportunity to put it in the right perspective Two hours later, it's on the tape, because he literally walked out of that breakfast and went to a meeting of the dealer bank association--of all things, a public meeting--and said something about it He said something vague about it when he was asked a question What he said was accurate But there it was And then he didn't say anything else Then Ken Bacon was snooping around I don't know, but Joe Coyne's story is that Ken Bacon was speculating on this privately, as many of these things go, and assumed that we might have to come to that decision It got confirmed by what the Secretary of the Treasury said and he ran with the story He may not have had any other leak The article was pretty accurate except for the headline, which said the Federal Reserve was easing or something That wasn't the point That is obviously not what I wanted to say But except for that first sentence, it was a pretty accurate story My speculation is that one reporter got something in the paper, which wasn't itself all that damaging, and it sent the other bloodhounds on the scent They then got more substantive comments directly, obviously, out of the Federal Reserve And that was the damaging thing, really I was upset enough about the Secretary of the Treasury's performance and that story, but the really damaging policy story was the one the next day, which obviously did come from the Federal Reserve I think it's a perfect example of how one leak generates another  There is a growth rate figure there of x, so they will look at every figure They will see if we are above or below X and ask if we are going to tighten up next week or three days from now or, if not, why not? That's what the directive says  They do it less, surely, now  I hope we can control the leak problem We may not control it by that device, and it may aggravate it, but this institution has had a very good record on not leaking  No, I just wanted to clarify that  That is right  I think you're wrong I think it would increase the market There would be text-analysis as well; we'd get all the English majors as well as the--  -66    11/16/82  SPEAKER(?) They couldn't use English majors, Paul!  Let me put this in extreme form You referred to these quiet little meetings we have in public I'm not sure it has no effect at all, but those involve relatively noncontroversial issues by and large We discuss consumer credit and some arcane regulations Let me go on the other side of the spectrum where I've had a certain amount of experience Those DIDC meetings are a zoo Anybody who does not think the substantive result is controlled by the fact that those meetings are held in public doesn't have his head screwed on right Now, we are not talking here about having a public meeting, but I'm afraid it's a step in that direction In a public meeting one cannot make effective arguments or explore alternatives And you cannot get anybody to change his or her mind once they have made a statement And you end up with miserable decisions, in my humble judgment And that is [true of the DIDC meetings] obviously because they are filled with enormous lobbying interests You can imagine what interest monetary policy would have-- not quite interest groups, and maybe that would diffuse them, but political groups If we ever got to that point, we could forget about having any coherent policy except by subterfuge Somebody would talk beforehand and would announce that this is what the policy is going to be and everybody has agreed to say yes or no In my opinion, that's the way those things have to work, if [the group] is going to make an intelligent decision at all  Well, I don't know whether it's worthwhile carrying this on any further I don't detect a strong consensus to publish  No I feel as if I'm an expert on this, having consulted with my counterpart on this precise point I'm not sure I know every detail They do often have a news conference But typically they are announcing a Lombard rate change or a discount rate change or something like that Of course, we announce that, too, if we make a change That is the typical reason for their having a news conference If I remember correctly, they don't always have one even for those purposes They specifically do not discuss open market operations, or their equivalent of open market operations, except in a rare instance, which is the issue here That is what I asked them about In fact, it has never occurred to them, according to him, to make a public announcement--except on the rare occasion when they want to--that they are going to provide more of less liquidity to the banking system Sometimes they do that, but they don't do it as a matter of course  That is correct Look, this memorandum, Mr Altmann is reminding me, has no indication of confidentiality I wouldn't like to see it spread around simply because the arguments that seem to us persuasive may seem, precisely for your reasons, less persuasive to others  No, I think it simply says that our interests may not entirely coincide with theirs I would even go so  -69-    11/16/82  far as to say that we presumably have the public interest closer at heart than all those people who have reasons for wanting to see a different answer  Well, I don't know as we can carry this any further I suspect we may want to return to it someday Maybe somebody can come up with a more effective argument on one side or the other and dispose of the issue definitively; I doubt it I'm [pressed] for time myself I have a legislative update, if you want to hear it [Our FOMC agenda is completed]  END OF MEETING  -70-       I thought we might change the order [of the agenda] a bit today since the short run blends into the long run and the long-run view may affect the short-run view I thought we would first approve the minutes anyway  SPEAKER(?) So moved  SPEAKER(?) Seconded  Without any objection, we'll approve the minutes I thought we might have the business description first, if Mr Kichline is ready, and have whatever discussion you want of the business [situation and outlook] Then we will go to Mr Axilrod who will talk about the short-run problem but in the context of the longer-run problem We will then discuss the longer-run problem and come back to the specifics of what we want to do, which would be tomorrow, if that is agreeable I don't know if it's more logical or not but for some reason it seemed to me it might be more logical We could wait for [the Managers' reports] tomorrow or we could do that now Why don't we--  We can turn to Mr Sternlight now We can't hear from Mr Cross now because I asked him to go to a meeting in New York this afternoon He will be here tomorrow morning and we can discuss the international aspects then Why don't you go ahead and get your report out of the way, which I think is also background  Any questions or comments?  No other questions or observations? We have to ratify [the transactions] Do I have a motion?  SPEAKER(?) So moved  SPEAKER(?) Seconded  Without objection We have [the Manager's] request to increase the [intermeeting] limit  He wants a lot of leeway to be restrictive, as I understand it  Do we have a motion on [the leeway]?  SPEAKER(?) So moved  SPEAKER(?) Seconded  Without objection, you get another bit of leeway Now we will turn to Mr Kichline  How close are we, if at all, to the end of this adjustment to natural gas prices--these new contracts that are very high?  Even at the present market price for gas? The present gas prices, as I understand it, at the margin, are way below those in these contracts If a buyer just went into the market today and bought some gas, the price would be much less than some of the high contract prices that they entered into a year or two ago  I will cease Mr Guffey  After that clarification, I--  I was just curious about what that profile of prices was  I don't want to divert this whole discussion to gas Who has comments about the business scene? Who senses a recovery? Hearing nobody, who has a comment?    12/20-21/82  Mr Roos  Those are the optimistic comments Now we hear from--  They're very optimistic I don't know what they're smoking!  Who does not see this little--firming is maybe too strong a word--[uptick]?  Apart from the great Middle West, Mr Keehn  You are not part of the program  Is there anybody who has a good report on Christmas sales?  Any other comments on the business scene? I don't hear enormous encouragement around the table  Well, you have a happy background, Mr Axilrod, to tell us how to deal with it  Well, you made it all crystal clear for everybody, I'm sure of that! I think the most interesting things in this paper are the chart and tables on the last two pages To sum up, I think that's--  Right Every one of them is off the trolley in the past year  You pay your money and you take your choice And I think that is a fact of some significance Maybe people have firmer ideas than I do, but I would not discount entirely having a meeting before February 8-9, if that seems desirable and seems to be a way to make some progress Let us open up the floor for any general discussion there is at the moment I assume there will be some  These problems are related but I think our discussion of general problems might logically precede discussion of the specific problem for the next few weeks  Was the happy little Canadian experience mentioned at this meeting or mentioned someplace today? They just abandoned M1 They had this beautiful record of the past 5 years of M1 steadily going down and inflation steadily going up  Mr Black  Governor Wallich  You didn't mention prices on your listing of targets  Is that very different from the aggregates?  Mr Balles  I didn't want to suggest, if that was the inference that you drew, that all this would clarify itself by February I only drew the conclusion that maybe we would have talked it through a little more by February, not that the numbers would suddenly clarify themselves You had a question for Mr Axilrod  We will have Mr Morris, and then Mr Roos will give us the opposite side  What is that political objection?  How far do you think we can go in that regard by saying we're going to project a 9 percent credit growth or 9 percent M2 growth or something that is inconsistent with the 12 percent [nominal GNP growth]?  Mr Roos  Suppose it is true, Larry, that we can make it perform just the way we want Say we put a target out there and we are right on the target with M1 but the unemployment rate is at 20 percent  But that is what I'm addressing myself to If markets have that impression, some people anyway are going to be nervous; I think they are today But suppose we were in this dilemma where money has to grow faster to keep the GNP up What are you going to do?  With that I agree Governor Gramley  The answer to this question depends upon whether or not one is in favor of a credit aggregate  Mr Guffey  Wait just a second  Mr Guffey  Mr Corrigan  I hear all these comments about the political viability of targeting nominal GNP, which I understand I want to offer an observation I would be very surprised if we got through the hearings in February without being asked to reconcile directly whatever target we have with whatever nominal GNP the Administration has And if it does not reconcile, we're going to have a big problem  And we say they have to accept that figure That's--  There will be an effort to push us into that, without any question  There is a little room for maneuvering, but I think we're not going to be so lucky as we were in past years in evading that issue Governor Martin  I don't know how much longer [we can continue] We're not going to get through everybody on this [issue today] Not everybody wants to say something Maybe we can go through a few more Mr Boehne  I don't think this velocity argument is going to work during this period; it will work the other way around if they are at all smart, which may be an overestimate They are going to say "I see velocity went haywire last year, so you have to give us a commitment that you're not going to follow that target but are going to adjust for whatever velocity does And you better hit that nominal target"  Paula Hawkins may not let me Mr Ford  Well, we have time--it's 530 pm--for the two remaining names on my list, if their comments are not too long Mr Keehn    12/20-21/82  It falls to you, Governor Partee, to pronounce an interim blessing  Just the [Divisia L]  Well, we will resume tomorrow morning  [Meeting recessed]    12/20-21/82  December 21, 1982--Morning Session  We can come to order I think we can proceed with the conversation we were having yesterday evening, if additional people want to say something I have two names staring at me here I presume that they indicated that they wanted to add to our discussion Governor Teeters  Speaking of prices, let me just interject in case you haven't heard it The consumer price index seasonally adjusted rose 01 percent in November It's as low as it is primarily because of declining mortgage interest rates Governor Rice  Mr Solomon  Mrs Horn  Mr Boykin  Any other comments? I don't know quite how one summarizes this discussion In some ways I think there was a consensus; in other ways I think there was a lot of disparity Let me make a comment about the deficit that has emerged from the discussion this morning I don't think there is much prospect of the deficit declining in any foreseeable time period, which is a more important problem maybe than some of the ones we've been grappling with in the last couple of days, difficult as those are The Administration's current estimates are going to be higher than anything we've seen and will remain higher I think we have to have targets, just by law And apart from the law, I didn't notice any great tendency around the table to depart from them entirely in terms of monetary or credit targets  It says "growth ranges" I was about to say that we may want to deemphasize to some degree the word "targets" That may be impossible to do; we've used it so frequently I take note of what you have said, but certainly the consensus I hear around the table is that we can't interpret this so rigidly in terms of what is going on currently and prospectively There was a good deal of feeling that of all these numbers M2 probably deserves the most emphasis at the moment, but there are a lot of qualifications surrounding that, I recognize I don't think the M1 question is an "either/or" question I don't particularly ignore it even today Its significance may [involve] a much wider range, but if M1 hadn't been rising as rapidly as it was rising in the last six weeks, we presumably would have had an easier policy in some sense Even now we can't make out what is behind it; but it gives a lot of people,  -39-    12/20-21/82  including me, a little pause when it is rising that fast even if it's not a formal target And that does to some degree influence what we are doing So, there's a recognition that I wouldn't say [in my testimony that] we will ignore M1; but it can't have the formal role that it had for some time anyway I'd leave open the question of when and how we can return to it  As for the total credit measure, I had this interchange with Mr Reuss and said I would put to you more or less formally whether we would include it I don't know that I used the word target; I don't think I did Whatever I said was heavily qualified, but I said we would consider presenting some kind of number for total credit I'm not sure everybody agreed with that, but unless I hear some objections, I take it we will present some numbers for total credit at the very least on an experimental basis Exactly which series, how frequently, and all the rest, we'll have to look at But we will put some kind of benchmark in there unless you tell me otherwise It certainly won't be emphasized as a target, in capital letters, but as something we observe and which may have an influence on us I'm not sure that we want to control any of these [aggregates] all that closely, given the degree of uncertainty that exists and those velocity numbers recently It seems to me that the direction of these signals is clear enough if they are all going in the same direction If we get mixed directions, then we have a different problem But if credit growth is high, M2 is high, M1 is high, and M3 is high, or vice versa, we know the direction in which we want to lean How much tolerance we have and whether we say we're going to hit that target, with a capital "T," and all the rest is another question But it gives us information about the direction in which we would want to go From that standpoint, if we don't have those targets in capital "Ts" in quite the same way [we used to], I'm not sure that the control issue and just how interest-elastic they are and all the rest are necessarily that much of a problem That's my reaction; other people may have different reactions  I do think we're going to be forced into a more explicit rationale, whatever we do, in terms of the nominal GNP I'm not saying we have to target nominal GNP very directly, and there are obviously dangers in that, but I do suspect that we're going to be drawn out on that subject much more heavily than we have been in the past I think there is a real danger in that because it does overemphasize what we in practice can do I think there's great overemphasis now on what monetary policy can do either in terms of nominal GNP or interest rates And it's very dangerous It's partly just a matter of frustration Nobody else can think of anything else to do so they say that the monetary authority must have control over all these things and if they press the right button everything is going to come out right The presumption is that there's a right button to press; I'm not sure there is Some problems don't have that simple an answer I suspect we're in one of those periods, and we ought to devote some attention to arguing that we're not all that omnipotent I myself would accept what some people have mentioned That we keep an eye on such things as exchange rates or maybe even more importantly the price trend and the price forecast but that we not formally target them  I wonder whether we need another meeting I think there is enough convergence so that we don't need it for this purpose I  -40-    12/20-21/82  suspect that we may have a telephone meeting anyway sometime between now and February just in terms of current policy, and some of these issues might be raised Perhaps Steve Axilrod can send out some kind of format or framework as a basis for a discussion of some of these things I'm not worried so much about what the precise numbers are but about the framework that we might use to present it and to help focus the discussion in February I'd do that considerably before the meeting and maybe even before a telephone meeting so that we can get any comments on it and see whether we're talking about the right framework when we come back in February with some language about how much emphasis, what these numbers mean, and some preliminary paragraphs--I guess it's not a directive when we present these annual targets--we might write in terms of presenting the annual numbers We will see whether we can come to some kind of conclusion about the way we want to present this and we will focus more at the next meeting on what numbers we want to put in there or what modifications in the language we want On balance, I think we're left with what could be termed an eclectic, pragmatic approach It's going to involve some judgment as to which one of these measures we emphasize, or we may shift from time to time And if they move in diverging directions, we're going to have to make some judgments as to which one is more significant at any particular point in time against what nominal GNP is or what the goal is or what the real economy is doing and what prices are doing and all the rest I just don't see much alternative to it From one point of view it's not the worst thing in the world; that's the way the Federal Reserve used to operate, less elaborately, for years when policy by present standards looked pretty good  That's right We may make bigger ones that way In today's world, with things so uncertain and upset, it does have dangers It personalizes things much more, which I don't think is ideal It leaves us with more expectational questions It may be fine now, but everybody will say What happens when the Board changes and the personalities change and you don't have a rule? But I'm hard pressed to condense what we have to do into a simple rule, given all the uncertainties we face and given some of these numbers going off track I don't think we have to apologize for the approach, but I don't think it's ideal There was some question--Roger Guffey and some others may have touched upon it a little--of explicit interest rate targeting I don't think we have to go to that It's a fine distinction maybe, but there is a distinction between having an explicit interest rate target and having, as I'm sure a lot of people do around this table, some limits of tolerance on what interest rate change one wants and some general idea as to the direction one would like rates to go as one is interpreting the numbers and setting the targets and setting the borrowing levels and so forth And I think it's a distinction worth preserving I'm not sure I'd want to confine myself to talking about real interest rates or saying we have to have a positive real interest rate I can imagine circumstances in which we might have to have a negative real interest rate I don't think we anticipate it at the moment, but I'm not sure we want to have too much at stake on a real interest rate  There was one thing I do disagree with, so I will just state it There was some implication and some comment that people would be perfectly happy with even bigger swings in interest rates--I may be  -41-    12/20-21/82  overstating it--in order to keep some of these aggregates on target That, I think, we cannot afford in the foreseeable future; I just don't think we can We have had too much [rate fluctuation] in the past for my own blood But given the state of the economy now I do not think we can be casual about thinking of swings in interest rates of several percentage points up or down and just take that as a by- product of some target we're aiming at that we've not very sure of anyway That is one thing I would feel pretty strongly about myself  Oh, I'm not saying anything like that I'm not sure we're tied that closely to the discount rate  All right, maybe during this period But I'm saying I don't think there's any implication of that at all  It's because it has been a by-product of borrowing being fairly stable But that's a decision we can make all the time, right? No, I'm talking about swings of several percentage points in an effort to get something back on target promptly  Well, I may be hearing things that weren't said I don't think so, entirely It's not a question of being in favor of it, but I interpreted some comments as saying that if being less sensitive to interest rate movements is a necessary expense of staying on target, that's okay; we just move the interest rates more I thought I heard some people saying that, but maybe not  Well, to oversimplify, I don't think it bears much relationship myself to the particular period that you're talking about If I wanted to make a comparison I'd go back longer than that; I would go back to, say, the early 1960s I think it's much more elaborate than what was done then because we are looking at indicators much more explicitly But it you look at enough indicators, it does get a bit eclectic There's no question about it And I don't think we ought to apologize for that I think that's the  -42-    12/20-21/82  way the world is at the moment, but it has some disadvantages It would be nicer, from a number of perspectives, if we had a simple, clean-cut rule I just don't see what that clean-cut rule is for the next six months or year anyway And I think that's what I hear around the table, too  I think what you might be saying, Larry, which a number of people have said--and I have great sympathy--is that the value of these rules is to discipline ourselves as much as anything And if there are too many things to look at, one can always find some way to avoid that discipline I guess we just have to appeal more to our internal discipline, but I think that is one of the things we have to lose I don't want to overemphasize the difference, but very broadly I would say we were willing to emphasize some of these things so much because we were preoccupied with that need for disciplining ourselves and disciplining the economy We were willing to accept a lot of guff, if that's the right word, and a lot of potential side effects because [the goal] was all important It's still very important but the risks have shifted We have made some progress on inflation; we got it turned around It's very important that we maintain that, but can we use such a simple rule as we have been using when the relationships between the rule and the economy, which never were all that great, have broken down at the moment? So, we have to look at one to one I don't think I am saying anything very different from what I heard around the table  That's what we need a framework for What I think I hear, which I don't disagree with at all, is that the central target in some sense is probably going to be M2 for the moment But that is going to be more qualified than the way we have presented these targets in the past for two reasons One is that we don't know what institutional impact there is on M2 and we have to qualify it for that reason whether or not we can in some sense formally measure the shift adjustment We are going to have to have at least an informal shift adjustment But that's not the only problem We also have velocity going off the trolley with M2 as well as with these other aggregates So, M2 is the central target--I guess that's the right term to use--but it's a somewhat more qualified target than we've had before What I think we're groping for is how  -43-    12/20-21/82  to state that M2 is the central target but we also are going to be looking at these other things One way is a kind of proviso--I don't know what formal language we would use--that if these other things are going off in a different direction, we will evaluate M2 in the light of credit declining or rising or whatever or if M1 for that matter goes way outside some range we would explicitly [take that into account] I find M1 rather inexplicable in November, not in October; the November behavior worries me and it's continuing into December Maybe it will all wash out with this new account; it may wash out to a considerable degree or not all So, we will wait and see If it doesn't, that worries me As I said, I think we're tighter than we would otherwise have been if that had not been going on  I would have expected the bulge we got in October in part because of all savers But all savers maturities were not that large in November, and I would have thought that after a month or so some of that money would be moving into other investment vehicles An argument is that there are other things going on too One argument is that everybody, or a substantial number of people, is sitting there waiting for this new account So that continues to have an influence Who knows? Maybe we'll get a little more insight when we get the numbers on the new account, but we haven't gotten them yet That's all I mean I would have expected the all savers impact on M1 in November to be rather sluggish, and it wasn't  I think we have the other problem that Frank Morris keeps talking about We seem to have assumed that the NOW account phenomenon was damped to the point of being nonsignificant in terms of shifts this year, and maybe it wasn't, particularly as interest rates came down and got more competitive with the NOW account interest rate If you look at the old M1, we had a very restrictive policy; even with the old M1-A, we had a very restrictive policy this year until just recently Now, that has begun rising in the last two months, too, but in the early part of the year it did nothing  Targeting interest rates Targeting interest rates  -44-    12/20-21/82  Well, it's the other side of the coin We have been more tolerant of changes in the aggregates, I suppose, and haven't reacted all that strongly, and that smooths out interest rates But that's different, I think, than targeting on interest rates I don't consider it a bad thing that interest rates are more stable I think that's devoutly [to be hoped for] If we can do it consistent with the other things we want to achieve, great If anything, this fluctuation in interest rates for the past few years to me is very broadly a reflection of the sickness of the economy and the financial system It's not a normal thing to have interest rates bouncing around like that They don't in other countries, by and large; they never used to here It is something we may tolerate in an effort to achieve a larger objective but it is of no merit in and of itself, in my view  The irony is that short-term rates have been fairly steady since September while we have reduced the discount rate about three times The bill rate is now slightly higher than it was in the middle of September  They are bound to be when we are operating in a fairly narrow band of nonborrowed reserves  Well, what I understand is that we were asked to give a Committee or a Board forecast  I don't know whether it was that explicit But whichever way it was, it was refused They were told that we would give the same ranges that we gave before with an addition, maybe I said more than maybe, I guess, but it wasn't absolutely a promise I said we would explore the feasibility, particularly if the distribution was not symmetrical, of giving some indication of where the central tendency of the individual forecasts lay But it was not a Committee forecast and it was not a Federal Reserve forecast and it would not be a Federal Reserve forecast, in capital letters It would be a somewhat clearer description of where the mode of the individual forecasts was And that's all it has been  I think the forecast is going to take a little more care this time than before I don't know whether we all make the same assumption on monetary policy or not, but the thought occurred to me  There's no question My assumption is that we'll at least need to have some chance after the preliminary forecast for individuals to relook at their forecasts on the basis of whatever they want to consider Whether we should force [the individual forecasts] into a common monetary policy assumption I am not sure, particularly if policy is going to be [vaguer] in some way or another about what the targets are If we say we may change the targets during the year, every individual Committee member may have a different idea of how that may be changed  Well, when you say stance, that's probably unavoidable Whether it is associated with a precise monetary number, though, is something else again  -46-    12/20-21/82  That's correct We make the distinction between stance and [target] We will have to think about just how we will do it, but I suspect we're going to need two rounds of forecasts anyway  We don't have great definitions of any of these Ms  Well, we're not going to resolve any of these issues today I think all we can do is send around a preliminary framework, as I said And if we want to have another meeting in January, we can I don't know if anybody else has that feeling, but I don't think we ought to do this before getting some kind of framework  I'm not sure  I'm not quite sure what you have in mind  Well, I'm not sure; my instinctive answer would be that I'd try not to make the central tendency all that prominent in terms of what is desirable But I think we are going to be forced into precisely what you are saying, after some statement It probably will be viewed more against the Administration forecast or some congressional forecast They will say We think a minimum adequate growth is X and if it's below that, are you going to ease? And if X is low enough, our answer might have to be yes I don't know how to state it or fuzz that up, but at some point that's precisely what I would expect to happen  Well, you can't tell Suppose after all the different permutations and combinations, the inflation rate is high and the real growth rate is low; we'd have a different answer than if real growth is low and inflation is low One can [consider] any other combination of those I'd try to talk my way around it I think the Administration is going to have a low real [GNP forecast], as a matter of fact, because Mr Feldstein is so preoccupied with not overestimating But where I'm a little afraid of getting trapped is this If they have high inflation and high real growth and the Congress says that's just fine, we're glad to live with 5 or 6 percent inflation and we want 5 percent real growth--that's not what the forecast is going to be but suppose it were--we would say that's much too much inflation and we're satisfied with much less real growth Then we'd have a real problem, I think  I could picture that the happy staff optimism on inflation is right and it is coming in around [their forecast], but the real growth isn't doing very well They might say My word, you're doing much better on inflation than you're supposed to be doing in some sense and you're not doing very well on real growth, so you obviously have to ease up That, I think, is going to be a big problem And it's going to be more so in that connection [depending on] what we say is the central tendency  Yes, but we open ourselves much more to this [criticism] if we don't have faith ourselves in these relationships over a period of time, or if we have less faith than we used to have  Just to make this all worse in a way I got the GNP flash It may be crazy, but it's going to make all these velocity figures look worse They have a nominal GNP increase in the fourth quarter-- well, they raised the third quarter a bit but that doesn't make that much difference, I guess They raised the third quarter by a percentage point, most of which is real So there's a real increase in the third quarter with a -22 percent real GNP in the fourth quarter and only +22 percent nominal So, we have to add another percentage point in the downward direction to all these velocity figures that we've been looking at if this figure is right on a quarterly basis  Yes  They raised the deflator a little They have +7 percent on real in the third quarter and +50 percent on the deflator; it was 48 percent For the fourth quarter they have 46 percent on the deflator, which is 1-1/2 percentage point less than the staff forecast We'll see which one turns out better in the ninth revision down the road! And they have -22 percent on the real GNP and nominal was only up then 22 percent So, I guess this is roughly 1 percentage point less than we were assuming for the fourth quarter nominal GNP, which is going to lower all those velocity figures, if we believe the others They have final sales up in the fourth quarter; [the downward revision] is all in inventories, which is not bad in terms of the outlook  Well, it's up only $500 million, so it's tiny I was hoping to see what they have in inventories I don't see inventories on this sheet Do you have the sheet, Jim? It's not on page 1 Here it is The change in business inventories in the fourth quarter was -$18 billion; that's obviously a big guess  -50-    12/20-21/82  No, it's not reliable For what it's worth, that's what it is Well, are there any other comments? I think we better get something out that will make all this a little more concrete  I hope that whatever range we get encompasses what other people have That remains to be seen But this central tendency may not amount to much It's possible that we will say here's the range of forecasts and it so happens that the individual forecasts are well dispersed within that range I can't tell you anything more But it might be that we would say this is the range but most of the people were in the lower half of the range or most of the people were in the upper half of the range That's about all I intend to say--maybe a bit more than that, but as little more than that as we can get away with  I think it's going to be much harder this time, though What bothers me about the Administration forecast is that they are likely to have a higher inflation forecast by a significant margin, not only for [the coming] year but a pretty high inflation forecast out into the future relative to what I think is going to happen And that doesn't indicate great confidence in the success of the anti-inflationary program, for my money They have a certain institutional bias; partly they have the budgetary problem But in part it's because at least some of them want to make darn sure they're not very far away from the consensus of other forecasts And if you look at the consensus of economic forecasts for the next few years, they have a considerably higher inflation rate than our staff seems to be [leaning] toward So, if they go toward a consensus forecast partly for budgetary reasons but partly just because they want to be near the consensus, that puts us in the position of arguing that the inflation outlook is really better and it is doable And they are saying, and everybody else is saying, we ought to be satisfied with a higher inflation forecast and have a more  -51-    12/20-21/82  expansionary policy That's my biggest concern And it's not just next year's forecast Maybe I'm wrong, but my gut feeling now is that this will be evident in the '83 forecast and in the 5-year forecast  It's a little premature because I don't know what [your forecasts will be] There may be no central tendency, as I say If the forecasts are well dispersed, all we're obligated to say is that the forecasts are well dispersed And maybe that's the way it will be  Well, the reason I find your question somewhat unanswerable, John, is that one can always say it's consistent with this number or that number and think it is today But if the Committee is in a mood of saying we may change that number if it turns out not to be consistent, where are we? Everybody is going to have his own opinion of it If we were really saying we were going to aim at 8 percent M2 shift adjusted and we are going to stick with that target through hell or high water, then it's valid to say that's  -52-    12/20-21/82  the assumption If we are saying that's where we are going to steer it now but we are prepared to change it--  There's a whole mine field out there!  Well, if we go all the way in that direction, I literally don't know the answer What we have then is a nominal or a real or an inflation target but everybody is saying that they are willing to change these things because that's in some sense where they want the economy to come out How we can maneuver among this, I don't know  We can make up an arbitrary formula as to how to shift the reserve path in terms of deviations from these targets I doubt that we would want to do that right now anyway Inevitably we would end up, in some sense, with more important judgmental positions about when to change the path in the light of all these things going on But I assume, as Steve says, that we will operate with a reserve path that has a certain degree of automaticity to it, but it probably will be pretty mild Whether we want to make it more than that is going to have to be a judgment  When do we actually get numbers on these new accounts?  Yes, I don't know why [unintelligible] you want anyway  Well, we'll have to sort that out We better not sort it out here Is there anything else to be said on this broad subject? Does anybody have a feeling that we ought to have a meeting in the middle of January sometime?  I'm trying to make that as short as possible, but with all these complications--  I would like to testify as soon as possible after the meeting But it sounds to me as if it's going to be a whale of a lot more complicated to write this than it was before Maybe we can do what we did before We can have that meeting on the 8th and 9th and have another meeting, at least on the telephone, on the 15th or so [That may be] what we end up doing  The more I think of it now, instead of a January meeting, maybe we ought to get that format as soon as possible Maybe the relevant question is not having a meeting before the 8th and 9th but whether we need a meeting after the 8th and 9th  SPEAKER(?) Yes  All right For a little change of pace, why don't we go to the international report and then come back to [the domestic side]  I want to get into this matter of the swaps a little, but are there any questions or suggestions on the non- swap issues or market developments?  The biggest element in all these accounts is this statistical discrepancy I find our forecast a bit unbelievable in the sense that if the deficits are that big something is going to happen and all hell is going to break loose It's a difficult area Anything else? It's a major depressing factor on the economy I don't think there's any question about that It appears in so many industries and it's not all analyzed in the same way, but there's no question that exports are going to hell  Plus or minus 25 percent!  More than that if the mark were down--how much did you say?  If it's 20 percent for the mark, you get 48 off the mark and the mark is down to 190  What are you assuming the impact of your exchange rate forecast has on inflation?  On the swaps with Mexico, we have some share of the $925 million What is that share? I forget  MESSRS TRUMAN and CROSS $325 million  It's $325 million, which is not all paid out yet, but will be paid out presumably by the end of this month  And the part of it that goes back earlier is going to have to be rolled over I don't think there's any question about that The earliest that is going to come out or begin to come out is May, with the second phase-in of the bank and the IMF [loans] Let me go backwards On the Mexican deal, as you know, the point of getting a tranche [from] the banks is far from complete I don't know how much they will come up with of the $5 billion total But we should know this week And we just have to presume that it's going to come close enough to make the whole thing proceed If it does, one option--the leading option--is that we will get paid back that original $700 million We may get paid back some of it before the end of the year out of part of an IMF drawing And the rest of it will get paid back very early next year out of the combination of IMF and bank money The position that I've taken is that that should be paid back to us as soon as there is enough liquidity and that should be there for an instant anyway There is a major question as to how Mexico will get through to the next bank drawing and the next IMF drawing in May And it seems to me that what we have to be prepared to do is to get paid--and I think it would be preferable, although some of our foreign partners don't like it--on schedule so to speak, out of these first IMF drawings and, in fact, mostly out of the bank drawing so that we are down to zero on that old swap I can't guarantee that this is possible But we'd put that back on a standby basis where it is available to Mexico to meet a squeeze they may have before the bank payment Presume we get paid off again, then If they do draw in whole or in part, we'd have it ready to come back before the next one following that; that is, we'd keep it on a standby but usable basis And the net effect of that--if the whole Mexican program goes according to Hoyle--would be that all this central bank money can get paid out by the end of the year The whole financing  -57-    12/20-21/82  plan is based upon that presumption Obviously, things can go wrong A major hazard in the case of Mexico, because we know they have had bad crops, is that they are going to have to import more agricultural products than was really allowed for in this program Some of that and maybe all of it can be covered by the CCC, but we [don't] know that that will be the case If there is a significant decline in the price of oil, Mexico has a problem and they will not be financed It's a contingency we'll have to meet if it happens [The financing] has some nice effects, but this is one of the bad effects Leaving those kinds of contingencies aside, we should all be paid by the end of the year We may be out of the $700 million for a period of weeks or months, if all goes according to Hoyle But I do think we ought to be ready to put it back in again I just want to make sure there's an understanding of that; I don't know that it has to be a formal Committee action  But when they draw again that doesn't have to be any formal Committee action?  What is the size that doesn't [require a formal Committee action]?  So we could put some back in without a formal Committee action But I think there ought to be an understanding of that approach, a kind of consensus that it is desirable or feasible So, I'll ask you that question at this stage  Well, you have to make two assumptions On the assumption that the program goes through, I don't think that can happen early in January because they're going to have so much paid out to them at that point that they are going to have enough money for at least a little while They are going to have $2 billion paid out to them all in one lump sum It may not last all that long but for a while they're going to have the liquidity That question arises late this month before they get the big payment, and I think we just have to be a little flexible about this It's a question of whether we get a couple hundred million paid before the end of the month or whether we wait until January 7th or something like that But that's on the assumption that the program goes through If there's not enough bank money in there, or if there's no bank money, there probably won't be any IMF money either If the program doesn't go through, we can't get repaid  -58-    12/20-21/82  I can think of all sorts of in betweens where we would get some of it paid out but not all of it It can go any place from being paid back $1 to being paid back $700 million  It will be more than $4 billion but the question is at what stage is it so small that the IMF doesn't feel able to go ahead?  Then we have a real problem But they already have [commitments for] basically more than $4 billion except that some of that is contingent on getting more, so it's not perfectly clear yet  I don't think the IMF has said they would accept $4-1/2 billion except as a starting point--that they might go ahead temporarily if Mexico will be getting the rest later Well, we just have to wait and see But that's the general strategy On Brazil, which is not irrelevant even though we have no money in there, the Treasury lent them $1-1/4 billion a couple of weeks [ago], which is the total amount of the Fund compensatory finance and first tranche--  It is the gold or reserve tranche and in that sense is secured The Treasury then went ahead and lent them another $250 million to bridge them over until they could meet with the banks last week and get some more bridging money from the banks That amount will be counted against a BIS facility, which is under discussion The Treasury would participate in that to a total amount  -59-    12/20-21/82  of $500 million, of which they've already put up this $250 million Other countries would [put in] $700 million That seems to be on track with the BIS and probably will be finalized this week, with the possibility of another $200 to $300 million from That is designed to keep Brazil afloat until they negotiate new money with the banks, they hope by early January That process just began yesterday There will be, to choose the words carefully, a voluntary rollover of existing maturities for Brazil next year--which amounts in practical effect to a standstill, in the Mexican pattern--and $4-1/2 billion, roughly, of new bank money plus $1-1/2 billion that they think is already committed for next year So it's really a total of $57 billion, roughly, of new bank money next year, all under negotiation at the moment along with some other things like keeping their branches and agencies afloat Hopefully, that will proceed with the BIS paying out all this money and with the Treasury in for up to $500 million during the next couple of weeks--the Federal Reserve is not involved at all--bringing the total Treasury exposure up to roughly $1-3/4 billion in Brazil Again, all the financing plans are predicated on the proposition that all that money will be repaid over the course of the next year In fact, the existing $1-1/4 billion of the first section of Treasury money is to be [repaid] quite promptly out of the Fund drawings in a matter of weeks, if all goes well and according to plan Again, that is predicated on everything going according to Hoyle and the banks coming up with $4-1/4 billion or $4-1/2 billion, which I presume is going to take a certain amount of front loading too None of that is decided, but that's the plan that is being presented So, the Treasury would be paid most of its money fairly quickly if everything goes well The remaining $500 million would be paid out over the course of the year and probably late in the year But there is a considerable Treasury exposure there  Moving farther south, we have Argentina Less money is involved, but there is a plan for the banks to put in some bridging money and then put in some medium-term money later in the year, increasing their exposure on the order of $11 billion or something like that  A $19 billion total increase in exposure?  That is pretty well negotiated by the banks A lot of that money does go, as Ted said, toward paying arrears It is not enough money to get Argentina, in terms of timing, anywhere near up to date early in the year So, the theory is the BIS will provide, with United States and other support, say, $500 million in the next few weeks to Argentina That money together with bank money would eliminate most if not all of their arrears That would get them back on a current basis Again, if the financing program works out the way it's supposed to work out, and this is more agreed than the Brazilian program--there are many fewer banks involved, only a few hundred instead of over a thousand and the amounts are smaller, so it's much more manageable--the central bank money would come out basically in May and August    12/20-21/82  Okay, a little before that  By June?  If everything goes according to Hoyle The plan discussed for Argentina is that the BIS would advance all the money under an arrangement in which they already have a of some considerable size--they've had it for some time--from Argentina Argentina has  The BIS would advance all the money knowing that if it is not repaid, they can exercise their right of offset against the That is not entirely free of legal doubt because there are negative pledges which our legal counsel tells us do not apply to a right of offset from an existing but that could be contested It would be paid formally out of Fund drawings There is not only bank money in Argentina but there's a Fund drawing and the Fund drawing [amounts to] $13 billion or something like that over the course of the year So that would be some multiple of this BIS assistance But, obviously, there are two contingencies One is that the right of the BIS could be contested legally if it came to that And the general contingency is that if something goes wrong with the program, even if they get the Fund money--and they may not get the Fund money--there may not be enough money there to pay off the BIS And the BIS doesn't particularly want to end up with  It's just too big an amount  So there are several risks that the BIS has to be protected against And the arrangement is that central banks or governments would protect the BIS against those risks by--I get a little out of my depth here on the technicalities--temporarily providing a deposit to the BIS if they don't get repaid But ultimately, if they  So the central banks would agree  Whenever it was done It means that if they haven't been repaid, they eventually would we're probably talking two years from now  After they have The BIS would  -61-    12/20-21/82  So that's one contingency they want to be protected against, and I think it's appropriate Another one is that if in fact there is a successful legal challenge to  which would repay them I suppose it's a similar risk If eventually Argentina doesn't pay them, they want the central banks just to take over the loan, in effect So an agreement has been drawn up to cover all those contingencies in which the United States will participate; in fact we originated this There is still a question as to what the US share will be If it's 50 percent, which is the preliminary thinking, it would be $250 million, obviously It may end up being more than that And then there is the further question of whether the Federal Reserve or the Treasury does it That has to be looked at in the light of the Treasury's exposure to Brazil I have had some discussion with the Treasury that we would either do this or maybe instead take over part of their Mexican exposure and let them do Argentina in whatever the amount is But I have to get your opinion on these matters  But if we take the Argentina loan, we would agree eventually  to these contingencies  None of this requires any formal action-- although I will take advice on this--because we are not lending; the BIS is lending the money initially It's going to be lending the money against these guarantees from the United States, whichever agency does it, and from other central banks We do have to enter into the agreement with the BIS, but it's not a swap or a loan now But it is an agreement under certain contingencies to make a loan one year or two years down the road And you have to understand that and agree to it As I say, it doesn't necessarily have to be us and Argentina Argentina is an Article VIII country, which is one place where we draw the ring around swap agreements Brazil is not But we've never had a swap agreement with Argentina; we wouldn't have to have one now but we would be committing ourselves under certain eventualities to have one at some point Or the Treasury might agree to our just confining our activities to Mexico, where we have a precedent, and they would do Argentina; I don't know Plus, I'm not sure it makes a lot of difference The only difference I can really see is that if we do it with Argentina--and I think there are some pluses--the minus is that we have extended the possibility of a swap agreement to a country where we never made one   If we do it, we will immediately make an arrangement with the Treasury, I presume, that  They would have to  But the Treasury  That Treasury is as broad as all outdoors  These are details  Well, basically yes We could do it all ourselves directly but there are legal problems with our doing it directly and They happen to have  But the other substantive point is that it makes it multilateral instead of bilateral, and it's a convenient way from that standpoint  It's  Well, I can't say that for sure If it's a 50/50 split, it will be $250 million But, frankly, the United States was the progenitor of this and we told them we, the United States, would do more than 50 percent if that was necessary  -64-    12/20-21/82  Well, we've had endless discussions about this That's the price of world leadership, I guess The Treasury got its back up on this Brazilian deal, quite rightly, and that's why that one is 500/700 And, of course, it's 500/700 in that portion of the agreement They already had $1-1/4 billion [in loans to Brazil] And the BIS wanted them to put in 50/50, particularly considering all this other stuff And that was finally accepted with some effort  You stated that a little too generally, I think, Henry The historical fact was--but it wasn't a policy and your comment may have been interpreted as general policy--that we did not participate in Hungary for purely political reasons The Administration was anti-eastern Europe That grates on their mind, and it hasn't helped in this case, but it was just the particular case of Hungary where it turned out that we did nothing and the BIS was very proud of themselves for taking the whole thing But it certainly is in their mind as are some of these other things Latin American is your area; Hungary and Yugoslavia we would [unintelligible]--  Mr Cross, what are the resources of the ESF?  It's always a matter of interpretation with the--  It's a question in the end of how much risk they can take care of They can always borrow or expand their resources, but there's a limit to the risks they want to take  Well, of course, Argentina isn't going to cost anybody any money in the United States initially The BIS is going to finance it all I don't know what the--  That's right In Brazil they are going to do it that way, too So, the Treasury is just going to backstop the BIS for the--  Well, I'm not sure about the oil advance; it comes out of appropriations, I guess But it is true, and I forgot to mention it, that the Treasury is willing to advance a further $300 million to Mexico in the next few weeks to ease their bind That's also going to get paid out next year  Behind us--behind our first [advance], not the BIS part Where do we stand? On this $700 million, to the extent we put it back in, we will be behind everybody else Again, the whole program assumes that this will all come out during the course of the year But when that $700 million goes in we can't be ahead of the BIS including the part we have in the BIS We don't leap frog over that  A more delayed position in the line-up anyway  That is correct  No, that's right It hasn't been arranged yet, but I think that's the realistic presumption That it will come out after the BIS There should be enough money Again, you've just got to assume--presuming that the program works--that there will be enough money to pay off the BIS in May and in August, including our portion of the BIS loan in May and August Some of that, of course, is not out yet Some of it went out in September; that part will be paid off in May The part that's going in now will get paid off in September, if everything goes on schedule If the whole thing falls apart, it falls apart That's been true all along, I'm afraid Oh, we are secured by this oil [collateral], but the BIS part is not--not the swap  -66-    12/20-21/82  No, it's the amount of oil sufficient to pay off the debt  It's secured by enough oil to pay it off  Or whatever that's worth  I think what John may be referring to is whether we are violating the negative pledge clauses that are here, which is--  We think But they are not free from challenge  To the best of our ability they have been so designed  This is why we don't want in the case of Argentina It raises less  question about whether this is setting up a preference arrangement  That is one difference, let me say, in our taking over more of the Mexican one [versus] doing the Argentine one None of these is black and white in the sense that if we basically do Argentina, I think the Treasury would go in there for a [small amount] just to show that we're in there together But if we do Mexico, it will mean an immediate swap agreement because that's the way the Treasury is financing this Mexican agreement If we do Argentina, [the loan] may never [be made] All we would be doing is making a promise to [lend] later under a carefully defined set of conditions that we do not think will materialize They will only materialize if one of these contingencies is triggered--basically that Argentina can't repay the loan on schedule and  Well, in any event, if we do the Argentine thing, I would want the Treasury to do at least a little of it just to indicate that it's a joint effort But is that the preferable course in terms of the [Committee's view]?  The only negative in the Argentine commitment, just to repeat, is that it's a new country [for us]  -68-    12/20-21/82  Possibly I just want to get the assurance from the lawyers if we do it this way that we have to make an agreement with the BIS  And that doesn't take a Committee vote?  So, it would take a formal action by the Board?  But presumably we--we, the Board of Governors--would take an action now against the contingencies?  You're saying we will take a formal action but because of the particular form it will be a formal action by the Board of Governors and not the Open Market Committee?  I basically left out this interim step in my original description We would only, in effect, get to a swap agreement way down the road after this deposit had been there too long  -69-    12/20-21/82  I think I have the sense of the [meeting] at this point From a general policy standpoint, we prefer to do it with Argentina, probably with at least a little participation from the Treasury directly to show the flag And whatever formal actions have to be taken will be taken by the Board Let's have a little break Oh, we have to ratify the transactions  And the possible renewal of the swaps  So ratified  [Coffee break]  [Unintelligible] about Argentina, about Brazil  Other countries? Yugoslavia is the other possibility, but that's mainly a governmental medium-term credit Just to repeat a point, if we get Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina settled, and perhaps Yugoslavia would be useful in another part of the world, I think the rest of these can go and hang there, to put it bluntly I don't think it presents a threat to the world banking system if we have these big countries stabilized, and that has been the [focus of the] whole effort We haven't gotten them there yet, but that's the strategy If we can get the Mexican and Brazilian situations stabilized, and Argentina is also big, I think we will have the whole situation stabilized because there's nothing else big enough and they'll never sell it to--  Right  Exactly They should have eaten some of this Well, they will in some of the private credits There are a number [of risks]--even if everything in our financial manipulation goes well For Mexico there is the obvious threat of an oil price decrease, which would be very destabilizing to Mexico It would help  -70-    12/20-21/82  Brazil some; Argentina happens to be fairly neutral there The other thing is if we don't get some economic recovery here, none of these countries is going to have a good enough current account position to make the arithmetic come out Nobody is projecting a great ebullience in the economies of the industrialized world But if we had [no recovery] at all, it probably would be impossible for these counties to meet the current account objectives that are in all of these IMF programs And, of course, they all have the risk that even in a reasonably favorable world environment they may be unsuccessful in carrying out their programs So, we're not exactly home free But in the next couple of weeks we might be in a position where for the moment we have it somewhat buttoned up  Well, that's part of not being able to carry out the program That is present in all these countries  Well, in Argentina the dimensions are different I think the general consensus is that they have a much easier economic problem, but they have such a weak political situation that they may not be capable of carrying through even a more modest program because their political situation is so weak  World reserves are going down quite precipitously now These actions tend to keep them higher than they otherwise would be, but they are going down rather rapidly The next danger items may be some countries in the industrialized area of the world France has lost on a net basis what--$19 billion or $17 billion of reserves in the past 18 months?  There was an article in The New York Times that suggested something in that direction But we have not been nearly as forthcoming as the banks would like us to be I understand we have not given them any assurance that they wouldn't have to disclose this [lending] What we have come very close to saying but we haven't said it yet--the specific question was on the prior Mexican debt--is that we would accept [the following] arrangement That if the Mexican private debtors can get up the pesos and deposit them with the central bank and these banks agree eventually to take it over, if they have to, [we would call that] a new loan to the central bank  Well, it is in dollars The loan has always been denominated in dollars We are saying for the time being, and it's a bit of a stretch, that the dollars [are] in the hands of a central bank as opposed to the companies [and we] will count that loan as being current, provided the banks agree to lend them the money to pay the interest, which is what they are doing with the whole thing But every one of these countries is being lent money to pay interest If you went all the way in the other direction, you'd have to say all these loans were nonperforming because they are all borrowing to pay interest This is a little more direct  There is no question that this has some flavor of compulsion--I mean internal compulsion--in that the only reason they're making the loans is to make the old loans good, individually There's no question  There's no question that these loans are not liquid in a very obvious kind of way I think it is also true that the loans are better after this than they were before because if this doesn't work, you know you have a pot full [of losses] The banks not only have illiquid loans, they will have no interest payments It's not a satisfactory situation by any stretch of the imagination  I think we'd better get to our policy problem It has been a long time since Mr Axilrod introduced it  Let's come to the point, Mr Axilrod  Yes, I think you have several versions of this thing floating around  I wonder if [this approach] would clarify our discussion The points that Steve raised are very relevant, but keep in mind what kind of general growth in M2 and M3--I guess in a sense that's what we have to put in the directive--you would want to have without these shift adjustments Then it's a separate point as to how we make those [adjustments] and how we state them [We would need to decide] whether we add [shifts] in to begin with or whether we  -75-    12/20-21/82  essentially use the directive that Steve is suggesting, which gives a number that allows for little or none but says we may have to allow for [shifts] if they develop One other point I would make is that on our current projections, which obviously are always subject to change with every bit of [new] weekly data, it looks as though M2 and M3 are coming in lower than the present directive suggests [Their growth] was higher in November, but if you put November and December together, it looks as if it's coming in below the track that we forecast, which in itself tends to push the borrowing level down a bit But presumably if that gets confirmed, it would move it down more just on the basis of the existing directive Now, we reset that at this meeting but if we weren't meeting today and the trend developed as now projected, presumably the borrowing level would be coming down anyway I think that's correct, isn't it? It would be [down] a little anyway  You can comment on the basic trend that you would like to see in M2 and M3, what your preferences are, and how to state that in terms of these alternatives and the borrowing level I think those are the key variables  No!  As I see it, just to make it clean, alternative two wouldn't allow for much shift  You're saying "some" Very little to none, I guess, just to keep the choices cleaner  You've allowed for what--a 3 percentage point shift in the aggregates?  I think in your alternatives here, which I have not explored with great care, you are not allowing for much, if any, shift in M3  So, presumably that is the kind of figure we would put in for M3 And you are saying putting in a number a percent or so higher would allow for just a little shift, which we'd have to explain in the text somehow  Maybe in the directive itself we should make some allusion to the fact that we've allowed a little [for shifts]  Let me get clear on this You have a quarterly average of 7 to 8 percent with what from December--?  Mr Balles, you had a question before  We always talk in shorthand about this borrowing level, which is very convenient, but it seldom comes out there because what we're really doing is setting a reserve path If excess reserves are high, the borrowings are high And we're entering a period, the year-end period, where the excess reserves may be very erratic So as shorthand for setting a reserve path maybe [we should talk about] a free reserves number rather than an actual borrowing number, particularly when excess reserves are going to be volatile at the end of the year  That's right We're just setting the beginning point of a reserve path Well, in the absence of anybody else talking, let me say this Simply because these other numbers are so big and we have to give an explicit estimate of a shift adjustment we don't know anything about, I like the alternative two approach I don't know how much to allow for, but I'd allow for some shift; if we're allowing for some, we have to be very clear either in the directive or the text that this is a higher number than we would have put down except that we are assuming some minimal amount of shift  But what it says is that our first bit of evidence would be if [M2] came in high but [M3] did not; then we would be more inclined to think it was a shift than reality If they both came in high, we would tend to discount the very first--  Unless there were other strong evidence  Just for the sake of completeness, what do you have for M3?  And assuming we say someplace that we are allowing for a little shift  In the Axilrod version, it is a conservative estimate of a shift  For alternative two  If you thought there was a shift?  It's the other way around  I don't know quite what Tony has in mind In the Axilrod version, just putting in Tony's number, he is saying that allows for one percent or so of shift adjustment, which we think is minimum It's the equivalent of saying between "A" and "B" on the other numbers If you were really right that the shift was 3 percent, who knows?  I will return to my interpretation for the purposes of clarity We can do it differently, but let's get some common basis here I'm won't say this is what Tony said; I'll say it's what I'm saying now We can put in a 9 to 10 percent figure, for instance, or 9-1/2 percent just to make the arithmetic correct, and say someplace--probably right in the directive--that we are allowing for a modest increase in M2 from a normal trend because we think there is going to be some minimal amount of shifting In fact, we are prepared to see a bigger shift, in accordance with the staff estimate If the evidence develops that way and the staff is right about the 3 percent, the 9-1/2 percent is equivalent to 11-1/2 percent In fact, nobody is going to know with any precision if it is in the end But analytically that's what I would suggest we are saying In other words, 9-1/2 percent is equivalent, without allowing for any shifting, to 8-1/2 percent  Well, I can understand that But it's just a matter of preference You would be putting down a number which the staff at least thinks is too small And we will never make it  And that has its difficulties, too My sense of the this is that if we're allowing for any shift here, we probably ought to say it right in the directive We could say in the next sentence that this number for M2 allows for some exceptional increase in M2 because of this switching If there's more than this little we allowed for--we keep the [suggested] sentence that's there  Yes, if the GNP number is right  Well, you are right where I described it, I guess There seems to be some general feeling that we ought to work with alternative two Can I assume that?  -83-    12/20-21/82  I don't think we can put in a number in [alternative] one and say this allows for a shift ranging from one to five percentage points; we would have to put in a range of 3 or 4 points around the number We would have to say we are aiming at 9 to 13 percent or something to allow for a shift of one to five points I'm not sure that helps  The argument against alternative one, as nearly as I can understand, is composed of two related arguments We haven't the vaguest idea, really, what the shift is going to be If we just put in a visibly high number, not knowing what the shift is going to be, we may get a psychological problem, which we don't need to be read into this right now  Yes Let me ask my question over again You responded I don't know whether you're convinced or not Do we work with directive two? Okay, that seems to be [the consensus]; let's work with directive two Let me repeat the proposal we have on the table Whether or not it's exactly Tony's--and I think it comes close--we put in either 9 to 10 percent or 9-1/2 percent, which happens to be the same number we've been working with and 8 percent [for M3], as I understand it We say explicitly--Steve just gave me some language "Allowing for some shifting into broader aggregates, particularly M2, resulting from the introduction of the new money market accounts" So, we've explicitly said that 9-1/2 percent allows for some and then we keep something like the next sentence that is already there  But in this first sentence we said [unintelligible] allowing for modest shifting or something  Well, let's see "allowing for modest shifting" or "some shifting"  All right, we'll say "allowing for some shifting into M2," if that's the way you want it This states it the other way around, resulting from the introduction of the new money market accounts It doesn't say from where but it says--  I think if we say M2, it's clear enough "Allowing in the case of M2 some"  We can come back to the precise language The proposal on the table is 9-1/2 percent, which implicitly allows--I will say--for 1 percent of this shifting in M2 and for zero shifting in M3 with a figure of 8 percent Tony said about $175 to $200 million for the initial borrowing figure  It's not very reliable from week to week, and the funds rate will be affected by whether people think the discount rate is coming down or whether the economy is improving and the rate decline is over or whatever  Well, it's easier at that point to adjust for it, but in the initial stages it's likely to be hazy  I think that is correct, and I would plan to do that  Technically, I think it's slightly tighter than the last directive if one literally--  Comments?  The assumption, implicitly, is that the federal funds range in the directive stays at 6 to 10 percent I don't see any particular reason to change that, as Tony suggested  I see We can all say we're targeting interest rates and all this is a meaningless exercise, but in fact we are targeting a reserve path which has some influence on the funds rate If the aggregates are not coming in at a level which justifies moving the funds rate lower at that point, under these directives we can't do it  I don't think the funds rate is going to become all that indeterminate all that soon But at some point we might want to reduce the discount rate and tighten up on the reserve path  I don't want to rush you here, but I don't hear any contrary views Is there a preference between expressing it as 9 to 10 percent or 9-1/2 percent in the first place? I hear 9-1/2 percent And 8 percent for M3?  Well, we have to decide upon that Let's just take the numbers [for the aggregates] first and come to the borrowing assumption later The numbers proposed are 9-1/2 and 8 percent I suggest language for the rest of the sentence saying "allowing in the case of M2 for modest shifting into the new money market accounts from CDs or market instruments"  All right Is that sentence agreeable? Then we go on with another sentence--just to complete the directive and we will get back to the borrowing Did you have new language for the directive?  What did you give me? It's this page I've been writing on? Okay "The Committee indicated that greater growth would be acceptable if analysis of incoming data and other evidence from bank and market reports indicate that the new money market accounts are generating more substantial shifts of funds into broader aggregates from market instruments"  This covers both as written  No  No, I think it clearly gives us flexibility Is that okay? There was a bracketed portion in the original draft reading "or signs of exceptional liquidity demands" Do you want to leave that in or out?  I'm not going to bleed and die one way or the other on this one I don't know whether that on balance is good or bad Let's have a show of hands just from the voting members on this portion of the sentence--a referral to if there are exceptional underlying liquidity demands  Let's make it for leaving it in, in the first instance It looks as if we have a minority of members who prefer that Let's leave it out for the moment  It's going to rest upon the strength of one's conviction, I guess Comments about taking it out?  We have more for taking it out And we have 6 to 10 percent on the federal funds rate range All right, that takes care of the directive language We're left with the borrowing Let me just try out $175 million as one end of the range that was suggested Who prefers that? Four Who prefers $200 million? There may be other numbers Five  The answer is $1875 million Let me suggest that we use $200 million, but in these great decisions we make from day-to-day that we make them on the side of being a little below rather than a little above Is that acceptable? I guess we have done the whole thing Well, we have that language that you were talking about at the end of the previous paragraph  It's very important because this will only be released after we've already done it  It's pointing out that we will review the decision carefully in the light of developments over the remainder of the year Literally it says our decision is going to be affected by what happens in the next week and a half and that looks a little odd  I think it's trivial  It's a sacred piece of boilerplate I really think it has no significance whatsoever  Governor Gramley suggests that the first sentence in the whole directive should be changed  He is suggesting "Real GNP declined in the fourth quarter, although final sales apparently were roughly unchanged" or "were maintained"  I think we can accept that change I guess we are ready to vote    12/20-21/82  Okay Do we have anything else?  We ought to think in terms of the possibility of a meeting after the 8th and 9th We will have at least a telephone consultation sometime in the middle of January  Well, I don't know whether it's useful right now because I don't have my calendar here nor do other people We will send something around Okay, I guess we can eat  END OF MEETING       Everybody's on here?  I think we might as well proceed with Mr Axilrod telling us where we are  We have an interruption here for some reason  Which seems to be the understatement you have made!  After that enlightening discussion of M2, what is going on with M3?  What is Ml adjusted?  Who can make sense out of all these figures?  Well, if you're counting on me, you're premature in getting any answer at the least I think this is terribly confusing analytically and factually It just makes our job in following these figures worse than it looked like [it would be] at the Committee meeting, I would say Beyond that, I don't know what to conclude other than that it's more difficult All these figures look high; I don't deny that Whatever kind of adjustment one makes-- unless there's something that we're missing here entirely--it's hard to say they look on the low side I'm a little surprised about what you said about M3 in January; to the extent that this shift in M2 comes out of M3, which some of it certainly does, you just don't add the bulge in M2 on to the M3 figure  And the latest data you had for M3 were not particularly strong, were they?  Forget everything you're assuming Assumptions aren't very good these days The last figures on M3 are not nearly as strong as the M2 figures, are they?  I know December, but haven't you anything for January?  He was assuming more than that  Well, he's assuming more than that The figure isn't all that low to say the least    1/14/83  I don't see why they are having any trouble making money, John, when they're offering 11-1/4 percent and a bonus and the prime rate is 11 percent You just do enough of that and you make a lot of money  Let me ask a question You probably don't have any feel for this, but one of the unknowns here is that we expected some limited but still significant portion of these MMDAs to come out of NOW accounts or demand deposits On the face of it, the    1/14/83  figures don't seem to suggest that Does anybody have a feel for that?  My word! If it was that much, it could be a huge amount  If you assumed any of it came out of Ml, you would get "shift adjustment" of more than what the actual figure was  Any more enlightening comments on these figures?  Well, I can't disagree with that as a qualitative conclusion I don't quite know what to do about it because I don't have any confidence whatsoever about what other number we would put down What I would suggest in that connection is that we look at this for another week and see whether we can make any more sense out of it I'm not terribly sanguine in that respect but [suppose] we just sit here and not do much; we're not taking any action to ease beyond what we discussed at the last Committee meeting I don't know whether we [should] take some moderate action in the other direction, but I'd just be inclined to sit here for another week and see whether we can make any sense out of this instead of thinking of revising a directive in our ignorant state at the moment Let's at least wait another week  I certainly share that view And that's equivalent, or the substantive result, of what I'm suggesting for the next week anyway  Mr Altmann has to interrupt again for some reason  Well, I don't know whether it's late or not  I want to raise another matter  OPERATOR All right, she'll be calling  We did, of course, contemplate this situation in the directive I don't think we contemplated it in quite the degree to which it exists, but there is an escape clause in the directive for the moment If that's the general view, I would not do anything at the moment, but continue to look at this I have to be gone the first part of the week, in Europe, but maybe we should be thinking about having a further conversation next Friday  Whatever you say, even if we could make out these numbers, my suspicion is they're going to look high As I said before, they've been running high for some months Put that together with economic activity and it looks to me like we are going to get, even on an adjusted basis, a further decline in velocity which will make the sixth consecutive quarter--I guess not technically consecutive because there's one quarter that interrupted it slightly-- of a downward trend of some size in velocity That is unprecedented and brings me back to our yearly problem as opposed to our weekly problem I don't know whether anybody has any bright new ideas on that Steve did write something, which I have seen The course that he chose, maybe sensibly, was writing something that isn't quite a directive, but a basic summary as nearly as he judged any consensus of what our conclusion might be on this matter I think it's a reasonable sense of what that discussion was Whether it's reasonable in face of the problems that we have for 1983 in judging precisely how we want to approach this, I don't know, considering what is going on But it may be worthwhile, if you agree, just to send out something like this to you It's not a draft of anything, really, although it almost sounds that way But I don't consider it a draft of anything I'd like to see to what degree this captures the spirit of what people were talking about as a focus for making any other telephonic comments that people want to make before we meet again Does that sound like a useful or a counterproductive idea?  Mrs Teeters  I don't know whether anybody was scratching their heads over the holiday season and beyond and whether anybody has anything they want to comment on in terms of our general problem for 1983 Let me ask that general kind of structural approach question And if anybody also wants to make any comments about what they see going on in the economy, this is the appropriate time to do it [Secretary's note Silence] I see you all were working very diligently and were filled with new ideas during Christmas and New Year's and beyond! I draw a complete blank?  That's fair enough Do you want to repeat an old one with greater intensity?  But is the operational conclusion you draw from that more emphasis on M3 and C and L or something different from that?  Governor Wallich    1/14/83  Does anybody want to make any comments on the business situation? Does anybody see any signs of change there from what they thought before?  Does anybody have any sense of any conviction on the inventory situation? We've seen some reductions recently, obviously And production has clearly been running below consumption just recently But we could still be a long way from a turnaround there or we could not be I just don't have any strong feel one way or the other I don't know whether anybody has any conviction on that score  I was talking to a lot of capital goods manufacturers the other day and none of them said they saw an increase in orders at this point Does anybody have any questions?  Okay I appreciate it If there are no other comments, tentatively anyway, we'll plan to do something like this next Friday We'll send something out to you Thank you  END OF SESSION  -12-     Well, I don't hear any other comment about changing what we're doing operationally If anybody has a comment, say so I have a small question about whether it fits the directive, or whether we ought to recognize [the situation] in the directive or make some note of this call, or have another call next week and see whether we want to make a note of it, or any one of those variants  I'm reading from the directive "The Committee indicated that greater growth would be acceptable if analysis of incoming data" etc We weren't exactly expecting M2  growth of 32 percent  I'm inclined to think we ought to make a note of this meeting or have another one I don't know quite what we would say other than that we reviewed the situation and decided to await further evidence while maintaining the reserve path Actually, because there are no reserve requirements on M2, we're not changing the reserve path  To accommodate what happens to Ml  I just haven't thought about this, but if    1/21/83  we don't want to make any real change now, I would suggest that we let it go until the middle of next week and maybe have another conference call People may get a bright idea or maybe we can just send you around some language to approve, disapprove, or comment on I think it might be useful in the record to show that we have had some discussion of the situation in the light of these wildly changing and divergent figures Does that sound reasonable?  I don't think that we have to be specific in terms of dates but just say something about "after a Committee discussion" We'll have the date of whatever I send around I don't think we have to indicate every time we discussed it Is that broadly okay?  He put that in there because I would prefer to have an average range instead of a fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter range The explanation is as simple as that  As always, our ranges are mutually consistent, in at least the analysis beforehand  Well, I might Let's see how things look What I'd like to do, if I have a sense that nothing drastic has happened, is incorporate what I sense people want to do at the moment and use it as a vehicle for informing the world at some future date that we've looked at these wild numbers as they were developing and    1/21/83  kept close touch on them and describe what we did in reaction That would come out about the time the public got the numbers I just don't know the operational language I want to use  And if it looks more complicated or if something changes, we'll talk about it Hearing no other comment, we will proceed on the present basis I don't think there's anything here that calls for any easing of the reserve path  And that is the way we will proceed in the next week Let's see whether we can condense something into a paragraph Thank you  END OF SESSION     It is now time to come to order We might as well approve the minutes  Is there a second?  SPEAKER(?) Second  Without objection, we'll approve the minutes I will welcome Mr Roberts; I think it may be symbolic or something that he is sitting on the left side of the table Where is Mr Balles?  We do welcome you, Mr Roberts, if you don't say too much  For the first hour, anyway We might as well go right to work on the business outlook and the longer-term ranges We may not get through that this afternoon, but I think we can get a long way So, Mr Kichline and company  MESSRS KICHLINE, ZEISEL, TRUMAN, and PRELL [Statements-- see Appendix]  I thought you had another page here showing the directive for the long-term targets over--  Well, that was a very full report Let us concentrate on what the outlook is Why don't we divide it into the real economy and prices at this point?  That seems like a very low growth in productivity for a period of expansion  How do you measure value added in finance?  I'm taking for granted there isn't any to start with  Do profit margins get squeezed?  Well, that may be going down We've had comments that productivity is too low What else is there on the business side?  Let me make an observation With a single exception, everybody in this room has a significantly higher forecast than what the staff has just presented To the extent that that is only due to what Nancy was just suggesting, that you assumed bigger inventory liquidation in the fourth quarter and presumably a lower GNP in the fourth quarter of last year, I don't think it means anything But maybe you didn't assume that Mr Black  I think we're getting ahead of ourselves Mr Axilrod could promptly comment on that at this point in our conversation  I think we ought to go on to something else at this point, but you might be interested in these charts on lagged velocity, and maybe we can distribute them You might tell us, Mr Black, if you have that big an increase in GNP, where it might arise  We can return to that subject when we're discussing [policy]  The saving rate is going to go down unless we get more investment someplace  Governor Gramley  Mr Boehne  I misspoke before I don't know why I only saw one person whose forecast was down with the staff; there are quite a few who are down with the staff, including you  Yes I have all those with me  Well, there's one that's below--  There are three  Does anybody else want to comment?  You said they could go up 40 percent with 5 percent or 4 percent [inflation]?  Well, let me ask the question the other way, after hearing you persuasive people What do you have to assume to get an inflation rate of 5 percent or above?  I'll rule that out Well, I don't know Is that the answer? Is that the only way [inflation] gets up there?  How bad would it have to be on food?  If we have a recovery, we're going to see a lot of commodity price increases  One could add up all those commodity prices and none of them equals a small decline in the oil price in terms of impacts on the GNP We're bound to see increases in volume--  Poorly, I suspect    2/8-9/83  Governor Teeters  So was I  Governor Wallich  Governor Martin  Mr Ford No, you already spoke Does anybody else want to comment? Let me raise a question, Mr Kichline If you look at your forecast beginning now in this quarter of '83 for a year ahead, is that substantially different than the forecast you had in the beginning of the second quarter looking a year ahead?  Of '82  It's a point not to be precise about, but my memory is that you had a forecast of a fairly gentle recovery beginning in the second quarter during the year ahead  Exactly  Well, I only raised the question because I detect a quite different tone in this meeting from only a month ago Everybody is assuming, or has forecast at this point, a recovery I would point out that I'm not sure that's in the bag; one could have made exactly the same forecast--whether or not you did, I think you did--nine months ago  I said one could have made that forecast nine months ago A lot of people did What we had at that time as I recall were low automobile inventories and some recovery in automobile production and the beginnings of a housing expansion, following two quarters of large inventory reduction  And a tax stimulus coming up  Interest rates are lower now  They were less cautious and more optimistic in my mind    2/8-9/83  Look, I think we're in a recovery I just say that one month of upturn does not a recovery make And the most recent trend in automobile sales--I don't know that it means much, but it's down, not up Automobile production is now up very close to sales They have a lot of incentive programs going on We know some sectors of the economy are declining and there are also plus factors in the economy We'll see  We've done a certain amount of talking about the business and the price [picture] and we haven't done any explicitly, except some mention of exports, on the international side or on the credit side The credit side I think we're going to have to return to in terms of setting targets when we decide what we want to do there But does anybody have any questions on the international side or on the fiscal side or the credit side? Mr Balles  There is no question that we are in a period, I think, without precedent--Mr Truman can think of all the precedents while I assert this--in that we have had a big recession here and the foreign [trade] balance is declining instead of improving Usually the balance improves during a recession And it is a very large fraction of the share of the decline in GNP If you want to make horror stories for this year, go along the line perhaps of your reasoning The exchange rate remains high; the trade balance gets even worse than projected; we get a big government deficit holding up interest rates, let's say; and we have a lot of foreign financing of the deficit The result would be that we have a mess in the economy relatively high interest rates, relatively high exchange rates, and for both reasons not a good trade balance and not a good [performance in] other sectors of the economy Governor Wallich  Mr Balles  Would you like to answer Mr Ford's question, Mr Prell?  Mr Corrigan  It's that 40 percent increase in profits!  Any more questions?  I think that's a good question, but let's defer it until we get to [the discussion of] the targets because it goes right to that question of where a credit aggregate, if we use it, should be in the light of history Is there anything else just on the general business picture, the international picture, or the fiscal picture? I would summarize my own view on this in a way that John Balles probably [was getting] to There are a lot of reasons why the price outlook looks pretty good; the business outlook looks pretty good except for the budget deficits ahead and except that the international outlook is a hazard, and except that we still have    2/8-9/83  [potential] problems with real financial disturbances, internationally and domestically, which I'm afraid will be aggravated at some point by too sharp a decline in the oil prices We have a little problem that has been alluded to here as to how aggressive both labor and business will be in their pricing as the economy expands I've been relatively optimistic about that but I don't know if there's any basis for being relatively optimistic If Mr Keehn is right--I think you were the one who commented on that side--then we have another problem If everybody's going to be very aggressive [in their pricing] with six months of rise in new orders, I don't know where we are [going] Only time will tell, I guess Let us turn to Mr Axilrod If you can clarify all this in a statement shorter than the remainder of our available time, my congratulations  I'm sure of that  You indeed finished before exhausting all our time How successful members of the Committee were in following the complexity of your statement, I'm not absolutely certain As you were talking, I wrote down some observations and questions I think what Steve has said is right in our traditional framework, with all the appropriate qualifications It assumes we're going to have targets on these various things, as we've discussed before And we will look at velocity hypotheses to set them down Let me just make two assertions to start with--or one assertion with two subdivisions I don't think we have any escape from an unusual amount of uncertainty --uncertainty in the technical sense--in approaching this subject right now I will assert, and I think it is true no matter how you lag these things, that velocity is off the map, as Steve indicated at the start, so far as 1982 is concerned and because we have all these uncertainties about shifts But I also think there's a more basic uncertainty about the economy, which was reflected in our earlier discussion--the international dimensions, the deficit, the "financial crisis" possibilities [Those concerns] are there  Against that, let me raise some basic questions and then some operational questions I suppose the first basic question, which we  -19-    2/8-9/83  more or less disposed of last time, but I want to repeat is Do we need these targets at all either legally or economically? I think we tentatively said yes, we should go ahead with them And by targets I'm talking about these monetary targets; one can conceive of some other kinds of targets A subsidiary question is How firmly should they be put forward and on what basis do we change them as the year progresses? And in evaluating that decision What do we see as the risks with respect to the economy or to inflation, particularly whether they're asymmetrical, in playing our hand? As part of that I suppose a question is What concern do we have about interest rates, whether or not we target them? Those I see as general questions on which we have to reach some consensus And then, assuming we're going to have monetary targets, we have those questions about which one we emphasize, what we do with the shifts, what the base is for M2, how much weight we put on Ml, and how we treat this credit aggregate Probably other questions will arise, but I think those are all operational This draft directive takes one stab at trying to answer the questions, reflecting pretty much the state of the discussion as I understood it after our last meeting With that much introduction, I would appreciate some comments on what I characterized as the more basic questions Maybe we just ought to discuss those a little before we get into which target, which base, and so forth  Oh, I don't know I would guess against it, but I'd put the odds at 60/40 or something against But I tell you, with all the other uncertainties, I see that one as about 18th on the list although it would obviously affect M1 if the DIDC did it  It's a subsidiary question to "What do we do with Ml?"  I don't want to impose too much order on the discussion, but I will deem those questions as appropriate when we get to the question of what we do with Ml I'm thinking of the more general questions of how we evaluate the general risks in terms of the very broad strategy of how we play this and what kinds of targets we want and how firmly we adhere to them Governor Wallich    2/8-9/83  Let me just insert an observation here I don't know how many of you read the Economic Report [of the President], but it went through various iterations before the final version was produced and I didn't read the final version So, I speak projecting changes that were made in earlier drafts As originally written, it had a very great retreat from certainty of monetary targeting, without any question, because it recognized the changes in velocity It basically took the position that you have to blend targets with judgment In some earlier drafts it came very close to saying what we should do is target nominal GNP, which is something that at our last meeting we pretty much decided not to do I think that has been toned down as the drafts proceeded but there is still some implication of it I suspect But that's the way they kind of get out of this box You have to be reasonably flexible with the targets and look very hard at GNP and inevitably forecast, I think, the GNP in setting the targets or in altering the targets Governor Partee  I'm sure they didn't exactly say that  Let me just make a distinction there, as a footnote to what we said Right at the moment M1 may be standing up better as a technical matter; it's not as distorted by these institutional things It is at least as far off in its velocity over the past year as the other measures They all are  No, it's probably neither more nor less over the next few--  Governor Gramley  I will defer that question until we get to setting the targets  Well, restrain your curiosity until we get to setting them up Mr Balles  If I can interrupt I think you're getting a little ahead of this, John All I'm interested in at this  -23-    2/8-9/83  point are broad observations about the targets and how we deal with them  Well, we'll find out whether there's a need to go around the table You can make an observation if you care to make an observation  Any other comments on this?  Mr Morris  I'm not sure whether I understand what your asymmetry is    2/8-9/83  That's why you want to keep targets  Do you also want to make the target relatively tight, whatever that means, at this stage?  Yes, but I guess I'm lost What do you conclude now for '83 on the basis of all this?  Other than Ml?  You want a firm target for a very broad aggregate, then  Governor Rice  Governor Teeters  Mr Black  Mr Roberts and then Mr Solomon  Mr Solomon  Mr Boykin  Governor Martin  Mr Boehne  Mrs Horn  Would you like to define dishonest flexibility?  Did I miss you, Mr Guffey?  I had your name and I crossed it off without even hearing you, I guess  Mr Keehn  Mr Ford  I think you've put your finger on a point that I was going to make in summation I would not carry it to the point that you carried it, but what I hear around the table--with maybe your exception--is unanimity on targeting, which is where we were before, and a lot of flexibility I think those are fundamentally incompatible in a conceptual sense, if you push this far enough In one theory of targeting, anyway, you'll go a long way toward undermining what you are targeting if you're very flexible in handling it I detected a lot of nuances or differences, which gives us a job to reconcile I wouldn't go all the way to targeting interest rates very firmly because I think there are targets other than interest rates that we could adopt instead of monetary targeting We can look at a lot of things in addition to interest rates, which I think is probably what we're doing But I did want to note that I think the Committee is on two horses; I'm not saying wrongly But there are two horses One is targeting and one is flexibility And they have two different names  Oh, I'm not saying it's wrong I'm just saying that we better recognize that that's what we're doing And inevitably, then, you have to put emphasis on other things, whatever they may be at the time--whether it's interest rates or nominal GNP or a number of other things that have been mentioned As to whether it's reassuring or unreassuring to the markets, I think you could ask a variety of market people and they'd give you different answers to that  -32-    2/8-9/83  question depending upon their own predilection So, that point I think one can interpret for oneself I have a little strategic decision to make on whether we finish tomorrow or not [unintelligible] Does anybody else want to comment on these general things in response to what they have heard from others if it doesn't take too long? But I think we are where Mr Ford suggested There are a lot of variables and a lot of nuances--or more than nuances--of differences as to what to do with all these variables And how we condense all that into a directive is the problem I think this draft that we have in front of us more or less reflects the flavor of the conversation, whether or not it reflects it in the details that everybody would like to see That's where we are We can leave it all until tomorrow or we can continue for another 10 minutes or so, I suppose, tonight If people want to stay for another 20 minutes maybe we could dispose of all these more or less technical questions that I've been deferring about lagged velocity and the question of [the base] that John Balles raised What else was raised that was more or less discrete? Why don't I just throw open [the discussion] if people are willing to sit here until quarter to six to get more underbrush out of the way  As I read this conversation--tell me if I'm wrong--we probably can work more or less from the directive that we have before us I'm not arguing that people wouldn't want to change some of the wording, but I think it very broadly has this flavor of targets with flexibility that I hear around the table Why don't we deal with this language here, which is fundamental I suppose, on how stable velocity is? On the face of it, it wasn't very stable last year And the question has been raised Does it look that much more stable if lagged?  It's here Oh old Ml! I don't know whether Steve is prepared to cover that one, but it's a reasonable question  I don't understand it I would have thought that old M1 was much closer now What are you calling it?  That was the growth of old M1  Well, it's another way of getting to the answer But I am not sure what your answer is I take it Governor Teeter's assertion or question--  --is Has not the velocity of old Ml been more consistent than that of new Ml?  A lot earlier there was no difference, I'm sure  You're probably right  You say the equations are not much different They're on the opposite side of this Suppose you take a very simplistic notion and say velocity was averaging 3 or so percent for a long period of time I take from what you're saying that in 1982 old Ml velocity was about zero Zero is closer to 3 or so percent than 8 percent was--well, not 8 but--  SPEAKER(?) Minus 5    2/8-9/83  Minus 5? Okay, minus 5; that's right  We're holding an array of charts before us, upon which maybe Steve will make the assertion--I'll make it for him for purposes of testing--that there is no significant difference between lagged velocity and otherwise I think we can detect a slight difference in the most recent period, maybe only because we don't have another quarter for M1 lagged one quarter in that first chart I suspect the next quarter would show the lagged relationship with a steep decline I say that because we had a 16 percent rate of increase in Ml last quarter and nobody thinks that the GNP is going to approach an annual rate of increase of 16 percent this quarter  Interestingly enough--and I think Mike Prell may have mentioned this--on the credit flows we had the same velocity phenomenon We had something like it in the 1950s for very brief periods But you have to go back to the 1950s  That was the memo distributed to you earlier The other question that arose was about basing There's just a feeling that if you take M2 in the extreme form, if we have a target for the year and use the fourth quarter of last year, we are going to have a big number, whatever the number should be It's going to be outside the range of anything we've talked about If we use the first quarter, it still has quite a lot of [that problem] because M2 was rising so fast during January at least The only way to cure it is by taking as a base some period that we haven't reached yet It's much less true in the other aggregates But it's true in spades of M2 So we're left with this simple choice If we're going to use an M2 [target] and if we use the traditional base, we're going to have a very large number The pros and cons of--  Well, we can do that theoretically, I guess Maybe I just speak for myself but I thought it was the general view around here that it is awfully hard to do that this year because you can't deliver those estimates of the shifts with a straight face and say you have any confidence in them If you just change one of those percentages a little, you're way off    2/8-9/83  In that connection, I would only point out--and it surprised me a little--Mr Axilrod's latest estimate If I read it correctly in the Bluebook, he is saying the estimate is not a good one in terms of being a reliable estimate His estimate is presumably the center of some range; I don't know whether he said that or not If it is the middle of some range, what it says is that we have no basis whatsoever for thinking that M2 was high in the last two months In fact, it was a little on the low side I don't think that's the public appreciation That hasn't particularly been my appreciation I don't think that has been the appreciation anyplace, but that's what it says  I'm wondering myself  I don't know I doubt it, but we--  I don't think it's a question that's fully settled  You can't say it is not great Even if you believe Steve's number as a center of a range, which he says is a very bad estimate, all you can say is that it's not clear that it's high or low  No, no, I'm just--  Let me just try this Suppose we use something like the February-March base for M2 Is that considered compatible, in terms of whatever presentational objectives we have in mind, with using a fourth-quarter base for the other numbers? Let me say that the reason it's not clear is that M1, we think, was distorted    2/8-9/83  in the fourth quarter and probably not much in January So that distortion is already largely in the base Maybe that's bad We think M3 is on the plus side by some unknown hazy amount in January but not like M2 It's a small fraction of what M2 is distorted by and will probably be less as time passes So, there's a bit of distortion but not very much if we use the fourth-quarter base for the other numbers So, we use a fourth-quarter base for those two aggregates, let's say, and for credit, but an advanced base for M2  We cross that bridge when we get to it  It is a kind of break in the series  It's getting late Let me assert, and people can argue against this tomorrow if they want to, that for purposes of putting in numbers in these blanks we will assume that we're going to do what Tony was just suggesting We'll talk about fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter numbers for everything except M2 where we will talk about some advance date as the base Whether that should be February-March, I don't know In saying that, we would have to say that we assume that this [shifting] will slow down drastically If it doesn't, we will have to look at the number again So, when we're thinking about numbers, the staff's estimate--which is probably no better than anybody else's-- Or maybe it is better Let me reword that It's probably better than anybody else's but that doesn't mean it's very good But we may have to say something about it in the directive The staff has already assumed that just using a February-March base for M2 until the end of the year we're still getting some upward bias by an order of magnitude of--  From February-March?  -39-    2/8-9/83  All right, just keep that in mind as an operating assumption You are assuming that M3 is artificially pumped up for the year by nothing?  On M1 you're basically assuming nothing at this point from a fourth-quarter base?  Well, unless people take violent exception, let's make those assumptions as operating assumptions I'm trying to keep the discussion manageable  The other one being what?  You're talking about Ml?  I'm not saying just technically use the first quarter as a base for M2 because I think it falls between stools It still gives us a high number for the year because it starts at the beginning of January so low I'm trying to get over that hump so we don't have an artificial, if that's the right word, high number for the year And we've got to go at least to February to do that I don't think we have to for M1 But I suppose in terms of symmetry we could say all the targets begin in February-March But we run into the other problem in that I think it will eliminate continuity where continuity is possible That's what we have to balance, I guess  Oh, sure You just have to put in a higher number  But then we'd have this visually high number Arithmetically, one can reduce it to the same number  -41-    2/8-9/83  Who knows? This is somebody's instinct My instinct is the same as Mr Solomon's We can go back [to the fourth quarter] for M2--but then we end up with this horrendous number and are forced to say that it's so big because we're assuming X percent of it is shifts And then if asked how we defend that number, we say we can't It's a guess That's not a very pleasant position to be in However, if we [advance the base] for all of them, then people will say Well, you really took a free ride on everything for a quarter None of [the options] is totally satisfactory because what we're doing is not totally satisfactory intellectually  Well, except that we won't on Ml We were in this trap before because [unintelligible] the facts We get these changes in the beginning of the year on an M1 target; we'll probably be above the target in the first quarter for the reason Lyle suggested So everybody says we're above the target and we have to get growth down We may not have that--  If we deemphasize it enough, it balances  Yes, but if we put it on this silly fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter basis that we do, we can't raise the targets enough We're always going to start above wherever it is  SPEAKER(?) At some point we can raise it enough  All these fine velocity assumptions that he made in the Bluebook rest upon a staff forecast that probably has a lower nominal GNP than everybody else's forecast, or is at the bottom of the range, anyway, of everybody else's forecast If everybody else really believes his or her forecast and believes this velocity business, we ought to have higher--  Higher targets  Yes, but you're saying if your velocity assumption is wrong  With their forecast?  One percent, historically, would not be much of a bounceback  Well, we'll see you tomorrow morning at when--900 am?  Well, ladies and gentlemen, after listening to our conversation yesterday, it seems to me that this tentative directive is probably a reasonable reflection of our concern to have targets but be flexible So, I would suggest we assume something like this draft directive will be used There will be chances for editorial comments, but let me just suggest in the interest of focusing the discussion and expediting things that we put some numbers in those blanks And on page 3 of that directive I would tentatively suggest that we eliminate the alternative for M2 [that measures the range from] the fourth quarter to the fourth quarter, just for purposes of the discussion at this stage anyway, and assume we're going to [measure it] from February-March to the fourth quarter If we take the middle course of what the staff says is consistent with their forecast--recognizing that very large amounts of uncertainty exist about that and recognizing also that their forecast for nominal GNP is lower on average than other peoples' by 1 percent or something like that--that says basically 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for that period, allowing for 1 percent or so of shifting from that base  That could be rounded up to 7 to 10 percent, I suppose, or rounded down to 6 to 9 percent, but we're in that range Turning to M3, for the fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter comparison the staff says 6 to 9 percent, period That could be pushed; last year it was 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent, so I think we're in that range Whether or not we want to include Ml in the same sentence or make that a slightly more subsidiary sentence or tentative sounding sentence is an issue that we can return to But the number that they have for M1 is 3 to 7 percent; that could be made slightly higher, I suppose So, we're around 3 to 7 percent or 4 to 8 percent, I think And for total nonfinancial debt, which we really haven't discussed much, they propose this rather peculiar result in terms of past cycles of 8 to 11 percent, which they'll have to justify at some point--a little more than I think we've already discussed It contemplates in their forecast a further decline in credit velocity, which would be unusual during a period of recovery But I take it they're prepared to defend that proposition I just throw those out as a focus for your discussion Let's see what comments we get on them  But we would have to go back and look at it anyway if most of the shift isn't done If we get into March or April and M2 is still growing rapidly, or if February and March are distorted, we better go back and look at it again I think that's clear  Let's look at them one by one, if that's the way you want to do it Let's look at M2 Does anybody want to go above 7 to 10 percent?    2/8-9/83  In the area that we're talking about, 1/2 point is inconsequential There's a certain argument for making it 7 to 10 percent because they are round numbers and why have spurious precision  I'm not sure what that gains you  Do I sense 7 to 10 percent as a temporary feeling here? Let me move to--  This is all highly tentative at this point  Yes, I assume something like that We'll get to this language, but roughly, yes  Very tentatively  Well, let's get to that in a minute and we will reach an iteration Now, on M3, again just as a starting point, the staff says flatly 6 to 9 percent, for whatever that's worth  A 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent range is what we had last year Is it worth horsing around with the half point?  Why would it be too tight next year?  What was it in 1982?  Well, I don't know Again, I do not have a strong degree of conviction in the area of a half point  Do I hear any other comments? Hearing no other comments, we'll put it tentatively at 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent  We're getting to Ml right now  No M1 is now before the house The staff says 3 to 7 percent for the middle course on their forecast  You assume, though, no change on business demand deposits?  And that doesn't assume much on Super NOWs, I take it  We can make it 4 to 8 percent  10 percent growth in what 2 months?  Yes The editorializing is something I want to return to when we get beyond the numbers And maybe I'd make this range sound a little more tentative  We'll come back to that question on qualifying it as a target It's a question of how strong it's implied, right? It's not implied in this sentence but it's implied in a later sentence  I haven't heard any contrary view expressed strongly  Does anybody else have an opinion?  I will assert that when the width of the range gets to be 6 percentage points, we might as well not have one  Does anybody else want to speak to this point? I seem to have a considerable opinion for 4 to 8 percent Well, let us pass on to total domestic nonfinancial debt You have some more or less elaborate analysis suggesting that total domestic nonfinancial debt is the [measure] we ought to be using I guess what it shows is that on these growth rates it makes a trivial difference, so I'm not sure it's worth an elaborate discussion I'm just talking about the definition now--whether we use total nonfinancial debt, total domestic nonfinancial debt, or total domestic nonfinancial debt [plus net stock issues] They all seem to have more or less the same [projected] growth number  It's not exactly a target, but this has a certain history We can do what we want to do, but we have been requested to provide such an associated range anyway  We're dropping out the bank credit here-- and whether we want to do that is another decision--so, it fulfills the role that bank credit used to do I think what we do is look at this [sort of range] to see if it confirms a contrary indication of what is going on as time passes  Why don't you go ahead right now  This is if we took 8 [to 11] percent  What page do you have?  I'm not sure I understand this table that Mr Partee has called to our attention What column are you looking at?  The nearest equivalent here is 1975, if the forecast is right, and it's 14 percentage points--  If you look at this other column on velocity, however, you get a different answer it seems to me I have a little trouble seeing how we're going to justify all this debt expansion We will have as low a velocity number as we have ever had except for last year  I don't understand this, Lyle This number you're looking at is this last column, isn't it?  All right You're looking at private If you look at the total, this number is high relative to the 1960s and a little low relative to the 1970s  Showing credit inflation  But to state it the other way around, you are also saying, if I understand it correctly, with this relatively  -56-    2/8-9/83  small amount of private credit you think interest rates would decline and the GNP would rise as you projected  That's what they say they've done  A huge decrease in velocity    2/8-9/83  12-1/2 percent  We're looking at the middle column  I must say that Mr Morris' point looks pretty persuasive to me, Mr Gramley What do you say to that?  We had inflation 5 percentage points higher on top of it  What was nominal GNP growth in 1980 and 1981?  Well, it's a little odd that we have a very narrow range for the figure we don't know much about  What's the total of this figure?  There already is one in there  I don't know Who the heck knows what this figure should be, but I'm a bit bothered by a lower figure than 9 percent which is where it has been running roughly Presumably, we're disinflating during this period We haven't had a figure--  That's right During the inflationary period, we haven't had a figure as low as 9 percent  It got down to about 9 percent in '74 and '75 when there was more inflation than there is now  Well, it's 3 or 4 percentage points  -62-    2/8-9/83  I don't think that's true The velocity has been unchanged for 20 years  So large  That's where I start out De novo, the question I have is Why is it so large? Why is credit in the first period of expansion expanding faster than nominal GNP?  Well, I hate half points [in the ranges], but the arithmetic resolution of this problem would be a range of 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent  We just did, under your urging, for M3  Of course their argument is that we get that [bank credit] figure on a much more up-to-date basis  Do you have the number for bank credit?  That's correct, I guess One could argue, however, that these are all based upon a somewhat lower GNP than everybody is calculating  You are right Well, what do you think about this bank credit issue? We could write a sentence in here saying that this would be consistent with a bank credit range of to _ percent That gets another number in there; I don't know whether that's good or bad I don't mind saying that at some point We could use it as a transitional device but not monitor it, or put it in parentheses  Obviously, it adds another number and that's a disadvantage I think we ought to say some place, though we don't necessarily have to say it in [the directive]--we can say in the text of the [policy record]--that we have this range and it was pointed out that this was the practical equivalent of the 6 to 9 percent range for bank credit  Well, why don't we do that Take a note of that somebody Why don't we go back over this and look at the language, paragraph by paragraph I had a very minor change back in the boiler plate part In line 20 it says "Growth of M2 surged to an extraordinary pace in January" That's certainly right Then it says "largely reflecting" If I understand it correctly, it's more than largely reflecting It misimplies that it's only partially [the reason] So far as we know it may be the whole [reason] We don't know I would make a big change and substitute the word "apparently" for "largely" Somebody says it's just an arithmetic thing; I guess it's what you're measuring from In lines 12 and 13 it says "In recent months the advance in the index of average hourly earnings has slowed appreciably further" I guess that depends upon precisely what month you're comparing it with    2/8-9/83  I don't remember exactly what the numbers were I thought the January figure was a little lower, but I just figured--  Just take out the word "appreciably" Is that okay?  All right Does anybody else have anything on the boiler plate part?  That's not the boiler plate  That first sentence is certainly boiler plate, but I--  Now we are down after line 33 What do you have, Nancy?  The only virtue that it has is that we have an unsustainable pattern We've had it for years and we haven't changed the sentence  SPEAKER(?) Steve, what was the--  I think the question is whether we want to change something--this particular sentence--which has in fact been boiler plate I raised the same question Actually, it may be more relevant now than it was before in terms of the exchange rate I would be inclined to leave it But nobody's going to notice it because it has been there forever    2/8-9/83  Is there anything else in that first paragraph? Anything down to line 49?  Anything else in that first paragraph? Let me go to the next paragraph, which is bracketed It seems to me that that ought to stay in, but I wonder whether we shouldn't reverse this somehow I don't have any [precise] language, but something like "In establishing growth ranges for the aggregates for 1983 the Committee felt that M2 might be more appropriately measured after the period of highly aggressive marketing of money market instruments has been completed The Committee also felt that a somewhat wider range is appropriate for Ml" We need some language in there, I think, to make that range sound a little more tentative, consistent with the rest of it  Well, that would be all right with me And that would be explained a little later, if that's--  Well, it says that right now That's the last sentence I think the whole thing conveys that The first paragraph says something about that and then this paragraph concludes with it I'd make it "Those growth ranges will be reviewed in the spring and altered, if appropriate, in the light of evidence" etc Then what this is saying--let me just be clear--is that we may look at M2 [after] we see what happens in February and March and see whether we like that as a base or whether it [should be] changed And we'll see whether we have any stronger feeling about M1 at that time, which is before the normal period [for our review of the ranges] Okay?  No  No, we're changing the word "narrowed" to "altered"  -67-    2/8-9/83  [We could say] "subsided" It depends upon what one means by "highly"  The distinction is between highly and not so highly  "Subsided" is all right  We just talked about the tentative numbers for the next paragraph I think Governor Martin raised some question about how M1 is stated Let me suggest this It would read as it is except for putting an "and" after M2 and before M3 "For the period from February-March to the fourth quarter a range of 7 to 10 percent taking into account the probability of some residual shifting" Well, there's a question right there Do we attempt to quantify that residual shifting? I would say we ought to quantify it very roughly in the earlier discussion [in the policy record], but we don't have to do it here Then just make it "and for the period from the fourth quarter of 1982 to the fourth quarter of 1983, M3, which appears to be less distorted by the new accounts" And then say something like "A tentative range of 4 to 8 percent"--if that's what we have--"has been established for M1 assuming Super NOW accounts are not vigorously pursued and that the [proposal before the DIDC for] business demand deposits isn't adopted"  Is not adopted It's not "business demand deposits," but put in whatever the right language is  We say that specifically in the next paragraph, I think It comes up again in the next paragraph  Well, we can't determine this paragraph independently of the next one; I think it does have that implication So, whether or not you like the language in the next paragraph, it's designed to make it consistent with the next paragraph  -68-    2/8-9/83  I'd just say that we had to make some assumption one way or the other  Well, I didn't mean to give definite language I haven't any language here, but I don't mean to make it read as though that decision is prejudiced; it's just a factual statement of what our assumption was in establishing this range We can accomplish that  I haven't any language written down  Why don't we say "assuming Super NOW accounts do not draw a substantial amount of funds from outside of MI" or "draw only modest amounts of money from outside of Ml" And I think we could say "assuming that interest payment on transactions accounts is not extended beyond the present eligibility"  Either "corporations or other businesses" or "beyond the present eligibility" It's just meant to be a factual statement of what our assumption was in establishing a range  It just means that's the assumption that we made  I probably will say yes, anyway, but that has nothing to do with this  -69-    2/8-9/83  I'm not sure, but that's my impression I haven't looked at it myself  We're not quite to the following paragraph yet until I make sure there are no more comments on this one  No, I think we agreed to put that in the [policy record] text earlier, not here It will go in the summary of the discussion or whatever we call it but--  I think that's the reason Again, I think that is dependent upon what we say in the next paragraph I just think it's better this way if it has a little less emphasis precisely because it does have less emphasis  Well, that's going to come up in the next paragraph Let's turn to the next paragraph, which starts out by saying "[In implementing monetary policy,] the Committee agreed that substantial weight would be placed on behavior of the broader aggregates"  Why do you say that? I don't understand    2/8-9/83  Yes, but why is that only going to be reflected in M1 and not the other Ms?  I don't understand that If they're running high, we tighten up  Less automatic--  I think it's less automatic; I agree with that I think the Committee does participate; it's less automatic but it's there If we want to use it, it's there  Just to put a little balance on this discussion in that direction, my concern about that sentence on the top of page 4 was that it was too strong I'd ease it slightly and say "While the behavior of M1 will be monitored, the weight placed on that aggregate over time will be dependent on evidence"  My answer to that is that there's no question M1 is running high relative to targets We can make these technical adjustments, but it's running high when you look at that whole period But the relationship between Ml and the economy I don't think has settled down, to say the least And my problem is that I don't know how soon I would have the intestinal fortitude, if that's the right term, to say that I have any conviction on what the velocity is of M1 I'm not [just] assuming that it's distorted by these technical things If we had an undistorted Ml figure, I'd say Okay, it's undistorted, but what its relationship is to the economy, I don't know at this point  The target assumes velocity is going to make a comeback and I assume it's going to make a comeback, rightly or wrongly, to some degree But on the question of whether the velocity is going to be 1 percent up or 5 percent or 6 percent up, I will tell you I'm a complete nihilist That's my problem  I suffer from the disability--I'm sorry-- of not understanding Jerry's point in the first place I don't want to jump back on it if I don't have any confidence in the darn thing  Well, you have two parts to your statement The first part I understand--that it's running high and by implication nominal GNP is running very high and you want to tighten up I think that's separable from the automaticity issue where you just say Ml is running high, let's tighten up  Because it says now "monitored closely," you see  Well, I don't know where we are I'm a bit bothered by the word "closely" That's my only problem  Let's just monitor it  We have it now reading "The behavior of Ml will be monitored, with the degree of weight" Now to this credit flow issue We're on that sentence  I would argue that appropriate growth, which is obviously relevant here, is covered in this other sentence that says we're going to look at that again anyway I think they are two different points and I guess it's just a question of where we discuss the two different points  They both are relevant My sense, as a matter of drafting, is that this paragraph is directed explicitly to the degree of weight In the paragraphs before we said we are going to have to look at it again in terms of the range  The other possibility is that I didn't like it!  I will tell you why I don't like it [Unintelligible] is that I think right away the market is going to say What's going on with M1 beginning right now in February? And it's going to put us in a box; they're going to be looking at those weekly figures very closely  I'm not sure I see anything wrong with it in the future, which is what I think this wording conveys I don't like the implication that in the next few months we're going to be at that mercy  It doesn't foreclose that It doesn't say we're going to target it as the single aggregate; I don't think we ever did  We say that, but I'm not even sure how true that is Look at 1981 M1 was running low and we said Well, let it run low because the other aggregates are running high That's explicitly what we said  That was certainly a factor in it, but that's not what we said  -75-    2/8-9/83  A predictable pattern  Let me ask a question I just don't know I guess we're saying the opposite  I don't have any particular problem with what you're proposing It seems to me it is virtually identical to what we have here I would, frankly, take out the word "closely," which I think maybe confuses the issue at the moment But in substance what you said is the same as what this sentence says It's a drafting preference  You interpret it as a diminution of Ml at the moment  SPEAKER(?) Postpone it  As I interpret it, the sentence as modified by Mr Partee suggested a stronger Ml and I guess Mr Boehne interprets his suggestions as being weaker on Ml And what we have is in the middle So, I guess I'm left in the middle If I don't hear violent objections, I'm left with the question of whether the word "closely" is in or out  I would [too]  That's right We have all the options We can not look at the speedometer, we can look at it, or we can look at it very closely or we can look at it carefully  I think the word "monitored" assumes that if you look at the speedometer you pay some attention to it now and then It's just the degree of attention you want to pay to it  Well, I think the issue is whether "closely" is in there We can substitute "carefully" How many want "closely" in there?  I interpret that as a vote against "closely" Who wants "closely" out? You want it out  Well, everybody will vote in this general [poll] Who wants "closely" in? I guess we have a majority to take it out, but that was not the most overwhelming vote I ever saw!  Let's go on to credit flows for the moment  Yes, I assume that we're using "degree of"  That implies, I guess, some weight right from the beginning Well, I now have it without the "closely" but with "the degree of" in there On credit flows, this question has arisen before, and here is the sentence that's supposed to answer the question "Credit flows, while not directly targeted, will be evaluated in judging responses to the monetary aggregates" That's one of the more declarative sentences, I think  Any comment on that sentence?  Last sentence  If what is bracketed is left in, just in the interest of clarity, it ought to say "including evaluation of conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets"  Do you want to leave that? I think we are doing it now Is that the consensus?    2/8-9/83  Well, that completes the long-term ranges Let me go back after all this discussion [to the numbers] We put in tentatively 7 to 10 percent for M2, with a February-March base; 6- 1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M3; 4 to 8 percent for Ml, with a note at the end of that I take it we're using "estimated" instead of "established" for the 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent range for credit And in the text of the discussion [in the policy record] that will be rationalized with the present range for bank credit And that does, as a matter of fact, correspond pretty much--maybe exactly--to  alternative I I note again that most of you at this point have a slightly higher GNP [forecast], nominal and real, than the staff estimated in establishing the alternative II ranges Unless anybody has a further question, we ought to vote  Where are you?  I don't really care, but I don't know when those data come in Presumably, we'd be looking at credit flows against the background of that range; we get some clues without having that precise number [for total domestic nonfinancial debt] in front of  us It sounds awfully technical to me to repeat total domestic nonfinancial debt But if that's what you want to put in, I'm  perfectly happy to put it in  "Debt expansion" That's fine  Rather than getting all that technical about it, "debt expansion" is fine If there are no other comments, I guess we can vote  All right, we will go to the immediate [policy] I don't know whether we need any more discussion from Mr Axilrod at this point or whether we need a coffee break  SPEAKER(?) Yes, I think so  SPEAKER(?) [I need] a lot of that coffee, Mr Chairman!  Why don't we have a brief coffee break  [Coffee break]  We live in a wonderful world where setting short-term targets is affected by the last figure we have We live in a world in which we've just changed all the seasonals and patterns and all the rest As a preliminary, Mr Axilrod ought to discuss without the latest numbers, which we'll tell you about in a minute, what all these revisions did to last year's numbers and [this year's numbers] to date  There are several points The growth in M1 in the last quarter of last year has been revised substantially down It's still high, but instead of 16 percent it's 12-1/2 percent  It's something like that, if I remember January, with the radical revision of data for the week of the 26th, which may or may not be right, is now less than 10 percent instead of over 10 percent  But you show, [if] one can believe it, that the radical revision is promptly offset the following week, which goes into February, with a further increase the following week of some substantial size That now makes February look higher than January The data are subject to equally radical changes in the rest of February What to make out of all of this, I don't know  Well, we return to what we want to do When do we meet again?  March 29th A period of--  Seven weeks exactly I don't quite know what numbers to put in here And the question is whether we need any numbers  Well, how he intends to operate depends upon what we decide here  Without numbers, you're saying?  Well, let me just put on the table an alternate proposal for the first sentence and at least explore what we want to do in substance Suppose we just say "For the more immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of reserve restraint expecting that that will be consistent with some slowing of the aggregates" If we want to go further and consider what would be very nice if it happens, "Lesser restraint would be acceptable in the context of appreciable slowing of growth in the aggregates" It leaves open the question of how we quantify this or whether we quantify it at all in the directive I think what that says is that we don't want to tighten up in this next seven-week period as we see it now and we don't want to ease up unless the aggregates turn in a favorable direction I would make that view fairly explicit We can put in the numbers or not put in the numbers, I guess  The other thing is not an alternative; it just takes care of another possibility--a further [action] not for today The first one says we will maintain the existing degree of    2/8-9/83  reserve restraint; the second one says lesser restraint would be acceptable in the context of appreciable slowing of growth in the aggregates That would not be for today but if the aggregates came in low in the next three or four weeks, we would ease  Expecting; that's not promising, but expecting Just to be clear, I think the second part would reflect a view that right now we don't want to tighten, which is implied by the existing language but is not quite as clear If we're putting in both sentences, it says we don't want to tighten right now but we do contemplate easing if the aggregates are noticeably, or quite visibly, soft  Well, we have to decide whether to put in the numbers  What is soft?  I think the probabilities are that we are beginning a recovery But I would not discount at all the [other] possibility; the atmosphere changed radically from the last time we met If something so simple as car sales were to come in at between 5-1/2 to 6 million, the third consecutive month of decline, and suddenly production schedules are no longer increased in the automobile industry but decreased, and housing doesn't do much more in the next month, people's moods will change rather sharply, I suspect  Any other comments? There must be some comments Mr Guffey  All right, look I think the issue should be clear The alternative language that I propose says, I think, what you said it says It says that we will maintain the existing degree of restraint unless the aggregates come in lower in some sense than we now expect And that doesn't give room, probably, for a discount rate cut to the extent that that's [not] consistent If I understand you correctly, you're saying this is a little tighter than you would like to see it  You say regardless of what the aggregates do You are in effect saying, if I understand you correctly, that what we ought to say in this first sentence is that we will ease reserve pressures a bit right now  Leave it open on the basis of what criteria? How does it differ from doing it--  If we get weak aggregates, it is left open, but I think really what Roger is saying is do it now  Well, that's a clear point of view  Well, yes, I think you're forced to that Just to be clear I'm not arguing for or against it at this point I think you have to put in some language that says we would seek to reduce--or I suppose you could live with this language if the discount rate is reduced, which isn't your decision  Well, I think technically in the first sentence or two it could be maintain the reserve restraint but we'd do it with a lower discount rate We would just go ahead and reduce the discount rate on some bright day I think that would satisfy Roger's position, as I understand it  In fact, what we could say is that lesser restraint would be acceptable in the context of appreciable slowing in the growth of the aggregates or signs of more business weakness, or words to that effect  Let me put the question more modestly than that, without disregarding that question Do we want, in effect, to foreclose a tightening in the coming weeks?  SEVERAL Yes  Is that the general feeling? If we know that much, we know quite a lot If we want to do that, I'm inclined to think some variant of this alternative language I suggested, which says that fairly plainly, is probably right That leaves open the question of whether we want to go further, but it says that much at the minimum So, if I judge you correctly, that's agreed Now we have this Roger Guffey-Ed Boehne kind of approach Let's have more discussion  I doubt it, but I'm confused Just now I thought I didn't hear any objection--I just heard one, Mr Roberts--on not tightening in this period  Let me make sure I correctly identified it Let me have a show of hands of all those who as we sit here right now making the best judgment we can--we're not talking about [forever] because if something radically different happens we can always have another meeting--don't want to put in an automatic tightening Well, I guess it is the consensus; let's stop talking about that aspect I understand there may be some opposition to that  All right Barring another meeting and reconsideration in the event things change from the way people now see them, it looks like we're not going to tighten on reserves So, presumably we say that Now we still have the question What do we say beyond that, if anything? We can just say that  We've got to get to that Let me just see whether we can get to that faster if I am a little more explicit and say I interpret the consensus that was just stated as being basically the first alternative sentence that I proposed "For the more immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of restraint, expecting that would be consistent with some slowing of the aggregates"  Yes, "restraint on reserve positions" or "reserve restraint" "Restraint on reserve positions" would probably be more accurate  --some slowing of the aggregates"  That is right  Yes Now, if we have a sentence of that sort, a question still remains in that it says nothing about any easing at all under any contingencies The second sentence I suggested says we might do that if the aggregates are slow enough We have had some expression of opinion that we ought to be doing that anyway  I just find it hard to see how to write this unless we say we want to do it I don't know what other criteria--  Let me give you two alternatives I think the second sentence as I gave it to you does what you want to do  "Lesser restraint would be acceptable in the context of appreciable slowing of growth in the aggregates" We could just leave it there or add something after that, such as "in the context of appreciable slowing of growth in the aggregates, or further evidence of low velocity, or further evidence of unusual demands for liquidity, or evidence of unexpected weakness in the economy" We could put in any of those things  Let me approach this in baby steps Given the consensus we already have on the first sentence, would members of  -89-    2/8-9/83  that consensus object to the first part of the second sentence? That part, in other words, is that we ease if we were to get further appreciable weakening in the aggregates  Well, we'll get to that later  Well, it's a word I have here at the moment anyway  We will get to the discussion of what the numbers are and whether to put them in here in a minute Is the sense of that agreeable?  I'm just talking purely about weakness in the aggregates now I'm going to get to the other question next, but I'm just asking Is going that far desirable?  All right So, tentatively, we go that far Now we take the next step Do we put an "or" in there which may be "high liquidity," "low velocity," or "unexpected weakness in the economy"? How many want that additional step? We're now getting close  We never did anything so sensible as that  -90    2/8-9/83  Let me just ask the voting members at this point, and I won't try to pin down the exact wording Who wants to go beyond what we've just tentatively agreed to--that if the aggregates are weak enough we ease--and add another phrase referring to the economy or liquidity or something? Five How many clearly do not want to add any other phrase? Just to make sure, we'll see how many mugwumps there are on that side Five Five to five and one person who didn't express an opinion apart from myself  I guess that's right  Well, I asked originally for those who are [members of the consensus]  We're obviously rather evenly split on that point  We're not  Well, I'm not sure it adds a lot to include it, knowing we can always meet again I will tentatively leave it off Where we are is with the first sentence as I gave it to you and the second sentence with the aggregates in there and nothing else That leaves us with the question of how and whether we quantify this in the directive or how and whether we quantify it outside the directive in explicit words I think we can leave the numbers out of the directive, but it's a matter of choice I don't know what numbers to put in here at this point with these very preliminary new numbers we got We don't know whether they are going to show a different [M2] over the quarter but they show it lower in January and at this point higher in February, which changes the pattern anyway  We don't tell them until after the period is over anyway  One thing we could do is make that [relative to the] longer term, if it weren't for the distortion of M2  Well, the trouble is that we haven't the vaguest idea, I guess, what M2 is going to be It depends upon how fast these MMDAs continue their rise during--  I think maintaining the existing degree of restraint means that we keep the borrowings where they are now  That's the difficulty we're in    2/8-9/83  There's a great sense that these aggregates are rising rapidly M1 I think is For M2 and M3 it is not at all clear There were very low numbers in December for both of those aggregates They were very low And liquidity was practically nothing in December I am just wondering whether we can get some language along the lines that Henry has suggested here But M2 is a real problem "Lesser restraint would be acceptable in the context of appreciable slowing in the growth of the aggregates to or below the paths implied by the longer-term ranges" or something like that  No, no We can't prevent them from falling below We'd be delighted if they fell below What we'd say is that we would ease in those circumstances  Well, I'm not so sure But we can put in a sentence on M2 to describe that If we literally took this language "to or below the paths [implied by the] long-term ranges," we would say in the policy record that we don't expect M2 to revert immediately, given all these things, to whatever we said up above--7 to 10 percent We'd say we know that M2 growth is going to be high for a while  We could say, "taking account of the distortion of new accounts" I'm not so sure that's so bad  "Lesser restraint would be acceptable in the context of appreciable slowing of growth in the aggregates to or below the paths implied by the long-term ranges, taking account of the distortions related to the introduction of new accounts"  Well, all that it says is lesser restraint would be acceptable I can imagine circumstances in which we wouldn't want to do it because the economy looks so strong I agree with that But I don't think this binds us to ease if suddenly the economy were taking off and these aggregates came in low for a few weeks  I was just looking at that If we took the sentence the way it's written here tentatively, I'm not sure we'd need that We don't need any of that bracketed material I see  Is that all right?  I'll read the whole thing to you "For the more immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of restraint on reserve positions, expecting that will be consistent with some slowing in the aggregates Lesser restraint would be acceptable in the context of appreciable slowing of growth in the aggregates to or below the paths implied by the long-term ranges, taking account of the distortions related to the introduction of new accounts"  The trouble with "some slowing in the aggregates" is that when you look at all this through a microscope that's certainly true of Ml, but it's not true of M2 or M3 M2 adjusted and M3 raw, if you take December and January together for instance, are already low  Well, I'm wondering whether I know what it means now that I look at it closely Why do we need that part?  We would have to put in January It's just based upon one month there? As I look at it now, I wonder whether we need that "For the more immediate future the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of restraint on reserve positions Lesser restraint would be acceptable in the context of appreciable slowing of growth in the aggregates"  But I think the second sentence conveys what appreciable slowing is It's to or below the paths implied by the long-term ranges  No, I'm taking it out of the first sentence for the reason that you suggest Now that I look at it, we're not really looking for any slowing, except in Ml, from December- January We are obviously looking for slowing in M2 Because of that, I guess that doesn't add anything So let me read the two sentences over again at this point "For the more immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of restraint on reserve positions Lesser restraint would be acceptable in the context of appreciable slowing of growth in the aggregates" That may be ambiguous in itself, but once we add "to or below the paths implied by the long-term ranges," it tells someone what we're talking about, it seems to me Then "taking account of the distortions related to the introduction of new accounts" Maybe we should say there "particularly in M2"  All right, I won't add that Does that catch the flavor of what we're talking about?  SPEAKER(?) Yes  Quite explicitly we're saying we'd be very reluctant to tighten during these next seven weeks  I think as it stands it says we won't; that's right  Right And not tightening means something around $200 million [in borrowing]  It leaves open the possibility of consulting just as, if the economy weakens or something, we'd consult on the other side But clearly it says, barring any further decisions, we will not tighten Then I guess we leave out all the bracketed material And then we have to fill in the blanks presumably in that last sentence We currently have 6 to 10 percent Is that  where we want to leave it? I'm talking about the last sentence on the  federal funds rate  It might be consistent with the first sentence to move it to 7 to 9 percent or 7-1/2 to 9 percent or something  Well, I don't think that  Well, unless somebody has a strong feeling, we might as well just leave it where it was Are there any other comments? I guess it's clear in everybody's mind what we mean to convey by this In fact it's pretty plain, I think, in the main  Shall I read it again just to make sure? "For the more immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of restraint on reserve positions Lesser restraint would be acceptable in the context of appreciable slowing of growth in the aggregates to or below the paths implied by the long-term ranges, taking account of the distortions related to the introduction of new accounts The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appearsfederal funds rateof 6 to 10 percent"  This is all part of the introductory period  "Monetary and credit aggregates"?  Leave them out Okay We understand We can vote  I guess we have nothing else to do Is that right, Mr Secretary? [Secretary's note Mr Bernard replied in a whisper to the Chairman] Oh my gosh, I forgot to do that earlier! We have our Managers down there [with their transactions] unconfirmed  Mr Sternlight, proceed if possible Somehow we made our decision before we heard from our Managers!  Proceed, please You may say something so radical we may want to reverse all our decisions  Comments or questions?  I haven't been following this very closely, but I assumed we were aiming at around $200 million  And they're really aiming for reserve provision consistent with $200 million of borrowing if their excess reserve assumptions come out correctly And it's the excess reserve assumption that has been a bit off in recent weeks You can't expect to hit the borrowing on the nose because of that variation and because of other reasons But if the excess reserves calculation itself has been off what they had been expecting, there may have been errors in the actual calculation of the factors too I don't know how they contributed, but--  Actual reserves figures are showing a decline in January, as I remember  Any other questions?  February 16th  If there are no other questions, Mr Cross  Before we proceed, I am reminded that I forgot to request ratification of the domestic transactions  Without objection the domestic actions are completed Now we will go to the international [intermeeting transactions]  And we have to ratify anything we have to do on those proposed [swap] renewals if they prove necessary, as they are likely to be  No objection We will do that I might say that the Mexican commercial bank loan has been delayed beyond all conscience I guess, partly by the hassling over the precise terms of the loan agreement, which runs to 175 pages There are some substantive questions and the banks are trying to get all they can out of this agreement Of the $5 billion of commitments that they were seeking, the last I heard was that they had $48 billion approximately, which is close enough, I think, to close the gap It may not be closed in the ordinary course but somehow it'll be closed I don't think that's essentially what is holding it up It's getting the agreement on the loan agreement It's running more than a month after it should have been done and I [unintelligible] The remaining  -100-    2/8-9/83  repayment on the swap has to be out of that money, which is why that has been delayed  Well, there's always a doubt when it's delayed and, of course, the new uncertainty put in the situation is what happens to Mexico if there is a real oil price decrease That is a question to which I do not know an answer If it's small, I guess we can paper it over a little more and get a little more money someplace If it's large, I don't know what we would do  Carefully I think the Open Market Committee meeting is over unless somebody else has anything There are a couple of other things I want to mention But we're finished with the meeting with the date set for the next meeting, [March 29th] Let me say what is obvious I see no excuse for any leaks whatsoever from this meeting And I see no need for anybody to talk with anybody in the press between now and February 16th, period  I'm looking at all parts of the room I think you can just avoid any confusion by deferring any discussion with the press until a time not very far off, a week from now  We have these [individual] GNP forecasts I would hope you would get in any revisions that you want to make on those forecasts in the light of any additional information, including this meeting, by the close of business tomorrow so we can incorporate that in my  -101-    2/8-9/83 -102-  report I presume that we will pick out some central tendency, or mode, or something, in presenting those forecasts  END OF MEETING       Mr Cross, do you have anything to say about the foreign currency authorization, the foreign currency directive, or the procedural instructions?  And you have no comments?  In which one of these [documents] does the overall limit appear?  It's in the Authorization Have all the sublimits on particular currencies disappeared?  $8 billion Yes, but I don't see the sublimits  Where are those sublimits?  They're not anyplace?  Where are they?  But we do have an outstanding decision that controls individual currencies?  Mr Bernard  How far are we from the yen limit?  We're $502 million away from the limit?  The Treasury has those  Do I have a motion on these?  Let's wait until we get to your part on the [agenda]  Objections? In the absence of any objections, they're all approved On Treasury warehousing, [we received] a memorandum from Mr Truman This is something we review every year The staff's recommendation is that it be agreed to for another year The Treasury is still warehousing a lot, I guess  Would you like to make a motion?  Well, it's Treasury earnings  They are the Treasury's foreign currencies, aren't they?  Which we put in our regular-  On the principal, as far as--  The explanation, as I understand it, is that we just take the earnings into our portfolio and add them to our balances in foreign currencies  Forget the exchange risk on the principal  Are there any objections? Not hearing any objections, it's renewed We now have the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations, agenda item 6 We have a recommendation from Mr Sternlight to increase from $3 to $4 billion the intermeeting limit on changes in System Account holdings He had a memorandum Do you have anything further to say, Mr Sternlight?  This is still low enough so that there will be some occasions for a check upon your operations  Do I have a motion?  Any further discussion? Do I hear any objections? The limit is raised from $3 to $4 billion Now, item 6(b) is a recommendation to delete section 2 of the Authorization pertaining to direct lending to the US Treasury We also have a memorandum on that from Mr Bernard Are you going to say something?  It's against the law  As it now stands, we provide for an authorization to do something that's against the law I think that's--  I don't know that we've been that precise about it I think if they're stuck and they overdraw their account, we're stuck But I guess we'd get after them  A normal banking function in this day of lax banking practices!  We better get this changed If it [unintelligible] Patman [unintelligible]--  Do I hear a motion?  SPEAKER(?) So moved  SPEAKER(?) Second  Without objection we will approve the deletion Next is a recommendation from Messrs Axilrod and Sternlight to renew the authorization to conduct RP transactions in    3/28-29/83  bankers acceptances I don't know which one of you wants to address that; I understand we also have a memorandum on that  I have great doubt myself whether we should continue this for a more underlying reason than anyone mentioned I think the bankers acceptance market has developed far beyond what was technically thought of as a bankers acceptance in the year [Congress] put in the Federal Reserve Act that we can deal in bankers acceptances And I'm not sure we want to give this kind of official endorsement to the market anymore I don't feel strongly that it should be done now I think there's something to the point that withdrawal at the moment would raise questions in a rather tender situation in the market internationally So, I don't feel strongly about that But I do think we probably ought to take an early opportunity to get out  My main concern is not that I'm leery of them but that they are not what they purport to be They're no longer self-liquidating pieces of paper Well, I am perfectly [willing] to put this off, given the surrounding circumstances I think we ought to come back to it in 6 months or so as one way of dealing with it  Well, as Peter says, there are limitations on what we can do without calling attention to it I suppose we could just buy fewer when the Desk normally would go in I don't know how we would lean in that direction, I guess  Does our presence in the market contribute at all to the quality of this instrument any longer, in terms of what we will accept and not accept?  That's the only reason I can see for staying in it--if we exerted some discipline in the market But I don't think we do  I don't think we need a motion, if I understand this correctly It can just stand as it is but we will make note of the fact that we ought to review this, let's say, no later than September  We need to approve the minutes  Without objections We'll now go to foreign currency operations  Let me raise the question of ratifying the previous transactions, just to get that out of the way Do I hear a motion?  Without objection On the first point that Mr Cross raised--renewing the Mexican swap drawings--have we a motion?  SPEAKER(?) So moved  SPEAKER(?) Second  That includes the second [renewals], I suppose Without objection that will be approved Now, let me add to  -13-    3/28-29/83  what Mr Cross said I think there is some possibility here with the weakening of the mark and a potential weakening of the yen--there's considerable nervousness about the level of the yen and has been for some time--of more willingness perhaps to intervene should that weaken further I think we have a $500 million limit on the yen  That may be enough, but I'd throw that question into the pot too  I don't think we have much leeway in either of these currencies Obviously, we have very little in the mark I think the yen is the more likely candidate for early intervention simply because [the Japanese] would not be surprised if [it did weaken] I know they want to use their money; they don't use it because they're afraid of renewing the pressures on the yen And it's possible that we might want to intervene, if they did, if the yen in fact did weaken  To prevent it from weakening  This always gets confusing It's weaker in number We would like a yen that had a smaller number attached to it So, I think this is a relevant question I didn't realize we were as close to the limit as we are in terms of marks but it's potentially relevant with respect to the yen as well  Because we have to raise it We get the interest and it raises our holdings in marks and begins to threaten this limit  So, we don't have much more interest to be earned without raising the limit or selling them in the market  -14-    3/28-29/83  We're in agreement, I guess  I understand the yen part but I'm not sure I understand the mark part That's been pretty weak too  We haven't got a currency to sell, I'm afraid  We have the best one can hold relative to the dollar They haven't been any good but I don't know of any better  We had a little intervention, I think  Yes  Well, there hasn't been a real clear reason to [intervene] in recent months But there was intervention last fall at some point  It was not very large  Well, we have one on the mark and I threw the yen into the pot at this point, which is obviously less pressing since we have a $500 million leeway I don't feel strongly about it except it's not inconceivable that we may run into conditions where we would want to change that  There's no legal limit  That's right But this is all within the $8 billion, which is in our formal authorization  Not at this stage, no I don't think it's particularly a matter of Treasury policy, if I can distinguish the two They are ready to do it, if it is weakening  That has been the story of our life recently It moves and we're ready and then it moves the other way  We have a long history of trying to reduce it to arithmetic and I'm not sure at this stage that we can  In any event, we have a recommendation for $500 million, which I would support I think the yen is more problematical We could do $250 million as a gesture or we could do nothing now and wait and see what is needed  Certainly, it can last you I don't think we're going to become that aggressive all of a sudden It presumably will last you for a few days at the very least  I don't think we need a motion This is done by an understanding  Unless I hear some objections, we will assume that we have another $500 million on the mark  SPEAKER(?) Therefore, the total is--  All within the $8 billion  I don't know how you feel about the yen Let me suggest the $250 million increase in order to test your acquiesence for a little more intervention if the occasion arises  At times  I could never figure out a formula for whether it should be 1 percent more or less in a day I have no doubt at all in my own mind that the yen at 270, or wherever the heck it got to a few months ago, was too low and was greatly damaging to our    3/28-29/83  interest and theirs I have no hesitation at all in pronouncing that I thought so at the time and I think so now  The only contingency I see now is that the yen might weaken appreciably, contrary to the desires of the Japanese government and contrary to the desires of our own government as a policy matter  Let me hasten to say that I don't think we're going to cure the basic problem by a little intervention But it's a gesture  Although $250 million is not all that much, Mr Truman is correct that what we're basically talking about in terms of intervention is $1-1/2 billion of leeway and that is more than I suspect we will need in any short period of time  Well, the Treasury might not want to intervene just because they're worried about their own cash position That's the only-- It's quite possible at some point along the line here Well, what is the overwhelming sentiment one way or another?  Yes There is still such a study, which will be discussed in Williamsburg What I'm saying is not apart from that in the sense that that's part of the background But it could well arise before Williamsburg--like tomorrow  It has not yet been considered by the governments  Well, we've done a little intervening off and on--  --and we were prepared to do more if the markets moved the other way  We have been prepared to do considerably more than that upon occasion, if the market ran the other way--nothing very big But this directive, I think, was the same when we did a lot more  Well, I hope you're not suggesting that we would not intervene, assuming the Treasury was in agreement, on occasions that we decided met the criteria that have been existing for some years  I take it that wording has been there since 1976 when we were going through a great game of intervention from active to inactive to moderately active to moderately inactive  I don't know when that is  I do not want to suggest at this particular time that I see anything I would consider really large in terms of affecting the overall [composition] of our asset portfolio in any significant way Have we concluded that we have ample leeway for the yen for the time being? If we have to change it later, we'll bring it up We will change the mark Mr Sternlight  Comments or questions? You uncovered an overpowering interest--  Where is the CD rate now?  We haven't got much for them  I will speak for myself to the extent that I was involved Yes, because of a stronger business picture and strong aggregates [I had the view that] if we were going to make a mistake, it'd be better to make it on that side than the other side Also, I think in terms of free reserves we were overshooting on the liberal side earlier--inadvertently, but there it was We need a motion to ratify the transactions  Approved without objection I didn't want to cut off any discussion, but I didn't hear any Let's turn to the staff report on the economic situation Mr Zeisel  Well, the staff has presented you with a nice smooth middle-of-the-road forecast, I suppose  I think that's probably right--most forecasts anyway I'd be interested to explore who has something sharply different than a nice smooth, even, business forecast in either direction  Whatever you want to talk about  Mr Zeisel, would you like to respond to that?  Do you mean final sales have been running 3 to 3-1/4 percent leaving out this factor?  I think you're right [that] it is clearly a distorting factor in trying to trace final sales Any other questions or broader comments?  What are other people forecasting for the trade balance?  I think it's fair to say--you can correct me if I'm wrong--that your depressed outlook for the current [account] has not been matched by developments so far You were predicting a bigger deficit than materialized in the fourth quarter and potentially in the first quarter?  It was $34 billion in the fourth quarter?  Do the figures show weakness currently in commercial building--not the new orders figures, the actual expenditure figures? Are they coming down?    3/28-29/83  Up?  There's no evidence yet in the actual spending figures of a downturn?  Yes, it was up Were there any previous months that were down appreciably?  How would you change this forecast if the tax cut were rescinded or if there were another more or less equivalent tax increase before the end of the year?  Stop the recovery?  Do we have any overall information about what is going on in state and local government employee compensation trends?  That's pretty fragmentary  What's this--a higher rate on money market accounts?  I see that some [depository institutions] in New York are getting more aggressive again They're paying 950 percent  Well, it seems to be going up according to the newspapers in New York Is there any sense that it's going up elsewhere?  It has pretty good figures  But it's up a little  [Unintelligible]  Well, who has a case they want to make for a markedly different business forecast?  Oh, wait minute Mr Guffey was ahead of you  Mr Corrigan  That's not a--  SPEAKER(?) 2-1/2 years  Governor Gramley  Governor Wallich  I might just assert, on that point, that I don't think the international strains are getting any less and they are a little more disguised They will get worse Basically, there are more countries unable to pay--I'm looking for a polite term And the ones that have been attempting adjustment for some period of time --I think with the exception potentially of Mexico which has now been hit by the oil situation--have not yet shown a turnaround There is no confidence returning to that picture in a basic sense Mr Black  You managed to get right outside the range a good part of the time  -32-    3/28-29/83  Mr Keehn  A little inflation makes people feel better!  Governor Partee  How much are our exports to Mexico down percentage wise in the past year?  It can't be down more than 100 percent  Two-thirds  Well, I was talking to a Mexican central banker and I was beginning to think I didn't hear him correctly He said their exports in the first quarter were 15 percent of what they were a year ago  Imports I'm sorry  I began thinking afterwards that he had said 50 but maybe he did say 15  It's their total imports, but they get a big--  That says, though, that it went up from [the fourth quarter]  It's not possible, I wouldn't think  I don't think any of them have tightened up the way Mexico has in this time period That may still lie ahead but they haven't done it yet  They weren't in the first quarter either  Governor Martin  One aspect that Governor Martin did not mention, except by implication, is that unfortunately the savings and loans have gotten themselves more and more sensitive to changes in interest rates on the liability side of the balance sheet and they are even less in a position to take an increase in interest rates now than they were before  Mr Boykin  On the [energy industry] forecast, can you be more specific? Suppose the energy price stayed close to where it is now Would the number of rigs hold up? Would you continue to get the current amount of drilling?  It's a lot cheaper to drill now, isn't it?  It must be more cheap to drill than the reduction in the oil price  If you don't have one now, you soon will Mr Ford  Is he buying them?  Where does this drop through the floor come from against that background?  What do you mean we will pay?  Because private credit demands are colliding with government credit demands?  Well, I can see that very clearly I don't see the connection quite so clearly with the money supply It seems to me you said we'd avoid this by getting a much lower private credit expansion now  SPEAKER(?) Get if off now  SPEAKER(?) Have a lower economy now  I don't--  Mr Roberts  That was lumber you said was up?  The figures don't show that generally, but they're up sharply; there's no question  They have gone up sharply in price  Now he can convince a few other people of that!  I have run through my list Does anybody else want to say anything? I think at this stage we might as well wait and begin with Mr Axilrod first thing tomorrow morning How long do you plan to talk, Mr Axilrod? If people want to stay 5 minutes and get this introduction tonight I'm at your--  Would you rather stay or go?  Okay You'd rather have it fresh in your minds than think about it That shows you something, Mr Axilrod  [Meeting recessed]  -41-    3/28-29/83  March 29, 1983--Morning Session  [Unintelligible] given a lot of room Who would like to comment?  Governor Rice  Mr Solomon  Governor Wallich  [Unintelligible] I'm not sure At least you can make a plausible explanation, which Steve touched upon, as to what is going on in the broader aggregates I'm not sure you can in the narrow ones But it's a fairly straightforward story, if I understand it and if the figures are right, which they may not be If the credit figure is as low as the estimators now think it is, and that's subject to considerable uncertainty, we have no great credit expansion this figure is about in line with nominal GNP, which is what one would expect  What we have is a lot more intermediation through depository institutions when they are aggressively paying higher rates relative to credit market instruments, which is I guess what one would expect of that The amount of deposit growth among individuals is very large in the first quarter and the amount of credit market instrument growth is very small relative to what it has been; that's consistent at least with different pricing Now, that doesn't explain Ml, but it's a reasonably consistent story for M2 and M3, to the extent that M3 is high at all  Governor Partee  -44-    3/28-29/83  Only indirectly in the last [directive]  Let me try to develop the semantics--  --in an acceptable manner We have two alternatives here There obviously are more alternatives, but we have two in front of us, which some of the comments have been directed to I don't think the first alternative has no targets in it but they are depressed a bit It says "paths implied by the long-term ranges;" it has some coloration of a short-term mechanistic following of the targets, I think But the only reference to targeting is to the longer-range paths The second one is set out in more traditional quarterly targets But I don't read that as necessarily implying as much as you were suggesting, Chuck, that it is necessarily returning to the operating technique [of recent years] And I'm not sure Henry was suggesting that  I think these do reflect to some extent different degrees of emphasis, but I--  Well, that's a substantive issue But I don't read alternative II as necessarily implying that Nor does alternative I imply that we don't look at the targets at all  I'm anxious to get to Mr Morris' new numbers I don't know what they are  Oh, okay I thought I was missing something again! Mr Corrigan  These were bankers?  Did they have an explanation for that?  Let me just interject here, for anybody who has not been observing the figures, that we have three months in a row of very high currency growth figures I think if you go back 20 years you can't find another three months like this It seems to be quite general and nobody has an explanation  We've looked to see whether there is anything unusual for which we have any specific evidence They tell me we have no evidence Now, that doesn't tell us how many Latin Americans may be holding money in the United States in a safe deposit vault, but we haven't any evidence of it flowing in Maybe it is, but we have no evidence It's a very surprising development I don't know why it would go in that direction; I can understand Latin Americans buying dollars, but we haven't any specific evidence of that I don't know why they should be doing what Mr Corrigan says All I know is that the [currency growth] figures show a big bulge  A very radical difference  Well, it's not low relative to what it has been in the past when currency wasn't going up this rapidly  Well, it is conceivable But we don't find any evidence of real cash shipments down there You would think it might be tied in with this international financial and economic disturbance, but we just can't find direct evidence for it  It might be I don't say you're wrong; I just don't know how to find it directly That kind of explanation sounds more plausible to me than Mr Corrigan's, but the other thing is that it seems to be happening all over the country You read that Federal Reserve notes in all the Federal Reserve Banks are going up It's a strange phenomenon and I don't know how to approach finding more information Just in line with Mr Corrigan's earlier comments, I think it's worth scratching our heads harder and expending some resources in trying to work on what's going on in Ml in general in terms of behavior patterns, particularly Super NOWs  Well, we're not going to resolve it at the table this morning, but I think we ought to devote some further imagination to trying to figure out what is going on there But I don't think you were finished, Mr Corrigan  You're talking about directive II?  Mr Black  Governor Gramley  Ms Teeters  Mrs Horn  Mr Keehn  Mr Guffey  Mr Morris  You say you've been persuaded by Mr Duesenberry?  I have to ask what equation Mr Duesenberry has; our equation doesn't show it  It goes in that direction, but it just doesn't go above--  We've run out of volunteers Mr Boykin  Governor Martin  -56-    3/28-29/83  I'm not sure what you mean by leave the language unchanged; we need more than that  Meaning alternative I?  Mr Roberts  You're talking about March to June, I take it, when you say the quarter  Mr Boehne  Mr Ford  -59-    3/28-29/83  I think we have some coffee out there  [Coffee break]  Well, we've been all over in the various comments I'm not sure anybody is suggesting anything all that radical, but we've certainly explored every side of the issue My own feeling is that this is not the time for anything too radical or anything radical at all pending a little [more] evidence, as some people have said, both about the aggregates and about the economy We have a set of projections; I don't know what weight you put on them-- not too much, I guess The projections for the aggregates look beautiful, but they often look more beautiful than the reality I just don't know what weight to give them, but if it all came out within the ranges of any of these projections we'd be looking not too bad so far as the aggregates are concerned It would be interesting to know what will happen on some of the latest economic data I'm sure it always is interesting, but it may be a little more so than usual I come away with a rather strong feeling that whatever we do,    3/28-29/83  we probably ought to be meeting again before May 24th I would plan to have a telephone meeting or something, anyway Maybe we won't do anything, but at least 3 or 4 weeks from now perhaps we should reexamine the situation against the context of, I presume, not doing anything very striking right now But if we got a combination, let's say, of high aggregates and a strong economy, maybe we would have to be a little more decisive than anything I have heard discussed this morning We could have the aggregates coming out as projected and the economy not doing much, and then it would look quite different So, I would assume that we can meet again before too long, presumably via the telephone  I do not think we're in any position--and only one or two people suggested it--to go back to a more rigid operating technique right now I think there are a few more fundamental questions for the future if these aggregates don't straighten themselves out relative to business activity in the coming months But we're not going to resolve that question this morning In the preliminary comments we had a perfect split, as near as I can see, between those who like alternative I and alternative II as a matter of presentation There were about the same number in favor of one as the other, with some straddling in the middle But if one looks at the central tendency of the comments, assuming we use alternative II--I don't want to foreclose that question [unintelligible]--something like alternative B seems to come closest to the center of gravity There may be a bit of shading on the up side, depending upon whether you look at the [views of] Committee members or the others There was a feeling that was not unanimous, nor did everybody comment on it-- To put it in a slightly different form, there was a reluctance to precipitate a general change in interest rates, including the prime rate and everything else Well, we're on the margin of that right now, I suppose So, leaving a bit open the question of which way to phrase it in the directive-- although I would assume that maybe a little more straightforward way is to use the alternative II formulation--let me suggest, whichever formulation, something like alternative B with the same federal funds rate range that we've been using and, just to throw out a number, a borrowings figure around $250 million  Yes, but in fact we've been running above it We've been running above that partly because the excess reserves are much larger than I at least was assuming at the time of the last meeting I assumed that $200 million borrowing level with $300 or $300 plus million excess reserves and implied small free reserves That's what we were talking about at the last meeting In fact, we had a higher borrowing level but also a higher free reserve level than I assumed we were talking about How those two things balance out, I'm not quite sure I think it's fair to say that in the last few weeks, anyway, we've been a little more concerned about supplying too many reserves rather than supplying too few, particularly given the excess reserves we had earlier in the period That can be changed, but that's the way I think it's fair to say we were leaning to make the errors--not to aim for errors but to have more assurance against excessive excess reserves than the reverse  62-    3/28-29/83  $175 to $200 million in free reserves?  You don't want a negative figure there  It wasn't too bad of a past 4 percent real growth and little inflation  Well, it depends again on what one looks at If you look at the last 4 weeks, we had borrowings of $415, $331, $568, and $295 million; we've been above, as I said, all along But we've also been above on the excess reserve side by an even more substantial margin So we had significant free reserves during all that period except one week when we made a mistake--we didn't make a mistake but on the last day of the week we had a big shortfall We had practically zero free reserves last week they were minus one It was the week that we had the shortfall [unintelligible]  -63-    3/28-29/83  Well, last week they were just about $300 million, which somehow I have in my mind is normal; it hasn't been very normal recently If you go back to February, there were a couple of weeks that it was $300 million Well, how satisfactory or unsatisfactory is that?  I don't know whether I want a show of hands just yet Who has a violent [objection]? We have to figure out the wording of the directive and any modification of the--  That depends upon how much they rise It might be If the aggregates were running decisively high, obviously, there is some implication that we're going to snug up--to use that term But we don't use an absolutely mechanical formula to do it If they were lower, with probably some lapse--if it continued to be confirmed over a few weeks--we would move lower We would take account of all other evidence we had in that process and, as I said, we will meet again in a month or so We wouldn't be terribly quick to change but, yes, we would change though not be mechanical about it We wouldn't change next week because they were high for one week  Well, you say avoid it It could come along with this I don't think it would probably stay there, but again, if we were absolutely at this borrowing number and if we raised it because the aggregates were coming in high and the economy was strong, it would certainly be there But it might be there for days, or a week or something I would not think that that would be likely in the short run, but I can't say it absolutely wouldn't happen I would think more like Steve that, if anything, it would come down to 8-1/2 percent or a little higher    3/28-29/83  Well, that's not really my interpretation of that sentence I'm not saying that at this point I don't know what those continuing distortions would be right now We can always have an unusual demand for liquidity But I would say, yes, we would expect M2 to run higher than any of these numbers that we're talking about if this new money market deposit account continued to grow at a great rate of speed--significantly beyond what we're projecting now I think this sentence was carried over from a period when there were more distortions than now and I'm not sure it's quite as--  All I would say is that I think we ought to have some qualitative words that suggest we're not following the target mechanically, assuming that we use alternative B  I'm afraid the show of hands as to sheer preference would show an even split, unless somebody has changed his mind I don't know if anybody who has expressed a preference one way or the other feels strongly about it, because I think it's a question of how strongly people feel If somebody feels strongly about either alternative I or II and wants to reiterate a position or change a position, they ought to say it Unless people have changed their minds the sheer preference will be 5, 5, and 2  We can blend the two by saying "For the more immediate future"--or in the short run or something--"the Committee seeks to maintain roughly the existing degree of restraint on reserve positions, expecting that would be consistent with"  No, I was expecting it would be consistent with--and I'd put in--the alternative B [specifications] or whatever  That makes them virtually the same except it puts in the "existing degree of" words It tells you what restraint there is a little more explicitly  That is true  I don't see anything the matter particularly with saying the existing degree of reserve restraint would be appropriate "The Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of restraint"--or roughly the existing degree of restraint or generally maybe--"anticipating that restraint would be consistent with a slowing in the growth of M2 and M3 to annual rates of ___ and ___ percent, respectively The Committee also anticipates that Ml growth" It's a rather straightforward blending of the two  Yes That's what I am tentatively proposing, anyway  Well, that depends upon what you want to put down, whether it's "B" or some blending of "A" and "B" or some blending of "B" and "C" Other people want some blending of "B" and "C," which seems too low to me Why do we say "for the more immediate future"?  -66-    3/28-29/83  Is that previous paragraph going to be in here?  I would say "For the short run the Committee seeks to maintain generally the existing degree of restraint on reserve positions, anticipating"  Where do we have that?  Either way  Let's put anticipating in here; anticipating is a little stronger word "anticipating that would be consistent with a slowing from March to June in growth of M2 and M3 to annual rates of 9 and 8 percent, respectively" is what "B" says Then "The Committee expects that Ml growth at an annual rate of about  percent would be consistent with its objectives"  Then we could leave the next sentence I'm assuming now that we have the Ml sentence just by changing "anticipates" to "expects"  Well, back to Ml I think it's fair to say, whatever we say, that it has had an influence on our operations I don't mind it being there If Ml had been coming in at half the rate that it was in fact coming in, I suspect we would have been easier with some confidence It's not a very fine judgment, but--  Yes, I would say--  Well, 6 to 7 or 6 to 8 percent is okay I just don't like the half percents  I don't know about it being 6 to 7 or 6 to 8 percent  I'm afraid on any of these things that we have no forecasting record that suggests with any confidence that we're going to come within 2 percent, even But it makes it sound a little less precise  6 to 7 percent, I mean  The 7-1/2 connotes a precision that--  [About] 6 to 7 percent is all right  And then do we leave in that next sentence on lesser restraint? We probably have to say "in the context of a more appreciable slowing" or "a greater slowing" or something  Yes, "a more pronounced slowing" or "greater" or something I think that word "appreciable" ought to be changed in there How about "still more pronounced"?  No, this is all based upon a projection, I think, at this point  I'm reading the second sentence in alternative I as it's written  Well, what about the second part? I rather like leaving the "relative to the paths implied by the long- term ranges" I don't think it has any substance, as opposed to the other wording, but it ties it back to the long-term ranges  Well, put "Lesser restraint would be acceptable in the context of more pronounced slowing of growth in the monetary aggregates relative to the paths implied by the long-term ranges" We could put "or indications of a weakening in the pace of economic recovery," as somebody suggested to me at one point  Let me leave aside the borrowing level at the moment  Let me just repeat where I am on the language "For the short run, the Committee seeks to maintain generally the existing degree of restraint on reserve positions, anticipating that would consistent with a slowing from March to June in growth of M2 and M3 to annual rates of about 9 and 8 percent, respectively The Committee expects that M1 growth at an annual rate of about 6 to 7 percent would be consistent with its objectives for the broader aggregates Lesser restraint would be acceptable in the context of more pronounced slowing of growth in the monetary aggregates relative to the paths implied by the long-term ranges (taking account of the distortions relating to the introduction of new accounts), or indications of a weakening in the pace of economic recovery" And then the last sentence remains as it is  "For the short run the Committee seeks to maintain generally the existing degree of restraint on reserve positions, anticipating that would be consistent with a slowing from March to June in growth of M2 and M3 to annual rates of about 9 and 8 percent, respectively"  Well, just looking at the structure of this, I think we would have to make the point in the discussion that these projections of 9 and 8 percent, and indeed the Ml projection, assume relatively little distortion--basically none in Ml and whatever we're assuming for M2  So, it would be clear that if indeed that assumption were wrong--let's say particularly for M2--and we had some reasonably clear evidence that it was wrong, the 9 percent wouldn't be relevant It would have to be adjusted; that's implied by the sentence I left in, instead of on the other side We can make a more complicated sentence by saying that would be consistent with a slowing from March to June in growth of M2 and M3 to these figures and assumes that the distortions aren't going to be very great We could add a sentence on there  I think you're right about the operating technique in a narrow sense But I would assume by putting this in the directive that, if these aggregates came in significantly higher without a clear explanation in terms of distortions, the first part of the first sentence might well be overridden  If that amounts to anything, I assume we would have a Committee meeting But we are expressing a presumption here that with a Committee consultation presumably, if [the growth of the aggregates] were significantly above or at all pronounced, our [general] inclination would be to go in that direction  Well, as I say, with a Committee consultation  I think Chuck is right that the first part of the sentence is "maintain generally the existing degree of restraint," so we wouldn't change it very much without a consultation But the whole indication is that we would change with a consultation if growth were appreciably above It can always be overridden later, but that's the bias on it  Well, if it's below, we'd need less consultation, I suppose  That's a much easier decision, I suspect If it's really low and the economy is low, we're going to move  This does, implicitly, doesn't it?  Then we can put some language in the policy record write up Is this generally acceptable? Do I interpret the silence in that direction? If the language is all right, let's come back to the numbers  Yes, that's just standard language  Yes, the clear implication is that it would be 6 to 10 percent Is that right? Let me check what I assume is the easy number first; 6 to 10 percent is what we've had But we still have to decide what numbers to put in there for M2 and M3 and for M1 and decide on the borrowing assumption Basically, if we operated off alternative B, it's going to be 9 and 8 percent and 6 to 7 percent, as we just discussed  Is that all right? It's 9, 8, and 6 to 7 percent We're down to the borrowing number  Well, according to the staff projection it does It's an entirely different question what weight you put on the staff projection The staff projection says $200 million will come in with that growth path Let me refine it a bit If we have to have an assumption, let me presume the assumption is roughly $250 million But I will tell you, when you're sitting there [and have to make a decision], the mechanical assumption is sometimes not as helpful as it might be because you have to guess where the errors might be or whether you should delay today or go ahead tomorrow It seems to me the obvious point is that--if we said $250 million, for instance, and it was running a little high--consistent with no consultation or anything else, as these figures come out we'd err on the side of it being a little more than $250 million If [money] is coming in low, we'd err on the side of it being below $250 million The "erring on the side of" doesn't say that's where it's going to come out You can get two errors But in calculating how the Desk leans to minimize being off course, the Manager leans a bit toward being slightly tighter if the figure is coming in high and slightly lower if it's coming in low And that's all encompassed by the words "generally maintain the existing degree of restraint"  We're stuck in the short run with the fact that in implementing this from week-to-week the federal funds rate has a life of its own It goes where the market expects that it might go In the space of 3 weeks or something like that we can change that; but if the market is in the mood to fear that it's going to go up, it will go up And if they're anticipating it will go down, it's going to go down I would say right now it's in the mood of thinking the risk is that it's going to go up, which is why it's where it is  Well, my modification is that we're somewhere between $200 and $300 million, depending basically on how strong the aggregates are coming in and whatever qualitative evidence we have That's a relatively big range but, in fact, we've been all around that range in the recent past  -73-    3/28-29/83  With that kind of gloss I put on it?  SPEAKER(?) You're talking $200 to $300 million; I would support $250 million  Does anybody else have any comments? In the absence thereof, do we know what we're voting on? If so, we're going to vote Should I read it again?  The previously bracketed sentences? I'm assuming this is a change in alternative I and am working from there What I have there now, just to repeat that sentence is "Lesser restraint would be acceptable in the context of more pronounced slowing of growth in the monetary aggregates relative to the paths implied by the long-term ranges (taking account of the distortions relating to the introduction of new accounts), or indications of a weakening in the pace of economic recovery"  No  Do we have anything else on the agenda?  I think we would plan in any event to get together in a few weeks by telephone, even if nothing is going on But certainly, if any pronounced change is in the wind, we would meet in advance of that So, the Open Market Committee meeting is over  END OF MEETING  -74-       Does anyone else want to enter into this at this point?  Does anybody have any real questions about the recovery at the moment?  I think we're all aware that that directive has a clause in it saying that we would ease in a sense-- automatically is too strong a word--if we had a convincing lower [monetary] growth rate over a period of time I myself think it's premature to do it now after one month, with confusion about IRA/Keogh accounts, seasonals, and mainly the fact that it's only one month And the latest indication we have is that the trend may be rebounding a bit I think we just have to wait and see a few more weeks and not get caught in a move that we may want to reverse quickly But I think it's a legitimate question to be raised and to watch in coming weeks I would assume, and I won't raise the question, that the directive is certainly valid I don't think we have to vote on anything  I would say in that respect that we already have unbiased errors We are not trying to err--well, we never do try to err on anything--but there currently is no attempt to bias the errors, as you put it  We have a straightforward aim that is not always reflected in results We had very high borrowings at the end of last week Everything was more or less on track and then went off right at the end of the week As a result, borrowings started out heavy this week So we may have more than $250 million of borrowings this week, but not because we're aiming at that; it's just because we already have them on the books, which I suppose technically will mean that the markets will ease after the weekend sometime, maybe around 400 pm Wednesday afternoon But, obviously, we are and have been operating in a very narrow range If there is not a strong feeling otherwise--in terms of riding with the existing directive under those understandings and watching this as it evolves to see whether we do get a May rebound or not--I think we can conclude  SPEAKER(?) I think we've lost you again  What?  I just said that I don't think we need to talk about changing the directive We have a directive I interpret it at this point, on the basis of the discussion I've heard, that    4/29/83  we're not going to do anything or even talk about doing anything very significant anyway, but that we'll play an unbiased approach for the next few weeks and watch how things develop If we have a strong indication of a confirmation of the April trend, obviously, things will look differently; if the aggregates are rebounding, then for the moment, unless it's an enormously strong rebound, we will still be on track in terms of the aggregates Just to see if that's acceptable, I will pause for 10 seconds  Let me just turn very briefly to a couple of other things as a matter of information We have had a request for the Redbook to be sent regularly to the Congress We wouldn't want to do that without some expurgation I have agreed to do it, but I think it's better to do it in a non-Redbook form So, I'm going to be sending a request to change the format a bit I don't know the details; maybe we'll do it slightly more frequently Essentially it will be the same regional document, which will be given to one Congressional Committee--not necessarily for publication, but it may end up that way sometime down the road  SPEAKER(?) We lost you  Well, you didn't lose anything very important because I will be communicating with you in writing on what we're going to do with the Redbook  SPEAKER(?) Okay  I might just note for your information that we continue to get, because of budget resolutions or whatever, these various resolutions on monetary policy I think you should be aware that there is a more concerted review under way of the Humphrey- Hawkins Act directive, clearly with the intention at this stage of changing it to reduce or eliminate the emphasis on the aggregates How that will materialize, I don't know, because there's going to be a series of hearings and we will be testifying I think late in June This is a direct review of the matter by the appropriate committee and it will be rather interesting to see how and if it develops  What I'm talking about at this point is purely in a subcommittee in the House, the Monetary Policy Subcommittee Whether the other things are dead, I don't know There's going to be an attempt on the floor because it's not dead in the House resolution There is some doubt about whether they will even pass the budget resolution But in the Senate a strong protest has been made by the Banking Committee on jurisdictional grounds and I would think that might hold it at bay in the Senate If there is nothing else, I will be in communication with you on the Redbook matter in writing Okay Thank you If something amazing comes up, we'll have another consultation  END OF SESSION     Open to questions  Well, I don't know what I could say that's very meaningful I agree with you There is a rising sense of nervousness underneath the surface and I think a lot of it is related to a perception that Brazil is not doing very well That perception has some foundation; I certainly [don't have] any confidence in the Brazilian situation If they need more money, they are out of compliance with the [Fund requirements They] must be able to make a Fund drawing on May 31 and aren't going to be able to make it through [unintelligible] and the question is [unintelligible] There is some feeling that the Brazilians may not be the most avid people in the world in following through on the strong program I think that's a lot of it But it's also true that Venezuela is stumbling around doing nothing [about] their big problems Other countries in Latin America pretty generally have a problem On the more positive side, Mexican payments are proceeding on schedule One sees reports that they're going to need some more money I don't see any indication of that, assuming that the oil price doesn't go down again And while I think production is still declining in Mexico, there is a possibility that they have a little money in the bank and may begin to bring in some more and we may begin seeing some improvement before long There seems to be a little more confidence in exchange markets in the Mexican situation doing a little better  Well, we shall see But at the moment if there is any room for confidence, it's in the Mexican situation; for the rest of them the situation is deteriorating Yugoslavia is not doing all that well And, obviously, the interest rate level in the United States [unintelligible] with all our debts is one factor [unintelligible] the situation Brazil is the focus of concern at the moment  The indications are that they can meet that; they may need a little help in August because they do have to make up each payment they didn't make in August How big is [the payment] in August?  [Unintelligible] Unless there is some objection, we will roll over the [swaps] as needed in the context that Mr Cross described We haven't anything other than that, do we?  SPEAKER(?) No  Mr Sternlight  Questions?  When is this debt ceiling [issue] supposed to be cleared up?  Then we are going to get a whole bunch of offerings  Any other question?  We need to ratify the transactions [Without objection]  That's through the year that you're talking about I thought we saw some pictures yesterday that said the recovery so far is about average  Suppose you address yourself to the first six months, recognizing your projections?  You have industrial production and you have auto sales figures  Governor Wallich  I haven't heard that word for a while!  You don't have to answer that question  Mr Black  Mr Morris  Mr Boykin How is your capital spending doing down in the oil fields?  Governor Martin  Mr Solomon  Mr Corrigan  Mr Roberts  Anybody else? Mr Balles  I think you have a rather pessimistic productivity increase for next year  Mr Ford  I think we have to move on here a little Mr Rice  I guess we can turn to Mr Axilrod quickly for an interim review of the long-run objectives  You didn't say anything about M3 and credit  Well, I would interpret your comments as saying that at least for technical reasons there is no need to review the M2, M3, and credit aggregates There may be some reason to review the Ml aggregate but you're saying it's a little premature I would say implicit in our activity so far is that Ml is getting relatively less emphasis; that does not mean no emphasis I suppose we remain someplace in that vague area That is what I am proposing I see no strong need to change it [unintelligible] being consistent with that emphasis before the next meeting if you want Maybe we can just leave it at that--that we don't change anything--unless there's some strong feeling otherwise People are going to look at Ml and we're going to look at it, but it doesn't get the same mechanical emphasis that it had 6 months or 9 months ago or whenever it was  Well, we will look at it automatically next time And we don't need--  I don't mean we'd necessarily change it  Well, I don't know It will have to be judged at the next meeting  Oh, I'm not prejudging what our short-run decision will be All I'm saying is that Ml does have the same weight that it had before and that we not bother to change the range now It doesn't mean no weight We have to decide that after the coffee break If there is no strong objection to that, maybe we can just go along and [hear Mr Axilrod's comments regarding our] immediate decision and then we'll have the coffee break  I don't know about the wording in the directive; we can worry about that later I would only add one comment, for what it's worth We had illustrated for us here the other day by some staff something that has been going on for some time With the exception of Japan, the experience in almost all leading foreign countries looks like ours rapid growth in M1 for the last 6 or 9 months, particularly rapid growth in currency for some reason or another, and relatively slow growth in broader aggregates It's very strange You could almost lay these sheets of paper on top of each other Of course, other countries have had a different kind of business picture; it vaguely resembles ours, but they don't have a strong recovery  Well, some of that is going on elsewhere too, but I don't think at the rate of speed it's going on around here  It's a very strange picture They all look alike, although the figures aren't exactly alike  I guess any speculation one makes about the United States can be pushed off on M2, the disinflation process, relatively higher real interest rates--  I can only say what [unintelligible] for the future If we don't have a great explosion of inflation in the next year around the world, the monetarists had better run for cover If we do,--  The Germans--  Well, the Germans think that that's part of the reason, but I'm not sure you can explain it that way in Canada or the United Kingdom or Switzerland I don't know whether we have the low countries in here  One of the really curious things about this to me is why currency is going up around the world That one little component has had a very strange experience here and [abroad]  Well, currency could be explained partly by anxiety about banks  Well, let's have a break  [Coffee break]  Let me make one preliminary comment and then ask you a question relative to others I don't think these numbers on page 8 [in the Bluebook] mean a great deal, except as a forecast, in terms of the operative decision as to what we are going to do in open market operations It is now May 24th Whatever numbers come out, growth is pretty much in the bag now for May and June I think we ought to keep that in mind so that we don't put undue emphasis on a number a half percentage point higher or lower than another number used  I don't mean that we know what it is I just mean it is going to be what it is  I don't mean at all that we know what it is I know that the staff has projected a low number in June And I would just remind you, looking at the quarterly figures, that what we set forth the last time, reading down, was 9, 8, and 6 to 7 percent We're below for M2 and M3 [and above for] Ml Credit, as near as we know is running around 9-1/2 percent; we didn't have a quarterly target for it but it's within the annual target as nearly as we know anything about credit Now, having said that, do you want to quantify your comment in whatever way you want to quantify it? As I say, I don't attach much significance to a half percentage point difference in these numbers, but are you talking about some borrowing level or--  Just to inject a quick comment, I think that probably would raise the federal funds rate just above 9 percent At what point would you be happy, if I now ask you to quantify it the other way? If [growth] got below that in alternative C, would you not go that strongly?  I'll make one other comment and then I'll go to Mr Morris I am not sure that it is quite right to say we redefined the M2 base Obviously, we did in a technical sense but I think that it's largely an element of judgment If you put in the January-February base for M2, with the kind of adjustments that the staff took a stab at, you wouldn't get a much different trend for M2 during January and February than you got in the surrounding periods  Mr Morris  We're establishing the outer limits!  Well, we have a difference of opinion You say it's high, so abandon it; other people say it's high, so we better give it some weight What would you do operationally?  What would you do on borrowings?  Mr Wallich  That's a semantic distinction  -23-    5/24/83  What would you do operationally?  Ms Horn  Mr Gramley  Governor Teeters  Governor Partee  Mr Solomon  They're running lower  Mr Boehne  A comment on the case for snugging up It probably is [unintelligible] rest on Ml alone Mr Corrigan  Mr Boykin  Mr Black  Well, we obviously have a difference of opinion, but for the most part the difference of opinion is not numerically huge I am impressed, domestically, by the actual and potential strength [of the economy] It's moving pretty fast now, with inventory still negative in the last figures; I don't know whether they were negative in April or May, but we've had a lot of inventory liquidation and some increase in final demand We'll get a shift in inventories at some point and consumers are very confident, if one believes these surveys at all Ordinarily, I don't give them much weight, but they surely are going through the roof right now with a tax cut of some size coming up in thirty-six or thirty-seven days  The conflict is quite clear in all the comments people have made I don't think there's much question about the short-term outlook, which I take to be six months or so, for the economy There's a question of its sustainability or certainly its balance There are questions about investments and questions about exports, which are very real And I think that's partly a reflection of the budgetary problem We have a straight-out conflict between the domestic and international considerations I don't know that we could have much more of a pronounced conflict there That is clearly fed by the budgetary situation We cannot control the budgetary situation; therefore, we have no satisfactory policy by monetary policy alone We have problems in the credit structure that have been mentioned and would be eased by easier money, but that also creates a conflict I am left with no answer in monetary policy except a compromise in an unsatisfactory situation I am not so bothered by this Ml; whether we count it or not, I think we weigh it a little--more than a little I don't ignore it myself; I don't know that I'm pulled by it But when the movement gets large enough, I don't see how we can totally ignore it It lends a little weight to whatever decision we make  I come out on the side of a little snugging up, which we should be prepared to reverse if things come out satisfactorily in terms of the aggregates or if there are any real signs that it is intolerably--that is a strong word--or even less than intolerably aggravating the international situation, or the business situation looks as if it has much less momentum than it appears to have at the moment I don't know how to quantify that But if we do anything, we have to go to $350 million, I suppose; we've practically been there recently by accident and $250 million is rather a minimal level of borrowing I think all we are talking about is putting some very marginal pressure on the market How the markets will react, I don't know The danger is that they will overreact Rather, that is a danger but there's a danger in the other direction, as Mr Corrigan mentioned I would suggest that we just compromise somehow  They were only up to 9 per cent, I think, during the statement period  I think the borrowing was all fouled up there; it was much higher, wasn't it? We had the statement date and the aftermath of the statement date  I didn't realize the borrowing levels had been quite that high  A perfect inverse correlation!  I think it would be unlikely to go that high and stay that high with the kind of borrowing we're talking about I wouldn't say it wouldn't touch there on occasion but I think we're talking more 8-3/4 to 9 percent But I don't have any particular objective in mind I don't want to shock the market  I'm not so sure the prime rate would go up with a funds rate of 9 percent  I don't know exactly what it will be Mr Axilrod just gave you a swing of one half percentage point, which seemed to be inversely correlated with the level of borrowing  I don't think one can say the market expects no change A straightforward reading of the market says they already anticipate it  Where is the CD rate this morning?  I doubt that we ought to be easing right in the face of all this  Well, I'm afraid Mr Axilrod is correct that if it's below $350 million, it will be perceived as an easing  Well, we have to write a directive I'm not crazy about the one that's in here  I agree with that but I don't like alternative II either I wrote something here but I don't know whether people will like it "The Committee seeks in the short run to increase slightly the degree of reserve restraint, recognizing that while M2 and M3 are expected to remain somewhat below the rates of growth of 9 and 8 percent established for the quarter and within their long-run ranges, transactions balances have been increasing substantially more rapidly than desirable The action was taken against the background of evidence of some acceleration in the rate of business recovery"  We can refer to Ml  Well, there's no question that there's an international risk The question is whether it's more now or later We get more international risk if the economy gets a bit out of hand on the up side  If it's slightly stronger and accompanied by continuing good news on inflation, it won't Maybe interest rates will come down  Well, we're talking about what we're doing over the next three or four weeks  -37-    5/24/83  I think whether May is 24 or 30 percent is irrelevant  The fact is that it comes after six months of very high growth that we thought might be slowing down and there is some doubt that it's slowing down  That is correct  That's a bit of an exaggeration  SPEAKER(?) It's out of hand, though  In the midst of a lot of inventory reduction  That's right And by September it was going down in the other direction and interest rates were going down for a few months and the economy was rising  Well, I'm disturbed by the fact that we're probably already de facto, by the results, at $350 million If we literally came out below that, it will look as if the economy is getting better and Ml is going through the roof and we're easing up  Well, it may depend on how we word the directive I don't know whether anybody has any better idea on how to word the directive I look at mine and it says "increase slightly" and we haven't had that small an increase in which we-- How about "The Committee decided in the short run to increase reserve restraint invisibly"  I haven't heard any promising suggestions  It says both It says that the action was taken against the background of evidence of some acceleration in the rate of business recovery  That is the second sentence  I'd take out the last phrase  I have no problem with changing that to Ml, if that makes people feel happy I don't like the word "Ml"  There may be some way of writing this to put more emphasis on the fact that M2 and M3 are expected to remain--  Because M1 has been increasing substantially more rapidly and because of the business [picture]  I would leave out that part about the average postwar expansion  I put that in there to answer Mr Moynihan  There is no indication here of going back again if these things drop or the economy dropped I don't know how we get that thought in very simply  I would leave in the boiler plate  Mr Axilrod is pointing out to me, in the area of truth in packaging, that in the last 6 weeks borrowing has averaged $392 million This is a terrific snugging up we're talking about!  The federal funds rate was above 9 percent the week of April 6, which Mr Axilrod left out of this tabulation The federal funds rate averaged in no week above 880 percent during [the rest of] the period  In the first week of April the borrowings were $14 billion  Well, Mr Axilrod is suggesting that we go back to the language somehow or another that he suggested in the first place--I'm not crazy about it--about anticipating that growth rates of M2 and M3 will accelerate That's not very meaningful to me when they are below where we said we were satisfied before That's--  Well, that's an easy change, changing "desirable" on Ml to "anticipating," but I--  Oh, I'd suggest "increase slightly" We can change it but I think the operative question, however we explain it, is whether we say "increase slightly" or whether somebody else has some other words  Yes, that's the argument  In the context of reading these things, it reads--whether we aim at something a little tighter than last time or not and can't make it--  The changes have been so modest that--  I think that's right We can explain it differently but that's the substantive thing [Unintelligible] and in my mind what this is missing is any recognition, if this is what you want to put in there, that if these aggregates came in low we might reverse it, or if business came in less than we were anticipating, we might be inclined to reverse it  It would have to be still lower  Yes, but I think it's ridiculous when you look at it It says we're going to tighten up because M2 and M3 are going to be more than 3 percent in the next two months  Well, I don't quite have that operatively What are you suggesting?  -47-    5/24/83  Well, my problem is that I lose sight of just how it-- I understand adding this other sentence; I don't think there's any great problem with that  Yes The fact is we haven't got much restraint  The only problem with that sentence "Lesser restraint would be acceptable in the context of more pronounced slowing of growth in the monetary aggregates relative to the paths" is that it's fine for M2 and M3 but it's hard to pronounce a slowing of growth in M1 relative to the path  Maybe we could just do that  I don't think it says that It says that Ml is increasing at a rate of 24 percent and I give it some weight  I don't think it says that That's your reading of it; it's not my reading of it  That's right And there comes a point when the one going up strongly outweighs the two When the two are 1 percentage point below where they should be and the other is 18 percentage points above where it should be, my weighting says, yes  [It is] straightforward I'm not sure it's going to solve any of these problems; I'm perfectly happy to try it out "The Committee seeks to increase slightly the degree of"-- I don't know about that "seeks to"--"taking account of expectations that growth of M2 and M3 will remain within their longer-run ranges, recognizing the recent strength of Ml, and against the background of evidence of some acceleration in the rate of business recovery Lesser restraint would be acceptable in the context of"  What's missing here, but I hate to say it, is that the Committee seeks to increase only slightly  Well, I'm not sure if I read anything that people are going to like better  I suppose it will make nobody happy to say "The Committee seeks in the short run to increase"--or maybe to  -49-    5/24/83  increase only slightly--"the degree of reserve restraint, recognizing that, while Ml has been increasing substantially more rapidly than anticipated, M2 and M3 are expected to remain below the rates" That explains why it's only slightly  We're talking about such narrow ranges  Yes, I'm not quite sure what I said All right, let's try this "The Committee seeks in the short run to increase slightly"--I'd put in "only" before that but it sounds a little [unintelligible]--"the degree of reserve restraint, recognizing that, while Ml has been increasing substantially more rapidly than anticipated, M2 and M3 are expected to remain below the rates of growth of 9 and 8 percent established earlier and within their longer- run ranges The action was taken against the background of evidence of some acceleration in the rate of business recovery Lesser restraint would be acceptable in the context of more pronounced slowing of growth in the broader monetary aggregates relative to the paths implied by the long-term ranges and a deceleration of Ml or indications of a little weakening in the pace of economic recovery"  I guess that question is not on the top of my mind My first [objective] would be to try to say something that halfway accurately reflects what we think we're doing  No, I disagree with that I just think that is a plain misreading It says here we're placing some emphasis on it; we are not ignoring Ml when it's huge We've never said anything different  I think that's precisely what we're saying  I don't know how you can read it any other way  SPEAKER(?) For one month  That's right They're falling 1 percent below They're expected to fall 1 percentage point below and Ml is growing 10 percentage points above  I think that is an empirically correct statement  To me, the only thing we could debate here is whether we put in the word "only" before slightly It just sounds a little--  Or we could take out the words "in the short run"  Well, let me read it once again and see whether I've got it straight and see whether anybody can do any better  "The Committee seeks in the short run to increase slightly the degree of reserve restraint, recognizing that, while M1 has been increasing substantially more rapidly than anticipated, M2 and M3 are expected to remain below the rates of growth of 9 and 8 percent established earlier within the longer-run ranges The action"--we could say the modest action--"was taken against the background of evidence of some acceleration in the rate of business recovery Lesser restraint would be appropriate"  That's why the word only would help in that context  It is backwards  Like the way I said it originally  I think the result of that is that it gives a little more emphasis on Ml, but I--  It's pretty honest as near as I can see  That's what we're saying  That's comes as close to saying that as I can devise  I don't see anything dishonest about this It says as plainly as I can say it what I think we're going to do I just reject that entirely It can't be much more straightforward  Well, that's a nice question I'm assuming we're talking about $350 million  I think it is about that, de facto  I continue to welcome any suggestions as to how to word this, but I do not think the issue is honesty  What we're trying to say here, assuming we snug however infinitesimally, is that, yes, we'll give a little weight to Ml when it's way above and we'll give some weight to the economy looking stronger  The decision is where to put the borrowing level  I think what the market--  I think that's what we're trying to say It's very close to what I said originally  Not much  What did you suggest for Ml, Mr Corrigan?  I understand that part  "The Committee seeks in the short run to increase slightly the degree of reserve restraint" I think at this point I'd be inclined to put in "only slightly" "The action was taken against the background of M2 and M3 remaining slightly below the rates of growth of 9 and 8 percent respectively established earlier for the quarter and within their long-term ranges, M1 growing well above the anticipated levels for some time, and evidence of some acceleration in the rate of business recovery Lesser restraint would be appropriate in the context of more pronounced slowing in growth of the broader monetary aggregates relative to the paths implied by the long-term ranges and a sharp deceleration of Ml"  Does anybody like "marginally" better?  Yes  I'd put the word only in I guess we're as close as we're going to get  The first question will be what the borrowing level is and the second question will be the directive "The Committee seeks in the short run to increase only slightly the degree of reserve restraint The action was taken against the background of M2 and M3 remaining slightly below the rates of growth of 9 and 8 percent, respectively, established earlier for the quarter and within their long-term ranges, M1 growing well above anticipated levels for some time, and evidence of some acceleration in the rate of business recovery Lesser restraint would be appropriate in the context of more pronounced slowing of growth of the broader monetary aggregates relative to the paths implied by the long-term ranges and deceleration of Ml"--  Well, we can't say "more pronounced slowing of Ml" What it says now is "relative to the paths implied by the long-term ranges [and deceleration of] Ml"  Let me go to the borrowing level How many people want to hold it at $350 million?  One, two, three, four We didn't get six votes for $350 million  I don't know where all the missing votes are  Do we pick up any [votes] at $400 million?  $300 million isn't going to have enough votes here  It's pretty obvious $350 million is the weighted average We have to reach a decision I'll promote $350 million again Any votes?  One, two, three, four, five, six It would be nice to have another, but I guess it doesn't make any difference We'll have dissents on both sides  We've got to get a ruling from the chair  I don't think anybody can predict [the funds rate] that precisely It will probably be 8-3/4 percent sometimes and above that sometimes and--  It sure isn't much different from where we are And I can't promise you it wouldn't go to 9 percent  You get lots of chances to consult  Well, let's go for $350 million and see where we come out Let's have a vote  Well, someone's going to have to change the vote We're going to have to go with a split vote, since there apparently are people on either side  I don't see how-- Well, it only takes one to [unintelligible] There's no higher number of votes for any other alternative that I see  I don't know what that means If it means we start out at $350 million, it's all right with me  You know, for a $50 million difference, it's ridiculous  Well, I'll convert my statement; if you think there's a great relationship, you're voting for an eighth of a percentage point on the federal funds rate  Well, we will sit here until somebody has a better idea  So we know what it is, we will vote for a directive that says "The Committee seeks in the short run to increase only slightly the degree of reserve restraint" We're going to have seven votes for this "The action was taken against the background of M2 and M3 remaining slightly below the rates of growth of 9 and 8 percent, respectively, established earlier for the quarter and within their long-term ranges, Ml growing well above anticipated levels for some time, and evidence of some acceleration in the rate of business recovery Lesser restraint would be appropriate in the context of more pronounced slowing of growth in the broader monetary aggregates relative to the paths implied by the long-term ranges and deceleration of Ml, or indications of a weakening in the pace of economic recovery"  Now we can go eat, if we don't have any other business  END OF MEETING  -60-       I thought it would be appropriate to review the situation and confirm or review our decisions on what degree of slight firming is appropriate and whether we're within the directive  [Secretary's note Messrs Kichline, Cross, Ettin, and Sternlight reported to the Committee on recent developments Their comments were not transcribed A summary of those reports, based on staff notes, is included in the Appendix]  Turning to the decision process, I do not myself feel--as a matter of preference--that we need any vote or new decision today But I want to confirm that we have a somewhat higher borrowing level than the $350 million that we talked about As Peter said, after one week where it went somewhat the other way, we have been playing it cautiously--particularly against the background of the higher aggregates and the better business news and not wanting to mislead the market the other way--and ended up with a somewhat higher level of borrowings It seems to me appropriate to maintain that level, which I interpret as in the $400 to $500 million range at this point That's what I would like to get some judgment on, given the background And I think that is not out of keeping with the general directive and not out of keeping with the basic guidelines on monetary expansion that were established at the previous meeting But that's a matter of taste I would just look for concurrence, if that's your wish, on that kind of borrowing level, taking account of fluctuations in excess reserves and the rest  What I'm talking about is maintaining roughly these levels which, as I say, I interpret as $400 to $500 million The actual level of borrowings, if we get a big bulge in excess reserves or something, is different But I'm talking in terms of making the path something like $100 million higher, more or less, than the one we were talking about before  Well, I'll let Peter address that  In that connection, what I would be inclined to do--though it could be done another way--is not, as you say, rewrite the directive because I think this is generally within the scope [of the existing directive] But I would include in the written record that there was a consultation and that we confirmed that a slight increase in pressures was appropriate  Yes Well, it doesn't have to We could do it either way But we have some precedent for publishing something like that, and it might be useful  No We have precedents for all different ways We can have a vote; then we have to rewrite the directive Well, we don't have to rewrite the whole directive but we have to have something to vote on--a specific sentence We can just do what I suggested, which amounts to pretty much the same thing except we don't list a vote The bottom line would be that we reviewed the business situation, the aggregates, and the international situation Everything looked a bit stronger and the Committee consensus was that, consistent with the directive, pressures would be slightly tightened  The other alternative, just to complete my thought--and we have precedents for this--is that we can have a consultation and not say we had a consultation I don't know why, but my instinct is that we might as well say we had one  Oh no, we wouldn't cite that anyway It would be some language to the effect that we're operating consistently with a slight increase in reserve pressures That's all it would say  No, it would be stated as consistent with the directive And we have a directive that says "slight increase" All we're doing is consulting about what a slight increase is, in these terms I think it's consistent with what we've done at times in the past As I say, we have alternatives all over  That is my instinct I don't know quite why I feel that way, but it just seems natural to say we have this under review We have a pretty vague directive, so we're just indicating publicly that we've kept it under review between meetings and reconfirmed the idea of a slight increase in pressures But the emphasis would be on "reconfirmed"  I don't want to get too bogged down on procedures at this point Let's return to the substance Does anybody else have any comments?    6/23/83  Any other comments? In the absence of a comment, I will interpret it as a consensus, which is the way the record of the consultation will be written  I wouldn't word it just that way I would just say that we met, we reviewed the business situation and the strong news that was reported We reviewed the aggregates and they looked a little stronger In the light of all these facts, the Committee consensus was to confirm its decision that a slight firming in reserve pressures is desirable  No, I wouldn't have a vote It will just be reported as a consensus that a slight firming was consistent with the directive we already have  Well, in fact, it has already happened, but this--  I think probably so, and I'm not sure I see the damage in that ambiguity  You can be, if it's agreeable that this is the consensus Hearing no objection, I think you can go, Si I'll just ask whether anybody else has anything else they want to bring up and you go  Not hearing any other business before the house, we will stop Thank you    6/23/83  We're going to take a look at the system for various reasons The more we look at it the worse it seems to get But we'll try once again  That comment refers to the communication system Okay  END OF SESSION       Let me say now to the assembled group, with a certain amount of sadness, that we just had a little discussion about a problem that has become all too recurrent either leaks or gossip to the press about our meetings I think we're going to have to establish some firmer guidelines, which we will discuss at the next meeting But for the time being I'm afraid that I want to return, reluctantly, to the practice that we adopted a few meetings ago of, in effect, having executive sessions or quasi-executive sessions for the policy discussion So, during the meeting itself, at the appropriate time we will have a smaller group  Let me just say one thing further about this while the whole group is here I find this most distasteful and destructive to the mission of the Federal Reserve I don't think we can operate effectively if we get conflicting, inaccurate, or on some occasions even accurate stories in the press that are not appropriately timed and don't have the appropriate imprimatur of officially designated Committee statements Through the years I think there has been a good deal of appreciation of this within the Federal Reserve System In some sense we are probably under quite a lot more pressure currently in terms of the interest in our behavior and decisions, both in market terms and I suppose in political terms In my opinion, it puts a very large burden on all of us, if we're going to operate effectively, to preserve the confidentiality of what we do and make our statements in the appropriate setting It is obviously a consideration that wider participation rather than limited participation is desirable I understand that But I have to balance these considerations The wider participation is fully appropriate when I have a reasonable degree of confidence that the confidentiality will be preserved Obviously, this has nothing to do with particular individuals I made the point earlier that a lot of this may come from people who aren't even in this room but who have some sense subsequently, accurately or inaccurately, of what went on and may not feel the same degree of restraint So, it is a problem of the whole organization in that sense But if we can't be at these meetings with a feeling of security and respect, I think it's damaging and ultimately damaging to the policy-making process Now I will ask for approval of the minutes  We'll turn to the staff report on the economic situation  Do you have budgetary projections beyond 1984?    7/12-13/83  Assuming continued growth in the two years there?  What he's saying is that the current account estimate shows it worse  These are national income accounting figures?  You have a very low productivity growth in 1984 compared to historical cyclical experience, don't you?  Where are those new orders in relation to sales?  Just by a little Aren't the new orders barely above sales?  Now, if you want to be pessimistic, you can say this order increase is necessary to maintain the current level of sales    7/12-13/83  This new orders figure is for plant as well as equipment?  I have one other question, which I will insert You have credit growth rising more rapidly than GNP and you say that is contrary to usual cyclical experience Why?  You're taking a position that all this liquidity isn't going to be reflected in a higher GNP  I think I have on my desk a study from the Treasury saying that government deficits don't have any influence on interest rates I haven't read the study yet; I just read the newspaper reports earlier I now have the study Have you seen that?  This is not an econometric study?  Exactly  You have a chart on deficits which shows the current cycle against the median of previous postwar cycles What would it look like in 1975 and the subsequent expansion?  Well, we have had all the specific questions and we have all the projections, so presumably we have a statistical analysis of what everybody thinks Those should be looked at again for any changes you want to make subsequent to our decisions You have to send in any revisions you want to make in a hurry so we can prepare the [Humphrey-Hawkins report] I just glanced at these, and there may be some obvious explanation, but I think the Board members are in a relatively narrow range of 5 to 6 percent, fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter, but with half the year over they are 3 to 5 percent on the annual average It doesn't seem mathematically consistent to me somehow  Did they put you in as zero? Is that what brought the average down? Something there looks [wrong]; people may want to examine the consistency Maybe I'm wrong and there is some obvious statistical explanation, but with half the year gone and a similar range for fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter, I don't know how it comes up so differently on the annual average  The problem is the 5 percent  I think it might be useful, after all these specific questions, for people to express any views they have-- and there must be some that affect one's judgment--as to either a difference of opinion in general or whether the risks lie on the up side or the down side and how that relates to monetary policy  Let me ask a longer-range question Many people have expressed the thought, including me upon occasion, that given these interest rates--and you have essentially flat interest rates--it proved fine in the early stages of recovery that you and everybody else overestimated the restraining effect We have pent up demand for housing and we have an inventory reversal that comes along early in the recovery; but once we get through that, which may be after the third or fourth quarter, the economy cannot continue to expand at this rate of speed at those interest rates  Any other comments or observations?  "Runaway boom" is pretty extreme Moderating the wording "runaway boom," is there agreement with that proposition?  We've had a certain amount of monetary growth too  I haven't seen it  I think that's a tricky concept A borrower's income is taxable too [unintelligible] corporation We're not getting into that today Mr Corrigan  Matching it against the return from a new investment [unintelligible] to do it after taxes Mr Corrigan  If that fact is true, I'd like to know about it by the time I have to appear in public  On this debt figure You have an enormous current account deficit projected Is debt in those figures when it's held by foreigners?  No, these outstanding credit figures that we have  So you already have a high figure for credit, excluding that $75 billion or whatever it is of foreign holdings  Is that included in those credit figures? That's what I'm asking  The credit figures are built up from the debtor not from the creditor It says domestic  Well, if that concludes the comments that people want to make, we can turn to Mr Axilrod and we can have technical questions anyway on his proposals and comments We'll quit at 5 o'clock  I'm not sure I understood that next to the last sentence  You say that inflation might then be higher?  -19-    7/12-13/83  Suppose velocity were lower?  Suppose we don't have higher prices but lower; that could be some funny kind of outlook if we got lower real growth and more inflation  You're assuming you know what nominal GNP is, I guess  You raise a great many questions about velocity Let's maybe take the next 5 or 10 minutes for hearing what anybody has to say about it  If it goes into other accounts, then the answer is yes  Neutral? If it goes in the market, it will reduce M2, too  Did you have further questions, Mr  -22-    7/12-13/83  If we're approaching gut feelings, we're going to stop soon! We have Mr Morris and then Mr Corrigan  I think we will have to continue this discussion at a later date and resume tomorrow at 9 am in executive session  [Meeting recessed]  -25-    7/12-13/83  July 13, 1983--Morning Session  We can proceed as expeditiously as possible When I look at these longer-term ranges, the staff has not given us much alternative for M2 and M3 If one takes that as the point of departure, in the interest of moving reasonably rapidly, first let me ask the question, just for 1983 now--and I will leave Ml until later where undoubtedly there will be some differences What about the proposition of just keeping the same target ranges for M2, M3, and total credit? I understand that we're [near] the top of the M3 range now but within it; I don't know whether we're at the top or not but we're now basically at the top We're at about the middle of the M2 range The staff analysis says it's all right Is that acceptable? Is it that simple?  SPEAKER(?) Yes, maybe  All right Why don't we just go to 1984, again forgetting about Ml Here the staff has given us a massive choice, if we take them literally, of a 1/2 percentage point difference in the ranges I take it the difference here is mainly whether, in terms of consistency, our long-term posture of pulling them down by 1/2 percentage point or whatever is worth doing or not  Not theoretically, if nominal GNP growth is slowing  That has been true for the last few years; it's certainly true as an empirical observation  What is the nominal GNP growth projected-- I didn't bring those figures--for 1984?  The 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent--  Roughly to the midpoint of that  1985?  Yes, but wait a minute If I read this right--I hate to put all this weight on these things--for 1984 there are two rows that are consistent with alternative II, right?  SPEAKER(?) The ones through 1984, yes  At least through 1984 you're talking about 8-1/2 percent [growth in] M2, if I understand correctly  I thought Mr Kichline said 8-1/2 percent  Let me raise a question about total credit We have this figure running higher than GNP--I forget by how much--at least in the projections for this year; but it's peculiar in terms of history And we have a relatively high total credit target this year It may be appropriate or it may not be, but we maintain that relationship next year if we only reduce that by 1/2 percentage point along with everything else, assuming we do that Is that really appropriate? I guess I'm looking at the staff Wouldn't you expect credit to move more in line with GNP over time?  Reduce it, say, by 1 point or something instead of 1/2 point  Either that or we've got the wrong policy  -30-    7/12-13/83  What do you agree with, [Frank]?  I don't think we know a lot about the relationship of interest rates to GNP We didn't have a very good forecast six months ago  You would have thought it wouldn't come out  Well, I don't think it's just tactical or cosmetic It depends upon, at least to some extent, indicating one's concern about pulling these [ranges] down over time and whether we're interested in moving toward price stability or not  We don't discuss that subject much, but I think it's going to be coming up To what extent do we really want to get to price stability in the fullness of time?  I agree that that is pseudo-precision But I think what we would say is that the credit target is a little high this year relative to its long-term trend We did that deliberately And it appears all right in terms of this year but we don't want it high relative to its long-term trend indefinitely That target was temporarily high in some sense relative to the other targets and we're now putting it back more in line with what we think the long-term trend is in relation to the other targets  Well, it always looked a bit awkward to me It may be right or wrong this year, but the long-term growth trends of credit and nominal GNP are pretty even, if I remember correctly And we have a target that implies more [growth in credit than in nominal GNP]; it's high relative to the other aggregates now in terms of long-term trends, to the extent one can make any sense out of this It's just a question of whether to say--  Well, I asked that question yesterday I'm not sure I got a very satisfactory answer, but--  More intermediation and more liquidity is the answer I got  -33-    7/12-13/83  Well, we're talking about whether to make it 11 or 10-1/2 percent at this point  Well, not on the staff's forecast; it depends upon what forecast we have But I think that is true if you take the Committee's forecast If you take the staff's forecast, it's right at the midpoint, roughly  They are assuming M2 growth of 8 percent  Which is exactly the midpoint [of the 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent range of alternative II]  Well, let me divide it up On M2 and M3 we go down by 1/2 point At least nobody has talked about going down more than 1/2 point The question it seems to me is unchanged or down 1/2 point for M2 and M3 Is the consensus down 1/2?  That's a little peculiar  Well, it can be rationalized I think it will give us a little trouble; it depends on what you think about the amount of emphasis put on this I can see comments arising such as "Oh, you are even more intense on these aggregates because you have the range narrower"  I heard two people say they didn't want them changed at all Is it only two people? Well, it seems that it's only two people And I haven't heard anybody say he or she wants the tops below 9-1/2 or 9 percent, respectively Is that true?  I think we are between Bluebook alternatives II and III at this point There are pluses and minuses for both of them The idea of narrowing a range here doesn't particularly appeal to me but I guess it can be rationalized  I think we can justify it intellectually and say that we don't really conceive of it being below 7 or 6-1/2 percent, or whatever, and we're worried on the up side But it does have this feeling of more precision I don't feel strongly one way or the other  Let's have a show of hands Who would prefer alternative II? I'm just talking about M2 and M3--moving them both down by 1/2 point Well, I'm not counting; I don't know whether you're counting There seem to be quite a few hands up How many want it down 1/2 point on the top and nothing on the bottom? That seems to be a clear minority  Now, let me turn to total credit Nothing here is settled finally Just forget about alternative III for the moment For total credit, if we're consistent--well, we don't have to be completely consistent between the two, I suppose--the question is whether to go down 1/2 or 1 point  [Unintelligible] gives you 9 percent as the midpoint I don't know how all these forecasts will come out, but we're going to publish these forecasts as modified in the next day or  -36-    7/12-13/83  two along, [although there are some] people who wouldn't want to modify them They must average about 9-5/8 percent or something like that for nominal GNP  I think that's the question Do we want to lower credit relative to the other aggregates, given that in some long-term sense it's high now relative to the other aggregates?  Well, I don't know whether that's the right interpretation It may be that these numbers are high because of the big deficit and that in a sense we're accommodating some of the consequences of the deficit If that's the reason that they're high, then the policy question is whether we want to accommodate that  I don't think this is too big a deal What we would say is the opposite--that we implied [omniscience] in saying credit was going to be relatively high this year, which may be right, but it's not going to continue next year  Well into a recovery--I forget--should credit cyclically be rising faster or slower than GNP typically?  Well, who wants to reduce it by a half point, the same [amount] as the others? Who wants to reduce it by one point?  SPEAKER(?) We have nonmembers voting here, so you're confusing--  Well, let's leave that just for the moment and we'll get to Ml Let me approach M1 by indirection There's a question of what weight to put on Ml and, whether or not it's in the directive, what we would say about it in the Humphrey-Hawkins report It may be helpful to approach it in reverse Look at 1984 first This proposal of essentially 4 to 8 percent again, which is what we have now and are widely exceeding, would imply unchanged or a small increase in velocity to a sizable increase in velocity but less than typical  It implies plus 2 or a little more on the staff forecast It would imply more on the Committee members' forecasts, which are somewhat higher than the staff forecast  Well, we're going to have to discuss that, but I--  I don't remember  Well, with any of these I think we have to say the relationship has changed; we're uncertain about the degree But even with the 8 percent we are implying a little increase in velocity That wouldn't be unusual during this period But I--  With 8 percent, but not with 4 percent  Let's discuss it together I guess that is one alternative We can start out again on Ml and then have the same target for the next year that we have for this year  If he's right, it will all work out nicely If he's not right, then we will have rebased and be over [the rebased range] I think if we rebase it looks as if we're attaching more importance to it somehow  That's the extreme view of what we could do--not have any target for this year or next year  So, it's not just what we say [via] the numbers, it is what we say We can say it's a target but we are giving it whatever weight we want to say  Just to be sure That 7 to 11 percent implies 6 percent from now on to hit 11 percent [Ml growth] for the year?  Yes  Presumably, it's 81 percent on a second quarter-to-fourth quarter basis, which is exactly the--  As I understand this, if we rebase at Q2, the 8 percent would be the same as 11 percent for the year  Well, it's 81 percent  Well, let me try this Suppose we rebase and use 4 to 8 percent and say that we think velocity has changed some but we don't know how much The 8 percent would allow for very little increase in velocity, which is possible, given what has happened The 4 percent would allow for an almost normal increase in velocity from here on out So, we're encompassing that kind of range We're still quite uncertain about it and--this will be the tricky part--we're not putting full weight [on Ml], certainly Just how much weight we say we are putting on it is the fuzzy area, I suppose We could go all the way to saying that we're monitoring [Ml] but putting very little  -41-    7/12-13/83  weight on it That's one extreme Or we could say we have a pretty wide range and we would get concerned if [Ml growth] was too far outside that range in either direction, but we're not following it mechanically Some place in that range of--  What would you do for the next year?  The more I think about this, I believe the simplest thing to do is to rebase, if we're going to have a target for next year, instead of having a complete hiatus The key issue is what we say about the degree of weight that we give to Ml  That is correct  I'm not sure, but I think what you're saying is that if we had this 7 to 11 percent or whatever it is, we'd also be above the 11 percent  It wouldn't be as much above the 11 percent, I guess  I think it's also true that while the M1 velocity has been off historically, the economy is doing a lot better than any other forecast implied except an Ml forecast  A strict Ml forecast would have given much higher [GNP growth] than actually took place, but the fact is we are higher than other forecasts, which suggests that there's no place in [unintelligible] it  Stabilizing probably around a different trend  We don't know precisely, but what I'd be inclined to say is that the 3 to 4 percent increase in velocity that we counted on we no longer count on  SEVERAL Right  I think it's a combination of the economy being strong and M1 being so high People wouldn't be so sensitive if the economy were weak and Ml were even 3 percentage points from its range  Let me suggest something with great hesitancy because I'm not sure I like it visually but substantively it gives me an easy explanation Make the range 5 to 9 percent and say that the 9 percent allows for no change in velocity during the expansion Maybe that's the new trend of things and we want to allow for that possibility The 5 percent allows for a fairly normal, or almost normal, cyclical change in velocity from now on And that's precisely why we picked 5 to 9 percent, because the 9 percent allows for no change in velocity and the 5 percent allows for a sizable change in velocity That still leaves open how much weight we put on it, but we picked 5 to 9 percent because that covers the probable range of uncertainty that we see in velocity  Yes, because it is consistent with the nominal GNP growth that we are predicting Precisely  [Unintelligible] That is my starting point We are going to be presenting a forecast of roughly 9 percent or a bit more than 9 percent for nominal GNP next year, so we relate it to that  I don't particularly like showing this high a range and that's my reservation about it, but I can see a rather pat explanation being given--precisely We projected, roughly, 9 percent nominal GNP growth next year, gentlemen We think by implication that that is a satisfactory outcome We feel that we are in the midst of velocity changes of a continuing sort that we can't quite identify--or we may say that we're not putting full weight on Ml Based upon everything we've seen so far and assuming we're in a period of expansion, we think it's likely that the velocity pattern will not change so greatly that we would actually get a bigger increase in Ml from now on than in the nominal GNP, so that's why we picked 9 percent at the top The 5 percent allows for a less than normal, but not all that much less than normal, increase in velocity in this particular cyclical period So, we kind of span as best we can the range of uncertainty that we have  I don't think I quite said that It may have sounded that way when I worded it But I can word it the other way that if there is no change in velocity, the 9 percent would be the appropriate [number] That gets the causality the other way And if there is a change in velocity, we would want to have a lower M1 and that's why we have the lower end [at 5 percent]  That would be too high  Yes, but what I would be saying implicitly is that if we have 4 percent velocity growth we may not know it until ex post That's the problem But if we thought we were getting that, the 9 percent is too high  Well, as I say, I throw it out as a suggestion The one thing I don't like about it is that it looks pretty high on the face of it  I'm attracted to it simply because I think it's fairly easy to explain, given the GNP forecast we have--if we think that's an appropriate GNP forecast Actually, it's going to come out 9-1/2 percent, I guess I don't know where the central tendency is; we have these medians here But I'm assuming the central tendency is someplace around--8-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent would be ideal I suppose--8-3/4 to 9-3/4 percent or 8-3/4 to 9-1/2 percent or someplace in that area  That's kind of fine-tuning in an uncertain period  We have to talk about next year; we don't necessarily have to give an M1 target But if we didn't give one for this year, I don't see much reason not to give one for next year We can say we don't pay much attention to it, but--  We are going to have great trouble getting a central tendency when I look at these numbers We have a whole bunch at a high level and we have a bunch at a lower level and there's nothing in between It worked out pretty well last time, but it ceratainly doesn't work out very well this time if my glance at these is clear The central tendency--  -48-    7/12-13/83  The central tendency on the nominal GNP will come out at 9-1/2 to 10-1/4 percent or maybe even 9-1/2 to 10 percent We have 10 people between 9-1/2 and 10 percent, roughly, or 11 people between 9-1/2 and 102 percent So, I guess we can say the central tendency is roughly 9-1/2 to 10 percent  I think what we would say with 4 to 8 percent in any event is that we are assuming a little increase in velocity  Actually 4 percent would give a 5-1/2 percent increase in velocity; that's pretty high even by historical standards  I don't know Maybe I'm beginning to like 5 to 9 percent  Let's look at what we're saying with 4 to 8 percent If we take the average of these forecasts, we're saying we expect velocity to be between plus 6 and plus 2 Do you want to adjust the 4 to 8 percent or would you say between plus 5 and plus 1? That's the difference  Well, all of these would allow some velocity gain The midpoint would be a plus 3 or 4 velocity gain  Are you saying velocity may rise more than the normal cyclical pattern?  Oh, I think we have to say that anyway for next year The official is less different than--  The only difficulty with 4 to 8 percent for next year--it's not a substantive one, I guess--is that we're going to be projecting, unless these [forecasts] change, a 9-3/4 to 10 percent average nominal GNP That projection is going to be published And a 4 to 8 percent range says that velocity is going to increase by from 2 percent to 6 percent Is that what we want to say?  And the average of that was 9 percent, roughly?  And we said 4 to 8 percent against the background of cyclical increases in velocity of 6 percent or more in the first year recovery Now we're in the second year of recovery, and we've had two more quarters of low velocity  Well, any of these ranges allows for an increase in velocity And they all assume that [some] degree of normality will return; it's just a question of the degree  Does anybody have the figures handy as to what the velocity has been historically in the second year of expansion?  Only 27?  Basing it on June seems awfully fussy to me  What are the Administration's and CBO's projections for nominal GNP next year?  It sticks in my craw a bit--we're back at 9-3/4 percent That's about where we will be If we say 4 to 8 percent, we're saying velocity is going to increase by the normal cyclical amount even if we're in the high end of the range  On 8 or technically 7--  The argument that I hear against 5 to 9 percent, apart from something cosmetic, is Suppose velocity is high and we want to tighten up and we're well within the 9 percent? I guess the answer to that has to be that if that's true, M2 and M3 and credit must be running high  We can make some arguments that it may go up; we can't make any that it may not because then we have to--  Gosh, I would hate to rebase on June but--  I'd almost prefer to make it 8 to 12 percent for the year  7 to 11 percent is exactly the same as [8] to 12 percent based on the second quarter  SPEAKER(?) Yes  What has it been so far?  If it's 138 percent now, we're almost at 14 percent so if we have 11 percent for the year, it has to come down to 8 percent for the rest of the year That's simple arithmetic  With that kind of increase in the third quarter, we'd have to have, say, 5 percent for the fourth quarter  And July looks as if it's going to be high  Well, I would suggest that we go to the short-term ranges The more one looks at the problems in the next quarter, it bears upon the reality of any number we put down for the rest of this year So, let us move to the short-term ranges We can do that by dispensing with the Managers' reports at this point, to avoid any interruption in the continuity What do we have now for the short-run ranges?  That produces what quarterly average? It's 10 percent or something that like?  I'm not quite sure I understand what you just said You say when you really look at it, you're not sure alternative A is inconsistent with some modest tightening of the money market?  Well, you're talking about the funds rate That might be consistent with the rest of the market being where it is, if [market participants] thought that was the end of [the tightening] But they may not think it's the end of it  We can't interpret the borrowing level without some allowance for excess reserves We've had borrowing much higher but we have had a lot of excess reserves I think the change in free reserves or net borrowed reserves is roughly what we contemplated, but we have been getting a lot of borrowing in the beginning of the week and the market gets easy  SPEAKER(?) Because banks have so many excess reserves  In some sense it is probably better to talk in those terms or in some combination of the two I think of the borrowing number as shorthand for something that's associated with $350 million or so of excess reserves, which used to be normal For several months, at least, it has been well above that I think the distribution of reserves results in some easing influence even though  -60-    7/12-13/83  the borrowing is high So, implicitly I look at the net borrowed reserves  Well, I think we ought to have some modest degree of tightening here, but it's a matter of degree  Present rate of growth? I'm not quite sure what you mean by the present rate It would accommodate--  -62-    7/12-13/83  I thought it was running above that Oh, you mean from June Okay  That's the problem When we get into a phase of change they keep anticipating more and more until something happens to change that, such as a decline in the money supply, a weakness in the economy, or something  You put more on M1 than I think is justified  Well, what I had in mind was borrowing of roughly $600 to $800 million, but I assumed excess reserves of $300 to $400 million, say It implies higher borrowings as it evens out if excess reserves are very high Whether that's consistent with "A" or "B," I don't know; I guess it's someplace in between  The economy is moving pretty fast; we have some inflationary danger sitting out there in the future; and the  -64-    7/12-13/83  aggregates are running high So, I'd go for a modest tightening until I see a change in this  Nothing, if it does it in a sustained way --a noninflationary way  The staff forecast doesn't show much inflationary danger  That's what I would [unintelligible] except for this expectation We've had rates move up, and I'm not sure the market is convinced that we've moved at all Now, when we tell them that we have--probably tomorrow--we will get another reaction  I don't know What do you think? I just read the newspaper Some say we've moved a tiny bit and some say we haven't  There is only one way to do that If we in fact move a little, then we say we moved a little and leave the implication that at this point we don't see any reason to move any more  All right, we have moved  Well, that depends upon what we do here, I guess I don't see how we can give that impression without moving a bit here If we move a little here, we can leave the impression that we may have a little tightening but there's nothing else in the offing other than what we're in the process of doing immediately That probably won't calm them down I don't think [the market] is going to be calmed down until something happens like the money supply going down or the economy showing a bad month or something  The fact is that in a strong economy and anything like their present mood there's no reason why we should indicate a decline in interest rates, whatever we do  What I'd like to get to, which is a little difficult to do in the current atmosphere, is the point where we're not really tightening more than we can tighten--where the expectations in the market change and they say that whatever change in interest rates will be might have [occurred] and that the next move might be down again We're not there; we are a long ways from there in the present atmosphere because of all the external events and the money supply How do we get there without making things so tight? Obviously, we don't want to--  I don't think we can do it right at the moment, but I--  Oh, no  I think that is right  -67-    7/12-13/83  Basically I agree with what you're saying What we're doing here is trying to maneuver things so that indeed those things happen in two or three months  Would you like to quantify your view? We'll start backwards start with that view and then translate it into the right numbers and then go back to the long term How do you quantify your view?  Who else has something to say? Are we supposed to be having coffee? If nobody else has anything to say, why don't we have coffee quickly?  [Coffee break]  Let me try to summarize this as nearly as I see it I am impressed, first of all, by the fact that our forecasts, I assure you, will receive much more prominence [than usual] in testimony and congressional discussion I got a request from Mr St Germain that the first page of the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony be nothing but a table of economic forecasts so they can concentrate on that I don't know whether I'll do that or not, but--  The Committee forecast So, it's going to be sitting right out there on the front page I calculated that the central tendency averages roughly 9-3/4 percent They go up as high as 11-1/4 percent and the lowest is 89 to 9 percent, which rounds off to 9 percent  I'm talking 4th quarter over 4th quarter for 1984 Now, wait a minute No, there is someone who is as low as 7 percent Yes, the low is 7 percent But still, I think this would be 9-1/2 to 9-3/4 percent, just to cite that as background But it bothers me in rationalizing--  Well, I don't know how to answer that because the way I have it arrayed it goes from high to low on each of these, so it doesn't add up They are all higher than the staff Or rather, the tendency is to be higher than the staff on the GNP deflator There's no question about that; that's where the difference from the staff forecast is The staff forecast is 83 percent [on GNP] and on the deflator it's 41 percent The central tendency on the deflator is going to be 5 percent or something like that on the Committee side Now, it can be changed But it will be sitting there and much more than before we're going to be asked Is this desirable? Is this what we really want? Is it consistent with our policy? And so forth and so on Let me just cite that as background  For the short run, after listening to you and considering the desirability from my particular point of view of a little flexibility, I would still say something like $600 to $800 million, assuming that [excess reserves] are around $300 to $400 million, which means net borrowed reserves of $300 to $400 million In fact, borrowings would be higher than that if excess reserves show this recurrent tendency to be much higher But I detect a lot of sensitivity, which I can well understand, to the federal funds rate moving above 9-1/2 percent, and I think that flexibility would be partly associated with a tendency for the federal funds rate to move and stay much above 9-1/2 percent As for the aggregates, in the sense of being a little more conservative in terms of what actually has been happening in Ml-- Well, it looks like we're going to have a high Ml in July, judging by the way it's starting out Of course, it doesn't make any difference for the June-to-September figure but for the quarterly average we're starting high I'd be somewhat inclined to take the specifications of alternative B for M2 and M3 and use 7 percent or something like that for the Ml specification So much for the short run We have to discuss precisely what to say in the directive and I would make some changes in what has been proposed  For the longer term, there's no perfect way I must say that I don't feel comfortable with rebasing on June It looks like too much fine-tuning I can see everybody saying Gee, they just take the highest number they got recently and they are fooling around I would put in either 7 to 11 percent or 8 to 12 percent for this year, and I take it there's agreement--well, we'll get to it--for 5 to 9 percent or 4 to 8 percent for next year But if it's 4 to 8 percent, I really have a problem in terms of our forecast It seems to me the implication of that is a lower GNP forecast And I would feel much more comfortable if we decide on 4 to 8 percent, if people would say that in the light of all our policy decisions these things were reviewed and we got a somewhat lower GNP forecast for next year and maybe a lower inflation forecast It can be on the inflation side  -71-    7/12-13/83  rather than the real side But I feel a little uncomfortable about rationalizing 4 to 8 percent with a forecast of almost a 10 percent nominal GNP increase next year I don't feel uncomfortable in rationalizing it with the staff's GNP forecast; the staff's GNP forecast is more than 1 percent lower than the Committee's GNP forecast  I guess there's agreement not to change the M2 and M3 ranges for the rest of this year and to reduce them by half percentage point for next year Credit could either be reduced by 1/2 or 1 percentage point Looking at the numbers now for credit On the average, though not in every expansion, [nonfinancial] debt has increased a little faster than GNP in the second year of recoveries I think it's true in all but one case since 1954 The first year it increases more slowly Now, it has been increasing more rapidly this year; so I don't know what that tells us for next year So, that probably is where I would be  Now, we have to divide it up in terms of arriving at a conclusion Let's take the short term first To repeat Some degree of flexibility in [borrowing of] $600 to $800 million, interpreted partly as net borrowed of $300 to $400 million, but with some sensitivity to the federal funds rate getting above 9-1/2 percent  A little more generous, yes It's pretty much between--  Yes, it's between "A" and "B," I think, and in broad terms is confirming where the market is now, except that I agree the market just might anticipate more [tightening] I don't know how to deal with that The market will anticipate it at some point whether we do anything now or not, unless we try to hold it down by--  Well, I think in the testimony I would not try to give the impression that we just embarked on this; the testimony would say we've tightened already I'll probably say that tomorrow because I don't feel I can avoid it I will try to say as little as possible about the future until next week  I'd like to be able to say that, but if right in the midst of when I'm testifying we are tightening a little more I don't know that I can really say we are going to wait and see But I'd like to give that impression to the degree that I could I think I can say we don't see anything here that says we need any drastic action The emphasis would be on a relatively modest move  -72-    7/12-13/83  We don't see anything right now to require anything more drastic than a slight action I'm not sure I can say this is over now  As much as possible I would give the impression, without denying that some tightening may be going on, that a really drastic move is not what the doctor calls for  Thank you Just in the interest of clarity, when I say "sensitive" to a federal funds rate of about 9-1/2 percent, that doesn't mean that the federal funds rate couldn't be above 9-1/2 percent on particular days or for several days What I do mean to say is that if it got up there, then we wouldn't be moving aggressively toward the higher borrowing numbers but the reverse  I don't want to make the target and then set--  It could stay there, but it would only stay there if the borrowing number tended to be on the low side of this range that we're talking about  I don't represent it as anything other than that  At that point either we would want to validate it or not or go further, depending upon what evidence we have at that time I would be delighted to get in a position where because of something we saw in the aggregates and the economy or whatever, we could say "Let's ease up a little bit" I'd be delighted to be in that position, but I don't think we're there  Well, this gets to the question of what we say in the directive I don't feel particularly strongly about this but I think it might be useful to have something along the lines of what [the Bluebook] is proposing in the brackets, but I'd modify it Let me say one other thing In the long-run targets--but it would have a pale reflection in this operational paragraph--I could see some merit in trying to handle this Ml issue by presenting our targets, when we present them statistically, in a little table I'd put down M2 and M3 as a target and put down Ml and total credit--I don't know what term to use--as a monitoring range or an associated range, so we have a two-tiered kind of target  I would not interpret it as demoting it further but making it clear that it has been demoted It doesn't get the same weight as the other two  I'm talking about the long run when I say that, but [it is reflected] in the short run I had a piece of paper where I scribbled something for the operational paragraph "The Committee seeks in the short run to increase slightly further the existing degree of reserve restraint The action is expected to be associated with growth of M2 and M3 at annual rates of about 8-1/2 and 8 percent respectively from June to September" And then, though I am not sure I thought this through, I'd pick up that bracketed sentence [in the Bluebook] but modify it to take out the "in part" I'd say "Depending on evidence about the strength of economic recovery and other factors bearing on the business and inflation outlook, lesser restraint would be acceptable in the context of a significant shortfall, while somewhat greater restraint would be acceptable should the aggregates expand more rapidly The Committee anticipates that a deceleration in Ml growth to an annual rate of around 7 percent will be consistent with its third-quarter objectives for the broader aggregates"  We could, except that we don't have a figure  It's not very meaningful if we don't get the figures in  -74-    7/12-13/83  We could put in a figure but I don't think it would have much, or any, operational significance It might have some operational significance by the time we get to September  We could say that the Committee anticipates that deceleration in Ml growth to an annual rate of blank would be consistent with its third-quarter objectives for the broader aggregates and that total domestic credit would remain within its range for the year or something like that It could be a little broader--"will remain within the established range for the year"  I wonder whether it's worth putting that in up above, too, just to emphasize that in these respects, anyway, we're within the targets "The action is expected to be associated with growth of M2 and M3 at annual rates of about 8-1/2 and 8 percent respectively from June to [September], consistent with the targets established for the year" I didn't say anything about the range for the federal funds rate I don't have any strong feeling about that one way or the other If we leave it at 6 to 10 percent, we are telling the market a month from now--I don't know how meaningful that is--that we didn't want or were worried about the federal funds rate going above 10 percent  We'll get comment a month from now but I don't know whether it will make any difference It's a little artificial at the low end, particularly now, but--  One can argue it either way; it seems strange not to change it because we're nowhere near the middle And it would seem strange to raise it if we want to reflect that concern So, I come out neutral  Yes, I think I'm neutral on the subject  -75-    7/12-13/83  Yes, we're on the short-run ranges  I think it says more accurately that judgments about the real economy and inflation and so forth will temper our judgments about the aggregates  But it's also a warning that if the aggregates really went in one direction or another we would pay some attention to that, but how much attention we would pay would depend upon what we thought was going on in the economy and exchange rates and other things  I took out the "in part" deliberately  Well, if we get the right words, "Depending on evidence about the strength of the domestic economic recovery and other factors bearing on the business and inflation outlook, including"  Probably the right answer is not to complicate it I may have complicated it too much, but let's not go any further We can put somewhere else in the record that among these other factors we're looking at are international financial markets, the credit situation, etc Well, I think the primary question, so modified, is Do we leave that sentence in or not? Let's deal with that question  The way I now have it is "Depending on evidence about the strength of economic recovery and other factors bearing on the business and inflation outlook" and the rest of the sentence is as it is  I think that's fair In or out?  SEVERAL In  Well, let me have a show of hands How many say in?  -77-    7/12-13/83  Just members of the Committee That's 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, without me Tentatively, we leave that in Now, what about the numbers? I put in here 8-1/2, 8, and 7 percent and put in at the end of the sentence on the broader aggregates that they are consistent with the targets established for the year That's just advertising We say in the other sentence, which would follow this sentence we just discussed, that the Committee anticipates that deceleration of Ml growth to that area will be consistent with its third-quarter objectives for the broader aggregates and that total domestic credit expansion would remain within the range established for the year Let's just look at that part, both the wording and the numbers of 8-1/2, 8, and 7 percent  I'll get to that in a minute But that's what I'm going to assume so we can vote on it explicitly Is that all right? We'll get to the funds range but we're not there yet We're voting on the 8-1/2, 8, and 7 percent with the language that I suggested All right  SPEAKER(?) I think I'll go with that  Now we get to the funds range We have a choice of 6 to 10 percent or 7 to 11 percent; I'm happy with either one  How many want 6 to 10 percent?  6 to 10  Who is for leaving it at 6 to 10 percent? 1,2,3,4,5 Who is for making it 7 to 11? 1,2,3 How many are left? Some people aren't voting again  SPEAKER(?) I don't care As long as you're planning on somewhere between 9-1/4 and 9-1/2 percent, I'm for either  Well, I wouldn't like to see a lot of disagreement just about that number, but I guess we have more for 6 to 10 percent in an indifferent situation than we have for 7 to 11 percent All of this is associated with $600 to $800 million on borrowing, interpreted as $300 to $400 million of nonborrowed reserves and sensitivity to the federal funds rate being above 9-1/2 percent-- meaning that we would lean toward the lower side of this degree of pressure either in net borrowed reserves or borrowings or both That's all I have to say If nobody has any other particular improvement on that formulation, I'll just assume that's it  I think that's--  Okay, I guess we ought to vote on this unless somebody has some question Is it all clear?  Now we turn to the longer-term ranges Let's dispose of this total credit figure to get it out of the way Do you want to go down a half point or one point next year? How many vote for going down one point? [Six] How many want to go down a half? Five That certainly settled that one!  Well, before we get to what is acceptable and what is not, let's assume for the moment that it's down one point, subject to change Everybody is in favor of down a half point for the other aggregates, M2 and M3 Now we're on Ml again, our famous Ml I feel just as I expressed it I'm willing to go to 4 to 8 percent, but it makes me very uncomfortable with the GNP projections as high as they are And I would like to have a feeling that if we arrive at 4 to 8 percent people might think that that's a little restrictive-- enough to justify some shading of their GNP projections  My gut feeling is that if we say 4 to 8 percent, we are assuming that GNP ought to be restrained from 10 or 11 percent I think that's what I am saying  Well, it could be I can't put it that sharply I can't say that with 8 percent it is impossible to have an 11 percent [nominal] GNP, but I think that's coming back to pretty much saying that velocity patterns haven't changed at all  In a word we're saying this is our central feeling about the GNP and the central feeling is that velocity patterns probably haven't changed at all That's what makes me uncomfortable  That's what you have to assume--a 3-1/2 velocity, which would not be outrageous but is higher than the average somebody gave me for the second year  That's what bothers me about it, just in terms of explaining it It seems to me that we'd have to say that for all this talking we've been doing about velocity changing, our forecast and our policy is based upon the notion that velocity hasn't changed That's what bothers me  I'm not sure what you're saying  Oh  That would solve the problem, if it did I guess that's what I'm asking, particularly in the light--  Well, I have a list here of what everybody projected on everything and I'm looking for Governor Partee's name and it's not here  Oh, I'm sorry Have I been looking at the wrong numbers all along? I didn't mean to look at these annual averages  The high is 11-1/4; the low is 83 But there are 8 people at 10 percent or higher Did we present this as Committee members or everybody last year?  Half the people who vote are at 10 percent or above  When I sit here, it seems to me easier to explain without much question On the other hand, it's shocking psychologically perhaps  At the margin 8 and 10 percent are reconcilable It is pretty hard to reconcile 4 and 10 percent  Well, I am thinking now of using the annual figures--using either 7 to 11 percent, which is equivalent to 4 to 8 percent, or even 8 to 12 percent  So, it would be presented as Look, Ml is off this year; we are going to attempt to slow it down That's true with even the 8 to 12 percent range; 7 to 11 percent is a slightly different coloration Next year we expect it to be lower by a significant amount What I would say is just what we said before that it does assume some slowdown in velocity from past trends, but not all that much at one end of the range At the lower end of the range we've allowed for a full, or more than a full, cyclical rebound in velocity  I don't want to make too much of the difference between 5 and 9 percent and 4 and 8 percent But it also comes to What are our chances of getting within it? It's awfully nice to be within these numbers instead of making excuses for being outside The down [side] is explaining why they've gotten that high in the first place  -82-    7/12-13/83  Oh, I don't mind rebasing on the second quarter, but I don't like rebasing on June  It's going to be one percent higher than where we are now That will be an easy calculation  1/2 of a percent  It's 1/2 percent higher than whatever  I would not argue against rebasing on the second quarter; it just looks a little flimsy to me to rebase on June  Well, I'm perfectly willing to rebase on the second quarter, if it sounds better to say 5 to 9 percent beginning in the second quarter  If we go for 5 to 9 percent particularly, we have to say in the statements that 9 percent is not appropriate if we get a normal velocity recovery We just say that very strongly That's why we have a range, and we could well be low in the range if velocity is normal But we have some great doubts about whether velocity will be normal We're going to have a downward movement in M1 next year without a doubt, but it's going to be 11 percent this year or something like 10 or 11 percent  From the last half there wouldn't be  That doesn't--  Well, this is all a question of nuance If we have 4 to 8 percent, then I think a statement has to say pretty clearly that we're counting on regular velocity movements and if they don't happen, we're going to have to increase the target Now, if we emphasize that less--  Well, you've heard all my doubts on either side Who wants the 4 to 8 percent next year?  -85-    7/12-13/83  One, two, three, four, five Who wants 5 to 9 percent? One, two, three, four, five  Who wants 7 to 11 percent this year as opposed to either 5 to 9 or 4 to 8 percent for the remainder of the year?  SPEAKER(?) I don't think we can have 4 to 8 percent for the remainder of this year and then say next year is going to be 5 to 9 percent  Yes, I agree with that  Yes, one or the other Just let me put it that way Do you want to rebase or not? Seven Well, that isn't a very healthy [margin] but I guess we rebase Having rebased, what is the preference between 5 to 9 and 4 to 8 percent?  I asked for next year; now I'm asking for this year  SEVERAL It's the same  Everybody is going to have the same  Well, we could have 5 to 9 and 4 to 8  -86-    7/12-13/83  Well, let's see how strong the support is for that 5 to 9 percent for the rest of this year and 4 to 8 percent for next year  A second-quarter rebasing That isn't tremendous [support] Who wants 4 to 8 and 4 to 8?  That's a bigger increase than what you indicated, Henry That's a triumph of cosmetics over substance  That leaves us with 5 to 9 percent for the remainder of this year and 5 to 9 percent for next year  Well, I'm not quite sure what you are saying Are you saying when people look at it in these cone terms that the cone begins in the second quarter and goes through 18 months and we get a big cone then 19 months later?  I don't think it makes much difference, and I don't think we have to face this at this stage We set it this way and say 5 to 9 percent for the end of this year The assumption  -87-    7/12-13/83  would be that the second 5 to 9 percent started out where we were at the end of this year  It can't go above 9 percent in either case; it can only go below Well, I recognize the psychological difficulty of this It's a question of a kind of realism and of the initial psychological [effect] I have to think of how that could be worded  It shouldn't; the wording appears--  It's not set in as a directive  "At this meeting the Committee reaffirmed the longer-run ranges established earlier for growth in M2 and M3 and total domestic nonfinancial debt" I don't know that we want to say "with growth in the broader monetary aggregates expected to be in the upper part of their ranges"  That M1 sentence has to be changed quite a bit We have to write an Ml sentence; that's where we are  Why don't we take out the total domestic nonfinancial debt from the first part and just say "reaffirmed the longer-run ranges established earlier for growth in M2 and M3"  -88-    7/12-13/83  Maybe it should be what you were saying, Lyle "At this meeting the Committee reaffirmed the long-term ranges established earlier for growth in M2 and M3 for 1983" And then go immediately to "The Committee also agreed to tentative growth ranges for the period from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984 of" whatever they are What are they?  6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M2 and 6 to 9 percent for M3  That is cutting them a half point "The Committee considered that these ranges"--that's referring to M2 and M3--"would be consistent with growth"  All right "At this meeting the Committee reaffirmed the longer-run ranges established earlier for growth in M2 and M3 for 1983 The Committee also agreed on tentative growth ranges for the period from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984 of 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M2 and 6 to 9 percent for M3 The Committee considered that growth of M1 in a range of 5 to 9 percent"--if that's the number--"in the second half of 1983 and during 1984, taking a base of the second quarter of 1983, would be consistent with these ranges The associated range for total domestic credit was reaffirmed at 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent for 1983 and tentatively set at 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent for 1984" Now, I used a full percentage point reduction there, if we use the 5 to 9 percent If we use the 4 to 8 percent, I think we'd use the higher total credit number We could say 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent  -89-    7/12-13/83  That's the operating paragraph; nothing on that  Yes, I think that will do "The behavior of Ml and total credit will be monitored, with the degree of weight placed on Ml over time dependent on evidence of velocity characteristics that are resuming more predictable patterns"  Leave out the bracketed sentence And then we don't need the next sentence either, I don't think  I don't know  SPEAKER(?) It's clear now; you can't--  Is that wording acceptable, leaving open for the moment the numbers on both credit and M1?  Well, what would appear on the table is the M2 and M3 targets and the associated ranges, or whatever other euphemism is used, that we have for Ml and total credit  Hearing no comment, it leaves us still with this 5 to 9 or 4 to 8 [decision] I can live with either one; I don't want to make too much of it I would say if we have 5 to 9 percent, we ought to go down 1 percentage point on the credit range;  -90-    7/12-13/83  if we have 4 to 8 percent, I'd go down 1/2 point on credit I don't know; as a matter of fact we could have 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent We have halves in all the others  But we weren't protesting then that we didn't know anything about velocity  I guess the more obvious compromise is 5 to 9 percent this year and 4 to 8 percent next year The only thing that bothers me is the height of those nominal GNP [forecasts]  I would do that, but I think we have to say in the statement that if the next six months show no return to [normal patterns of] velocity, 4 to 8 percent is probably too low  All right Let's vote on that particular variant, understanding that I will cast some doubt if pressed on this consistency I'll say we are assuming that it will return to normal velocity patterns If that doesn't happen--if we don't see further evidence of that in the next six months--we're going to put that target higher when we come back in February After all that, are we ready to vote? Now, where do we put the credit range then?  It's down a 1/2 point on the credit If you are going to vote for it--  SPEAKER(?) Make it 2 to 11!  Well, I guess we did have a majority there  SPEAKER(?) No one feels all that strongly about it  Well, let's take it again Assuming we have 5 to 9 percent and then 4 to 8 percent, who is for down 1 point on the credit aggregate? Who is for down 1/2 point? I guess we have a trade here for the 4 to 8 percent So, we are at 5 to 9 percent I have to change the wording slightly here from what I wrote, reflecting that Understand that that's done We are down only 1/2 point on credit  Yes, for credit Now all the numbers are reduced by 1/2 point  M1 will be 5 to 9 percent; the borrowing--  -92-    7/12-13/83  Ready, aim--  Now I think we have reports from the Managers  I think it is abbreviated  Any questions?  Is still borrowing?  Did lend to them?  Any other questions? Mr Cross  Mexico, as I understand it, would prepay at least part of these but they can't do it because their agreement with the commercial banks doesn't permit them to repay the official [borrowing] in advance So, we are exploring some kind of deposit arrangement or something  Without objection I'd say the Brazilian thing has been very disturbing; it's promising if they act They're in the clinch this week--today, tomorrow The latest report seems somewhat promising It's a terrible problem  Chile blew up last night?  Well, there have been some riots in Brazil, too But it's complicated The President has heart problems and is coming to the United States They are in the throes of trying to pick a successor for the President--pointing a finger in the right direction Apart from the economic problems and difficulties, which are very evident, time is running out in terms of patience by the banks and the BIS and others And it's either going to come together this week or we're going to be in the soup  That's a mistake in the papers It is the United States but it's Treasury, not us It's shared among the various central banks and--  No, that was  No, this doesn't have any of the real security The Brazilian problem is very troublesome; it's troublesome whatever happens If they act, they're going to have problems at home and they already have them The Mexican situation, on the other hand, looks pretty good From an external standpoint they still are not growing With that, I guess we can conclude  END OF MEETING       Mr Cross, proceed  Do you have a question?  The United States alone did billions  [We need to] ratify the transactions  Without objection we will ratify the transactions Mr Sternlight  Well, I don't know what the basis for that is I don't know whether one would get any better results following borrowings alone; I would suspect not  Why is that?  It is reduced, seasonally adjusted, from the very high seasonally adjusted amount in the second quarter  That is because the second quarter was so high; I think that's an illusion  No other questions? We'll ratify the transactions Without objection Mr Kichline  [The floor is] now open for questions and comments and disagreements and alternative scenarios  Any forecast is an act of faith!  Mr Balles  While I was on the phone the other day I was looking at Business Week, which has this business indicator [measure] on the front page They compared last month to two months ago and last year, and they had a comparison with five or seven years ago They included the steel industry, which is running 40 percent below the figures of five years ago Every other industry they included was up 30 to 40 percent compared to whatever it was 5 or 7 years ago There's a tremendous contrast between what is going on in steel, as reflected in that, and in the rest of the economy  Just the feeling that everybody buys, including the Russians  Well, they'll get that new crop in by the end of 1984  SPEAKER(?) Yes  What's this excess increase?  Why?  They have a decrease in their rate of return  We've had a number of different views expressed here about the outlook Out of curiosity, how many people would have a forecast significantly higher than the staff forecast? I will define significantly higher as roughly 1/2 percent or more on the rate of growth over the next 18 months [Secretary's note Messrs Balles, Black, Gramley, Ms Horn, Mr Morris, and perhaps a few others] How many would have a significantly lower forecast? [Secretary's note Messrs Partee, Rice, and Ms Teeters]  Well, I think that's quite possible Why don't we turn to Mr Axilrod  Any other questions? Mr Axilrod answered all the possible--  Mr Ford  Are there any other questions addressed to Mr Axilrod?  Why wouldn't it have a direct effect on interest rates as well?  There isn't circularity when you're running great big current account deficits  That may be caused by the exchange rate  If there are no other questions, we'll go and have some doughnuts  [Coffee break]  -18-    8/23/83  We've had some differences of opinion expressed about the business outlook There are some indications of a little slowing [in the recovery] from the pace to date Differences of opinion on the outlook seem to be rooted in [unintelligible] There are some tentative signs of a little slowing in Ml; M2 and M3 are doing pretty well in terms of the objectives It doesn't necessarily strike me as a time for pronounced moves, but I'm open to comments  Well, I don't know whether these views that are expressed are the consensus, but I have a certain aversion to making unnecessary changes in these targets in the middle of the quarter That appears to be an extreme fine-tuning All we really have to do, if this is the course we want to go, is say "The Committee seeks in the short run to maintain the existing degree of reserve restraint" We'll discuss how that gets interpreted Maybe we say that the action is expected to be associated with growth in M2 and M3 at around 8 percent--that's about what we have--and leave in the 7 percent for Ml  MESSRS GUFFEY, FORD, and CORRIGAN Yes Let's go home  Well, we have to discuss just precisely what we mean by the borrowing assumption As Steve suggested, all things considered, the $700 to $900 million might be appropriate It is $100 million higher than we set before, but it encompasses the range that we've actually had  I think we're still talking specifically of excess reserves in the $350 to perhaps $400 million area when we make that borrowing assumption  What--excess reserves?  This would imply [excess reserves of] $350 to $550 million  Where the funds rate is in the short run, I suspect, is partly affected by whether the market thinks interest rates are going to go up or down If they think they're going up, the funds rate will be higher; if they think they're going down, the funds rate will be lower  Also, we have a fairly long time before the next meeting I thought we ought to have some sort of a consultation in between  We have the question of the federal funds rate range We left it at 6 to 10 percent last time and I don't know if there's any great reason to change it I think its only relevance will be when it is published  Well, I don't want to conclude the discussion prematurely  -21-    8/23/83  SPEAKER(?) That's a blessing!  We have some other things we can talk about, though I don't want to encourage it unnecessarily  Well, if the aggregates ran high, we could tighten up on this  How much weight you put on the funds rate is in our minds when we make the decision And we're obviously constraining the funds rate in some sense but we're not aiming at a particular funds rate The funds rate came out a little higher--a quarter point maybe--than we anticipated at the last meeting  Well, you can talk about what you want to talk about or what you want to aim at, but I don't think it's meaningless after the first day We haven't basically changed that We could change it in light of all these factors mentioned here  Except that, as kind of a footnote, they have had these weeks when [borrowing] came in very high early in the week and the market may get pretty [unintelligible] We get a lot of excess reserves as a result The Desk hasn't been driven to supply a lot of money to get the borrowings way down to balance off what happened in the first half of the week on some occasions  No, there were several weeks  I think it's clear that members of the Committee, in varying degrees, have the level of the funds rate in mind when they think about the borrowing level But we're not strictly adjusting the operations so that we are aiming at a particular federal funds rate  We can do that, but that's not what we are doing  That is correct  With that clarification or lack thereof, I guess where we are specifically is that we replace "increase slightly further" with "maintain the existing degree of reserve restraint" I would just summarize that 8-1/2 and 8 percent by saying 8 percent [for both M2 and M3] and take out the "respectively" We leave in the 7 percent for M1 and I guess we're leaving in the 6 to 10 percent for the federal funds range And we are assuming a borrowing level of $700 to $900 million, unless these other factors suggest that that should be changed  That's where they are guessing, that's right  Shall we vote? Somebody is pointing something out What is this about?  It's not true, is it? Mr Bernard is looking at the last sentence of the boilerplate on interest rates "Interest rates rose appreciably through most of the intermeeting period but recently market rates have retraced much of their rise" We should just be putting in "all of their rise" Is that correct?  SPEAKER(?) Yes  Well, "much" is the way it is now  We'll make it "most"  That gives us two "mosts" in that sentence Say "through much of the"--  Where it says "most" up above we'll change it to "much" We'll reverse the "most" and "much"  -25-    8/23/83  Okay I guess we'll vote  All we have left is the confirmation of the date for the next meeting, October 4 And we may have a consultation before then  END OF MEETING  -26-       I'd like to take advantage of this [consultation] for two reasons One is just to get any comments or reflections that any of you might have on perceptions of what is going on in the economy or inflation; the other is more directly in terms of the policy decided upon [at the last meeting] We have gone somewhat toward the lower end of the specific range we were talking about in terms of reserve pressures at the meeting The directive clearly contemplated less than that if there was weakness in the aggregates, particularly if it was not accompanied by signs of increased economic activity And I would interpret that at the moment as moving--or at least making our errors--on the slightly easier side and not doing anything very drastic, depending upon what happens in the first part of September If the aggregates came in low then, we would continue to move in that direction; if there were a tendency to reverse what has happened recently, we would stop moving in that direction Conceivably, if growth were high enough, we'd go back to where we were So, we're in that kind of posture at the moment of leaning a little toward the easier side, fully in accordance with the directive  [Secretary's note The transcript record has an ellipsis at this point, indicating that the ensuing discussion was not transcribed]  Anyone else? I do not hear any comments that suggest a great sea change is going on in the direction of economic activity at this point, and I think that reinforces a feeling that the directive calls for some move here, but it is not going to be very dramatic  No, it goes beyond that  But not much It could go--  You know, this is partly an art, but I think I would aim at $700 million or a little less  [Secretary's note The transcript ends at this point]  END OF SESSION     Two-thirds of the Chrysler workers in Ohio voted against the 12 percent [wage] increase?  Well, you can look at that somewhat differently There isn't any question that they are still getting concessions, but what is holding up the average? What are they getting in areas where there aren't concessions?  It's 4 percent but a lot of industries, such as the utilities industry, [are higher] I'm just looking at some figures here that somebody gave me on collective bargaining agreements and they are all more than 6 percent; many of them are 8 percent That's down 1 or 2 percentage points from the peak levels in an industry that isn't under exceptional pressure They can always pass it on to the customer  Well, you remember what happens when these pressures go away The next report could have an expansion Wages could settle down  Mr Morris  Let me interject a question or a comment I don't understand this "either/or" crowding out theory It seems to me that interest rates are relatively high and that the deficit is relatively high and there's already crowding out in some sense [unintelligible] more investment and more housing  Their projection shows a reduction in housing  What has happened to lumber prices in the last few weeks?  Mr Boykin  Mr Keehn  You're not suggesting that we call that "crowding out"  Mr Corrigan  Mr Black  Mr Roberts  Governor Gramley  Mr Balles  Why don't I defer that until we get through this go-around on the business situation, and I'll be glad to address it  Governor Wallich  -15-    10/4/83  Governor Partee  Do you see these signs of slowing down abroad over the summer?  Of course, I've been sitting at meetings with these fellows and they told me for a week how good things were and that they were getting better  A big increase in the GNP in Germany in the second quarter--  Well, that's a pretty strong statement I was about to say that I was struck by everybody's optimism around the table Now you tell me there's no world recovery It seems to me that the business news has been quite mixed recently and everybody is perfectly willing--maybe with your exception--to look through this and say [the economy] is really very good or reasonably good and is going to continue All the economists who can't see over the horizon are perfectly willing to see out to the next 18 months anyway--at least those around this table--and say that things are going to be fine, or orderly, or whatever Now, I do think that has a bearing on our current policy decision I'm not sure that the news is all that uniformly good statistically, but I hear a lot of optimism around the table on balance And it may be right I'm not arguing that it's wrong That's just the conclusion I take from the discussion around the table Ignore all these soft figures People are feeling pretty good  But looking out into the future and questioning what can go wrong, I think a lot of things can go wrong, none of which can be easily incorporated into a forecast of the kind that the staff has to make I would put this debt problem at the top of the list, and let me return to that But let me just make a comment about the oil situation, just on the other side of Mr Roberts' comment If we really had a disturbance in the Middle East, which people worry about now in terms of the Iraq/Iran war getting more aggressive and involving an impairment of the oil flow from the Gulf area, I think it is true that, looking at the United States position alone, we import relatively little [from Iraq and Iran] And one could say that if that supply were almost cut off, we could probably make up that gap relatively easily I don't remember the exact figures but the Middle East still supplies 35 percent of the world's oil or something like that in exports  -18-    10/4/83  There would be tremendous shortages elsewhere in the world  Activating shut-in capacity or whatever in the United States wouldn't make a dent in that situation and the price impact could be very large if it really happened in a major way I think this is a completely unpredictable kind of event, but I don't think that we can consider ourselves [unintelligible]  Well, that may be if just Iran and Iraq went That's a big assumption--whether it can be confined to them I still think there might be a bit of a problem, but you're talking about a more manageable [situation]--not US production, I don't think, but Mexican, Venezuelan, and Nigerian might get through--  If they ever reach peace there, we'd probably have a surplus I guess that's something one can't evaluate This exchange rate problem and our export problem are all mixed together As many people have said, it's a new ingredient I don't know whether to worry more about the exchange rate remaining high or declining precipitously I think either would give us very real problems This wage situation is very uncertain in my mind; it depends upon psychology and expectations I get ultimately buoyed up when I see some figures and ultimately discouraged when I analyze some [other] figures and the lack of any big adjustment, as I suggested earlier, in industries that have not been severely impacted by the recession--the financial industry and the utilities industry to name two All of these things don't tell me very clearly what policy should be  But let me return to the debt issue for a moment The bright spot there, of course, continues to be Mexico Even there it has to be looked at with some degree of realism, I suppose Their external financial condition is substantially better They have a certain amount of cash; they haven't drawn upon all the bank loans they can draw upon They will be in a position to go back to ask the banks for significantly less money next year, even assuming their imports rise And they probably will get lower rates in the process If everything else goes smoothly there, it will probably be a simpler process than it was last year But at the same time, even looking at Mexico alone, there aren't many signs apparently of an increase in economic activity there They're still at the bottom in terms of their own domestic business picture and they've had a more severe contraction than the program planned in the first place It's not unlikely, I suppose,  -19-    10/4/83  when you begin making a vigorous adjustment that it will go a little further than you estimated That's part of the reason why they look so much better--fairly dramatically--externally They have even fewer imports than they were assuming when they took the contractionary measures Of course, we're feeling the other side of that in our trade picture But still, I think one could say that they are in a position to [have] some expansion consistent with financial stability if nothing else goes wrong among their neighbors or elsewhere in the world That prospect isn't exactly safe; we have had Brazil struggling for months and months And partly because they have been struggling for so many months, I think the political support for a strong adjustment program has deteriorated within Brazil They had a political setback a few weeks ago when the Congress reared up and rejected a wage law That is of no substantive significance in itself, but the opposition demonstrated that it could reject the wage law and by implication that they intended to reject the wage law that is the centerpiece of the Brazilian program Now, that--  Well, it has a month-and-a-half or so to run at the maximum They might do it by avoiding a vote There may be some maneuvering to have a vote and try to get it passed, but it's a very tenuous situation Mainly because of that situation, I think the prospect of getting any short-term financing into Brazil has evaporated, and their arrears are getting bigger and bigger; and they have arrears of the kind that will produce nonperforming loans over the third quarter I don't know if that's any disaster, but it will be an interesting psychological test of the market when banks have to report nonperforming Brazilian loans in some magnitude On the other hand, we did manage to put together in principle a basic financing program for Brazil if they carry through on their adjustment program That money wouldn't be available before the end of the year, but in principle the outlines of that--a combination of bank money and public money--are set to go forward It will not go forward unless they carry through on the adjustment program, and that is very much in question As I suggested, it may not go forward anyway because we still have a big problem of getting all the banks to join in The lead banks have agreed in principle; they haven't gotten all the other banks to agree yet But it's going to remain a quite tenuous situation Argentina is in a particularly political period before an election It has been mentioned that they already have taken actions that are inconsistent with their IMF program and it's a question as to how long they can be said to be in compliance with it The actual specific tests of that program have not yet been violated, looking back, but it's virtually certain that they will be, looking forward The [situation] has heated up internally in terms of negotiations with the banks to the point that they put the central bank governor in jail yesterday  It's indicative of the hazards that they run I don't know [the details]; all I read was a newspaper report  -20-    10/4/83  that he's too friendly with the foreign banks But it is some indication of the difficulty of managing these programs  Well, he made a constitutional ruling against one of the provisions; it had to do with a waiver of sovereignty as I understand It says Argentina can't do that, and that's a point the banks have insisted upon in these arrangements And apparently some more particular political incentives are operating on that judge as well But, it is illustrative of the enormous problems that are both real in the terms that Governor Martin was talking about and political and organizational in terms of the number of people that have to get involved This, for instance, was a judge in the southern part of Argentina I don't think it was any great plot, but I think he is in opposition and is a radical fellow who apparently just acted on his own  These are not the only countries involved Some of the medium size countries in Latin America are not in good, though not in terrible shape Chile, Peru, Equador--none of them is in good shape, but they maintain their equilibrium Venezuela has been taken care of and an election is coming up, so it should be easier; but there are still very tense political pressures And there are countries elsewhere in the world, notably the Philippines and Nigeria, that are on the verge of real problems The Philippines situation is obviously complicated by their political problems on a large scale, quite apart from their economic problems That makes it very difficult to deal with the economic problems  The risks [in this country] are at least as large as they have been and in my judgment may be larger I don't know what the definition of crowding out is, but the only way I can see really important short-term relief--by short term I'm talking about a year or so--would be to have interest rates decidedly lower The chances of having interest rates decidedly lower with the budget deficits of the magnitude that we are running do not seem self evident to me Growth obviously is terribly important, but growth acts over a period of years To get real leverage on their external flows in the short run, interest rates would act over a period of a year if we had a decided reduction in them Because their debts are so big, Latin America I suppose would get $4 to $5 billion of debt relief if we had a couple percentage points reduction in interest rates We would not get  -21-    10/4/83  anything like that from the growth side in that kind of time period Yet, it is hard to be optimistic that that is going to come about I see nothing there but their continuing to hang on by their fingernails for the indefinite future As for these special IMF programs, Governor Martin, I think it is worth saying--IMF or not--that the constraint is the shortage of finance And if we didn't have an IMF, I suspect they would be involved in even more contractionary programs simply by force of circumstances if they were unable to raise the money abroad So, it's a risky picture from that side  I think these countries have assumed that it would not be very easy or they wouldn't be trying as hard as they are Brazil's vulnerability is clearly oil imports If the oil  -22-    10/4/83  imports dry up for two weeks, they're out of oil That's not literally true in the sense that there is a little more stock than that But considering what has to be kept in the pipeline and so forth, they'd be in real trouble  Not very convincing to whom?  I don't know either But so far, they have not been willing to take the chance That's what you can say So far as the rest of the IMF meeting is concerned, let me say that there has been a lot of stuff in the newspapers The tone, from where I saw it--and maybe I didn't see it all--was reasonably good The United States took what was considered to be a very tough line specifically on some of these IMF issues A lot of the rest of the world didn't like it much and certainly some of the developing countries didn't like it much But there was a tendency to say that we had to do that because of the IMF legislation, so we got excused for a lot of things we ordinarily wouldn't be excused for, I suspect There was a feeling, which I don't think is entirely true, that it was politically necessary in the United States The people were quite happy that the President very strongly supported the IMF legislation in a very uncompromising way publicly--more strongly than he had before in a public statement of this sort That was accepted at face value and thought to be very, very encouraging There was a great deal of worry about whether we will in fact vote for the IMF package in the end and a lot of concern as to what would happen if that fails  He's presumably negotiating that letter I don't know whether he will send it or not  How long are you going to talk, Mr  -23-    10/4/83  We'll let you talk for 15 to 20 minutes and then we'll have coffee  I don't know what order you're going in You're going to talk about velocity first and then current policy second?  All right  I have a question These velocities on chart 8 look a little different--maybe it's a difference in scale-- than those on chart 1 Are they computed differently?  Chart 1 isn't lagged, is it?  But it's on a four-quarter basis?  Four quarters on--  [Unintelligible]  You're back to targeting interest rates?  I think you have some disagreement there Do you have 2 minutes on current policy, Mr Axilrod?  With that I think we ought to have a doughnut  [Coffee break]  You all heard Mr Axilrod's opinion that the real question is what to do if these various aggregates begin going off track The implication is that there isn't much to do at the moment Although he didn't say it explicitly, I suppose that suggests some version of alternative B, which he interprets as no change for the moment, assuming nothing goes off track I will raise  -27-    10/4/83  that question anyway, as to whether that's a reasonable starting point  Well, I don't think we know That's what Steve was saying We have to get some guidance on what happens if indeed [monetary] growth either snaps back and goes above or goes below Presumably, there would be some implication for moving and the rate of speed at which to move How aggressively to move is a nice question If we start where we are, which is at this peculiar $650 million borrowing level that we talk about but which has never been in existence--  What is going on in the market today, by the way?  You're on track with $650 million now?  That's the week before we went?  Well, I don't want to speed you along faster than you want to go, but are we starting roughly where we are?  Well, 9-1/4 percent is what Mr Axilrod says, but I don't consider that a vital part of the decision I don't  -28-    10/4/83  know exactly what [funds rate] is consistent with it down to the last quarter point  I think the best answer I could give to your question is that $650 million implemented over a period of time, with a reasonable excess reserve figure, would probably give you a federal funds rate averaging less than it has been averaging  Somewhat less; how much less I don't know  I'm not aware that it changed  I'm talking about $650 million borrowing and using the specifications of alternative B  Well, I have no particular feeling on that one way or the other But I do feel we have to discuss how we will react to either undershoots or overshoots I'm only in stage one  I think you're just a little ahead of the game Let me come back to you and ask my original question Do we want to deal with those questions that you're dealing with against the starting point of basically $650 million of borrowing?  Well, that seems to represent the general feeling Okay, Mr Boehne, go ahead Did you say if monetary growth falls short [of expectations], you want to react pretty quickly and if it goes above, you want to react more slowly?  Let me just mention a descriptive point that bothers me a little, but it's going to be dealt with in the policy record If we do begin as we just said--that we remain basically unchanged--presumably the directive will say we remain unchanged The last directive said we remained unchanged In theory, we have eased a shade since the last meeting but both directives say things are unchanged  It all would be clear enough if the borrowings actually had been lower recently, but in fact they weren't So we're saying we are remaining unchanged in a somewhat easier posture that isn't evident--  --to anybody who is not inside our heads How do we explain this in the policy record?  -30-    10/4/83  What level? The trouble is the last figures right up to this meeting are higher in terms of borrowing  Well, we say reserve conditions I don't present this as a major substantive point; it's just a little something that has to be cleared up, and it's a little difficult because they--  SPEAKER(?) How about "maintain the somewhat easier tone"  I'm not saying there is a substantive problem but I think there is a completeness-of-the-record problem We have gone from--it wasn't much of a change--$800 million or something in borrowings in our minds to $650 million and it's all labeled as unchanged And, in fact, the statistics went from $800 million to $1 billion in the last--  I know why it happened All I'm saying is that some clever writing--not clever in the pejorative sense--  We could say that, but that's a little misleading too in terms of our--  The nice thing to say would be "seeks to maintain the slightly easier posture implemented over recent weeks," but it wasn't implemented  That's exactly what it is maintain the slightly easier posture intended but not implemented  I didn't--  Well, I just raised this because I think it needs some description in the policy record It would not be in the directive itself unless somebody can think of very clever wording for the directive  But I diverted us from this other discussion What I have are some views that if things come in weaker, we ease a little, if it's quite natural on the aggregates And if things come in tighter we would be either reluctant or we'd be symmetrical, all depending upon the business situation  All this is simple enough unless the business news diverges from the monetary aggregates news If we have the kind of thing Lyle was talking about, all the [business] numbers would be coming in quite buoyantly but the monetary numbers could remain low for another month and we might be quite happy about that and not want to do anything If the business news is mixed or weak and the aggregates are low, it's quite clear what we do; and vice versa, it's quite clear what we do If we get these mixed signals from the two sides, it's a little more difficult  We can't deal with every possible contingency here We can have a call, but we can get some feel for the situation anyway  Have they?  The numbers we would put in here, I suppose-- Oh, the 1/2 percentage point [difference] Suppose instead of saying 8-1/2 and 8-3/4 percent, we just say 8-1/2 percent [for M2 and M3] and 7 percent [for Ml]  They're up 1/2 percentage point  I don't think they would pay any attention to a 1/2 point [difference]  No, if the money supply were low, I think they would say Okay, you said if the money supply came in low, you'd ease a little  The more I look at that first sentence the more it bothers me in terms of being misleading I'm afraid the more accurate thing to say would be "The Committee seeks in the short run to decrease slightly the degree of reserve restraint evident in the market in recent weeks"  Net borrowed reserves or the borrowings  We did have one whole week where net borrowed reserves came in less  Well, let me look at these figures Maybe it's not as bad as I thought it was What are they? Read off the recent borrowings and the net borrowed figures  All right Now, what was [net borrowed]?  And this week it should be what?  -34-    10/4/83  $300 million or so  Well, maybe that's not so bad If you take out that one figure and give weight to net borrowed reserves, we have been distinctly lower than we were I don't know when we were--  Well, it's one month But I guess we could almost say "The Committee seeks in the short run to maintain the slightly lesser degree of reserve restraint achieved in recent weeks" if [the numbers] come out [as expected] this week We had two weeks, then, of a low net borrowed figure  Well, maybe we just say that and explain it in the [policy record]  Well, except right now as we're meeting the funds rate is quite high  Then we say we're aiming at those rates?  -35-    10/4/83  Really, I'm not sure what you're saying That one week screwed it up Otherwise the borrowing number and the net borrowed both are distinctly lower than they were earlier  Yes, that one week--  The $12 billion goes back to the earlier period; that's before we moved In the last five weeks there's only one week that's way out of line  Yes, but I think the problem--  What we have written down here at the moment is "The Committee seeks in the short run to maintain the slightly lesser degree of reserve restraint sought in recent weeks"  I think what we've done is distinctly compatible with the previous directive, but I--  Eventually [This wording] isn't perfect, but then--  I think by implication you're saying we are aiming at interest rates  Anything we put in there is going to require some explanation  Unless there's strong objection--I don't think we're talking about any substance in what we're trying to do here--I'll put in this language "The Committee seeks in the short run to maintain the slightly lesser degree of reserve restraint sought in recent weeks" We'll explain in the policy record that we had problems with Treasury balances and the market was a little easier  Yes, I don't think there's any trouble in rationalizing it with the previous directive  It is except for that one week  Okay Who can add some enlightenment as to how we should react to contingencies?  I agree with that to the extent that if we get too aggressive--and we're talking in a limited range here, I understand--and take too many risks of having the aggregates and the economy moving up on us, it may help to bring a little glimmer of hope to the LDCs for three weeks, but then we will put an arrow through their hearts  Oh, I think the language covers it all right  I don't have any trouble with the language I agree that the language in its general way covers what we're talking about But it doesn't mention the international situation explicitly I don't know whether that's wise anyway  There is the phrase "other factors bearing on the business and inflation outlook"  Where is October [Ml] starting from in terms of the September level?  Over 10 percent  Let me give you a calculation, which you don't have Given an assumption that the 28th is a little higher than the 21st, if you increased it by $1-1/2 billion a week in October, would it be over 7 percent?  That's the average  Well, it depends upon where you start The average--  Well, I think we have decided on the $650 million, generally interpreted as $600 to $700 million  Well, sometimes strange things go on with excess reserves or otherwise  Let's be clear; there may be some confusion about it My interpretation is that this directive says we ease if things are coming in low or we tighten if they're coming in high I don't interpret that as staying within the range that was set, which is an operating--  Well, it's not a big point to me It doesn't make much difference, but sometimes we get in there and we ask Shall we stick explicitly at $650 million this week when things are very tight and excess reserves are going to be high, or do we allow for a little higher excess reserves this week because that looks like what's going to happen? A little more borrowing or a little less is just fiddling around from week-to-week I don't know whether it adds much; it's not a big deal one way or the other  I have a distinction in my mind between a technical reaction to the patterns that are developing during the week, which has no real significance in terms of what we're aiming for, and whether we're really making a [policy] move, however small, because the aggregates are high or low And it is meant to convey that I don't care--we've operated both ways--whether we use a number or [a range] It doesn't make much difference  We'll do it anyway because we're always sitting there saying Well, which way are we going to miss? Which way are we likely to miss this week and which way are we going to be most misleading if we miss? So, we lean a little one way or the other sometimes And we do that whether we put down $650 million or whether we put down $600 to $700 million That kind of gives the range for that, but it's not a big deal  It clearly goes higher than the range, depending on where you start  It sounds as if even if it were $1 billion, the growth would be pretty high  The latest week is on it, so if the next week is up--  What about the broader aggregates? Are they starting low or high?  Well, you're telling me the chances are that we're going to be starting a little on the high side on all these aggregates, which makes it sound to me as though the chances are that October may come in a little high rather than the opposite  Does this figure that you have in all these alternatives allow anything for deregulation?  We could get pretty good growth in M2 and M3 in October I guess that ought to be mentioned in the record as a minor effect Well, I don't know whether we need to go any further Unless somebody wants to change his or her mind, we're interpreting this in any event at around $650 million [in borrowing] I don't much care whether we call it $600 to $700 million or around $650 million  That's pretty subtle  The only hesitancy I would have is that I would think we're more or less symmetrical but I would accept Governor Gramley's caveat that before we do anything we look and see whether the business picture tends to be consistent or inconsistent with the way the aggregates are going  I think we are probably covered on that if we make some mention in the policy record that we expect a small effect in the next few weeks but we don't expect it to amount to much If we decided it mattered a heck of a lot, we would take it into account  Well, I don't know whether I can postulate the median opinion as being a little less quick on the trigger on the up side than on the down side, all other things equal  I guess we can vote We're voting for the specifications of "B" rounded off to 8-1/2 percent, with a mention in the policy record that 8-1/2 percent was shaded up a bit because of deregulation but we don't expect the effect of deregulation to be very significant In explaining that first sentence we would indicate in the record that we had tended to ease a little Otherwise, all the language is the same with the substitution of 8-1/2 percent for 8 percent and that new first sentence I read There's a 7 percent where it was 7 percent and borrowing is $650 million or thereabouts  I'm saying you're voting on the directive as it is with an 8-1/2 percent and a 7 percent number in there and with a new first sentence as I read it before "The Committee seeks in the short run to maintain the slightly lesser degree of reserve restraint sought in recent weeks"  You have a tentative schedule for next year to which it is my understanding nobody has objected And we thought we might begin on Monday next time even though it's in the middle of the quarter and discuss the inflation outlook in a little more depth Let's start the next meeting on Monday afternoon  Inflation and the outlook Expect to discuss inflation and come equipped to debate the issue, including maybe what we were intending to discuss, which is where we should go on inflation in a 5-year time perspective  -45-    10/4/83  I think that's all fine And you're also going to explain how we can get to a zero rate of inflation in the next--I'll be modest and say the next 5 years   That was a real performance We have to [decide on] the long-run [monetary] targets for next year soon and present some [economic] projections There have been some proposals that we present projections through 1988, which happens to coincide with [the period covered in] the last table [distributed for this presentation] We're not yet obligated to do that; I don't know whether we will be by the time we get around to presenting our long- range projections We're going to have to decide how we will collectively look at this situation The staff has a pretty sharp decline in M2 in 1984 to get on this track [toward price stability] What is it going to be this year?  We see how tolerant you are!  How big is that?  Might as well go for broke--go for zero Mr Morris    11/14-15/83  Mr Boehne  Mr Balles  Mr Solomon  Mr Forrestal  It is remarkable that you can give a presentation about inflation and never mention the deficit, and there are a hundred eighty million people out there who think there's some relationship  If I understand you correctly, your assumption on reducing the deficit is that it's bad for inflation?  It's agnostic on the point that Mr Solomon is raising as to whether you can have those deficits and have this nice smooth path?  How much does the level of interest rates itself affect your inflation forecast?  There's no cost push from high interest rates?  When you say cost of capital, do you mean in terms of cost or in terms of affecting the amount of investment?  You still have 9 percent interest rates with a 1 percent or 3/4 percent rise in prices?  Governor Wallich  Mr Guffey  Let me just explore this for a moment I take it the staff does not agree that that is possible, [barring] some revolution of expectations?  Well, I don't know about his exact Ml figure but, if I understood Mr Guffey correctly, he has a model that gives us faster growth and faster deceleration of inflation at the same time  I know one can make other assumptions as to the growth of productivity and all the rest I don't think I said anything very startling Unless you make some other assumptions of that sort, you can't come up with that kind of answer You have to find the answer in productivity or expectations--  Well, we'll ask Mr Guffey how he comes up with a different answer Did you put in more productivity or different expectations or what?  It's a relevant question in a way How do we do better than these numbers? Mr Roberts, maybe you can tell us  I think that's precisely right I think that they set themselves up here as a big fat target, and it's not a very--  It's useful It shows the result It is meant to be a vehicle for discussing how to get a better result  If that's right, then we would also get a lower level of prices  Well, let's examine that proposition I'll let Mr Gramley answer that  -11-    11/14-15/83  It surprises me a little that you get that answer based upon these numbers You get the unemployment rate down to where? The natural rate is 6-1/2 percent?  How can you? If the unemployment rate went down steadily, you would be bound to have a higher inflation rate in 1985, right?  Mr Balles  -12-    11/14-15/83  Mr Black  But you're assuming a sizable depreciation in the dollar, so all those import prices are going to go up  Mr Keehn  By 1986 we will have had, with or without a recession, 5 straight years of the consumer price index [in this projection] being less than 4-1/2 percent So, why should they accelerate beyond 6 percent? That's your number  You read my speech!  -14-    11/14-15/83  Let me ask a couple of questions If you extended this assumption for M2, the monetary policy proxy, of 4-1/2 percent for three more years--you seem to have a zero velocity in here, roughly--what is going to happen to prices and real GNP in '89, '90, and '91?  Would you still have inflation under those assumptions? You have an unemployment rate 1-1/2 or 1-3/4 percentage points above the natural rate  It would go into minus prices and then it would go plus again  I don't know whether we ever get to that; it takes 8 years to get to the long run on this model Suppose--the obvious question--you cut all these money figures quickly and then level them off Where would things go?  Where would we end up in '88 a lower rate of unemployment?  Is there some monetarist here who will give us a much more favorable hypothesis and explain it?  The Phillips curve in Chart 7 doesn't look so good  I can make a simple point that if you're not ready to attack the model, you have to live with it Do you want to attack it, Mr Corrigan?  Suppose you magically changed that in your model and made it 1 percentage point lower What would that do?  One whole percentage point  Wouldn't both happen? If monetary policy and everything else is unchanged except you have some deus ex machina here that gets inflation expectations down 1 percentage point, the inflation rate would be down 1 percentage point and the unemployment rate would be down too  -17-    11/14-15/83  STAFF(?) Initially the inflation rate goes down, but I think eventually the unemployment rate would end up lower too  Not if it's like your bad news!  The inflation rate is where?  What does the staff say about that?  This level meaning what?  This model shows [that we get it] with a more restrictive monetary policy than what we have heretofore talked about, if I read it correctly  What assumption do you make about M2 or Ml or anything--zero [effect] except as it affects nominal GNP?  You have two columns here It doesn't tell you anything--it's some pure guess--about velocity  It's a guess; it's your model of velocity But its influence [unintelligible] model Well, I'm left with my question to the group, not to the staff Either accept something like this model, [which has] satisfactory results from most points of view, I guess, or say how you would change any of these factors to get better results You have to come up with a better model or a different model if you don't like these results  I don't think that's really a different model There's a different timing with inflation [unintelligible] But you don't have different factors to play around with; [you have] the same variables  You would get different numbers, but you're still using the same model  Well, they already assumed a 1 percentage point lower growth in the briefing  In '84 and '85 we have reduced [real GNP growth], if I understand it  I think it's 1 percentage point lower than they otherwise--  And we are assuming 4-1/4 percent  You're assuming 5-1/4 percent with this same inflation prediction?  It's 5-1/4 percent real growth if they have 5-1/2 percent on prices  Well, does anybody else want to comment? Mr Wallace  -24-    11/14-15/83  Well, I think we can leave this for the day But I would urge people to look at this question I think we have a rather pessimistic [unintelligible] But I have not heard a great deal of attacking of this today You're simply saying we are better off with higher productivity if we could only achieve that They can have a wrong estimate But people might want to think a little about how we can improve this situation or even [unintelligible] We will attend to it briefly at the next meeting  -25-    11/14-15/83  If we have enough time, maybe we can go through the Managers' reports this afternoon  I think there's a little more to be considered, consistent with that This is very much internal staff speculation It has no Committee status and there's no Committee--  Well, I think you may be taking it too literally I don't think this is a business cycle forecast It's kind of a structural forecast with growth tradeoff [unintelligible] of these recessions  I'm only interested in what we can believe  Or have somebody believe; it may have some correlation in the presentation  I'm curious, but I won't prolong this, how you get this similar result from a long lag money growth model and a short lag money growth model in the chart that has the deflator and Ml This Ml only goes through '81 Do I interpret that correctly?  Chart 2  I don't remember a 10 percent rate of growth--maybe in 1981  On a purely monetarist approach here If you looked at this first chart, chart 2, you would have the money supply lower You've got its growth coming down to below that of the [deflator] for a while and kind of coming back in line with prices, right?  Then you would show a sharp increase, which would imply a sharp increase in unemployment at the same time we were going into a recession if we maintained the recent rate of growth of the money supply  Oh, this is really before the most severe [unintelligible] This money supply stops in mid-1981  Because if you get in there-- Well, Mr Sternlight No First, the meeting has to come to order and we need to approve the minutes  -27-    11/14-15/83  Without objection Mr Sternlight  Well, you might explain why you need a  larger leeway  You don't have any limit on your repurchase agreements?  Well, we'll come back to that Are there any other questions on that point or any other point? Operations are all lucid as a spring [unintelligible] flowing out of that swamp  We might discuss this a bit tomorrow; I don't think we should take time now on the debt ceiling I sent a letter to Mr Regan telling him what horrible things would happen if they do run out of money now or later I presume that will be published at some point but we could distribute it Or did we distribute it, Mr Axilrod?  Well, maybe we can distribute it tomorrow morning so people are aware It has strong operational--  Not yet I don't know what happened I've been out for a couple days; I haven't had a chance to follow up Any other comments or questions? We need to ratify the transactions Without objection We have this proposal on increasing the limit Without objection, we will approve that I don't know how I got you out of order, Mr Cross  This contingency would be if we drew yen and invested--  Are there any other comments or questions?  Maybe we should just leave that for tomorrow in view of the time  You might say a few words about the debt situation tomorrow, Mr Truman  We need to ratify the transactions Without objection We have this proposal for authority to renew the swaps with the possibility of one small change Without objection We will see you tomorrow at 930 am  [Meeting recessed]  -31-    11/14-15/83  November 15, 1983--Morning Session  Is there anything you want to add, Mr Cross?  Well, we hope that Brazil will get its interest arrears up to date by the end of the year Can they or can't they if this [loan] goes through?  In that case, the question wouldn't arise in any important way There is a lot of accounting controversy and discussion and all the rest as to how these [items] are reported The SEC wants some reporting of them as troubled reschedules, or whatever they call them There will be more disclosure at the end of the year but they won't go into a nonperforming category, I don't think  Argentina will be, I guess, if they don't make some payments Brazil is more than 90 days, but that presumably will be cleared up first  Well, we only have a few days [before we know] whether it's going to be approved or not going to be approved There's great negotiation going on; it got tied up with the housing bill and, in a satisfactory way, from the standpoint of the Democrats That obstacle seems to be removed but there are still a lot of questions They have to get the appropriation as well as the authorization and it hasn't been through the Appropriations Committee They are going to try to short-circuit that; whether they can isn't a hundred percent clear But that is being negotiated right now and has been for the past week  Well, I don't know; in the Congress it varies from day to day They were not going to have the communist countries; there's still some controversy about the apartheid  Those things have all been fixed up satisfactorily, I think But there probably will be some reserving, not for these big countries, in accordance with proposals that we gave Congress when it was before the Senate When the loan is in protracted difficulty or whatever we called it, there would be some  -33-    11/14-15/83  mandatory write-off on reserves This would be for Zaire, Sudan, Poland, and some Latin American countries  What is being worked out now and will probably happen in the next week or so is that some directive will go out The amount is not massive in total; it would be a maximum of $300 and some odd million dollars for all the banks together, less anything they have already written off, which is a very foggy notion But it's enough potentially, if they haven't already written some off, to have an impact on some of the bigger banks in reducing their earnings in the fourth quarter In terms of the psychology, it will raise the question If it's Sudan, Poland, and Zaire now, when does Mexico follow and when will Brazil come down the pike and so forth?  Yes, but that's different This is at the opposite extreme where these [loans] are really weak We will rename those categories so we will have a category that some of these Latin American countries will fit into where the loans won't require any reserving but will get a notice in something like a special-mention category for foreign loans  Well, it's consistent with a provision in the IMF legislation But we would be taking the action a little in advance in a sense Presumably, the legislation will have passed anyway It's totally consistent with the Senate version of the IMF legislation but it raises some questions of precedent It will be the first time we have done it and will raise those kinds of questions It won't apply to any of these countries that are in negotiation with the IMF or have IMF programs and so forth, but I think it will send a little tremor through the banks  Well, this question will arise Some work also is being done on proposals that we came up with at the time of that [unintelligible] and rejected for the time being--whether to require a reserve against the aggregation of all this if it's too big  It's very hard to know what this reserving is for our banks or other banks They say they reserve The question is whether they are increasing their total reserves more than they  -34-    11/14-15/83  otherwise would or are saying within some total they have anyway that they are allocating this to Brazil, Mexico, or whatever I don't think anybody knows the answer to it completely  Or they will write them off I think many of them will just prefer to write them off for their [unintelligible] balance sheet I say write them off; it's just a partial write-off  Well, it's a foggy area This write-off equivalent is what we would be [unintelligible]  Only this particular type of specific reserves Our banks are very reluctant to write off or reserve in a way that really adds to the reserves It has been argued so many times that we can't do enough to make any difference, and it just raises questions about the loans Our banks operate more in a goldfish bowl than any of these other banks who can write off without telling anybody their reserve [unintelligible] and they haven't got any hidden reserves The allegation by many of our banks is that they are reserving whereas these other banks are not really reserving They just move something out of hidden reserves into calculated reserves  Some of them have written off some of these extreme ones  I have an ideological question for some of your New York banks who refuse to accept [unintelligible]  Yes But the accounting on those private sector loans is easier to handle They just fall into the normal rule more easily than a sovereign credit So, they would be handled just like domestic credit  Any better feel on how many banks are involved in that now?  I thought earlier it was less than a dozen banks but I fear it is more  That's a possible way of doing it  We're not probing too closely It meets the technical [requirements] In terms of the Mexican [situation] and the interest rates, that is in my judgment the opportunity for the  -36-    11/14-15/83  banks to provide a lower spread--a positive spread, but a much lower one They stuck Mexico last year And we will have a provision in the legislation that gives strong moral endorsement at the very least on the part of the United States--it's a Congressional directive--to look for lower interest rate spreads on these  Well, the language, I guess, is all right now I don't think it's so bad to have a little moral suasion coming out of the Congress We didn't want it so mandatory that it would foul things up Mr Truman and Mr Bradfield have [determined it is] satisfactory, I hope I haven't looked at it closely  Mr Kichline  Governor Martin  Does that mean that oil import prices are going down?  Mr Wallace  I'd like to make a modest request that occurred to me earlier These flow-of-funds figures are always shown in half-year terms Could you put them in quarterly terms for the period?  You like this volatility submerged!  If nobody else is going to comment at the moment, let me ask you a question, Mr Kichline Mr Rice said he thought, if anything, that the forecast may be on the low side Suppose we want to explore the opposite I'm not saying you would forecast it, but what plausible scenario could you make for substantially more weakness in the first and second quarters than you have projected? What would you expect to see happen if the economy gets weak?  Mr Keehn  The four you mentioned were what?  An 81 percent decline from 1981?  -40-    11/14-15/83  Governor Wallich  Mr Forrestal  Mr Corrigan  Mrs Horn  Governor Gramley  Mr Wallace  Does anybody else see the kind of land speculation that is going on in Texas?  Prices are up in some areas four or five or six times  Mr Balles  -47-    11/14-15/83  Mr Roberts  Governor Martin  Governor Partee  Without any other comments, we'll ask Mr Axilrod to deliver his remarks  You can put a doughnut in your stomachs now!  [Coffee break]  Well, I guess as Mr Axilrod carefully explained to us, we have somewhat conflicting feelings and signals of  -52-    11/14-15/83  great ebullience and some [concern] about the economy I just had Mr Kichline check, and you have to look fairly hard among past recoveries to find three consecutive quarters [of growth] as high as [we have now], including the projection for the fourth quarter Interestingly enough, 1958 was a bit more rapid and immediately terminated after three rapid quarters  Maybe it was the steel strike that made it end so abruptly  I mention that because I think some of these things about the strength of the recovery are a little misleading We started out with a fairly slow quarter That's probably an accident of when somebody dates these things or just how it starts out The recovery really is in my judgment somewhat above average since it has gotten some momentum; it may be quite a lot above average We have some weakness in Ml; I don't think we have too much weakness in the broader aggregates at the moment That Ml weakness comes against the background of having had a big increase earlier and having raised our target in effect by rebasing it I'm not sure there are grounds for making any very violent move at this point But, let's see what other people think  In a tightening direction  I don't hear any sentiment for a major move now Maybe we'll do this in a different way Does anybody want to make a major move?  Mr Balles  Let me just comment that I think it is possible that more predictable relationships may be returning to M1 but, speaking for myself, it's a little too early [to be sure] I think we probably are going to have a very big increase in velocity here, which will make up for some of the reverses earlier, but what the trend is going to be in the future isn't clear I wouldn't assume that this increase in velocity is going to continue But whether it will lapse back [unintelligible] But, given the burst that we had earlier and now the retracing of it, partially anyway, at what point does one assume that [a return to normalcy] begins? It still mystifies me  Governor Wallich  Mr Wallace  Mr Roberts  Mr Black  Mr Corrigan  Governor Gramley  Mr Forrestal  Governor Martin  Mr Solomon  Mr Guffey  Mr Keehn  Mr Morris  Does anybody else have a comment?  Mr Balles  -61-    11/14-15/83  We have a couple of people for whom I do not have an opinion indicated, if they want to express an opinion  Have you expressed a view, Governor Partee?  I thought I had that correctly  Well, I have a lot of people who want to stay more or less where we are, with some tendency toward tightening by some I don't recall many times when we've tightened prematurely  We tightened in January '81, if I remember  Well, we'll have to discuss next time or the time after how we get into a disinflationary policy if we want to have a disinflationary policy over a period of time A five percent M1 figure, if M1 is going to return to normal, looks a bit high to me  I'm talking about next year  I don't care what the staff is predicting; it looks a bit high  If it returns to normal--I don't know if it's going to; that's a big if Well, I could convince myself to tighten up a little now, although I don't feel that strongly about it But I'm not sure we will want to wait for the next meeting if the aggregates turn out on the high side and the business news remains that good We can start off where we are and stay there if everything  -63-    11/14-15/83  goes according to the forecast If the aggregates or the economy come in more strongly, obviously, we have room in these directives to move anyway I think we ought to discuss how to bias this a bit, if we want to I don't know that it takes any change in the wording What does the [current] directive say? Maybe we should start out by saying "maintain the existing [degree of reserve restraint]" And if we believe what the staff tells us, that 8-1/2 percent [for growth in M2 and M3] can remain, I think We're in a mid-quarter meeting; I don't see any necessity [to change] the second sentence The third sentence may be a question Let me just look at it  I could reverse the sentence in a sense, and say "Depending on evidence about the strength of economic recovery and other factors bearing on the business and inflation outlook, greater restraint would be acceptable in the context of more rapid expansion in the aggregates"  Reverse [the order]  Well, reversing it is an obvious possibility  I think we have discovered historically that we can't take care of every permutation and combination in these sentences, but--  If we do it this way, the first half of the sentence seems to be simple enough If you want to put in a balancing thing on the other side-- But it's weighed somewhat differently, I guess "Depending on evidence about the strength of economic recovery and other factors bearing on the business and inflation outlook, somewhat greater restraint would be acceptable should the aggregates expand more rapidly"  What change that I suggested?  I don't quite see how to word this second thought We could just put in a semicolon and say "lesser restraint would be acceptable in the context of a significant shortfall in the growth of the aggregates from current expectations" I'm not sure we're saying that; I don't know what significant is if business looked even stronger and the aggregates had a shortfall That's the main problem Then what would we do?  Well, we could do it that way We could just put a semicolon and say "lesser restraint would be acceptable"  Well, that's all right  Now, what number do you want to put in there?  We had 7 percent before?  I think if we leave 7 percent, we have to put 7 percent or less  Well, we could do that but it's fine- tuning I think we can either put in 5 to 6 percent percent or 7 percent or less Or we can change it to October through December and leave it at 7 percent  Put 5 to 6 percent?  I don't mind putting in "7 percent or less," as a matter of fact I'd just put in the "or less" to take account of the fact that we've had some [slowing] But 5 to 6 percent is all right with me  7 percent or less  Do you think it's too low or too high?  Well, I can certainly go either way I don't think it's a terribly sensitive decision given our ability to--  -67-    11/14-15/83  Do we want 5 to 6 percent?  Do you want to put in a phrase at the beginning of the sentence such as "Given the relatively slow growth in October, the Committee anticipated"?  SPEAKER(?) That would do it  Well, are we putting the 6 to 10 percent [funds rate range] down at the bottom?  We don't put credit numbers in here  Well, the figures aren't right up-to-date but we have had a quite rapid increase in the liquidity figure through the period for which we last had figures and the debt figure was within the range but not low  They include the Treasury bills Those have been going up, commercial paper has been going up, and bankers acceptances have been going up Over the summer liquidity was rising at an annual rate of around 8 to 12 percent Anyhow, I guess this is where we are If nobody has any comments, we can vote  Yes, 8-1/2 percent for M2 and M3 I think that's what "B" shows  $650 million  It's the best estimate, which might be called a big fat guess  What they are saying is that, with this rate of business activity, they think it's going to pull up M1 even at the current levels of interest rates and borrowings But that is a judgment about this unwinding being over or possibly over But who knows?  Well, I haven't looked at the figures in the last couple of weeks, but I think one can argue that the money market deposit accounts, which are not in Ml, remain very low, don't they?  Well, maybe it's beginning to go up again But it looks suspiciously like there was this great attraction into that account when it was first offered There was a lot of publicity and very high interest rates People put more money in there than they wanted to hold in there permanently, and as things settle down they are taking advantage of other slightly higher rates in 6-month  -69-    11/14-15/83  certificates or 3-month certificates or something else And we may get some of the same phenomenon perhaps on NOW accounts  Well, the thing that has looked best over the past year or the past two years is not Ml but old M1A What has that been doing recently?  So, you have an increase in currency offset by a decrease in demand deposits?  Well, during this very recent period apparently But last year when Ml was going up so rapidly and velocity was declining, old M1A was not going up so rapidly and the velocity looked more normal That may have been a pure coincidence, but I--  Well, what we have is "maintain the existing degree of reserve restraint" We have 8-1/2 percent in those blanks and then "Depending on evidence about the continued strength of economic recovery and other factors bearing on the business and inflation outlook, somewhat greater restraint would be acceptable should the aggregates expand more rapidly; lesser restraint might be acceptable in the context of a significant shortfall in the growth of the aggregates from current expectations Given the relatively slow growth in October, the Committee anticipates that M1 growth at an annual rate of around 5 to 6 percent from September to December will be consistent with its fourth-quarter objectives for the broader aggregates" All the rest would remain the same with 6 to 10 percent [for the funds rate range]  -70-    11/14-15/83  I guess we are finished aren't we, Mr Secretary?  END OF MEETING  -71-       We have an addendum to the minutes from the last meeting, which has been distributed to you I'm going to ask for approval of the minutes as amended We do need a motion  Approved, with no objection You have seen the Report of Examination, I assume Is somebody here to talk about it or to answer questions?  Do we have any questions about it?  What policy do we follow now? Do we update these every month? Do we mark-to-market every month?  We're not permitted to ask questions before we [unintelligible], I suppose  SPEAKER(?) I beg your pardon?  Are there any other questions on it?  It's our own examination people [unintelligible] looking embarrassed  It doesn't imply anything about the policy?  Do we have a second?  In the absence of any objections, it's approved [The next item on the agenda is] a preliminary report on contemporaneous reserve accounting Who is introducing this subject? Mr Axilrod?  [With regard to] the miss in required reserves that is discovered at the end of the period, to what degree is that related to a change in Ml and to what degree is it related to other factors?  Can you say anything sensible about that with further looking?  That might be worthwhile Governor    12/19-20/83  The date it begins is the first of February?  Well, we have a little problem here, it seems to me It occurs to me that we better tell the market what we're doing; we should have a little statement I don't know how we're going to come up with a statement before the next meeting  In a particular week we could make an adjustment for M2  Mr Black  Mr Roberts  Mr Boehne  Mr Guffey  Governor Gramley  Governor Wallich  Mr Corrigan  Are you going to give us a little analysis of it?  We always come within $50 million anyway!  To put it in perspective $50 million would imply a $500 million dollar weakness in Ml from where we were, roughly  If we had a week in which Ml, according to our perfect seasonal, went up by $5 billion--if you could imagine a week of that sort--when we were thinking it was going to go up $1 billion, borrowing would go up by $400 million, all that being perfectly arranged  I don't quite understand this taking a 100 percent or 50 percent You're not going to know what the figure is; you don't know what to take 50 percent of  Well, I think it is analytically correct that we went out and bought a potato digger but we don't have to plant the potatoes  Mr Keehn  You're going to plant a small field! Mrs Teeters  For reasons other than a change in Ml  More slowly than most other people!  We're almost bound to get more volatility in the very short run, whatever we build into this I think--we'll see--that just [the nature of] this system is going to give us more very short-run volatility  It probably happened over a longer period of time--volatility over a month, two months I'm not sure That's an open question But I think within a two-week period we're going to get more  Mr Forrestal  Mr Balles  Governor Martin  Well, let me draw several conclusions I think it is logically or otherwise correct that simply because we  -14-    12/19-20/83  adopted contemporaneous reserve requirements, for better or for worse, we don't have to arrange our policy from now until eternity to take maximum advantage of that operationally That's a separate decision and logically comes first Secondly, I do have the sense that there's enough uncertainty about this [CRR] that we're not going to want to do anything very radical in the very first months of its introduction There may be very little change Thirdly, I think we really have to say whether we're going to do anything very different or what we're going to do because there will be [a lot of] confusion around And if this process begins on February 2nd, inevitably I guess we're going to have to say something before then  As a footnote, I want to be reminded that we may have to advance the next meeting, anyway--which will be convenient for this reason, I suppose--because I might have to testify before the Lincoln Day recess in the Congress If so, that doesn't give us enough time [between] the meeting as it is now scheduled [and] the testimony I don't know that for certain at the moment, but we may have to get back with you to see about a date roughly a week earlier [than now scheduled] If we do that, we can then decide precisely what we want to say, although even then it will be getting kind of late, I suppose It might be that there will be a lot of questions I would prepare at least one version or maybe two or three versions of precisely what an announcement might say as to how we're going to handle this at least for some transitional period while we at least make sure that the statistics come in in an orderly and predictable way  Then, finally, I think the question is What weight do we want to put on the different aggregates, which is the natural subject of the discussion at the next meeting in terms of setting targets; we're going to have to discuss it anyway People probably have different opinions about whether we will want to make any major changes, but it is a natural focus of the discussion But even if we put a lot of weight on Ml, I wouldn't be prepared to put full weight on it for at least a brief transitional period to gin up an operating [procedure] just because we have contemporaneous reserves, simply to get the operating bugs out at the extreme  Well, we'll see how it goes I don't have a good feel for it On Ml itself, just to make one substantive point, I have some feeling that it's getting a little better but I don't know why It has been way off on the low side, and seeing it come back from that I guess makes everybody feel a lot more comfortable But we have one quarter of an exceptionally large rise in velocity now So, while I have a feeling that maybe it is going to be reacting a little more normally, we surely can't prove it by any figure we've seen at any particular point in the past quarter anyway  Well, I'm not quite willing to say that  I'd hate to have to pick out today what the trend is going to be over the next three years, even though I have the feeling that it may be a little more reliable I'll know more three years from now Well, is there anything else to be said on this subject?  We will see once we set the date of the next meeting, but we may either have to circulate something to you in writing before then or have a telephone call or something because I do have the suspicion that people in the market and everybody else are going to ask what this is going to do and how we are going to conduct ourselves They will ask whether we are going to do something radically different and we ought to tell them  On this M1 issue, I don't know what the figures look like, but I was looking at this so-called experimental seasonal, for what it's worth, that we publish figures on The monthly figures look quite different  They look erratic in different ways  That's the way I see it  No, and it shows a sizable growth in November, I think That brings it to--  -16-    12/19-20/83  Yes, because the target is set forth in seasonally adjusted figures We live in an eerie world of seasonal adjustment, but when they are converted into--  Yes, but they're converted from a target that is seasonally adjusted  Yes, it looks much more like a drop to a plateau than--  The only thing I conclude from it is that, as Steve is suggesting, weekly and monthly seasonals are very treacherous and we shouldn't assume too much But [the results] are quite different, depending on which seasonal one uses  -17-    12/19-20/83  Well, we're back in that old dilemma If we wait too long, we've waited too long; and if we react too quickly, we've reacted too quickly  Is there anything else to be said on this subject? We will turn to Mr Kichline  Okay We can have some Committee discussion, which I would hope would focus as much as possible on what risks, probabilities, or otherwise, people may see looking out 6 to 12 months ahead either on economic activity or on prices Mr Boehne  You're not going to tell us whether you agree with that?  Mr Corrigan  What company was that?  Mr Boykin  Governor Martin  Mr Forrestal  Governor Wallich  Mr Keehn  Governor Rice  I might ask Mr Kichline to comment on the point Mr Corrigan made earlier, which is the inverse of this profits point Is it true that labor costs are going up much less--or historically very little--compared to prices at this stage? You don't have to address it now unless you want to We'll turn to Governor Partee  Or use the Federal Reserve numbers?  Governor Gramley  Let me just make sure that's correct; I just want to have it confirmed You have $35 billion a quarter--or more than that--on average That would be no increase in the inventory/sales ratio?  What am I looking at--unreal inventories?  Governor Teeters  I'm out of names Mr Roberts  Maybe you ought to tell us more  Mr Guffey  -29-    12/19-20/83  Mr Kichline  If I may just interrupt you The increase in profits is stronger?  How about the relationship of profits to GNP or corporate product?  But then the consumer price index should be lower but it's not; it's higher  How are profits in the manufacturing sector alone? You can cover that tomorrow  They probably are up pretty sharply, but I don't know where they are in absolute levels  Well, I think we might as well quit for the evening, if nobody else has anything to say on this subject, and turn [tomorrow] to a preliminary discussion of the 1984 ranges I don't find myself as excited about this forecast and its idealized aspects as some other people do here My ideal forecast always has a declining inflation rate Thinking back to our discussion last month, we didn't draw much  -31-    12/19-20/83 -32-  of a conclusion This is the time to come to a conclusion, I suppose, in terms of inflation strategies as well as other objectives of our long-term forecast We'll put that on the table bright and early tomorrow Nine o'clock is bright and early  [Meeting recessed]    12/19-20/83  December 20, 1983--Morning Session  We can begin with a discussion of the 1984 ranges There was some discussion in the Congress about requiring ranges for 1985, or two years ahead, and we might want to consider what we might say about 1985, at least in a qualitative way, when we present the 1984 ranges Obviously, we don't have to decide this now or even be that precise about 1984 now But if anybody has strikingly different feelings than are encompassed in the preliminary ones--or a radically different way of looking at things--this would be the appropriate time to bring it up I think the Bluebook paragraph or two about this was a good discussion of the various considerations that have to be brought to bear It does fit in with our inflation discussion last time about what we think our responsibilities are and what the practical possibilities are for dealing with inflation over a longer time-frame because these kinds of things are reflected in the long-term targets I don't know whether you have anything to add, Mr Axilrod, to your comments in the Bluebook  Yes, but that would only be if you attributed some special importance to 7 percent or whatever it is I think what we said at the time was that we would be perfectly happy with low growth if velocity were high and we'd be perfectly happy with high growth if velocity were low  It changes the arithmetic, but I don't think there's any great significance to 7 percent Mr Morris  -34-    12/19-20/83  Do you have evidence on the second year of expansion for the previous 25 years, Mr Axilrod?  Mr Solomon  Mrs Horn  Mr Black  Governor Wallich  Mr Corrigan  Governor Martin  Mr Forrestal  Governor Teeters  -40-    12/19-20/83  Governor Gramley  Are you serious?  For 1984?  Mr Boehne  Mr Roberts  Mr Keehn  Mr Guffey  Governor Partee  Mr Boykin  Governor Rice  Mr Balles  Nobody has suggested we go on the gold standard!  [Unintelligible] not happy with all these Ms  You don't want to defend this proposition?  It's working pretty well, isn't it?  Why don't we turn to Mr Cross?  Any comments or questions?  I think it's a danger  On both sides  No  Any other questions or comments?  I thought maybe we could do that after the meeting [at lunch] Meanwhile, we have to ratify these transactions  Without objection Mr Sternlight  Comments or questions? In view of great silence, we can ratify the transactions  Without objection The leeway question?  Without objection Mr Axilrod  Well, we might as well have a doughnut  [Coffee break]  I don't know if anybody else wants to direct any questions to Mr Axilrod  That was a pretty erratic intermeeting period in terms of where the borrowing and the net borrowed reserves came out The average is not too bad over six weeks or so; it is not too good [in relation to the intended level] in between  We have already had quite a lot of discussion--by implication but not in precise terms--of where we should go in the short run I might say The housing starts figures came out this morning Just to get that on the table, Mr Kichline, can you describe those?  Yes, permits did not rise very much I do not know if this is terribly significant, but the flash GNP will be coming out this afternoon--no, it won't be out until tomorrow I do not know what it is, but there is a suspicion in other places that it  -55-    12/19-20/83  may be a little higher than our staff has projected But I do not know for sure  It's not even a very good number in my opinion after it is no longer the flash Unfortunately, it can be inaccurate in both directions But it will be a pretty strong memory  I suspect we are getting a little seasonal pressure in the markets I think [whether or not] the reserve positions change, one would expect seasonal pressures from the middle of December probably through the end of the year We [typically] have a very erratic--or maybe [simply] erratic--money number early in December; nobody knows quite what is going to happen through the first week or two of January when we have often had very erratic numbers This is well reflected in the quite different signals that our two seasonal adjustment techniques provide In trying to sort all of this out, and just to give you something to aim at Given the strength of economic activity--until there's a little more evidence that it is going the other way, if we ever get it--given the nervousness of the inflationary expectations, and given that the latest money supply figures look a little higher anyway, I don't find myself in any mood to ease I am talking about a very short time perspective of several weeks Whether one would want to tighten up slightly is debatable, I suppose Part of my problem with tightening is that in announcing it, as we inevitably would have to do sooner or later, [the announcement] may exaggerate whatever one's intention was, unless one had a pretty strong intention I find myself in a position where I think that maybe what we can say is that we will maintain the existing degree of restraint at least for the time being and if things turn out to be on the ebullient side, economically and with the aggregates, we could make a small tightening move in coming weeks or wait for a little more evidence That is the way I would tend to write the directive--in a sort of one-sided way  Well, I don't know whether it will be more than what we have, but I would think that if we maintain this for the next week or 10-day period maybe, it might remain under some pressure both because of seasonal pressures and because the Treasury is doing a lot of financing between Christmas and New Year's Day Then I think that seasonal [pressure] would be over  Well, maybe into the first couple days in January--so, maybe [for the next] two weeks  I am talking about the borrowing assumption And I am talking about, I presume, without being absolutely precise--we can discuss it--measuring the prospects for any tightening subsequently so far as the aggregates are concerned against the standard of something like "B"  I haven't focused closely on those figures I was thinking of something in that area, but we may want to lower or round some of those to whole percents These figures for M2 and M3 are pretty close, I guess, to the staff's December projection; they don't involve any particular change in trend from what we have been having for M2 or M3 M1 would obviously be a little higher, but probably lower than--well, who knows what the December figure will be!  I have just one comment on that I don't think we can aim at the federal funds rate as closely as one quarter of 1 percentage point We take our chances on that a bit  Mr Morris  Governor Partee  Mr Corrigan  Mr Balles  Did you say you would like to see the borrowing above $650 million?  Mr Solomon  We'd need one, I think, if we wanted to go the other way  Mr Boykin  Governor Rice  Mrs Horn  Mr Black  Well, let me try to clarify my original position in the light of all these comments and see whether we can get closer I am partly influenced by the fact that it's just Ml that is very low and if we write into a directive that we want to increase restraint and have to reverse that very shortly because Ml falls out of bed, it would look peculiar and would be difficult to explain I must confess that I have that a little in my mind These seasonal pressures are convenient in the sense that we're getting a little more seasonal restraint for a couple of weeks I think the split we have in the Committee is between [waiting or not waiting]--not necessarily waiting until we see [the outcome of] collective bargaining agreements or that kind of thing, which would take some months But if we really get a confirmation of strength in Ml, particularly by early January-- let's say December comes out more or less as projected and we get another Ml bulge at the beginning of January, so that January growth is beginning to look high and we aren't getting any economic news to suggest anything less than the ebullience we [currently] see--I'd begin moving in a modest way as early as that I'm talking [about moving] maybe in the first week or second week in January  That would have to be projected for January, but I mean if Ml got off to a [high] start in January Right now I would say that we should try to make sure we don't get below the $650 million [in borrowing], which means obviously that we would err on the side of more tightness Borrowing might be more likely to come out above than below $650 million, but we would not be aiming above that level  Well, let me look at these [specifications] I would not mind myself knocking the halves off of the alternative B growth rates, or [making them] a little less, if that makes people happier Let me come back to the federal funds rate later Specifically, what I would put in the directive is a first sentence that reads "The Committee seeks in the short run to maintain at least the existing degree of reserve restraint" This would be explained more [fully] in the policy record part We could move up M1 if you want to On the Ml sentence, [leave out the reference to] the relatively slow growth in October and just move up that whole sentence on Ml and the credit aggregate to follow the sentence on M2 and M3 That's a very subtle change; I don't think anybody will notice it They haven't even gotten it yet that it has been moved down Then I'd make the next sentence read something like "Somewhat greater restraint would be acceptable should the aggregates expand more rapidly within the context of continuing strength of economic activity" I'd leave out anything about the down side; if something happened and we really wanted to ease--if Ml came in very low, for instance--we'd have to have a meeting  I don't know what we're likely to get in the next two or three weeks  If you exclude food and energy from the PPI, it was still a rate of only 3 percent And capital goods was, I think, a pretty good figure all around  Of the business news that we will get, part of it we'll get tomorrow But we're now looking at just the first week of January and obviously I can't answer--  Suppose they came in strong Suppose we got a further decline in unemployment and a sizable increase in Ml; that certainly would be a factor on the snugging side Now, if the [un]employment rate retreated 2 or 3, which I suppose it could just because it was down so sharply the previous two months, we'd weigh that in the balance a little on the other side If the consumer price index is high, I don't have to tell you on which side of the balance I'd throw that  We would be in somewhat of a dilemma, I suppose, if the employment numbers came in very strong and Ml came in weak Then what do we do?  I wouldn't be surprised if the GNP growth in the fourth quarter came in around 7 percent That's my favorite  -64-    12/19-20/83  statistic If it comes out 7 percent, it will be the most rapid three quarters of economic growth that we've had in the postwar period  It will be just in that ballpark Then you would say it's about as fast as we've ever had  I don't think there's any question Prices have gone up [faster] from the midst of the recession and its aftermath  The question is whether it's giving the right reading  None of it sounds to me like it supports why the inflation rate was 12 to 13 percent and now is 4 to 5 percent, but that's beside the point We need to make a decision here  I have described the intentions here about as clearly as I can What I am proposing, as I understand it, is a  -66-    12/19-20/83  pretty quick finger on the trigger if things move in the one direction and no finger on the trigger at all if things move in the other direction It doesn't mean we can't have a meeting What we're talking about is that this snugging up, if that is the right term, might well come about early in January The range of what we're talking about [on borrowings] is $750 to $800 million, depending upon just how the numbers look  Well, I'll give you three alternatives, none of which I feel strongly about either 6 to 10 percent or 7 to 11 percent or eliminate it  That's the problem in eliminating it right at this point Who wants to eliminate it? Only two Committee members We won't eliminate it; that proposal has not attracted sufficient support A 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent range doesn't send me I think we could hit 10 percent It wouldn't bother me terribly if we do; I don't think we'll hit 11 percent  No I don't think it's going to confine us all that much either I think we could hit 10 percent; if we hit it consistently over a period of time we probably would have a consultation But I don't think that in itself is going to affect anything too much, so I think we're talking about cosmetics here  I don't feel strongly about this There's something to what you say The only argument I see on the other side is that we're so close to the top of the 6 to 10 percent range, it looks a little funny keeping it there  How many prefer 7 to 11 percent? Four [Secretary's note Messrs Gramley, Keehn, Morris and Wallich], How many prefer 6 to 10 percent? Six or seven--an enormous difference Well, that suggests we leave it at 6 to 10 percent, but it's not a life or death difference as far as I'm concerned  Well, to some extent you have to combine them But we're not going to get all that much news on the economy, as we suggested I think that if the aggregates, particularly Ml, are running a little high and we haven't in all likelihood gotten adverse economic news, the present sense continues  Just because of the timing We could get some very sour economic news If suddenly everybody stops shopping before Christmas and sales don't look so good--  --and the unemployment rate goes up three tenths of a percent and employment doesn't do much and the industrial production figure for December goes up only two tenths of a percent, all that would give me a little pause But I don't expect that to happen  Only in Chicago?  Well, what we would have to do is have a meeting The proposal is to leave it out simply to indicate that there is still some bias toward a little tightening rather than the reverse  Oh, if they were really flat, I think that's right  The Committee in the short run seeks to have a merry Christmas!  Well, what about the specifications for the aggregates? We can take straight alternative B or, as I said, I'd be just as happy to knock off the halves Or we could have something different  Very little  You get round numbers; that is precisely right  Do you want to knock off the halves?  All right, let me reformulate We have alternative B without the halves and 6 to 10 percent [for the funds rate range] "The Committee seeks in the short run to maintain at least the existing degree of reserve restraint" We move up the sentence on M1 and the aggregates to follow the other sentence  Yes We can't make a major change in one meeting! And somewhat greater restraint would be acceptable should the aggregates expand more rapidly within the context of continuing strength of economic recovery Got that? And I am saying all the  -69-    12/19-20/83  other changes that I didn't mention there are as in this crossed out [Bluebook draft version] This wording "consistent with the targets" is crossed out Got it?  Well, I think that is correct technically, but it makes it so fuzzy otherwise I think that's true of the way it was last time  Well, yes I'm not sure it makes a lot of difference to me It sounds like quite a few of you are just saying that the whole thing would be the same, but we would just put a period after "expand more rapidly"  That's all right All we're doing is putting a period after "more rapidly" Okay  Okay In the boilerplate we'll change the sentence to say that housing starts gained in November, if that's acceptable I think we'll have to come back to you on the date of the next meeting I'm not sure about my own calendar at this point, but it will probably be Monday/Tuesday of the previous week, if you don't have problems with that What we need to know--let Mr Bernard know-- what days you have insurmountable problems on I suppose we can't go beyond Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday of that previous week  Let Mr Bernard know if you have any insuperable problems on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday of that week; that's January 30-31 and February 1 Those seem to be the likely days, if we have to change [the meeting dates] [We can't do it] the week of the 12th since I'd have to testify on the 9th or the 10th  Yes, but I'm not sure  That's what I'm trying to do  Probably not, that's why the logical day to do it may be on February 1st if I'm testifying on the 8th We could do it as late as February 2nd, so consider that date too Consider January 30th and 31st and February 1st and 2nd The sandwiches are not quite there We [will end this meeting and] take up this question of the foreign lending program and just dispose of that now if you want to  END OF MEETING  -71-       The meeting can come to order with the approval of the minutes, if somebody would like to move that  Without objection, we will do that I want to change the agenda order here a bit and have Mr Cross and Mr Sternlight report first, after we discuss this confidentiality item on the agenda Then we'll go to the long-term ranges with the staff report and the discussion I would not anticipate that that will come to a conclusion this afternoon, but I would hope that we will be prepared to reach a conclusion, as nearly as one can forecast, when we assemble tomorrow Given this confidentiality problem--and maybe out of an excess of caution--I think perhaps we could have an executive session first thing tomorrow morning while we complete that discussion and then resume with the short-term targets  Meanwhile, let me discuss this confidentiality issue Everybody has received a copy of the GAO report, which in general came to no conclusion with regard to who did the leaking I think the GAO also came to the conclusion that procedures were somewhat more casual on the Hill than in the Federal Reserve And the unspoken conclusion from that I will leave unspoken Maybe one should speak in terms of probabilities But obviously, they did call attention to weaknesses in our own procedures, too I don't think the key to this lies in procedures but rather in personal integrity and morale Those are really the key But I think it is incumbent upon us to review our procedures and satisfy ourselves that they are reasonable and reasonably tight and also that people know what they are The latter was particularly the criticism that GAO pointed out [Our rules regarding confidentiality] have been lying around for a long time without review and there was, to say the least, some confusion about them  The way I would like to proceed is to do nothing further at this meeting but to appoint a committee that I would hope--maybe overly optimistically but not necessarily--could report by the next meeting and if not then, by the following meeting But let's see if they can review the procedures and present some recommendations and proposals to us at the next meeting In thinking about who might be appropriately on that committee, and taking some account of geography and distribution among the presidents and the Board, it seems to me reasonable, if they all agree and if the Committee doesn't point out any great objections, that Mr Solomon might chair the committee--and the New York Reserve Bank, of course, has a particular problem--and Mr Partee might represent the Board and Mr Black, in effect, the other presidents I would have the committee work with a staff group I left the names of staff I had in mind on my desk; I hope I can recall them I thought Mr Axilrod might serve as Chairman of the [staff] committee; Mr Oltman could provide some legal perspective and some practical perspective from New York; Mr Coyne with his    1/30-31/84  particular responsibilities could also serve on the staff group; and Mr Bernard could act as Secretary to it That doesn't mean that anybody else who has an idea--either on the staff or the Committee-- should not participate I would hope that the staff would consult with other staff and that the committee might be [open] to suggestions or comments from any member of the Committee or from other Presidents and that we could proceed on that basis  If anything goes wrong, we'll point to the Solomon guidelines in the future Let me turn to Mr Cross  Your point has been made on a number of occasions I think we're getting into a very difficult situation here where we're getting totally locked into a big capital inflow from abroad which so far has come very easily--too easily--with the dollar up But when that mood changes, we will have problems because there is no way we can get out of dependence on our capital inflow from a balance of payments standpoint or from a budgetary deficit standpoint The capital inflow this year will run to more than 2 percent of the GNP, I guess So, the total net savings runs to something like 7 or 8 percent in the United States and about 25 percent of that is being supplemented by foreign capital inflows  I don't disagree with you  We have a wonderful specter of the dollar plunging and interest rates rising at the same time! In some sense the crowding out is now crowding in--or rather, drawing in--foreign capital If it [stops] drawing in, we will have a problem I think that is at the heart of our budgetary deficit policy problem  I'm not sure we would want it in the first stages, but all that remains to be seen But even then, I wouldn't have too much faith in intervention when we're relying on $80 billion of capital inflows Intervention of $5 billion or even $10 billion is a small fraction of the total  I would have had somewhat similar feelings a year ago, though less strongly, and it hasn't happened yet It may not happen in 1984 But I think it is not a sustainable long-run position to have the United States borrowing a larger and larger fraction of its GNP from abroad It's not sustainable on protectionist grounds either, or on industrial grounds But I find it difficult to predict when the turning point may come  That's right But the fact is that we started--and we're inclined to forget this--from a very strong, relatively balanced, payments position and we had a current account surplus, or a roughly balanced current account, two years ago Well, two years ago [the deficit] was $14 billion or so and last year it was $30 billion and three years ago [the current account] was in surplus or in balance [The deficit] wasn't all that big for the whole of last year by today's standards, but as it gets bigger we have to get more and more capital every quarter  It has been talked about a lot and it hasn't happened, which suggests that maybe the market is fairly resistant for the moment, but--  Do you have this in your presentation, Mr Truman? We'll get off this depressing subject for the moment  If there are no other comments, we need to ratify the transactions  Without objection  No other comments? If not, we have to ratify the transactions  Without objection, we will turn to Mr Kichline  MESSRS KICHLINE, ZEISEL, TRUMAN, and PRELL [Statements-- see Appendix]  Can someone explain to me the chart in the upper left hand corner on households?  How does that differ from the chart immediately below it, except that it is indexed?  Well, if the top one is changing, the bottom one ought to be changing too, right?  I'm not sure why, but I won't pursue it anymore  Does anybody else need any enlightenment?  Mr Morris  Mr Axilrod says yes We will defer it, meaning that he will effectively answer it in his presentation But we can have his presentation now if it's more desirable  Well, I don't know what people prefer I think we ought to discuss the economic outlook Do we want to do that against the background of your presentation? Go ahead and give your presentation  Baldwin United got in just at the right time!    1/30-31/84  Somehow this chart of yours on inflation abroad seems somewhat improbable to me too If we have that kind of decline in the dollar, all these countries are benefitting from a 25 percent [decline] in the price of oil--and you still show no improvement in their consumer price indexes  Well, he didn't assume that  But you have unemployment rising, I thought you said  Stable All right  Mr Balles  I detected a bit of a struggle in Mr Prell's explaining how the government is going to be financed and in Mr Truman's explaining how the balance of payments is going to be financed But he has the great advantage of a statistical discrepancy  -11-    1/30-31/84  I think Mr Forrestal is going to explain it to us  I think that's a very good question  The ground rule is that you can talk about the economy now If people don't want to talk anymore about the economy now, we will have a break  Let me ask you a question on the business outlook You say final private domestic demands are high and rising  Well, let's say they remain high, or however you want to qualify it, and the GNP doesn't rise all that much because imports are going up so rapidly How long can that last?  How big an increase do you have in this concept Mr Gramley is using for the first half of the year?  What was it in the third and fourth quarters of last year?  The rates are 5-1/2, 8, 5, and 4-1/2 percent You still have a big increase in imports in the first half of the year; it's magically going to level out in the second half  Because you have the happy prospect of another recession!  Are there any other general points people want to make now? Mr Corrigan  Governor Martin  You have a bigger full employment trade deficit too  Mr Forrestal  I think this is the time to have a cup of coffee  [Coffee break]  Mr Axilrod will tell us how to resolve this  I see you all have absorbed all that  I might just interject that if you notice that phenomenon going on in an important way, you might have a little counseling session at those banks about how we might look at their capital ratios  They have to take it off the balance sheet  One vote for no targets  You want that debt target?  Well, I tell you That's very strange Since you raised that subject, the chart [we saw] earlier indicates that past patterns of debt [in relation to GNP] are not being observed, rather strikingly, and I wonder what the implications are I haven't been able to figure it out but the debt aggregate is off the pattern anyway Who else would like to [comment]?  A technical question from Mr Partee  Mr Balles  Governor Gramley  Governor Wallich  Mr Forrestal  Let me just interject Beauty may be in the eye of the beholder, but I don't see any normality about the velocity of M1 ex post We have had some increases--much less than the normal cyclical increases and well delayed in the cycle Now, this may all be consistent with a presumption that M1 may be getting more normal in the future but you can't prove it by what has happened, I think, through the fourth quarter Mr Solomon  Manage our reserve position  Who is?  Seldom  Mr Corrigan  -26-    1/30-31/84  Mrs Horn  Mr Guffey  The experimental model would show a little more rapid growth rate, if the seasonals did not change, because of the benchmark I suppose  Mr Boehne  Mr Roberts  Alternative II and alternative III?  Governor Partee  Governor Teeters  Governor Rice  -31-    1/30-31/84  Governor Martin  [Unintelligible] 17 good men and 2 [good] women Mr Keehn  Make them all monitoring ranges? Where is Mr Morris?  Mr Black  Mr Boykin  I'm not sure we have ever said clearly as a Committee that our objective is price stability  I don't mind leaning on the side of price stability but I raise my eyebrows a little at your earlier statement when inflation has done better than we projected  It's a projection Do you want to add anything to your earlier comments, Mr Morris?  In their way they were, but a little confused--  1920  OPEC is going to have to play that role for us Well, we have a variety of comments I haven't noticed anybody coming out for alternative III, so that narrows the options I think we ought to return in the morning and see whether we can dispose of this after mulling on these comments We are scheduled to reconvene at 900 in the morning?  I tried to draft a somewhat different directive, which is being typed I would judge that the consensus, when we get down to the language, is to give a little more weight to M1 but not full weight I think everybody is groping for some combination of flexibility and discipline Those two things are hard to combine We can combine them in an individual's mind, but it's a little harder to combine them in a directive But that seems to be the recurrent theme I heard yesterday  And everybody is for discipline  In terms of numbers, there clearly is a lot of support for just staying about where we were tentatively [in July] If we wanted to make a little gesture, which is all we are talking about in any of these minor deviations that most people are suggesting, nobody suggested anything more liberal than alternative II but some people said generally they would like one way or another to be a little tighter for either M1 or [M2] There was not any great consensus for either one of those, but if you added together all the people who thought there should be a little reduction in one or the other, there was some sentiment [in that direction] In my mind it comes down to taking alternative II to start with Do we want to reduce the range for either M1 or M2 slightly? It might be going too far, judging from what people said, to reduce both of them I guess we're talking about a 1/2 point reduction for either of them There is an argument to reduce M2 if you believe in all the technical analysis  What do you mean that we're in either range?  For the last year?  I don't know what you mean That 4 to 8 percent was a tentative range we put down [last July]  But we never would have been within that 4 to 8 percent range last year, if that's what you mean  The 4 to 8 percent was for the whole year last year and we were way above it  One has to concede it's a round number  Well, do we have somewhat of a consensus to have the ranges at 4 to 8 percent, 6 to 9 percent, 6 to 9 percent, and I guess 8 to 11 percent [for debt]? I might point out that it bothers me analytically, but I don't know what to do about it, that credit has been growing faster than the GNP in recent years and we just say that's fine and we will continue to have ranges that permit it to grow faster than the GNP I don't know what the significance of all that is, but I just note it  Well, perhaps it would come close to the midpoint, but the staff projections show that its growth will go up They may be right or wrong They over-estimated last year, but the current projection--  Well, that's what I say But the staff has a projection of 10-1/2 percent, if I recall correctly, and that [11 percent] is not much above what they have  It's all the repayment of equity, which doesn't appear in the debt figures  What did debt actually increase by in '83?  What was the nominal GNP?  SPEAKER(?) 104 percent  -39-    1/30-31/84  Well, last year we anticipated--I remember this discussion--that debt would increase faster than GNP It did not We also are anticipating that it will increase faster than GNP this year, rightly or wrongly  Well, if we lower it, we violate the round number  Well, does 4 to 8 percent, 6 to 9 percent, 6 to 9 percent, and 8 to 11 percent capture where we want to be? This may or may not be reflected in what we say in the language, but we are thinking very roughly of M1 somewhere around the middle [of its range] I say all this with a question mark What the staff assumes for M2 and M3 is 8 percent and I think their projection for credit is about 10 percent or so  Well, let me state it this way In thinking of testimony I don't want to say we expect to be at the top but if asked why the range wasn't higher I'd say we expect probably to be in the upper half of the range  Someplace between 7-1/2 to 9 percent is what we expect for M2 and M3 and very tentatively around the middle of the range for M1, but subject to its own [unintelligible] Well, we have to wait until we get some text to look at Let me see where the typing stands on the text and have it run through a Xerox machine  I just want to defer that  I don't know that there's anything much the matter with trying to make it a little fuzzier, frankly, as to precisely what weight [we are placing on M1] It's clearly more; we  -40-    1/30-31/84  wouldn't talk about a monitoring range but would express some uncertainty about it  Well, let's see whether we have something we can work from How are we doing?  Why?  This isn't what I'm talking about at all I'm talking about the directive that Catherine was typing Trouble finding a Xerox machine?  I gazed at it and had no conclusion, so I left it We are always trying  It would be nice to change that sentence if anybody has a [suggestion]  I wasn't able to rewrite the sentence that was given so I just left it But the assumption is that it's there and it would be--  Can you think of a different phrase? I couldn't think of one last night  It says we're going to do all things  Contribute to an improved pattern? I don't know how we do that  No, I just didn't repeat it here  Why don't we put in "an improved pattern" I just assumed that that sentence would [stand], but that sounds a little less-- At least it recognizes that it isn't very good now  This [draft that you now have before you] is designed to follow that first sentence For the ranges we would say 6 to 9 percent, 6 to 9 percent, and 4 to 8 percent It's only the first two paragraphs In this second part, I just went on and added the short-run language, which we'll get to later  -42-    1/30-31/84  Well, another way is to take out the word "more" But I would not protest taking out that whole phrase  Now, just to point out Technically, it is true that if M1 were in the bottom part of that range--at the midpoint or below--and the economic forecast is correct, velocity growth would not be less than in past periods of expansion It is [M1 growth in] the upper part of the range that would make [velocity grow] less than in the past  Well, I don't know what the average is of past expansions--3 to 4 percent, I guess  If it's below the 6 percent, I don't think one can say that velocity would be less than it has been historically  Well, I'm not sure It might be more, say, 5 or 4 percent  The second paragraph hedges it all, I'd say  We are assuming that that's not going to happen, and I think we ought to say that You have now brought it up, and we ought to put in the policy record that this is all based upon an assumption that that's not going to happen during the course of this year  We can make it a little more neutral by saying "taking account of the possibility that in the light of the changed composition of M1, its relationship to growth in GNP over time might be shifting"  We can only shift it in one direction, I'm sorry--  "The possibility that in the light of the changed composition of M1 its relationship to growth in GNP over time might be shifting"  SPEAKER(?) That's good  We're putting in the nonfinancial debt range here, by the way, of about 8 to 11 percent Well, the remaining question is What we do with that part after the comma? Three alternatives leave it, drop it, or take out the word "more"  All right  -46-    1/30-31/84  And leave out the last few words at the end of the paragraph "as tentatively agreed" and go down on all the others  Where?  Yes, "growth in nonfinancial debt" I'm inclined just to take out the word "more" These things are all very narrow  Relatively, yes It says "for the time being"  You know, we are not going to get it perfect We cite the other two ranges first--period Then we say we have a range for M1 and we have to interpret that in the light of these other things, which receive substantial weight It seems to me that fairly well captures what we're talking about  I think it's putting "more" back in  Well, it says "for the time being" It clearly leaves open the possibility that our next step might be--  That's right I think the reading of this has to be that we're more tentative about M1 than we are about the other ranges  I think that is the way it is whether or not the "more" is in there  I think not I am sure it's not going to  -48-    1/30-31/84  rock markets But let me restate that what I think we're saying is that we moved M1 out of a purely monitoring status but we are more tentative about it than we are the other ones We'd be more prepared to change that range if evidence showed it [should be changed] Or if these other things were in line and M1 were moving peculiarly, we would in that sense put less weight on it But it has more [weight] than it did before  I think not I would argue that the credit aggregate is there but it doesn't have the weight the others have It has less weight than M1, I guess  Right This next paragraph is general and refers to them all But the hierarchy here as I see it is still M2 and M3 together, M1 coming up, but with some uncertainty and--  That's right And the credit range is an associated range rather than a [principal one] If no one has any further brilliant suggestions, we're talking basically about the first two paragraphs of this [draft] But I just anticipated here when I wrote this up that, in contrast to last month's approach which was unbalanced on the restraining side, we would lean a bit to the easing side--that we would be quicker to ease than to tighten  No One says we only have somewhat greater restraint if both the aggregates and business expansion were strong The other says we would ease if the aggregates were weak I think it is fairly evenhanded, but we don't have to debate that now Just look at the first two paragraphs Are we ready to vote?  We can have the other [staff] people come in I don't know what we'll do in the future, but we have a little lapse before announcing [this decision on the long-run ranges] and I think people can know this on a need-to-know basis I am going to be testifying and we probably will release it either Sunday or Monday  No, I am testifying on Tuesday, but we will send the material up by Monday We'll send it up late on Monday and that's probably the latest we will release it in order to avoid--  Just a thought I might do it on Sunday and everybody would get it together on the weekend  Well, I got a letter from Mr St Germain yesterday, an irritating letter, saying "I direct you to release it immediately" I sent him back a letter telling him it's not his decision to direct us [unintelligible] release And the Senate committee isn't very happy about--  I think that's fair unless somebody has a need to know, and I don't think anybody does except presumably the people in New York who are already here This is just an excess of caution, but it gives us a defense if something happens between now and--  That is correct  Agreed Okay  -50-    1/30-31/84  SPEAKER(?) [Unintelligible] time?  Well, we can send it to New York  Well, I think the only question is New York  We'll make an arrangement that's basically in accord with what you're saying  We're not overlooking that  I think we can proceed to the short run Mr Axilrod  What did we have last time 8 percent, 8 percent, and 6 percent?  I might say I have a little suspicion from what people have said that we're not going to have the weekly money supply figures for a week or two, or at least with long lags I don't know how prepared you are out there to produce these numbers in a timely fashion  Well, it will be part of the release  They are not unrelated [Unintelligible] supplies of reserves If they borrowed less, the excess reserves would be less; if they borrowed more, the excess reserves would be more  For two weeks  What is the December-to-March equivalent of what you have here for November to March?  77 percent  -54-    1/30-31/84  SPEAKER(?) You're saying that's the same as alternative B?  Well, we have discussed a lot of technicalities What do you want to do in substance? Do you want to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve conditions or don't you? If you do, then that means alternative B  When does the leading indicator [index] come out?  Did the housing number come out?  No, not starts; did the housing sales come out today?  Yes They are strong in any event  Excuse me, but are these figures on page 10 [of the Bluebook] all revised figures? Is that why I don't recognize them?  And to get that 12 percent in January we have to have a big increase in the last week in January?  Boy! What makes you think we're going to get that?  Unfortunately, you could also make the statement that he's often wrong  What do you mean the normal increase is 1 percent?  I don't know That's news to me How is that index constructed so its normal increase is 1 percent a month? That means the average of all the components has to go up 1 percent a month? The work-week has to go up 12 percent a year and the stock market has to go up 12 percent a year?  And the money supply has to go up 12 percent a year?  Well, you have stimulated me to look into it But it seems very strange  Well, I don't know whether we're close to a conclusion Is it clearly the consensus that--forgetting about what we do in the future--right now we "maintain" Is that the right word to put in there?  Nobody wants to ease up and nobody wants to tighten now?  Well, it doesn't make any difference for this purpose, but I'm now working off of mine Do we just put the word "maintain" in there?  Yes, I know that The [housing sales numbers] are out?  We had some strange figures for new house sales They went way up--28 percent--and it's all in the South; everyplace else they went down It's the highest figure since I don't know when [Unintelligible] The [press release] says you have got to go back years before you find a month this high  New  You have to go back--I forget, but I think it's 10 years or so to get a new home sales figure this high Or maybe it was 1978 I think it was  -58-    1/30-31/84  I didn't look at the data I was told it was in the South and that the West is down, the Central region is even, and the Northeast is going no place It's all in the South Very strange It's all in Dallas, [Bob]?  Well, if "maintain" is the right word, let's look at this draft I gave you  Yes  What's the sentence out of the last operational paragraph?  I just stuck the CRR reference in the last sentence But before we get to the CRR issue, this was deliberately changed from what it was last time, rightly or wrongly I put the possibility of lesser restraint first and said we're not going to tighten unless we have in effect both more rapid growth in the aggregates, within some limit, and good business news  Where's he reading from?  Well, before you get there, let me just note that the first thing my draft does is list M1, M2, and M3 all together And that immediately follows this other language about the relative weights  Well, I think it is to be read in the light of what is in the previous paragraph  Well, we disposed of that for the long- term ranges  Well, one way we can do it is to say M2, M3, and M1 I don't think it's read in the light of what the previous paragraph says  I have been given the following figures for alternative B if we use December to March 78, 78, and 73 percent I suppose what we would put in there is 8, 8, and 7 percent if we cite December-to-March figures We have 8, 8, and 6 percent for November to March, if you want to be essentially where we were last time  Yes "with growth of M2 and M3 at annual rates of about 8 percent and M1 at 7 percent respectively from December to March"  We don't need the "respectively"  "In the short run the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on bank reserve positions, anticipating that approach will be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 at annual rates of about 8 percent and M1 at an annual rate of about 7 percent during the period from December to March"  To make sure we're not adding up the two!  Then the growth of nonfinancial debt sentence is the language we've used before Is that acceptable?  SPEAKER(?) Yes  Now we get down to what we might do and how, going back to what Lyle was talking about Let me look at this again and decide  We had nothing in the last directive about lesser restraint    1/30-31/84  Well, the sentences become almost identical except that the order is reversed by putting "lesser restraint" first In the "lesser restraint" sentence the difference is "might" and "would," as you noted; otherwise, I think it's the same The language of the other draft has "somewhat" too It's very close, but I myself think it's a little better showing [we need more evidence] to tighten than to ease at this point  Now, what asymmetry in the words do you mean?  Yes, that's what it was meant to do  It's the same wording, isn't it? I think that's the same as what you're looking at on page 4 [of the draft directive]  Yes, but it's the same language he is looking at, isn't it? Exactly  It's the same language, isn't it?  That is a small difference; nonetheless, that's the only difference of significance, I guess, here My own feeling is that I'd want a little more evidence before tightening than I would before easing at this point  That is certainly the Chairman's mood  Well, then it becomes more neutral That's the way Steve had it, but it depends upon whether you want to be that neutral  I think we've had some business signals  The question is whether it takes more, I guess  Well, my problem is very simple I don't feel evenhanded about this  I know where my hand is  I would I want all those things  That is part of my problem  What I'm talking about depends on how far things are off Well, I'm not going to die with this language here I am just picking this up "Lesser restraint would be acceptable  -67-    1/30-31/84  [etc] while somewhat greater restraint might be acceptable given more rapid expansion of the aggregates, both viewed in the context of the strength of the business expansion and inflationary pressures" I feel a little biased at the moment as I look at the situation But this is all in the context of not doing anything at the moment Is that language acceptable?  SEVERAL Yes  When do we meet here again?  Well, if anything happens, we'll have a consultation anyway before we decide to move That's for sure And with that understanding, I think we can just leave it What that next sentence says is that we aim at a little higher excess reserve levels at least during the first couple of weeks and play it a bit by ear as to whether we pull it down thereafter We could get a good deal more volatility in the federal funds rate during this period I don't think we ought to be too sensitive to that but at some point I suppose that would be a measure of how much excess reserves were needed But if it bounced up to 10 percent or so for a while or went down to 9 percent or below, I don't think we have to be jumpy about it Just to take a guess, do we add about $200 million in excess reserves in this first two weeks?  I think the implication is that you'll probably be aiming at small positive free reserves for these first two weeks  -68-    1/30-31/84  I think that's the only problem here We could just peg the federal funds rate during this period, but I don't know that we want to create that--  Well, I think it might I don't disagree with that I'm a little reluctant to say we want the fed funds rate at 9-1/2 percent or something, so let's use [unintelligible] On the other hand, if we're not using it and, as you say, it settles in at some high or low level, I think that's evidence of the level of excess reserves they want  No, it's 3 percent It would be 6 percent if it was one week but they will have a two-week settlement period  -69-    1/30-31/84  You'll have fights with all your banks as to whether they had a carryover, if we're not clear about it  Well, things may not vary very much because they won't know what to do either so they'll continue to trade federal funds just at the level they are now That is quite a possibility We just have to evaluate this as time passes and assume that we could have lower excess reserves in the second two-week period, particularly if there are signs of persistent ease during the first two weeks  That may be correct Well, are we prepared to vote? I guess so What we say is "seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressureM2 and M3 each at annual rates of about 8 percent and M1 at an annual rate of about 7 percent from December to March Growth in nonfinancial debt is expected to be within the rangeLesser restraint would be acceptable in the context of a shortfall in money and credit growth from current expectations, while somewhat greater restraint might be acceptable with more rapid expansion in the aggregates, both viewed in the context of the  -70-    1/30-31/84  strength of the business expansion and inflationary pressures" And then we have this sentence on contemporaneous reserve requirements and the usual sentence on the federal funds rate range, which I presume we're keeping at 6 to 10 percent, which is now hallowed by tradition  We're finished already?  Coffee break time  END OF MEETING  -71-       Without objection, Mr Solomon will be elected We have a list of [proposed] officers, which is virtually identical with that of last year, with a couple of additions from the Board's staff Do you want to read the list, Mr Bernard?  Those are the two additions, I think  As usual, the associate economists from the Reserve Banks reflect the nominations of the Bank presidents serving [as members of the FOMC] We have two more, I think  Without objection, those will be approved Now we have the selection of a Reserve Bank to operate the System Account  Do you want to propose New York?  Do we have a second?    3/26-27/84  Without objection We have the selection of the two Managers I assume the present incumbents have been approved by their Board  Do we have a nomination for Mr Sternlight and Mr Cross?  SPEAKER(?) So move  Mr Cross is not here today Second?  SPEAKER(?) So move  Without objection No changes are proposed in the foreign policy--"foreign policy" sounds a little too grandiose to me  In the various directives related to our purchases and sales of foreign currency there are no changes proposed Are there objections? If there are no objections, they will continue in force We have a $4 billion intermeeting limit on changes in System holdings; that's the routine limit I'll ask whether there are any objections to retaining that If there are no objections, we will retain it That doesn't mean we can't change it temporarily from time to time as we go ahead, but that's the basic authorization I hear no objection There is an agreement with the Treasury to warehouse foreign currencies No change is proposed  It is not But it's thought to be a good idea to keep the authority active even if the implementation is not currently active  We need at least a "no objection" Again, there is no change [proposed] I don't hear any objections, so it is approved The next item is security of our procedures and related materials Mr Solomon was the chairman of that subcommittee and we will turn to Mr Solomon  Are there questions?  My memory may not be perfect on this, but my overall impression is that the record has been very good in terms of identifiable leaks from them I can recall one or two occasions where a newspaper reported that the Federal Reserve staff was thinking in a certain range or reported a certain number that sounded to me as if it may well have come from the Administration It wasn't particularly damaging or timely; it wasn't that we sent it to them and it appeared before an Open Market Committee meeting I can recall one or two instances that made me suspicious, but generally I think the record has been pretty good I don't know if anybody else has a different recollection  Within a day or so of the time it's issued, I guess  We can The point has been made to them but obviously it can be made again and probably would be useful to do so  I would agree very much with what Lyle said about ongoing relationships unless there is an apparent real problem  I don't think anybody has proposed that we release the Bluebook to them I don't know whether it makes any difference whether we send it to them a few days before an Open Market Committee meeting, which is the usual practice, or a day after I don't think we've ever had a leak just before the Open Market Committee meeting Nothing in the document is all that sensitive to issues of timing, I guess But I don't think the particular day we send it to them is sensitive in terms of our relationship with them  They don't get the Bluebook at all  It seems there may be some miscommunication here You were thinking the first vice president would not get it?  He's an addition to the pot  He doesn't have any powers with respect to the Open Market Committee  That's not all that rare  Is there consensus on this point?  I interpret this, Mr Solomon, as not limiting the prerogative of the Chairman to have more limited executive sessions for whatever purpose  SPEAKER(?) And you have even more ad hoc exceptions than anybody else  Where is this?  "Three other officers and employees" Is that the language?  What's the magic word? Employees, staff  -10-    3/26-27/84  Federal Reserve personnel There seems to be a consensus on that point Any other comments?  How, in fact, do they get to the Banks now?  Cannonball Express is a private delivery service?  SPEAKER(?) Yes  I looked at mine a half hour ago  Just looking at it from the production side, what is the problem in getting it out a day earlier?  I don't know whether we should someday review the magic day upon which we hold Open Market Committee meetings We wouldn't get into this weekend problem if it--  Let me just give you a reaction to it It has the problem of another day, which means the weekend, which I think is a problem We have an existing problem of relying upon these carriers, which doesn't make me feel all that happy on the other side In terms of substance, let me just raise a question with you What is the point of getting it so early? You are supposed to be making up  -12-    3/26-27/84  your own minds before Mr Axilrod prejudices your view Maybe it's a good idea to get it late!  Why can't they give you that advice without the Bluebook?  How does the ordinary pouch go, whatever the pouch is? I keep hearing about it What does it consist of?  Who delivers it?  Whom does the pouch go with--our check couriers?  How do they get to Washington?  How do you control the number of copies?  Is that in operation now?  Can it take charts?  SPEAKER(?) Yes  -14-    3/26-27/84  Is it secure?  Yes, let me look at it and we'll see whether we can make some alteration next time This doesn't enter into this report Are there any other issues? Should we reconsider when we meet? I won't do it now, but--  I don't know  Actually, I thought that Tuesday was a particularly awkward day in terms of the data flow  I thought one Bank had them on Monday or Wednesday, but that could have changed Well, we'll look into these things Meanwhile, I guess we can approve the report with the two amendments that were made Do I have a motion?  SPEAKER(?) Move to approve  SPEAKER(?) Second  Without objection  I don't know where we are [on the agenda]  Where am I? I'm following--  Let's go back to bankers acceptances I skipped it because it's not on this [summary] memorandum Anyway, let's consider bankers acceptances  Mr Sternlight, you have a memorandum  What is the modest usefulness?  My reaction to this is that the issue doesn't turn at all on its usefulness to open market operations, which seems to me close to nil one way or the other We were in there historically because of some idea that this market ought to be nurtured and supported and for a kind of regulatory coloration--that we determine what is an eligible acceptance and all that business And there may be some usefulness there yet I don't know what it is    3/26-27/84  but maybe there is But against that, and given what I know or have found out about the bankers acceptance market recently--that it is operating in a high, wide, and handsome way--it strikes me that I don't particularly want to endorse that And we get into the messy regulatory question as well--this question you described If something goes wrong, do we do it or not do it or what kind of signals are we sending? We may be well advised to get out My only reservation is Are we really losing something on surveillance on the regulatory side?  We don't examine them anymore  Well, that's what worries me that we give this implicit blessing and we don't really use it to see whether the market is behaving within certain parameters yet there's this assumption that we do If we don't use it, get rid of it  We don't use this now for any surveillance purposes or any that I can understand  You haven't made that distinction in your operations, have you?  -18-    3/26-27/84  The more I hear, the more I think we ought to get rid of it  Well, I don't think it is absolutely dependent but I may be wrong Historically when we used to buy them outright--maybe not in recent years but going back to the '20s, '30s and '40s--somebody would sit there and say Is this a good acceptance? Has it got the document attached? Does it meet the criteria of eligibility? That has faded away through the years I think that was part of the purpose of our being in there That we would only buy the good stuff and the idea was that the market would then gravitate toward the good stuff because that's the only thing we would buy  Is there any point in putting this out for comment? What do our lawyers say?  We've said that about some other things  What are we doing? We would still have the authority to buy but we're not going to exercise it? I didn't understand that  I really have no problem with that but it raises the question of why we have the authorization But we can face that down the road  For the time being we don't have to face that If there is no objection, we'll leave the authorization for the time being and review it later  Yes Well, I guess we're up to [agenda item 9], the minutes  That is the presumption isn't it?  -20-    3/26-27/84  You can delegate that to the Chairman and the Manager if there is no objection We have to get to the minutes in a minute The thought occurred to me in our discussion of confidentiality that we have a request--I guess from Mr Fauntroy, but I'm not sure how hard it is being pressed by Mr Fauntroy--that we give his staff rather than the whole subcommittee on the House Banking Currency Committee Part II of the Greenbook modified to redact those very few sentences that have some confidential projection or policy implication There is very little of that in Part II It is mostly a pretty straightforward rendition of the business picture and the financial picture and so forth There is an obvious problem with it at least in the sense that we did it recently for the Redbook and it becomes a question of whether conceding some of these things to them is helpful in terms of harmonious Congressional relationships, assuming it's harmless, or whether it only encourages the next request The fact is that it is a little hard to make a big intellectual case about this because there isn't much in [Part II of] the Greenbook that is not in the public domain anyway  It's a pretty straightforward analysis, I think, for the most part  That is one place where some deletions would have to be made  That's what we did with Redbook  I think one would have to assume this is virtually a public document anyway whether they promise not to    3/26-27/84  reproduce it Copies go to every member [of Mr Fauntroy's subcommittee] of the House Banking Committee  They already think it is accompanied by a black file  It didn't used to have any projections at all?  Well, I think you're right in worrying about some inhibition on the way the document is written I don't know how great that is and I don't know whether there is any general impression that the Redbook has diminished since it is written to be distributed or whether in fact that has led to any difference in the way people write it Is that a common appreciation? We do delete these sections--they are distributed separately  Well, we took a very strong line that Part I was verboten and that has not been pressed at this point Now, what they will do six months from now or a year from now--  I think there is something to that But of course you are risking that if they really press, we'll tell them we will reinstate the Proxmire-type reports  Well, I don't want to probe all your minds, but how many people read Part II?  I don't think we have to linger on this any more We won't do anything immediately but I think we ought to review the whole issue I don't have any particular feeling that Part I should be longer But we'll get the answers to Part I when we discuss Part II We won't do anything for the moment Now I'll go to the minutes Do we have a motion?  SPEAKER(?) So move  Without objection, the minutes are approved Foreign currency operations, Miss Greene  Questions or comments?  You're looking at me rather than at the people at the other end of the table Well, I think the answer to that is "Yes" Most of the attention right now is focused on Argentina where, as you know, they have a new government and a very difficult external problem The amount of indebtedness is large; it's  -24-    3/26-27/84  half the size of Brazil's or Mexico's, but it is still fairly large The new government has had a lot on its mind to say the least internally as well as externally and they were not moving very rapidly toward an external--or internal for that matter--economic adjustment program In a sense they lost a quarter or so while they were pursuing other priorities As a result, there are possibilities at least of more substantial problems I suppose it's fair to say that the possibility of getting a letter of intent this week before the end of the quarter is at the vanishing point It seems very unlikely under those conditions that interest [arrears] will be brought up to date through the fourth quarter of last year, which means those loans will become nonperforming early in April and will affect earnings statements early in April  But more important than that This is the first time, I think, that this has happened to any of these major borrowers And what psychological reaction it will have on the banks' attitudes or on the market, and indeed on Argentina, remains to be seen That would be amplified further if it is followed by a classification of the loans, which isn't automatic and which seems to be natural unless activity picks up pretty rapidly with the [International Monetary] Fund There are some indications that it is picking up now and there has been a reasonably straightforward effort going on to reach agreement with the Fund just in the last week--in terms of actual discussions with the Fund even in the latter part of last week, to be more precise There are indications that the government wants to reach an agreement Certainly, the Fund wants to reach an agreement There are discordant voices within Argentina and some very real difficulties on such little matters as how far they can reduce the budget deficit, to take one example Wage policy traditionally enters into these negotiations They have been following an ad hoc policy from month-to-month of increasing real wages Inflation is accelerating; monetary policy is lax; and the [peso] is probably a little overvalued And two-thirds of their exports would'be eaten up by the need to pay interest Otherwise there wouldn't be any problem!  I might say in just looking at the Argentina problem that they have a big trade surplus, very largely based on agricultural exports The country is reasonably self-sufficient Part of their big debt reflects some recent current account deficits, but not half of it and maybe not more than two-thirds of it In rough numbers they have had proportionally an exceptionally large amount of capital outflow, and like some of these other countries they finance private capital outflow by the government borrowing the money back But the assets have flown They don't generate any income for Argentina because the income stays abroad as well as the assets, and it puts a very large burden on their current account to manage their external debt We have a problem within Argentina and, of course, we have the contrary problem that whatever happens to Argentina--which in and of itself might be a manageable situation--how can you expect a situation to remain manageable or what are the risks that it will spread to other borrowers and we will have a much bigger problem on our laps? So, that is the focus of concern  Now, there are continuing concerns with other countries Peru lost a finance minister recently Mexico continues to look good from the external side but it still has sluggish growth However, it does look as if they may be approaching a situation where they will  -25-    3/26-27/84  not have to rely much, if at all, on net new external expansion Brazil, on the other hand, is just in the middle of what has finally become, I think--there are still some questions about it--a pretty forceful internal adjustment program, tightening their monetary policy But the success of that is still not clear  Well, I don't know what you mean by concessions It's a very foggy word The idea of giving what one might term a subsidy, which Argentina no doubt would like, would be an extremely difficult one for the banks and in itself would raise a lot of questions of precedent for the other countries Certainly, the Argentines will at the very minimum go for whatever concession--more narrowly defined as a low spread--they can get That would give banks some heartburn too on the theory that the Argentine payments are not as large as the payments of other countries and why do they deserve as narrow a spread as Mexico has gotten The Argentines probably won't be very happy with the Mexican spread That poses a problem  One can say increases in interest rates in the United States don't help any of these problems  It was October 3rd or something  However, some banks have told me that they have gotten scattered payments since then  It's $9 billion dollars or something like that for US banks  They would have to not record the accrued interest for the first quarter and also subtract out from the first quarter earnings what they already had accrued from the fourth quarter So they get a double hit in the first quarter  No, not at this point They don't have to but the process is beginning that leads to classification and then to further classification and at that point they would have to  I don't think you want to get drawn deeply into that subject, but I haven't made any great secret of the fact that in the situations where there has been clear improvement I think that ought to be taken into account in setting terms--whether interest rate terms or maturity terms or the size of the package or whatever But we haven't gone around on a case-by-case basis [unintelligible] drawing out interest rate spreads A clear case of improvement is Mexico  I detect an interesting phenomenon in this area When you talk to the banking statesmen, if there are such people--or to those who would like to think they are banking statesmen at large banks or small banks or American banks or foreign banks--they talk very freely about reducing interest rates and the need for concessions, for caps, or whatever When their delegates arrive at the banks' advisory committee meetings that atmosphere seems to be noticeably absent I think it's fair to say that we can have formal conversations that probably encourage larger thinking but it doesn't get transmitted very much in their--  by and large does not show up at these meetings does In some cases where banks were not at these meetings, I could only report an impression I don't try to track all these down Bankers who have talked in rather sweeping terms are also reported to be with banks that don't want to participate or want to raise the interest rate when the telegrams go out They think the terms are too narrow I don't think I'm completely misreading this situation There's a difference between the guy [whose] bonus is being determined by the performance of these loans and the interest rates on them and the executives who are somewhat above those levels  Well, a lot of very tricky problems arise in interest rate concessions or roll-ups or whatever in maintaining any sense that these loans are then currently performing and [unintelligible] That raises a whole range of other problems about how many reserves and so forth and it changes the whole nature of the negotiation with foreign countries There's a legitimate fear that once they began making concessions, where does it stop?  It gets a lot tougher not just for them; it gets tougher for the bigger banks and for the European banks The whole process is getting tougher But if you want to look at the other side of it and hold this thing together a while longer, it is quite feasible, as I suggested earlier, that Mexico will come back next year and we can forget about all those regional banks and smaller banks And maybe the bigger banks wouldn't have to provide anything either That doesn't say there isn't a lot of refunding to be done But I think it's easier if we can make a distinction between restructuring or refunding and new money Mexico might be getting close to becoming a country that in some sense has made the adjustment and isn't totally dependent upon these greatly ginned up programs And then people will begin saying yes, conceivably they are beginning to see the end of the process--"end" is stretching a little, but at least an end of the process of a mass draft of new money for one country--and we can begin looking more hopefully at other countries But we have to hold it together for a little while longer before that can happen  The basic arithmetic here, of course, is still very strong They can sit there and talk about not getting any new money The fact is that they're getting more interest out of all these countries and they're putting in new money It may be nice to say the choice is no new money, but the response of the [debtor] country is no interest  Well, it could In some sense they're in technical default now They're in a position where a lot of banks could say Argentina is in default if they wanted to take action  There is a mixture of opinion in Europe and a mixture of opinion in the United States So far they've held ranks, but I think the nonperforming status will give some of them that idea It will be an event We will see what happens  No  We were trying to avoid that  From the System?  Recently?  You are raising the specter in my mind that there are more such calls than I was aware of And I hope that's not the case  I have not been encouraging such calls  In the case of Mexico I can recall that there were a few calls of inquiry I'm not aware of any since then, but maybe I'm--  I didn't think there were any on this recent Brazilian exercise I'd be interested in knowing where that came from Any other questions in this area?  -31-    3/26-27/84  Just to revert to the other issue I have told the banks when they have asked that it's their job to round up all these things I've made some statements about general support for the program, which they can use in public, but not in terms of contacting individual banks [Let's turn to] domestic open market operations  If there is no objection, we will approve [the recommended leeway increase] with a note in the commentary that this is in reaction to a very large increase in the Treasury balance and not monetary policy We have to ratify the transactions since the last meeting  Do I have a motion?  Without objection Mr Kichline  The [next] item on my agenda says Committee discussion of economic situation and policy implications Mr Boykin  Your comments raise a number of questions in my mind Let me just cite some of them and other people can comment on them On this last issue, the agricultural situation, your comments are not what I am getting from some people in the Midwest They say the banks are liquid enough but the ability to repay after a few years is getting less Land appraised values have declined and land price [declines] if anything are accelerating and a lot of farmers are getting increasingly stuck On this energy situation that you started out with, my impression is that in recent months it has been getting a little worse or going downhill instead of uphill for some reason  Prices of unused rigs went up a little from a very low level and have begun receding again  I guess I just don't comprehend what is going on down there with all this land speculation and the S&Ls and all of that I'm confused [unintelligible] exposed  There are almost 50 S&Ls down there that have grown by more than 100% in the last year  And in many cases apparently making no attempt to sell the houses  How do you explain this record or near- record volume of office building in a city that has a 25 percent vacancy rate?  What is happening to the price on all these existing buildings that have all these vacancies?  I don't think you can build a new building any place at these interest rates and expect to rent it at $20 a square foot  -35-    3/26-27/84  Mr Keehn  If you look at the aggregate figures--I don't remember them offhand but somebody here collects data and makes an estimate--there are a lot more than 15 percent that have these heavy debt burdens It's a minority but it's very sizable  Iowa is probably better off The calculation of average farm income relative to assets is 2 percent If a farmer has 25 percent of his farm mortgage at 13 percent, the 2 percent is gone I don't know what the correct number is, but it doesn't take very much  Yes All expenses before interest--  Mr Boehne  What did you hear about wages when you talked to them?  Mr Guffey  Mrs Horn  I'm sure that they are never satisfied with their profit margins but if you can believe the figures that we have this morning, profit margins in corporate business are higher now than at any time in the last decade  There must be quite a few of them elsewhere  That's right--not much beyond the first year of recovery Mr Morris  We have demand for credit well above our target already  We've reached this advanced stage of economic development--and I'm serious about this--where you don't even need a buyer for the houses in order to build them You see that going on in Dallas It's a process of self levitation  I hope Dallas is the exception  Governor Martin  Mr Forrestal  I don't know how much time we're going to have tomorrow As you know, I have to testify in the morning and I don't know when I will get back We may have to go to or after lunch I'd like to get a little more done tonight, but I also am conscious of time passing and I would ask those remaining to concentrate on points that have not been made before Mr Roberts  Mr Balles, what do you have to say that will add to our sum of knowledge  We've heard a lot about it since then  Governor Gramley  Governor Wallich  Governor Partee  If nobody else wants to pronounce the benediction, we will quit for the evening  [Meeting recessed]    3/26-27/84  March 27, 1984--Morning Session  Mr Axilrod  Are there any more or less technical questions for Mr Axilrod?  I don't think we should over-estimate Mr Kichline's ability to predict the economy and even more Mr Axilrod's ability to project interest rates!  Are there any other questions?  What is the estimate?  Is that an annual rate?  Are there any other questions?  Do you have an estimate for reserves and the monetary base for March handy?  What do you have for nonborrowed reserves?  -54-    3/26-27/84  Any other questions? Well, let me sum up what I think is a difficult situation in terms of arriving at our policy judgment Drawing upon what you people were saying yesterday, on the surface we certainly have a strong expansion We haven't had much change in the inflation picture The wage picture to date--I make no statement other than to date--looks surprisingly good There really is no evidence, looking backward, of a real change there Attitudes seem to be carrying over Obviously, the issue is how to sustain progress, not just where we stand now I think we have some very large distortions in the economy that are becoming more apparent --they may not be apparent in quite the way many predicted--arising out of the deficit We have this enormous foreign trade deficit I don't know how big the housing industry is these days--maybe you know, Governor Martin--but I don't think it is much bigger than our foreign trade deficit  Just to illustrate the problem We have this decline, by whatever it has declined, and it is equivalent to losing half or more than half of the housing industry in terms of GNP Another way to look at it is that domestic demand has been expanding considerably faster than GNP  It's more than 2 percent if you take domestic private demand Do you have that figure handy, Mr Zeisel? You computed it for me the other day  That figure you gave me excludes government, doesn't it?  And it would be less if you included government?  This agricultural problem is obviously mixed If you don't have any debt, you haven't any problem But quite a few farmers have debts and the problem gets bigger This housing market could be living on borrowed time There are very funny things going on in Texas and I suspect a few other places One of the disturbing things to me for the future is that I think there is a reluctance to add to capacity for several reasons As you mentioned yesterday, [manufacturers] have been through a sluggish period and they have had a lot of instability And interest rates bite when you're talking about a new factory or something I don't know whether to be encouraged or discouraged about the future of the country I was in Winston-Salem last weekend and there's a huge new factory down there for cigarettes It's the only big factory of that sort that I've seen for a while, and it is big But all these distortions seem to be interrelated with interest rates The economy [unintelligible] when demand moves very rapidly; I don't think that's so surprising in view of the deficit But I also think interest rates are not in the short run--I don't know about the long run--a very effective brake on many sectors in this deregulated world that we live in People go ahead for a while anyway, except in some areas like new plant, without responding And I think it raises a question of how the shape of the economy will look in the future  I would add to Mr Kichline's view that he gave yesterday in response to Mr Morris as to what may happen He has a good traditional, and I think fair, view of what one ordinarily might expect low investment, low housing, and foreign trade problems But on top of that we have lots of vulnerability This thrift situation can rapidly turn negative and is turning negative We were talking about their throwing money at builders and I think they are going to continue to throw money at builders whatever the interest rates are They will pay whatever they have to pay and raise the interest rates, but they probably will continue to throw money at them or engage in speculative investments It's a sign of weakness not strength We have this LDC problem There is an interesting article in The Washington Post this morning which is not new news but indicates the kind of psychological treatment this problem may get We have the foreign exchange rate problem If the dollar declines and the foreign trade picture improves, it pushes all these pressures--bottles them up in the economy--and we will see more results there I observed that a lot of you reported that businessmen don't want us to take away the punch bowl; they don't want us to tighten now I think there is some real fear about interest rates and the question is, in part, whether these little changes in interest rates necessarily do all that much I don't think they do Maybe it's just not very visible but if you scare people enough, there is a risk of a discontinuity [in their response] here They may suddenly say "Oh my gosh, we are going back to 1980 or 1982" And people could draw in their horns quickly I say that because when I talk to people about interest rates they don't seem to be worried about a small increase What they are worried about is that it is the first step toward a big increase that they consider very serious; they have that pattern in their minds We are operating in an atmosphere where interest rates are considered the problem and we are considered interest rates Whatever we say about the budget, [unintelligible] doesn't reflect the budget or the economy It's a very simplified view--that we can control interest rates So, we're dealing with that kind of atmosphere and I think  -56-    3/26-27/84  we're living to some degree with all these distortions on borrowed time  Broadly, I guess we have three options I don't know whether my comments exactly conform to the statistics of Mr Axilrod, but I think one can take the view that the economy is going to slow down by itself and inflation will remain under control and we don't have to do much--we can luck out and avoid adding strains in the short run I don't know what you think about the reliability of that [scenario] I think it is possible but how reliable it is is a question The middle option, in a sense, is that we can help nature along by making sure we resist any excessive money and credit growth Under the circumstances we have at the moment that's a middle course but it raises the question of whether it's enough Or one can take a more aggressive and what might be considered therapeutic approach that certainly is going to be reflected in short-term changes in interest rates and we will be face to face with some of these risks--the international negotiations and the psychological risks that I referred to, of course If things don't go well, we are going to face those sooner or later anyway Those are the options that I see We can proceed  I am certain that we are not going to arrive at a discount rate decision at this meeting In making your comments you may want to make whatever observations you want from your particular perspective about the discount rate and how it might affect your judgment as to what should be done on monetary policy  -57-    3/26-27/84  Well, I'm not so sure it is so important if one looks at it in terms of the monetary growth, which is the initial focus here But I will accept any comments anyone wants to make here as to how one manages one's affairs in the interim  Let us proceed  In the first instance, I will repeat If you are talking about "B," I don't see an interest rate there and I don't see a borrowing assumption there So, I think we can do a certain amount of talking And I would suggest that we proceed Mr Black  Mr Balles  Mr Corrigan  -59-    3/26-27/84  On those credit growth numbers, I don't know if the number was touched upon yesterday but that shouldn't change the general comment February growth was swelled by these mergers and is accompanied by a decrease in equity, which isn't a very healthy thing The equity is not in the number whereas the debt is, and that makes a difference of 2 percentage points or so for one month, if I remember correctly It's still strong, however you look at it But it doesn't show an acceleration; it just shows strength  It's strong, no question There's just that extra bulge  Mr Rice  Governor Gramley  Let me ask a question inspired by your comments It really wasn't developed yesterday, and I will direct it to Mr Kichline We face various probability distributions of the outlook I saw in the paper this morning that somebody is projecting 2 percent growth in the second quarter I guess a lot of people are still projecting 4 or 5 percent Can you explain to me the probabilities and the kind of profile of that kind of slowdown?  You don't have to explain the 2 percent figure necessarily, but what are the chances of that and what is the evolution of events that would produce it? In your view how probable is it that we will see what you have projected? Did you project 6 percent or so?  Yes Suppose it were in the neighborhood of 4-1/2 percent How likely or how unusual would that be and what would have to happen to get that?  The major vulnerability, if that is the right word, is that retail sales may develop less buoyantly than you have forecast?  Governor Martin  -62-    3/26-27/84  Governor Teeters  I object a little You say we raised--  That's a little different  Governor Wallich  I think we can go to lunch  [Lunch break]  If we are reassembled, we ought to proceed What I would like to do is complete this general go-around Then I think it might be appropriate to go into a more limited session of the kind we have had before After we finish the comments by people generally, I would appreciate the staff leaving and we will go into that kind of session We will proceed with Mrs Horn  Does that imply, as a matter of curiosity, that you think that's better than changing the discount rate?  [Your Bank] having proposed one  Mr Forrestal  Mr Roberts  Mr Boykin  Mr Boehne  Mr Keehn  Governor Partee  There are a couple of outliers or people not heard from yet, anyway  Mr Guffey  I think we can go into [an executive] session now I have some wording that Steve or Mr Bernard might distribute This is no great attempt to be radically different but it seemed a little more coherent to me than some of the others It accepts the notion of putting the aggregates first That may be ducking a bit, but it reflects the comments made by a number of people that this is probably a time when we don't want to be too precise about knowing where we want interest rates, within limits I don't want to prejudge where the limits are put I'd start off with that foot rather than the other It's fairly symmetrical I put in a mention that we would want to take some account of the rate of credit growth, which I think is of concern A number of people have mentioned it So far as the numerology and assumptions are concerned, clearly the center of gravity and indeed the majority is toward "B" whether one takes the limited group or a wider group But there are feelings on both sides of that in varying degrees I rather share many of the feelings that Governor Partee just expressed, including the possibility that if the economy is as strong or stronger than Mr Kichline has suggested, there may be considerable difficulty whether we take "A," "B," or "C" We could run into a deviation in the real aggregates from the assumed aggregates that will overshadow any fine- tuning of whatever precise numbers we put down And presumably we would have to respond to it if the economy were all that strong and the aggregates were all that high But, based on past patterns, we could get a high month or two I have no projection of that sort but I just know that that could happen Even if the economy goes toward  -70-    3/26-27/84  the lower side of Mr Kichline's projection, which I think is less likely, I still think it's possible that we could have a rather high money figure--or rather that we're much more likely to be faced with that contingency than the opposite But that remains for the future As I say, I suspect that to a degree that will overshadow any half point or one point differences in the numbers we put down here  I think we have a seasonal adjustment [problem] in M1 every month I don't think you have to worry about April I trust that number about as much as--I was going to say my grandmother, but I would trust her if she were alive  I don't trust them much in any month  I have no particular feeling about where M1 is put in this list We can put it the way it was before I put it there because I think that's basically what we are concerned about I'm talking about not trusting it in narrow one percents I trust it if it shows a big increase or a big decrease And it gives us the best excuse in a real sense and in an excuse sense But I think in this particular situation if these aggregates continue to run high, we should in substance react to them I just don't think my judgment is so fine as to know what we should do when it gets down to the + or - one percent area [of differences in growth rates]  I'm not talking about automaticity in the sense that I take it Mr Black was talking about  Where is the old directive?  I have a little technical problem, but it's a very great problem, in starting out with reserve pressures, which is partly what convinced me [to start with the aggregates] I don't know how we'd describe the current degree of reserve pressures It's a meaningless concept Well, the concept isn't meaningless but if you look at borrowings or if you look at net borrowed reserves or free reserves, you're going to get entirely different answers for the month of March You get borrowings up to what--$1 billion?--with net borrowed reserves probably a minus What does maintaining the existing degree of reserve pressure or increasing it or decreasing it mean in that circumstance?  That's precisely why I put the second sentence in brackets Maybe we can drop the whole thing  Greater from wherever we start; we don't have to describe where we start The problem exists But at least one avoids it in the directive by dropping the second sentence  Well, I'm just looking over what people said here I don't think anybody, except maybe Governor Teeters, has said that they wanted a lower upper limit--for whatever that means, since we waive it when the rate gets there--than 11 percent I don't know about Governor Teeters Nobody else who spoke to that point directly--and there were some who did not--[said less than 11 percent]  I have you marked down as saying an 11 percent ceiling  That's what I just said Nobody was below an 11 percent ceiling  There is disagreement above that point, but nobody said less than 11 percent Well, if it's nothing, we can get to the wording of the directive Maybe we have the cart before the horse and people are going to want different emphases, which are going to have to be blended in the directive That's the fact of life But in terms of the specifications, I'll take them up backwards starting with the funds rate Apparently we have established that nobody wants to put the upper limit below 11 percent Some people want to put it above that Well, the limit is irrelevant, I guess What we had before was 6 to 10 percent If we keep the 4 point range, 7 to 11 percent would be the minimum that anybody is talking about And a lot of people are talking about [a higher range], but I don't know if those are outliers Is that generally acceptable or not?  Well, quite a few people have expressed the opinion that it ought to be higher and the question is whether--  I myself would think 8 to 12 percent is too high in the directive We may be under pressure to release this directive early You might have that in mind I don't intend to do so, but--  Congressional pressure I intend to resist that but I can't guarantee it My own feeling is that putting down 8 to 12 percent and having this come out will be interpreted as a much stronger step than we would want it interpreted Knowing that if we use something less and get to that point and think the situation justifies going higher, our record has been 100 percent, I'd say that we've never felt constrained when it came to that point  Maybe we can define what it means for us, but it's a little hard to describe to the market simply [in terms] of putting out the directive  I don't know what ball game you think we've been playing in the last few months, but I don't see much difference here, frankly It says we're going to set a restraint level and we're going to stick to it depending upon how these aggregates go, but we are going to look at what is going on in the economy before we change it I think that's what we've been saying  Well, that's a separate decision  I think you're back at the wording of the directive Let me see whether we can sort this out  I understand I'm just trying to sort this out Let me try 8 to 12 percent I sense that there's a lot of resistance to that Is that true?  I don't think we need a show of hands I think as a practical matter we are between 7 to 11 percent and 7-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent  Let's resolve the numbers  It wasn't very long ago that it was 9-1/4 percent  We'll go on to the next numbers Assuming we are somewhere in the neighborhood of "B," does anyone have a more felicitous series of numbers than "B" pure and simple? And one that they also think will command wide support?  Are there people who can't live with "B" as put down in the Bluebook?  Those in combination are awfully low numbers  I interpret it as a symmetrical sentence The reality I don't consider very symmetrical, but I consider that sentence symmetrical  Well, I guess it's slightly asymmetrical as written  Well, let's get back to these numbers I would feel a bit reluctant, to say the least, to lower the M2 and M3 numbers any further We have said all along that we expected to be in the top part of those ranges I think on M1 we can horse around between 6-1/2 and 6 percent, but it makes little difference I think it will make no practical difference in the way we operate, but this gets to be a visual point  That doesn't worry me terribly, but I don't know whether other people like it  We came pretty close this time  Within 1/2 of a percent?  I was going to suggest that It seems very close to that Let's assume that for the moment  Let me move to the borrowing level where I think there is, in fact, a bigger range of opinion I suspect that reflects in part that we don't know whether where we are is because of contemporaneous reserve requirements or other expectational factors We have a classic case in this two-week period of the way one would think things might happen frequently with a two-week reserve adjustment period Everybody thought that perhaps [markets] were getting tighter earlier in the period and they borrowed a lot They built up excess reserves and now they end up the period with big excess reserves and the market is getting easy In previous weeks, I guess the opposite happened This used to happen with the weekly reserve pattern and now it can happen with considerably more amplitude because [banks] have a two-week period before they get caught up short So, those who would like to calibrate the federal funds rate in their thinking down to a gnat's eyelash have a bit of a problem I don't know what this means for the level of borrowings this week and for the federal funds rate, particularly during a period when it might be higher [initially] and then turn out to be lower at the end or vice versa, depending upon the pattern during the period  Well, I'm not sure Let's assume that's the case just to get an analytic [framework]  That's what I'm about to ask I'm not sure I have a great deal of faith in them    3/26-27/84  Without any change in the discount rate?  Well, I would take just the opposite point of view The federal funds rate, with a billion dollars of excess reserves--though not during the early part of the period and I don't know what it will average--averaged well over 10 percent And we will have a billion dollars or slightly more borrowings and we happen to have a billion dollars worth of excess reserves If we have $650 million of excess reserves, I don't know what we will get  During the introductory period of CRR--we can go back before that because we had a little change in reserve requirements there--the average level of excess reserves was around $400 million  Oh, I think it will be lower  I don't assume that it is going to continue at these levels; I don't know all the reasons that contributed to it but I certainly would not assume that it will continue  I would guess that as well as people can understand this--and I don't think any of us can be very sure--that what many people are talking about as a center point is a billion dollar level of borrowing with that much lower excess reserve assumption I'll say $500 million just to put a round number down, which [unintelligible] for this past week in a total reserve position sense is tighter than anything we have had by a considerable margin Let me take out the adjective tighter than what we've had You can interpret the adjective yourself I assume that's more or less what people are talking about but I don't have any great judgment as to whether that means a 10-1/4 percent funds rate or 10-1/2 percent or  -82-    3/26-27/84  10-3/4 percent To some degree I care, but if it meant a greatly easier federal funds rate, I don't think it is consistent with the substance of what we're talking about and it would be inappropriate  Let me just try this With all the uncertainties associated with it and subject to the risk that we may find out we're crazy but within limits, we're talking a billion dollars worth of borrowing and assuming something like $500 million in excess reserves, which is less than we've had at any time since contemporaneous reserves That number may be too low [Unintelligible] Mr Axilrod?  Let me say $1 billion of borrowing, and $600 million of excess reserves and see how that goes  Well, I assume But it's nothing more than an assumption I'll accept the notion just hypothetically that if one had to guess, it means a federal funds rate in the 10-1/4 to 10-1/2 percent area  I'll get to that question Let's assume just for purposes of discussion that it's in the absence of that Well, let me get to that I'll just raise a question If the discount rate went to 9 percent, is that assumption still good?  Different people may have different opinions about things  I think the answer is We don't know how much of that expectational influence is in the funds rate already  I can't quantify this but I think it is fair to say that at the minimum everybody around this table is not talking about giving the market some false sense of easing at this stage and that, whatever this [borrowing] number is, it ought to work out that way Maybe there will need to be a little flexibility to assure that result  I made the minimum statement that I don't think anybody wants to misspecify here in the sense that it gives the market some notion that, in the newspaper parlance, there is an easing of policy  Let me just say that whatever [borrowing] number we arrive at here, I think we need some flexibility to manage things so that at the minimum that impression is not created  That is an entirely different question I don't want to disagree But could I at least assume by my very modest statement that if by some development the borrowing turned out to be quite consistent with a 9-3/4 percent federal funds rate, that we haven't got enough borrowing?  Now, that's the other question--how much to go beyond  I will tell you In this particular city a half point will be an explosion It will carry a certain message  I think I have established a bare minimum on the substantive objective for the borrowing, but the question is whether we start with this We certainly [can] raise it This may well be consistent with a tightening It is the strongest net borrowed reserve position we will have had  That is right And [the Board] obviously has the flexibility to raise the discount rate  -85-    3/26-27/84  Let me just suggest that there is going to be no formulation that is going to take care of all the contingencies that I see in the next two weeks much less in the period until we meet again in 8 weeks In the interest of testing The minimum sense that I have is that we don't want to convey any chance of easing We start off with $1 billion on the borrowing assumption and something like $600 million more or less as the excess reserve number That could bring some tightening in and of itself but I'm sure it doesn't bring any easing We have the discount rate issue I don't know what [the Board is] going to do but it is clearly an option and we don't make any automatic decision here that we will reduce the borrowing simply because we raise the discount rate If things come in such that we want to reassess this in the next couple of weeks, we can  I'd be a little concerned  -86-    3/26-27/84  We change it all the time  I say we change it all the time We don't fiddle around with it from week to week, but we get a sense of what the directive says This time we would change it if the money supply were coming in stronger and business remained strong or whatever  Unless there were a consultation If something drastic happened, presumably there would be  Not oblivious, that's right If I had a sense that we were getting a lot more tightness out of this than I judge we were really looking for, we would redo it That I can assure you You may certainly take it for granted that if there were a little easing out of it, we would adjust it  Well, excepting your last statement I would accept the others  I'm not going to accept a federal funds target that narrow  That's what we are told is the most likely outcome If we get less than that, I think the discussion says something is the matter If we have a sense of easing, something ought to be tightened up; if we get a little above that, I'm not sure I would have that sense  I would modify that If I assess this discussion correctly, I would wait for it to be [persistent] I'm not talking about [the funds rate on] a particular day but some judgment about the whole atmosphere It wouldn't be below 10 percent and I don't think it would be down to 10 percent  Well, I'm not talking about getting up above 11 percent either  In the very short run if nothing else happens, I'm talking about misspecifying on the low side I would interpret that in the very short run as misspecification on the high side  Yes Obviously, it's consistent with what was just said If things were very tight, we would take that into account in changing the discount rate We may want to change the discount rate but we might not want to do it without some offsetting adjustment, and we could consider that at the time if it appeared necessary But I don't think there's any presumption that that's going to appear necessary If it seemed to be a little too easy, in the wisdom of the Board we can raise the discount rate and that would be one factor bearing upon that decision Let's come back to that funds rate question we left dangling--this 1/2 percentage point question My own preference, knowing that this presumably isn't going  -88-    3/26-27/84  to be published for a month or more, is to raise the funds rate range a full percentage point to [7 to] 11 percent in the comfort that if we wanted to go higher, we would But I'm not sure I want the larger headline implied unnecessarily, on the order of [another] 1/2 percentage point on the range [by going to 7-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent] I might well want to go there, but I can go there without the extra headline of saying we had that [in the directive but didn't implement it] It's like that very asymmetrical directive that we had worked out all right in December Nothing happened; it never was triggered But it became a fact of life that the directive was written that way If, contrary to expectations, the economy began levelling off and we never got to the 11-1/2 percent, I'd just as soon not have it in the record  No, we left [open] this 1/2 percentage point  I have a preference It's not an overwhelming one, but it is very relevant My preference is purely how it plays in the press If we exceed the 11 percent before the next meeting, it won't make any difference We will have exceeded it by the time [the directive is published]  Yes, but I could probably live with M1 at 6 percent as a round number But that's visual, too; it's not going to affect operations  I can live with any of them, but I am expressing this vague cosmetic preference  That is correct  Significant, I don't know  In some sense, the only difference it makes is if we don't get up there  Because when we get up there I assume we're going to exceed it  The only thing I am reacting to is that when they get the directive the press will say "Federal Reserve tightens because they raised the federal funds rate range And this says they would tighten a little more" The only contingency I'm guarding against is that we never get there and some article says, "Oh, they were all prepared to go up; what they wanted to go to was 11-1/2 percent"--or whatever interpretation they put on it They don't know whether that's--  That's why my preference is not all that strong  It really depends I suppose in substance-- forgetting about my point--on whether the Committee wants to have a consultation if the rate gets there That's what it mechanically does  Based upon all the experience, I don't interpret it as a barrier anyway But it is a mechanical point that means we have a consultation So, where do you want the consultation?  Look, I think we've done something today-- depending upon how one looks at it You keep looking at the federal funds rate We are now operating on a directive that says we are not that far over it; it says no free reserves and no net borrowed reserves, basically And we just changed that We now say we are operating on a net borrowed reserve directive Whether the market really has anticipated that in its movement is the real question But I don't think there's any question that we have tighter specifications than we are now operating under  Well, you can argue that interest rates have already anticipated that  By no means would I say that it's not a valid view that we should be tightening and that one might just want to get interest rates up--period But I don't think we can be in a conceptual position of saying that every time the markets anticipate a move we have to ratchet it up one step further  If the federal funds rate stayed at 10-1/2 percent, just to put it there [unintelligible] A perfectly good example I don't think it would be long before the prime rate went up another half point  I think it will be too  Yes, I think Steve is absolutely right about this thing  I think maybe you have the wrong instrument in mind  For these purposes, you are discussing the wrong instrument, I think I would reinforce what Steve said; I don't have much question about it  Look, as I think you know, there is not much in this difference between 7 to 11 and 7-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent Which way do you want to make it?  Just Committee members How many want it 7 to 11 percent?  Hold up your hands again  How many want it 7-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent? It can't be much closer Can we live with 7-1/2 to 11-1/2? Let's hope we can Now, we have this other number to worry about I think the only one that's relevant to worry about there is M1 How many can live with or want it just the way it is 6-1/2, 8, and 8-1/2 percent?  You're only going to get two choices here The other side is How many want 6, 8, and 8-1/2 percent I came out that it goes the other way--6-1/2 percent  I think the 6-1/2, 8, and 8-1/2 percent had the majority It's a perfect balance Those who wanted the higher federal funds rate won, and those who wanted the higher M1 won How can we get a better consensus than that? Now we can return to the language of the directive  I don't know how to word this directive with reserve pressures [unintelligible] I'm not opposed to it in principle; after listening to this other discussion, I just don't know how to do it  I don't know what it means I literally do not know what that means If I had to explain that in public, I would be absolutely lost  -95-    3/26-27/84  My only problem with it is that I just don't understand it  Yes, but I didn't have this problem when excess reserves were going up and borrowings were going up at the same time That's why I say it's just a little technical problem  Well, we're not talking about that We're saying there's a significant increase in net borrowed reserves  Yes  Well, I think that's a little better, but I obviously interpreted it in terms of net borrowed reserves  Well, what has emerged recently in the net borrowed reserve sense is no different than what it was beforehand  That is the problem, I think  That's because we don't hit the--  In a borrowing sense it's going up, if it is interpreted as borrowing  -96-    3/26-27/84  This is to me almost a purely cosmetic point, but I think we're walking into difficulties The whole attack on the Federal Reserve is that we're trying to manage a good growth situation and that leaves us extremely exposed  We say we're tightening because the economy is growing too fast I'm not talking substance now; I'm saying that we are walking into--  Well, he may have this great concern about the market; I have a very considerable concern that we are walking directly into the trap of our most vociferous critics  I think our theology is in full swing on both sides  -98-    3/26-27/84  Let's fuzz  We could take the radical step of putting a range around all the aggregates  You know, we're really exaggerating the difference between these two languages The first says "maintain/ increase somewhat/ decrease" and that gets into this problem of what it is now It is possible to say in variant I "anticipating that this approach will be consistent" This says "consistent"  The argument is what people will read into that for the next meeting But there must be some language that doesn't raise the sharpness of the concerns on both sides  I have no feeling about that one way or the other  Does it help anybody to say "In the short run the Committee seeks a degree of pressure on bank reserve positions consistent with"?  "Seeks a degree of pressure"?  "Over time" sounds a little funny when we talk about--  SPEAKER(?) "Broadly consistent"  "Broadly consistent" is all right but that makes it [a change] Last month we were consistent This month we will be broadly consistent  We have to leave out the "broadly" and put in the "around 6-1/2, 8, and 8-1/2 percent" Is that what we have? In the next sentence, though, do we want to clarify precisely what we're doing initially on borrowings?  Yes I think it reads all right without that  -100-    3/26-27/84  Well, I think we have used reserve pressure or reserve restraint as a synonym for borrowing This just says borrowings because of the confusion about what the heck we mean It raises questions, I suppose, but it depends upon how fully we want to describe what we decided It reads perfectly well without it  We can leave it out and point out all these problems in the text [of the policy record] That's one way of handling it  Yes, but it's kind of funny when you look at it Maybe it will have to be changed We say "The Committee seeks a degree of pressure" That's a perfectly general statement Then it says "greater reserve restraint" Well, that's implied already There is something logically lacking when you leave out the second sentence I have no great desire to leave the second sentence in, but it raises a question about the next sentence  I don't know what that means  What it's saying is that all these people have raised questions I think what we understand it to mean is quite clear a billion dollar borrowing assumption  -101-    3/26-27/84  That's right  I think that is true too  I just have a small logical point Where are we starting from when we say "greater restraint or lesser restraint"?  Well, what is the meaning of the next sentence Greater reserve restraint than the degree of pressure on bank reserve positions consistent with? We're not saying that  I think we are better off to make the sentences hang together Let's go back to Lyle's language In the short run the Committee seeks to maintain pressure on bank reserves consistent "  That's right--"anticipate will be consistent with"  Should we start with M3 and say M3, M2, and M1? Is that what you're saying?  SEVERAL No M2, M3, and Ml  That just looks so peculiar We could leave it as separate sentences, I guess  -102-    3/26-27/84  I think we ought to leave it this way or say M3, M2, and Ml  Why don't we leave it this way  I think I would say at this particular meeting "Broadly, yes"  That's because the market gives 90 percent of its attention to M1; and I don't think it is going to change much  I don't think it makes the slightest bit of difference  I now have "In the short run the Committee seeks to maintain pressures on bank reserve positions judged to be consistent with growth in M1, M2, and M3 at annual rates around 6-1/2, 8, and 8-1/2 percent respectively during the period from March to June" Skip the next sentence Now we go to the next sentence There is a slight bias in this thing  Put a comma after "business expansion" and take out the big substantive change  I think we can take out the last sentence We have a two sentence directive Put in the word "might"  Well, I guess the question is whether to put a separate sentence in about it I don't know whether that's good or bad I don't know exactly what the sentence would be but I thought it might depend on whether we put another sentence in up above  We get in trouble if we put it in the first half of the sentence It's logical in the first half of the sentence, but you have to put it in the second half too, I guess  SPEAKER(?) Yes  Monetary and credit aggregates  Somehow that makes it sound so technical I think it would be the first time we've had that in the directive; it has some significance just putting it in  I think it's better that way If we want to highlight it more we could say "the rate of credit growth, which has been excessive recently" Are we ready to vote? We have a sentence here with the federal funds rate range of 7-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent, the standard sentence for that  Okay  I think you can inform them and follow the rule The numbers in the directive are all right, I think  Whatever the rule on that says  I'm not sure I would say that they have to have [this information]  SPEAKER(?) You can reproduce the Bluebook  END OF MEETING       If we're finished with this, we can turn to the meeting [agenda] and maybe have the Managers' reports today We need to approve the minutes of the last meeting  Without objection Mr Cross  There has been some tendency for US bank rates to go up in London as well as in the United States relative to other rates It hasn't gone very far There is a little selectivity in the bank stock market--at least about some banks--but there is talk about it  If they are not adequate, I don't know what else we can do  There may be some questions about it nonetheless  That is intended to be answered in the press release by saying any arrangements--or whatever the exact wording was--  $40 billion, if you take it all  No That has been greatly exaggerated in all the press reports I don't think anybody is realistically talking about anything other than protecting against some further sizable increase in interest rates It's all talk and no action at this point  I don't know anything about that, but I know they are very unhappy--understandably so  There's no question that the rise in interest rates has depressed the whole atmosphere surrounding these debt negotiations, which were already difficult Certainly in Argentina and in the others as well, though perhaps to a lesser degree, they have a very great feeling of helplessness The banks do as well Mr Sternlight  Questions?  How much do the dealers have left of that financing?  Any other questions?  Any questions? We need to ratify the transactions I heard a motion and second Without objection We will continue at 915 am tomorrow  [Meeting recessed]    5/21-22/84  May 22, 1984--Morning Session  Any comments?  Welcome to the world of American banking! Governor Martin  -10-    5/21-22/84  Mr Black  Mr Roberts  What is the list price of something that goes up and down that much but has been unchanged?  Mr Forrestal  If those banks down in Atlanta aren't worried about Continental, I assume they are fully funded  Governor Wallich  I think I agree that it's not raining; there may be a heavy mist, though  Governor Gramley  Looking at prices, one of the irritating things is that we changed to this new consumer price index about 18 months ago--the beginning of 1983, I guess The old measure has been running about 1 percent less at an annual rate than the one we now use If we hadn't changed that index we'd be looking here and saying My goodness, consumer prices were only up 3-1/2 percent recently And, of course, that is what social security and wages are indexed to  It has to be That's the only thing they changed  It's about a 1 percentage point difference as I remember so far this year, or maybe over the past 12 months  It's right there in the second paragraph of the release but nobody ever looks at it  [Unintelligible] we publish those figures --they say a 13 percent rate of price increase!  Mr Corrigan  What reports are you getting?  But is it clearly designated by agency? Does anybody else sense that?  On agricultural loans in particular?  Well, we're going to have to take some further initiative in this area I'm sure the concern is real, and I don't know what we can do other than forbearance But I think we're going to have to make some more specific arrangements to make sure that we are forbearing appropriately  I don't think that would cure the problem  Mr Guffey  Mr Boykin  Mr Balles  Governor Partee  Mr Morris  That big boom is all electronics  I'm skeptical of the productivity improvement Mr Solomon  If we have no other comments, we'll turn to Mr Axilrod  Let me say a few words before we have the coffee break I don't like quite a lot of things I see these days whether in the real economy or more particularly in the financial economy I certainly think attitudes are very volatile and I wouldn't bet on the economy slowing down all that much I have one hypothesis but it could change very rapidly If you forgot about the financial side--and I'm not sure I'd propose it anyway--it might take somewhat more aggressive action than we've taken before to bring the economy to a suitable path And I might argue that that's the best thing in the world for the S&Ls, for the farmers, and for others--to take it in the short run and have some hope that they are going to get out of this situation over a period of time But, unfortunately, I don't think that course of action is open to us I look at this financial market as being on a knife's edge I don't believe all this business about policy at this point working at the margin with a nice little rise in interest rates slowing things down here and there We have a financial market that for better or worse works by bankruptcy And when the economy is getting strong, people are going to make leveraged buyouts and they're going to make construction loans without any takeouts and for full value and I don't see any sign of that stopping gradually In some ways it seems to increase as the economy gets better, whatever happens to interest rates, until all of a sudden something happens and then it may go [whirling] in the other direction  The biggest sign we have of something not working at the margin right now, I think, is the LDC situation They are all going to survive together or they are all going to go down together If they go down together, we will have a reaction in our financial system and in our economy that I think at the very least is going to be very difficult to cope with We have this strange situation Karen starts off today by saying bankers are shoving money out the door; you hear that all over the place I'm sure they are engaging in financial practices of a type that probably would send the fathers of some of these bankers whirling in their graves There are things you never heard of in the banking system on the one side; and on the other side we have this other force coming on If you want to see a group of ashen-faced bankers, sit down in a group and talk to them about the Continental situation and possible repercussions for the funding of their own banks against the background of this LDC situation and what that might mean in terms of their own behavior and policies I don't think it is occurring at the moment, unfortunately--I don't know, maybe some of this is going on--but what it could mean is a sudden change in attitudes I hope it's working gradually at the margin, to some extent, and maybe it is I don't see any evidence yet but this is very recent  My bottom line is that we've run out of room for the time being for any tightening, given this situation I don't know for how long I don't know what is going to happen in the weeks or months  -27-    5/21-22/84  down the road, either to the economy or to the aggregates or these other things I don't have any sense here that we should be easing But I do think we have to be concerned about a very potentially volatile and actually volatile set of attitudes here and elsewhere This Continental situation is rather enlightening in the sense that we have a government guaranteed institution at the moment which nobody much wants to fund anyway There is no doubt that it has caused a lot of looking at other banks and we don't see that strongly evident in the market now When we see it strongly evident in the market it will be too late, in my opinion, to keep it under reasonable control We're pretty close to the edge of that now So, I'll leave you with those thoughts and go have some coffee and orange juice  [Coffee break]  Well, we can proceed Governor Rice  End of the story?  Mr Boehne  Mr Solomon  -28-    5/21-22/84  Mr Guffey  I think that's possible  It looks like we'll get a decline in Continental's borrowing and it might actually disappear tomorrow, but it doesn't reflect any better position They are getting prepaid for this credit card [sale] and drawing more on this backup line If we want to get them out tomorrow, maybe we could It doesn't reflect any basic improvement in their position  -30-    5/21-22/84  Not much Compared to 6 days ago they got $2 billion from the FDIC; they are getting a large amount of federal funds from one semi-governmental institution; they are getting paid $750 million today by Chemical for the credit card business Add all those up together and I don't think you get much [improvement] Plus they got more from the line banks  Well, we don't get the numbers that closely I think there has been some further deterioration; it's not basically better  It's holding I don't know that one can be very precise about it There were no very marked reflows I don't want to interrupt the conversation but they were losing their correspondent funding among other things; they pretty much lost it Any encouragement in that avenue might be helpful, but it comes from a lot of small banks and they just lost it They were very heavily dependent upon foreign funding and they still get a little, but they don't get anything like they were getting before  Mr Keehn  Mr Forrestal  Mr Corrigan  One thing we ought to be sure of!  Governor Gramley  Mr Boykin  Those risks are not exactly separable in my mind  Mr Morris  Mr Black  Governor Martin  Governor Wallich  I don't think they would be Let me dispose of that I think the Continental problem is independent of the level of interest rates I do not think the LDC problem is and, therefore, I don't think the concern about the banks or the banking system is  Mr Balles  Mrs Horn  Governor Partee  Mr Roberts  Well, there is a broad area of consensus here, and we can turn to the wording But let me make one comment about the financial uncertainties or whatever we want to call it I think it's extremely unlikely that they are going to go away in the time period we're talking about Continental may or may not be handled; that's going to be difficult in itself But what I don't think is going to go away is the background of concern about the other  -36-    5/21-22/84  banks against the fact that we are entering a crucial period on this debt problem in Latin America Argentina does not look good from any external signs We have a funding to do with Mexico which should go well objectively, but in this atmosphere I'm not so sure One of the problems is the interest rate problem Brazil--depending upon whom you believe--doesn't look too bad But the Argentine situation is very much in jeopardy Venezuela is fooling around Maybe I'll be wrong, but I don't see that the undertone--it's more than an undertone--of concern is likely to evaporate in two or three weeks I think the sense of knife's edge or fragility is going to be with us for a while We [are not likely to] get Continental settled and some of these other debt problems behind us, at least in people's opinion, for some months Getting Mexico more or less semi-permanently taken care of would change the atmosphere But I think that's some ways down the road at this point  So far as the language is concerned, we have exactly the same numbers that we had before if we take "B" for M1 and M2, which is nice; I guess we're forced to raise the M3 number to be reasonable and I suggest 10 percent I feel rather strongly that we should make some mention of reality out there--that we are affected by financial market conditions and the conditions of the banking system are part of that It's appropriate to say that we do [take that into account] Having no mention of it in the directive seems to me misleading, in fact The minimum we can do is what Governor Partee suggested I personally would probably do more than that, but I think that's the absolute minimum--the recognition of the problem In a close reading of what we had last time, the directive is slightly biased in that we're more apt to tighten than to ease I would make that symmetrical and put "mights" in both parts of that sentence I think "might" is probably more appropriate than "would," given the other caveats  Yes, I didn't even notice that Should we put "somewhat" in both places?  Our Secretary is a little bothered by the English in the first sentence What we can do is make two sentences Before we just said "seeks to maintain pressures on bank reserve positions judged to be consistent" When we say "maintain existing pressures," which is I assume what we're talking about here--I'll get back to that precise numerology in a minute--it might just be a little better to make two sentences "The Committee seeks to maintain existing pressures on bank reserve positions This is expected to be consistent with" Let's put a "somewhat" in front of "greater reserve restraint might" and in front of "lesser restraint might" I would just emphasize the qualifying clause a little more; [instead of a semicolon] I would put a period there "In either case such a change would be considered only in the context of appraisals of the strength of the business expansion, inflationary pressures" If we adopt the Partee suggestion we would put in there "financial market conditions, and the rate of credit growth" I would be perfectly happy to write a separate sentence about that  -37-    5/21-22/84  Well, I don't know that there are any more comments It's not the way I would do it, but I think it's acceptable I was playing around with a sentence such as "The Committee recognizes the operational implementation of policy might need to be modified in the light of unusual financial strains should they develop" I think that is the fact of the matter  I would not change the federal funds range --just on the grounds that other people are going to [read it as a tightening] I can never be sure whether these [directives] are going to be released on the regular [schedule], given the Congressional interest in them I don't see any operational significance in that but it will be read subsequently as a tightening I don't think that's what we mean to convey, so we shouldn't bother doing it  Well, forget about this financial market conditions part for the moment Is the rest of this all right? We break up the sentence and start a new one with "This is expected to be consistent" and we put in 6-1/2, 8, and 10 percent [for M1, M2, and M3] We use "somewhat greater reserve restraint might," which is of absolutely no policy significance Make it a period after that The sentence looks a little long; I mean nothing by that I would put in the word "only," if that's all right I can live with this other suggestion I think we have to make some acknowledgment of [financial market conditions] in there; it is unrealistically little to me, but so long as there's something--  That's what I would have done in my other sentence saying that the operational implementation might need to be modified This is precisely what I was after If we do it the other way, we're just leaving it understood, I think  This sentence really refers to changing [the degree of restraint] in response to the movements in the aggregates  I think it stands on its own feet and that's fine so far as it goes, but it does not take care of Mr Axilrod's problem I guess we could leave it understood  I think we can also say if it really becomes necessary, we will have a consultation and we can have one And we may well want one sometime during this interval  I think Steve is technically right but it should be understood It would be a better or [more] complete directive to put something in there, but if it's understood and we can all live with it-- I think it ought to be understood  It became a little more operational  Let me just clarify the so-called Continental problem, as it is in my mind Continental is probably manageable with difficulty; $40 billion institutions are difficult to manage Having two or three $40 billion institutions is a horse of a different color If we have two or three, I don't think we're going to stop at two or three  Well, it is in the sense that that's where the LDC problem comes in I think that is the cloud overlying many other banks--not Continental, which happened to be largely a domestic problem The underlying concern about the other banks wouldn't be there if we didn't have this international debt problem  That's correct  Well, the other $40 billion bank problem is going to come because of the LDCs, if it comes Again, 1 or 2 percentage points on interest rates in and of itself doesn't make or break that problem Psychologically it may, given where we are in the negotiating scenario  I don't--  Mr Axilrod has found a bit of time honored boilerplate We can do what we feel like in the light of financial distress  We have ample authority  I think we have to put something in the boilerplate, which nobody reads anyway I guess there's no mention of this whole range of problems Steve is proposing a sentence I don't know whether it has to be precisely this, but let me know if you agree in general "Recently, day-to-day market conditions have reflected considerable sensitivity to potential liquidity strains, as highlighted by the problem of one large bank, and to uncertainties about the financial and budgetary outlook generally" That's an accurate statement It is one of the versions  Well, where we are, just to repeat  seeks to maintain existing This is expected to be consistent with etc, "somewhat greater reserve restraint mightIn either case such a change would be considered only"--I would prefer to leave that in Then it says "financial market conditions and the rate of credit growth" We leave in the 7-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent [range for the funds rate] All this is with an understanding that that bit of long-range directive language that has probably been with us forever covers the  -42-    5/21-22/84  situation where if we need some flexibility in light of financial market conditions, [we have it] whether or not we are responding to different aggregates or growth or whatever  That depresses the--  --the speed with which we react to the aggregates  Right  I'm not sure I understand what you're saying It says--let me take the optimistic side--if the aggregates look a little weaker than this and if the economy seems to be moving ahead and the inflationary pressures are strong, we wouldn't be very quick to react If the aggregates are going up and the financial markets are in turmoil, we wouldn't necessarily be all that quick to tighten  It seems pretty clear to me  I think that is correct  It's not ruled out and it's not meant to be ruled out  You ought to be delighted! Shall we vote?  -44-    5/21-22/84  In  Are we ready?  We're going to be very careful in the context of all this stuff  I think we're cheating if we leave it out  We have more things understood  I'd be delighted to have them read that we take a second look in terms of all these things  I think it's a relatively minor point All it is meant to convey is that before we move we should stop, look, and listen a little more strongly than before That's the way I feel It's a question of whether you feel that way or not  Let's vote  Okay The meeting is over  END OF MEETING  -46-       I don't know whether you've had a chance to meet all these people yet, Ms Seger We can make our introductions afterwards, but we welcome you to the meeting  We don't have a coffee break this afternoon, I guess  Don't tell them that! We will proceed We need the minutes approved  Without objection, they are approved We will turn to Mr Kichline  MESSRS KICHLINE, ZEISEL, TRUMAN, and PRELL [Statements-- see Appendix]  I have a sense that the inflation forecasts from people sitting around this table are considerably pessimistic relative to what has happened recently  Let me ask a question about this debt number I don't know how you figure all this; I'm sure you don't have any very precise way of allowing for the mergers Suppose you did this differently--or this may be what you did--and included the normal level of stock financing in the numbers, whatever it is What would these ratios look like relative to [the normal] experience?  Well, I'm looking at the bottom panel but that doesn't give me the answer Suppose this measure that we use were not net domestic credit or whatever we call it but net domestic fund raising  But would these lines go below zero? Shouldn't the red line have gone all the way to the bottom in some sense?  It doesn't make any difference what chart I'm referring to  That's what you subtracted?  The borrowing must be the total amount of the red part  Now, all I asked was If you took both of those together and had some base--I don't know if you used it correctly--what would the percentage increase there be?  It's 12 percent if you just apply it to a base of 10  But you also have a distortion when you do it this way if in fact there is a lot of retiring of equity  You have it coming down pretty quickly  Mr Forrestal  Mr Balles  We learn from experience--and I have great sympathy--that nothing changes that 15 percent decline  No, they have always said 15 percent  Do we have any other comments?  What weight do you put in these remarkably low wage trends from the fact that the index that goes into wages is also remarkably low so far? I think for the past year or so the consumer price index W or whatever it's called [unintelligible] is fully 1 percent lower than the one that everybody looks at And [the difference is] more than that this year  That index is going to reverse on us now, isn't it?    7/16-17/84  It was going down while mortgage rates were rising because of this mix problem, I take it  They are busy getting legislation enacted  Mr Balles  Mr Morris  I think at this time we don't have the answer to your questions  Excellent question  Mr Black  We can all be encouraged to know that Milton Friedman has decided that with the downward shift in velocity of--I can't remember whether it's 8 percent or 11 percent--all bets are off in the future for inflationary implications of that rapid growth  Mr Keehn  Governor Gramley  Mr Boehne  Mr Boykin  By a considerable margin Governor Wallich  Governor Martin  Governor Partee  Mr Roberts  Well, we've had a long and I guess useful discussion If nobody else wants to say anything--  I think we ought to go on to Mr Axilrod's presentation before we quit today But before we do that, I just want to say a few things myself I want to ask, because it has been on a lot of people's minds in this city, about a theory going around that we are on the verge of deflation--a theory that is widely publicized by one group morning, noon, and night It has been an expanding group in political terms I haven't detected it, but I just want to confirm that that theory that we're close to some deflationary movement is not shared by anybody around this table  Well, it's price deflation as I read these things--price deflation followed by severe recession down the road  Well, let me make a couple of comments that have occurred to me in listening to all this I could have left these for later, but what jumps out at me is how atypical this cycle is Just on the face of it, we have had more rapid growth than at any time during the postwar period--which I guess makes it atypical-- though we started from a low level, to be sure Take those domestic demand figures, which didn't include inventories, that were presented to us a little while ago If you compared the domestic demand with earlier cycles, I think you would see nothing like what has been going on in the past 20 months And, in fact, it doesn't show much sign of a slowdown If you look behind it, we obviously have a budget deficit, as was mentioned, that is out of line with all our experience It is in fact rising in the third year of expansion and the full employment deficit, however calculated I guess, is rising rather sharply Of course, the mirror image of that is the trade  -19-    7/16-17/84  deficit, and however one adds it up I cannot believe such a deficit is sustainable forever--however long forever is  I would like to think that there is something else atypical-- but it remains to be seen--and that is that prices are moving up exceptionally slowly, given the strength of demand at this point I'm sure the dollar has something to do with that But how much we have ingrained in the wage situation from a succession of recessions or other factors remains to be seen I share the feeling that a number of people have expressed that the reliability of any economic forecast in the 18 months ahead under these conditions is exceedingly limited, to say the most for it I don't doubt that there's a lot of momentum in the economy right now; I wasn't so sure a month or so ago, but it surely looks that way now And I don't doubt that we're getting a continuing thrust on fiscal policy I must say that I don't see much effect from the rise in interest rates we've had and I'm not sure we're going to get it when we're in the midst of one of these periods of considerable momentum I was--I don't know the right word-- bemused, I guess, by the analysis of the last Michigan survey that says the public thinks interest rates are low and one of the reasons they are buying is that they think rates are going to be a lot higher later That doesn't sound as if marginal changes in interest rates are going to affect purchasing very much Of course, consumer interest rates in fact aren't doing anything, except maybe very recently, and I doubt that there is much there to change the behavior very strikingly At the same time, all these interest rates produce a lot of income on the other side of the balance sheet--on the income statement--that we haven't had in past expansions We certainly need some slowdown in my judgment, given all that's going on In fact, I think we're having a test of monetary policy in deregulated markets and it doesn't look very sensitive in terms of responses out in the economy I have to say that I think a lot of the difficulty we are facing is due to no great news on the budgetary situation The only promise I can see in that area is that the budgetary situation wasn't absolutely written in heaven or wherever it was written, maybe the opposite place, and it conceivably could be changed--not in the next three months but looking beyond the next three months I'm almost inclined to say it better be changed or we have an almost insoluble problem I won't berate the fact that we now have a financial system under pressure in every direction I don't for a moment want to underestimate that problem, which I think is a considerable risk on all sides in terms of looking ahead We'll talk more about that tomorrow when we get to the short-run policy So, with that much comment from here, why don't you give us your wisdom about the long run, Mr Axilrod?  Well, thank you I'm aware that it's 500 pm and somewhat warm But maybe we at least ought to deal with any specific questions that people have or go on and say something about the ranges themselves We can do so or wait until the morning  We were way over the 4 to 8 percent range, I guess  It means what the Committee says Are there any other technical questions?  We ought to put them all on probation!  Any other questions or clarifications or whatever? I wonder if we can just do one other thing get a preliminary view just on the 1984 ranges Maybe it will be easy; if not, we won't carry it through to a conclusion Why don't we present it with a relatively simple option here, which is a largely cosmetic ingredient It may be more cosmetic than substantive, but I'll find that out Mr Axilrod is not suggesting any change in M1 or M2 Is that going to meet with general approval?  SEVERAL Yes  Then the analysis says--whether it's right or not is another issue--that for M3 and debt we in all likelihood are going to end up above the present ranges Is that a good reason for raising them or should we keep them the same?  Mr Guffey  Well, we may not want to debate this at this time of night My own inclination is to keep them the same and say that we expect that we're going to come out above these ranges but we're not too happy about it and that's why we're not changing them  We think they're higher than they should be for the long run  I don't know what it means if we raise it If we raise it a little, we're probably saying we better darn well get within it I don't know how people will interpret that  Predicted or accompanied?  SPEAKER(?) Yes, what is this?  If I understand the way they measure it, that is not the way they get the number They say they get the number by the amount the stock was reduced [Unintelligible] statistic  Well, I won't pursue it any further Let's dispose of this first thing in the morning  [Meeting recessed]    7/16-17/84  July 17--Morning Session  I had a little research done overnight on a couple of factual points that arose yesterday Let me just report the results of my research Nonperforming loans of the big banks have been going up rather regularly--through March, anyway They were 38 percent compared to 35 percent at the end of last year From very incomplete reports that we have so far, my impression is that they have taken another jump in the second quarter Mr Boehne raised the question of impressions about wages--and I think we all have been surprised at the low level of the figures--and whether the figures are right We went back and looked at wage settlements that have been reported so far this year and it's a rather interesting story Let me read the list, which begins in January and goes more or less to date  Commercial builders in New York City in January--a big settlement, no cola, but 6-3/4 percent;  Teamsters/Motor Express--minus 15 percent; Oil refineries, the first big settlement of the year--l-1/2  percent, no cola; Highway contractors in Pennsylvania--0 to 2-1/4 percent; Container industries, 17,000 production workers at the four largest  companies--0; Fieldcrest Mills clothing--55 percent, no cola; Honeywell office machines--0, no cola; Minneapolis hospitals -- 4 percent, no cola; United Airlines flight attendants--6 percent increase over three  years and they get it right away; Dow Jones & Co--not, I think, terribly affected by business  conditions--7-1/2 percent, a big one; Los Angeles hospitals--5 percent; Western Coal Mines, United Mine Workers, 10,000 people--2 percent,  no cola; Hawaii hotels--4 percent, no cola; Southern California Gas--6 percent, no cola; Frontier Airlines--minus 11 percent; New Jersey building contractors, unlike New York--3 percent, no  cola; Northwest Airlines flight attendants--6 percent, lower for new  hires; Public Service Elec & Gas, New Jersey--5-1/4 percent, but with  lower pay for new hires; McDonnell Douglas Aircraft, 9,600 workers--0; Chain Food Stores, New York & New Jersey--5 percent, lower pay for  new hires; Pipeline contracts nationwide agreement in June, 45,000 workers--0; Houston Power Co, a utility--3 percent, no cola in the first year; Cargo and Tanker operators, National Maritime Union, 20,000  workers--0, no cola; Chicago area contractors, 45,000 workers--0 to 2 percent, no cola; Niagara Power Corp, 8000 utility workers--5-1/4 percent, no cola; United Airlines, mechanics and ground crews--4-1/2 percent, lower  pay for new hires, no cola  What is BNA? I don't know  A private outfit I guess they update this and do some summary of wage agreements For all industries the median first-year wage increase negotiated to date in 1984 is 28 percent, compared to 5 percent last year From the report of the comparability survey of the government, average salaries among white collar workers increased between 3 and 6 percent over the year ending in March 1984, the lowest rate of increase in more than 10 years That is the government's pay comparability survey So, I think there is some comfort that what we see reported in average weekly earnings is not off the wall We have some big agreements coming along and I only have the vaguest impression of them The Post Office [workers] are in negotiation now and I understand there's some prospect of very little or no increase As for mine workers, I don't know but I suspect they're far apart There is another big one apart from the auto workers coming along What am I forgetting about here, Jim?  Coal miners I just mentioned  The automobile one is coming, and we know that's a big, dangerous one I thought there was one other The postal workers are very big as are the mine workers and [those negotiations] going on right now  Well, it's very clear that we're getting low settlements in some of the deregulated industries There are two industries in particular the airlines, which came up here again and again; and the construction workers, for which these aggregate figures show practically no increase in wages The explanation I hear about that, despite very large increases in construction activity shown in these charts, is the threat of non-unionized workers  Well, no I think a lot of them are two- year contracts and this gives the first year There was a variety, but I think these numbers were for the first year  Let me raise another question while I think of it and we can return to it These price estimates that everybody has given bother me a bit, partly because I'm not sure we should be in the public posture of saying our monetary policy is ineffective in keeping prices under control It became very clear yesterday that you have a variety of assumptions about the dollar and I have no doubt that over a period of time--I don't know about next year--that can be a big influence, [particularly] if the dollar really fell out of bed I wonder whether it would make some sense to have a standardized assumption on the dollar and do all these projections on the assumption that the dollar isn't going to be changed substantially, which would encompass a depreciation of 5 percent plus maybe, but not, I think, 15 to 20 percent We could present the price forecast that way and say quite clearly in the material that these price forecasts are made on a standardized assumption that the dollar is not going to change very substantially and that if the dollar does decline substantially, everyone would be raising his inflation forecast appreciably That would get us out of this business of evaluating different assumptions about the dollar, where I take it there is a good deal of uncertainty about the timing of any decline anyway, although there is a good deal of feeling that the dollar might decline, as I well understand  Well, we're still going to have some differences; having differences doesn't particularly bother me I think a certain dispersion of the estimates may even be helpful I understand the overall level if one is assuming declines in the dollar But I think that is a separable and an unknown factor  If you assume the dollar is going down  We missed by about 1 percent this year, it looks like  You all ought to have a chance to redo your forecast and I was planning that in the ordinary course of events You may make any re-evaluation you want after the meeting and after any decisions we make I'm raising the additional questions Do we want to standardize the assumption on the dollar and, if we want to standardize that, how do we do it? I find it a little difficult to standardize it if [our report] says the Open Market Committee is unanimously expecting a big decline in the dollar I just don't think that--  Well, I don't know how much it would affect people's growth forecasts during this particular time period I guess nobody is assuming any budgetary action next year I'm not sure that's a good assumption  Well, I don't exclude the possibility I don't see any way out of the box I wouldn't bet a lot on it, but there is a chance of their going after the budget after the election I would not like to presume that that's impossible  Well, I mean an official program  I don't think that is going to materialize in anything in 1985  Stronger somewhere else--  Well, we can substantially overdo our ability to make any of these forecasts  Let me return to that question later on  I don't know how I would interpret that  Well, it doesn't make me too happy I'm not sure I've thought this all through, but I think I would rather say that it's based upon an assumption that may or may not be right that the dollar is unchanged or that if it does change, as everybody thinks  -31-    7/16-17/84  [is likely], there is a substantial danger that one would have to add 1 percent or so to these figures  My main conclusion is that not too much weight should be put on these economic forecasts, but people look at them; they didn't look at them all that much in the past I think the staff had an assumption of a big decline in the dollar a year ago; in fact, that may help explain why the inflation picture is better It doesn't explain why the economy is doing a lot better than the staff projected a year ago  It's 8 percent above?  The way the dollar bounces up and down, I think a decrease of 10 percent may be insignificant!  Let me return to picking out these targets On 1984, I'll make another attempt to see whether we can dispose of it relatively quickly When I said no change yesterday, I thought I noted some oral acclamation I may have been wrong about that because people began saying they disagreed But let me just try something out to see whether we can [agree] without spending a lot of time on this Suppose we keep them the same with a very clear caveat that we're keeping M3 and debt the same and expect to come in over the ranges for them but are not too happy about that Is that the best way to present these? The alternative, obviously, is to increase the M3 and debt ranges Among Committee members, is that the desirable course?  Apparently a couple of people think that's not the desirable course  -32-    7/16-17/84  The debt range is awfully high It seems to me inconsistent with any-- Mr Prell gave me a figure after the meeting yesterday, but I don't know whether it made me feel better or not If I understood it correctly, the trouble here is knowing what the base is If you took net issuance of debt and equity this year and used as a base debt outstanding plus the market value of equity, which is a big question, the rate of growth would be about 9 percent  Is there anybody else who feels that way? My problem with the alternative--and I think we could do it either way--is that if we raise them we really have to say we're going to try to meet them And then there's the question of how far to raise them I think the worst of all worlds is raising them and then saying we're going to go over them anyway  Let's tentatively assume that's what we're going to do then, and return to the '85 targets  It may not be the worst thing in the world to send one out For 1985 the proposals here, which we don't have to limit ourselves to, range from no change to partial change to reducing them by roughly a half point I will entertain any comments  Let me just observe, along the lines of your concerns about velocity, that something like 4 to 7 percent or whatever number you pick looks pretty good compared to the staff's nominal GNP forecast Yesterday [we noted that] the staff's nominal GNP is below everybody else's except for one; quite a few of the nominal GNP forecasts are around 9 percent and some are as high as almost 11 percent, which raises the greater question of consistency  Well, that's fine with me I just hope the forecast--  Well, I'm just trying to imagine the circumstances I don't think it's so hard moving [the ranges] up if the economy isn't doing well It depends on all the circumstances If inflation is doing well and we get no increase in velocity, we would say we're getting no increase in velocity and move up That's a very favorable circumstance  I think that's the alternative--running over a little  That's based on your economic forecast?  What did you say for Ml?  But that's with only an 8 percent nominal GNP, which I remind you is lower than everybody's forecast except the staff's  I suppose theoretically we can say that everybody thinks it's going to be higher but, ideally, we want it lower That's what we seem to be saying  Because the deflator would be lower  Well, you have a bit of a problem, I think At this stage that's right But once you've set the policy, you should go back and look at the forecast, theoretically, I guess  Mr Forrestal  Mr Boehne  Mr Guffey  Mrs Horn  Mr Black  Mr Keehn  Mr Roberts  Mr Balles  Governor Partee  Ms Seger  Governor Wallich  Mr Boykin  Because it's so inconsistent with your forecast  Mr Morris  We tried that once  I really don't think that option is open to us If you will recall, everybody was on the Committee when we tried precisely that one year and got sent back like bad boys to go do our work over again We were told to come up with the guidelines for the following year in July--that that was what the law required  Well, you're coming pretty close to saying that  Does anybody else have anything to say? Well, let me try this in reverse order After listening to this, I come out very close to where some other people came out, but without a complete sense of conviction On debt, we are all conscious that we're running way above and I don't hear any great sentiment to reduce that very much You put down 8 to 11 percent; that bothers me a bit No, let me start differently From what I hear people saying, in terms of policy--and this encompasses most people's, but not everybody's, forecast--we are talking about a nominal GNP of 8 to 9 percent There aren't many at 8 percent--only the staff There are a lot between 8-1/2 and 9 percent and some above 9 percent, to be sure But in terms of a policy objective I sense that that's about where we are If that's where we are, a debt range of 8 to 11 percent, which  -43-    7/16-17/84  is unchanged and allows for a larger growth in debt than GNP for the third or fourth consecutive year, is not an entirely happy circumstance  Well, it's 1 percent higher  What I'm saying is that if I had any question about it, just as a normative proposition, I'd make it 8 to 10-1/2 percent or someplace in that neighborhood For M3, 6 to 9 percent seems to reflect a lot of the thinking, I guess on the basis that the debt has been running high and it certainly allows us enough room on the down side On M2, we get more questionable If we're giving weight to running high on the others, we might give a little weight to running low on M2, and in the interest of showing some decline go with a range of 6 to 8-1/2 percent I don't know; it may be psychological, but perhaps it doesn't look too bad When we get to Ml-- What has nominal GNP been in the first half of this year?  On M1, I get a little concerned It has run about 7-1/2 percent so far this year--within the range--with the 12 percent nominal GNP If we're aiming for an 8 to 9 percent nominal GNP, based upon recent experience it seems to me that the range ought to be lower or we will give a rather peculiar signal Then it's a question of how much to lower it If you allow a 2 to 3 percent velocity increase, 4 to 7 percent seems all right and gives the right signal Then we get into this tactical question of whether to do a half point now and maybe do a half point later Just sitting here, I don't have any absolute final conviction about this It has been running 7-1/2 percent so far this year; announcing that we're satisfied with 7-1/2 percent next year but are looking toward a decline in the nominal GNP on the order of 3 to 4 percentage points strikes me as a bit peculiar I'm assuming here that we don't put tremendous weight on the midpoint and that the most operative thing tends to be the upper limit A number of people have said and a lot of people would interpret that as the same growth in the money supply next year as this year with a hope or stated objective of having substantially lower nominal GNP growth  That would be true even if it were cut in half; the 7 percent would allow for that  What I just put down here is the same as a couple of people have suggested 8 to 11 percent; 6 to 9 percent; 6 to  -44-    7/16-17/84  8-1/2 percent; and 4 to 7 percent And I think implicitly we weight them all equally There are a whole lot of caveats around all of them, as Mr Axilrod suggested  Well, what could happen next February? None of us knows Let's suppose we're running above that [range] next February for good and understandable reasons; that must mean that we're worried about something--interest rates or something in the economy In that kind of scenario we would go [to Congress] and say, "Look, you haven't done anything about the budget We can't hold it by monetary policy alone without running undue risks We're going to have to raise this target and that is all the more reason [you] ought to be working on the budget deficit"  Well, we haven't made the decision It's at least debatable I don't know whether they will or won't  I think the circumstance in which we couldn't hold the money is when we're having significant upward pressures on interest rates  Well, I think that's what we're debating here I don't know whether it's enough or not, but it looks pretty mealy-mouthed It depends on how one interprets it If one interprets it as the midpoint, it's okay If one interprets it more as the operative [number], what one really gets concerned about is breaking through the top, which I think is more the reality in this situation And it looks like not much  Well, we're using the present projection, which is for substantially slower growth in nominal GNP than we're now getting The whole thing is based upon that assumption It may be wrong Who can tell all about it? But I think that is the assumption either as a forecast or as an objective that we're faced with  I don't know There may be no long-range growth in velocity I don't discard that hypothesis entirely in the present world, in which case this is going to be too low and we will just have to say that We don't have the evidence to make that case right now  Well, let me forget about M1 at the moment, just for the purpose of advancing the discussion Do the other three look broadly acceptable or even narrowly acceptable?  SEVERAL Yes  Are we just talking about Ml?  Only, I guess, that nobody can envision its growth being below 6 percent  I'm off M1 at the moment  I think that's the justification It may be completely wrong, but M2 in fact has been behaving much more stably for quite a while than the other two have It has been a nice, even-- and it may be a total illusion but--  Well, historically it has been It is erratic this year, but the [average] number has been quite steady  Velocity has been erratic because the [annual M2 growth] numbers have been so stable while the GNP [growth rate] has been changing  Well, we're not talking about a big deal here; 5-1/2 percent just seems awful low to me  With these near the midpoint?  Were there any other comments on anything but M1? This question has been raised about M2 Let me narrow it down to M2 Is there any feeling about 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent versus 6 to 8-1/2 percent?  Well, let me return to M1 I don't think that I'm going to press this to an absolute vote right at the moment We can come back and pull everything together in light of [our decision on] the short run But I think we're between 4 and 7 percent and 4 and 7-1/2 percent That seems to be the general range of [views]  I think "in almost every case" is a correct statement  Well, we're down to a very narrow issue How many of the Committee members prefer the 4 to 7 percent? Six Maybe some are indifferent How many prefer the 4 to 7-1/2 percent? All right Let's look at it in the light of our short-run decision What do we have to do yet? We have to listen to Mr Sternlight--[Mr Meek, today]--and Mr Cross first Now is as good a time as any to get that in Mr Meek  Well, whoever goes first I guess you go first  I think we ought to follow all the precedents  Questions or comments?  Let me make a general comment on the subject More generally, as I read the situation, economic developments abroad are quite unsatisfactory in terms even of earlier expectations, which weren't all that buoyant I don't want to  -50-    7/16-17/84  overdramatize this, but they are just not moving with any speed and alacrity I don't think there's any doubt that our interest rates are complicating things The two most marked examples, I think, are the Canadians and the British The British talk proudly about decoupling; they don't think they're decoupled today They've had problems domestically that have aggravated this situation, but they are very unhappy about having to see this very sharp increase in interest rates that they currently have when the economy is doing nothing and they have a 12 percent unemployment rate In Canada, the unemployment rate is between 11 and 12 percent It has sat there for a long time even though the economy is growing, mainly because of exports to the United States On the continent of Europe and in Japan, the economies are not exceeding our earlier expectations, which weren't all that buoyant If anything, they're falling a bit below Is that true, Mr Truman?  There is increasing concern there I don't want to overemphasize it but the concern is there I think our interest rate picture is not helping things in that connection Governor Wallich  I would think that most people would say intellectually that the dollar ought to decline, but they're not willing to bet on it right now  Any other questions? We have to ratify some transactions  Without objection Mr Meek  Comments?  I don't know what Mr Meek's view is, but I'll tell you my opinion is that there's no chance that it's a passing phase that is going to evaporate in a matter of weeks or months  Unless you're a Swiss bank  I don't want to have a prolonged discussion right now because we need to get on; we can discuss it a little later if you want But just symptomatic of this, among other things, the Comptroller has developed a new plan for evaluating oil loans, which may not be overly conservative in some theoretical or abstract sense But there is a certain fear--I don't know about this, but it needs some testing--that application of those standards to national oil credits will result in billions of dollars of loans being put in classified status because they won't pass the stiffer hurdle that's implied by the new evaluation The only sense we have of that in a direct measurable sense is that they have done it to Continental and it has added $200 to $300 million to their classified items in a bank that already has had its oil portfolio examined and reexamined At one point I heard a figure of $350 million Maybe you know the figure as a result of the examination  That's loss since the last examination, which was 6 months ago  I think we can return to these questions, but I just don't want to interrupt the continuity of the market discussion entirely Are there any other questions?  [Unintelligible] I think is right  If there are no other comments, we have some transactions to ratify  We'll go to Mr Axilrod and then to a coffee break  Well, let's have a coffee break  [Coffee break]  [Unintelligible] about the perspective with which I, at least, approach this operational decision we have to make This has somewhat more importance, I'm afraid, than worrying about the long-term ranges that we've been debating, anyway I think we are at a critical point from a number of directions I don't have any doubt about that; how much influence we can have is another matter I am struck by the problems in the banking system We touched upon that a few moments ago As I understand the situation, I think the funding abilities of the multinational banks are virtually uniformly stretched Psychologically, I think none of them has great confidence that they can do more funding than they are doing in any substantial amount One evidence of that is the way [investors] all ran away from Continental even when they thought it was in better shape than, in fact, it was Nobody was prepared, when they thought about it, to take on the funding risk that would be involved even for the biggest bank in the United States, even in considerably shrunken form I think there is no doubt that they are all worried about their funding in varying degrees In fact, it's probably not too much to say that a good many depositors would just as soon get out of bank paper if they knew where to go If they don't know quite where to go, some of it hangs more than it otherwise would on customer relationships and all the rest  Maybe I do feel fairly confident that these problems aren't going to go away for a very simple reason They reflect the fact that there are a lot of weak credits in the banking system And they seem to be coming more into the open rather than the reverse--even discounting the LDC problem which, of course, sits there as the most looming threat I might say, as a side point, that my impression is that they are adding to the weak credits in the banking system with new loans every day I'm not full of pride about the supervisory performance of the United States in general or the Federal Reserve in particular It's a very difficult area, but I think it's something that we have to concern ourselves with a lot more One aspect of that is the holding company situation When there is a condition of crisis, as with Continental Illinois, we find out that we  -55-    7/16-17/84  don't have a very good handle on the holding company and how it is funded and how its assets match up with its liabilities We just haven't been analyzing these things in this way One doesn't imagine that they would ever get into this kind of difficulty, but we're at the point where they are in this kind of difficulty, and I think we have to do some rethinking in that area I might say in that connection that this is not entirely a side issue in terms of monetary policy We are going to be raising the capital ratios for holding companies and banks and the FDIC and Comptroller have already made some announcements in that direction It's not final yet, but this is going to be done in the next week or so We will be talking about moving toward a more building-block approach with respect to capital in the holding companies Now, apart from the supervisory implications of that coming at this particular time--while the move is not drastic in the sense that most of the multinational holding companies will be able to meet the new capital ratios of 5-1/2 percent, which I presume is where it will end up--some of them aren't going to be very far above it And I think there will probably be a little accompanying music [suggesting] that this is another step toward still higher ratios in the future The net result, I think, moves in the direction of restraint on asset growth It may even be more potent than monetary policy--at least if we did it a little more aggressively--at this particular point in time So, that's just some background  Well, I don't know; two or three will fall short, I think will certainly fall short  was getting there; I forget whether they were there But I think most banks will want to get more comfortably above the new ratio than they are at the moment, so there's a degree of pressure there  Looking at the rest of the financial climate We referred a bit to the problems abroad I don't have anything to add to what I said earlier about the problems of the developed countries Let me just say a word about the LDC problem I don't think there is any question that the general psychological attitude in LDCs has deteriorated in terms of the determination to adjust and pay their debts The focus of that, of course, is in Argentina It's a little hard to tell what is happening in Argentina now It's rather at an impasse But that feeling has affected other countries, even though we can show objectively that countries like Mexico and Venezuela and Brazil are doing better than expected It is not just an economic problem but an increasingly difficult political problem This last increase in the prime rate coming one day after the Cartagena meeting convened, when there was a great effort to restrain the radicals in Latin America, hit our friends like a kick in the solar plexus in terms of keeping the political situation under control I'm not saying, certainly not economically, that some further increase in interest rates in the United States follows like night after day But that situation falls apart I don't think that is true economically but politically I think we are increasingly close to margins of  -56-    7/16-17/84  tolerance The significance of that, of course, is partly that it feeds back into our domestic credit situation and the confidence in our own banking system Now we have that whole set of problems It's a set of problems we have not seen the likes of, in my opinion, since the early 1930s or late 1920s One of the reasons we have the problem is that it has been so long since we've had it that no bankers could imagine it was going to happen again So they went out perfectly happily and got rid of all their liquidity and filled up the balance sheet with less-than-strong loans  When you look at the real side of the economy, as I said yesterday and I guess the view is widely shared around here, there is just a lot of plain forward momentum I see very little [slowing], except possibly in housing, and that's not clear We get a housing starts figure tomorrow I did see a builder survey yesterday that shows a further decline in sales; it was an attitudinal thing-- traffic, sales prospects, and all the rest, which continues the trend that started two or three months ago in a fairly decided way But that's a limited piece of evidence Generally, I think the momentum is very strong in the domestic economy and is propelled by a lot of factors If I were just sitting here looking at that without any of the financial problems, I wouldn't have much doubt about what I would do within the limits of monetary policy I would be more restrictive because, just looking at that, I think that's where the risks lie When I look at the financial system, I get quite a different picture of what maneuverability we have To put it another way, I do think we have something of a knife's edge problem If we are too easy, then this momentum in the economy will be excessive and will materialize in more strength than we'd like to see If we are too tight, it might pull out the rug from the whole thing in a rather sudden way due to the financial concerns I hope the knife has a dull edge rather than a sharp edge, but dull or sharp, it's not very easy to keep on a knife's edge In a sense, I think we're coming close to running out of maneuvering room in terms of monetary policy alone I don't conclude from this, as I guess I implied, that any kind of easing signal is justified or appropriate But I do conclude, given everything we know at the moment, including that for the moment the monetary aggregates look reasonably quiescent, that it's not time to take a strong initiative in the restraining direction So, that reduces the choices, in my mind, to a fairly narrow range I am not saying that there is no room for some tightening down the road if the momentum of the economy continues and the aggregates move high and all the rest I'm not saying [we wouldn't ease]--although I find this pretty far-fetched--if something happens that makes the economy on its own look considerably weaker I really don't expect that I do not discount the possibility of more financial stringency and difficulties that could arise from any number of directions, most likely from the LDC side But it could arise from purely domestic or even developed country concerns All of this leads me in terms of specifics to something like not doing very much right now, but remaining poised to tighten a little if we have to in terms of what happens down the road in the coming weeks I guess I'll stop right there  Let me just clarify one thing I said I think the aggregates are quiescent for the moment; that's based upon what information we have and estimates for July And, of course, the last couple of weeks of July are a guess, but the first two or three weeks of July look like they're not really above the June average So, we could have a reasonably low July figure  There's no doubt that June was on the high side; the average with July may not look too bad May was high but the average with April was not out of line  Yes Oh! I'm not saying the 12 percent rate of growth, I'm saying [the level]  It looks pretty safe that it will come in at what, Steve--about a 5 percent rate of growth or less?  We would need a substantial increase in the second half to get it up to 4 or 5 percent  Mr Martin  Yes, there's something the matter with M2  I just have the monthly figures here Well, it was a quarterly growth rate of about 7 percent  The quarterly average for monthly rates of 69, 87, and 73 percent--  Governor Wallich  Mr Roberts  That's a "B-" in the normal nomenclature  Mr Morris  Mr Forrestal  Let me just comment on that Perhaps for a long time I think the obvious economic policy approach in these conditions--where we are getting too much strength in the real economy and we have the financial difficulties--is tightening up on fiscal policy I can't rub my genie to produce that, but the inability to produce it doesn't say there's another answer Governor Gramley  Governor Partee  Which particular institution is savable?  Mr Black  Mr Corrigan  Mr Guffey  Mr Boykin  Ms Seger  You're going to have to vote  You don't have to vote right now, but you're going to have to vote either for it or against it at some point I'm kidding!  Governor Rice  Mr Keehn  Mrs Horn  I would be sorely tempted, if we were operating the way the Open Market Committee operated 10 or 15 years ago, to say "Thank you, we have a consensus Goodbye" I'm afraid we have to be a little more nitpicky We're down to nuances Just to be clear, I don't mean to suggest myself that we can do much about these financial problems by these minor decisions But, in the range we're talking about, they're not going to go away if we stand pat; and in the range that we're talking about, all these domestic things aren't going to suddenly collapse on us The international situation, at some point, might collapse in the range in which we're talking But it's a question of how much justification we need, in some sense, to take an overt step at this stage And I think we need a little more than usual  There is obviously some small difference of opinion here; I suspect the prevailing view is what has been referred to as the Solomon/Gramley approach I interpret that as We don't do much now; we'd be very cautious about anything interpreted as any easing; and we might have to tighten if things come in stronger I referred to the economy as having a lot of momentum; I may be wrong I'm not sure I fully see all the slowing down so far in domestic demand, but M1 looks fairly quiescent in July It could be anything in August I wouldn't drop out of my seat if August came in with some very high numbers, in which case we may have to respond But then we would have the evidence of that in front of us  Now, how do we put this in terms of a directive? I think the numbers are simple enough We are really talking about the alternative B numbers Some people said they were a little in-between but the only real difference, described as a quibble about the number, is whether we make M3 9-1/4 percent--which is an odd number to put in the directive anyway--or 9 percent Let me say that this is no big deal with me, but in the interest of rounding, maybe 9 percent is the appropriate number to put in there Does that make sense to people? I guess we are talking about 8 to 12 percent [on the funds range] I don't think that affects the substance, but it will affect the visuals of this when and if it's announced And I don't know how hard-pressed I'm going to be in testimony to indicate some of this I don't interpret [raising the funds rate range to] 8 to 12 percent as meaning  -65-    7/16-17/84  anything significant, but the market or certain Congressmen will That does not say, given that the rate is between 11 and 11-1/2 percent, that we should not do that But I just note that that will be interpreted by some people as a tightening  No It will come up, but I just assume it won't pass simply because they don't have much time But anything can happen in the wild last days of a Congressional session, and it's the kind of thing that could be tacked on to something and we would just deal with it I just want an understanding here that we are talking about [a funds rate range of] 8 to 12 percent despite the fact that some people may view this differently and it will get interpreted publicly as a tightening I'm not interpreting it as a tightening in and of itself, but just a recognition of the reality that the funds rate is up around 11 plus percent currently So, we give ourselves a little more leeway Is that where we are? I don't see any dissent on any of this, if I may say so, with these numbers I'm just getting the numerology now Now I will try to describe reality And I don't know how to put it in words [in the directive] One possibility, which occurred to me last night but I didn't look at it very carefully, is to have a directive of the sort that we had in December, which basically says we're not going to ease, we're not going to do anything right now, but we might tighten during the period if the aggregates and the economy are running strong Does that catch what people are talking about?  Well, it buys a little leeway; it suggests a willingness to do a little something if both the aggregates and-- How is it worded here? Specifically what we said--and this is not magic--is "The Committee seeks in the short run to maintain at least the existing degree of reserve restraint The action is expected to be associated with growth of [the aggregates] Depending on evidence about the continuing strength of economic recovery and other factors bearing on the business and inflation outlook, somewhat greater restraint would be acceptable should the aggregates expand more rapidly" We could change that "depending on" clause I suppose we'd add something there about financial markets in these circumstances The rest of it is pretty standard  Well, it's one possibility  It was symmetrical  Or that was the meaning Just remember, we had all kinds of nuances there, but it was basically symmetrical  -66-    7/16-17/84  It wasn't, I guess absolutely symmetrical Sometimes we use "would" in one sentence and "might" in the other Maybe we were absolutely symmetrical last time This would be asymmetrical  I'm not sure it was misinterpreted last time  Oh, we always have the option of doing whatever we feel like doing with a consultation I think it would assume that we don't expect to run into that contingency That's a hard thing to put in the directive anyway, even if we had it symmetrical  In defense of December, we didn't do anything in this directive in December and I wish, in retrospect, that we had We didn't have the evidence for it between the meetings  A pretty good reputation    7/16-17/84  Well, that's all it says  Well, I do care, but I don't care that much I'm perfectly happy to be asymmetrical I just want the record to show that because the situation is asymmetrical without much doubt in my mind  I would agree with that, certainly It's preferable that we have enough leeway here so that we don't give a false sense of easing if the money supply is not declining and there isn't evidence of the economy slowing, and so forth And that may take a certain amount of flexibility in the management of reserves  Well, that's mainly because I thought we'd be clear about it I take it the contingency that has been raised here, which strikes me as a real one, tends to say the aggregates are more or less on path We're always guessing what they will be next month Let's say we start out with [M1 growth in] July at 3 percent or 4 percent, but we have a strong suspicion that it's going to be higher later and the other aggregates might be a little on the low side in July But we have a strong suspicion that they're going to be higher later as the business news remains fairly good and there is no big change in that If the money markets began easing, we'd be very cautious about supplying reserves until there was further confirmation of low money supply numbers and all the rest  That would mean something as long-lasting even as quarters To get a great feeling of relief and then in the next month to see them go back drastically in the other direction with the money supply taking off would be unfortunate, I think  I would add that there's no doubt in my mind--although I may be wrong--that the risks are that the economy is growing too fast And on the inflationary side, the only thing that concerns me is the financial side I'd be just as tight as I could be without precipitating that situation  Maybe We're not too far from it But I'm always willing to probe a little further  Probably  Yes, I think with any of these directives I would say, if I have to say something, that it has not changed  It depends upon how the questions are  -70-    7/16-17/84  I might, yes  Well, maybe I'm not going to say it just that way, I don't think I might say that as I look at the situation with the economy moving the way it is and the inflationary risks, yes, there's a possibility we might have to tighten  Particularly since you guys aren't doing anything on the deficit--and as I evaluate the economy--I don't see great prospects for much easing I might well say that  Well, where we are and if that's the way you like it, is "seeks to maintain" We'll make it "would" instead of "might" and leave the [other] "might" We'll stick in 5-1/2 percent, 7-1/2 percent, and 9 percent I think there's some understanding that some flexibility is necessary to prevent false [signals] and 8 to 12 percent If we don't have any general consensus [to try] to improve on that, let's close it now  Now that we've disposed of that, we have to return to our other little problem here, if I can remember where we were We have an issue yet What we tentatively thought about was keeping them all the same; I began to worry a bit that if we keep M3 and debt the same, we actually ought to put a word in the directive itself I don't know just what it would say I don't remember what this boiler plate, which is pretty awful, says We ought to add a sentence that while we reiterate the 6 to 9 percent and 8 to 11 percent, the Committee thinks there is a certain probability that growth will be above them    7/16-17/84  Well, what Steve was suggesting when I raised this question with him was to add a sentence immediately following the one on the ranges saying "It was anticipated that debt and M3 would increase at rates somewhat above their upper limits, reflecting in considerable part a rise in debt and the decline in equity financing related to recent merger activities" Maybe we should put a "however" in there I scribbled down something, which I wasn't very happy with In effect, it says that while this was anticipated the Committee felt that these [recent] rates were excessive in the longer-term perspective--excessive as a benchmark for evaluating the appropriate trend for credit and M3 growth Let me try that out That may not be so bad Put a "while" in front of this  No Make it all one sentence We state the ranges They're unchanged Then say "While it was anticipated that debt and M3 might increase at rates somewhat above their upper levels, reflecting in large part a rise in debt and decline in equity financing related to recent merger activity, the Committee felt that higher target ranges would provide an inappropriate benchmark for longer-term trends in M3 and debt growth"  This is a 1984 sentence  We can take out the "in considerable part" Or we could take out the whole thing about merger activities and say "will rise somewhat above their upper limits, the Committee felt that such a rate of growth was an inappropriate benchmark for evaluating credit growth over time" Something like that tells them why we didn't raise the rate, even though we expect it to be higher This is just for '84  Well, without worrying about the particular language, but that it is something about this being too high a benchmark for evaluating what is right, is that okay?  SEVERAL Right Yes  Now we're set Wait a minute Do we need to change anything else? Maybe we ought to go over it I'm looking at the typed-in language "In furtherance of these objectives, the  -72-    7/16-17/84  Committee agreed to reaffirm the ranges for monetary growth that were established in January" etc We take out this stuff about M1 Then we give the total debt range, which is reaffirmed Then we put it in a sentence And that's the end of 1984 We're accepting all the language the staff has here  I'm not there I'm just talking about the ranges I assume that will stay in, but I'm not talking about '85 yet, which is the next sentence I'm talking about all the sentences on page 3, or whatever I have in front of me, which I guess is the same thing  Yes I assume that will stay in, but we better [check] Is that the general assumption--that that sentence stays in?  The next sentence in the next paragraph The one-sentence paragraph "The Committee understood that policy implementation would require" I'm just assuming that stays in Apply it both to '84 and '85 All I'm talking about now is '84 and I'm just accepting the language that was prepared here, with the addition of the sentence we talked about The effect of this language change from what we had before is to remove the probationary status of Ml, but the other paragraph says that they are all to a degree probationary With that, let us vote on 1984  Let me review the bidding on '85 We had a couple of questions Is the consensus for debt unchanged at 8 to 11 percent? Some people did suggest 8 to 10-1/2 percent  The general consensus is toward 8 to 11 percent, I take it I think everybody was pretty much for 6 to 9 percent for M3 Is that correct? We have this little cosmetic point on M2 Let me just see Among the Committee members, how many want it at 6 to 8-1/2 percent? Eight [Secretary's note Messrs Boehne, Corrigan, Gramley, Martin, Partee, Rice, Ms Seger, and Mr Wallich] There seems to be a clear majority for that Can we live with 6 to 8-1/2 percent? That brings us down to the M1 number, where I take it the range is between 4 to 7-1/2 percent and 4 to 7 percent We had a tentative vote on this before, but we were split Let me try again For 4 to 7 percent? Six [Secretary's note Mr Corrigan, Mr Gramley, Ms Horn, Mr Partee, Ms Seger, and Mr Wallich] Does that mean the other five, excluding me, have a firm opinion or are some neutral?  Who wants 4 to 7-1/2 percent? Five That means everybody has an opinion  Well, I feel there is more to this than that These are awfully weak reductions in these things if we don't go for 4 to 7 percent I somewhat prefer going to 4 to 7 percent  --ranges of 8 to 11, 6 to 9, 6 to 8-1/2, and 4 to 7 percent  I think we still have to do some talking about the uncertainty of velocity This is based upon an assumption that it returns to more normal behavior If it doesn't, which could be in the upper direction, we obviously have to reexamine it  I'm talking about the testimony All right, I guess we're finished I don't know where we are on these projections I think you ought to look at them again anyway I don't feel that strongly about it, but I don't think we have to sit here and say we're assuming that the exchange rate is exactly where it is now But I think an assumption that it does not decline [unintelligible] something like getting up toward 10 percent We seem to have 5 percent up and down wiggles regularly, and I'm not sure that that's anything very much But make an assumption that permits the Humphrey- Hawkins report to say that these projections are not based upon a severe, if that's the right word, depreciation of the dollar which would obviously have substantial, important and significant implications for changes in prices The dollar remains substantially within the range of the last year That probably allows for quite a decline, doesn't it?  Well, I'm trying partly to avoid the market effect We're saying we assume that the dollar is essentially in the range of the past year, but if it did decline a lot more than that, we would have more price inflation  All right I think Mr Kichline would like to have [your revised projections] as soon as possible, which he interprets as midday on Thursday What's today? Tuesday I guess that's all we have, except the [confirmation of the August 21] date of the next meeting and sandwiches outside  END OF MEETING  -75-       If we can come to order, I need a motion to approve the minutes  Without objection You have received a report on the examination of the System Open Market Account I assume you all have examined that with care  Are there any comments? In the absence of any comments, we could have a motion to accept it  Without objection  Mr Cross,  Comments or questions? It left everybody speechless! We have nothing to approve, right?  Let's turn to Mr Sternlight  Any comments or questions about the earlier part? Mr Black  Governor Partee  Any other comments?  Well, I don't think we want to give any impression that there is any limitation under these circumstances Unfortunately there is, which surprised me We have a collateral requirement for Federal Reserve notes which cannot be met by lending to banks unless the loans are secured by eligible paper So, we may have to put in a little effort to get some eligible paper to secure those borrowings and to keep track of it The limits are not all that far away, if we get another big bank coming in to borrow or if Continental's borrowing keeps going up It depends upon circumstances elsewhere on a day-to-day or week-to-week basis That troubles me  It depends upon what the market circumstances are If market circumstances are disturbed, as they might be in those circumstances, we couldn't offset it But it may be that we wouldn't want to [do that] in some circumstances  Mechanically, yes, we could resolve it that way  It depends on the circumstances; I can't see offhand that that's likely to have any advantages over selling in the market  Well, actually, that might be a way to maintain the assets that we need I suppose that's what we could be driven to in order to maintain the assets we need to collateralize the currency That could make all the banks love us!  No, you could get the same mechanical result I guess we could do it--protecting our assets that we need to back currency  We would have to raise the reserve requirements quite a lot, I guess    8/21/84  We have this question of limits Are you [unintelligible] convinced by Mr Sternlight's analysis?  [I need] somebody to make a motion  What are you asking for specifically?  That isn't exactly likely to happen Do we have a motion?  Do we have a second?  Do we have any opposition? If not, it's approved We have to ratify the transactions Without objection Mr Kichline  I don't know as we can stand all this good news!  It seems like an extraordinary rate of increase in prices of residential construction  If I understand, all the construction materials prices are steady or down and wage rates are steady    8/21/84  On the other hand, although there may be something to what you say, we're going to get some protectionist measures that may lead to some direct price [effects] in steel and copper and other things  In looking at these summaries of District business conditions, I thought I detected a considerably more cautious tone than had been reflected earlier Did I detect wrongly?  No, on the business [side]  We're only 21 months, I guess, by a generous interpretation  Mr Roberts  Well, it seems to me the major risk on the price side is the dollar Let me examine the proposition that the economy may turn out to be a little softer in the near term than Mr Kichline has projected We have housing definitely going down now and I think we have some momentum in business spending with the latest    8/21/84  number--though it may not mean anything--but the latest consumption figures are not so great  Steel still is showing no pickup from this little slump in the spring?  Well, that seems to be the strongest thing I suppose for the short run the economy is going to be determined by inventories as always  I was told it was going to add quite a lot to the third quarter  The GNP figure ought to look pretty healthy in the third quarter, but I'm not sure that means anything It has this bloop in it Mr Keehn  I was observing on your observation  This FCA situation is extremely difficult It is so big I don't know if we can handle it smoothly  And you can ask where the bank regulators are too  Miss Seger  That auto industry settlement is the second biggest threat to the inflation outlook, next to the dollar  No, I think--I hope--when they are talking 4 to 6 percent they are including the COLA  Well, it's a guess  A 4 to 6 percent increase without the COLA would be bigger than what they used to get  Well, they don't get a full passthrough on the COLA, I guess  It's pretty big  Those figures are apart from COLAs Not all those agreements had COLAs Mr Guffey  Mr Guffey  Mr Forrestal  I'm not sure a strike is the worst thing in the world that can happen, if the alternative is a high labor settlement  That's the worst--if we get the high wages and a strike If no one else has any pressing comments, why don't we hear from Mr Axilrod?  We'll take some brief questions now and maybe have coffee Before that, let me just say that when I look at this directive I'm a little hard pressed to see why we're running below [the specifications for the aggregates] I know we're running below the track a bit on M1; that's fine I don't know why The question that occurred to me right off is Why reduce the target for M1 for the quarter when we're running a little low--or reduce it so much, anyway? Then, if it went back up and we got the target we were looking for before, we'd have to tighten That's a little odd to me  I'll suggest another factor too  Well, we went over that last time I think the growth of domestic demand has been a lot faster than that of GNP And those imports have to be financed too  Why don't we have a coffee break  [Coffee break]  Let us proceed Let me indicate that I have some bias for not making radical changes in these monetary target numbers in the middle of the quarter unless there's a very good reason to do so What's more important than those numbers may be what we actually do, reflected in the borrowing and the reserve assumptions So, let us proceed  Continental's borrowing is going to go up at least until that stockholders meeting There may be a chance of getting it down then I don't know I would just note, to put it in your mind, that on this international debt situation a portion of it seems to be going as well as could be hoped That Argentine situation could still go very much either way  -24-    8/21/84  Well, they still have $100 million Is that what you mean?  Yes They either paid them back or made other arrangements to pay them back  I don't know if you expressed an opinion on these specifications If you would like to do so while you have the floor, Governor Partee--  That's none of these The only difference of any significance, I think, is on Ml  Mr Boykin  You would make the specifications about where they were last time?  Governor Gramley  Mr Morris  I don't want to be absolutely rigid on that  Mr Corrigan  Mr Forrestal  Mr Solomon  Governor Wallich  I'm sure the staff appreciates that note of confidence that you see in their forecast  specs! Governor Martin  Mr Black  Miss Seger  Mr Keehn  All these comments that things are going nicely brings to mind that I just read a book about the battle of Midway where the Japanese sailed there with their whole fleet thinking everything was going nicely and one day later they thought it was not so nice Mr Boehne  Mr Balles  Mr Roberts  Mr Guffey  Well, I think we'll deal with that question later  I'm left without a comment from Mrs Horn  Well, I guess everybody has spoken Oh no, Governor Rice No, I have your comment here We have some differences of opinion, I would say  Well, let me take off from your comment and suggest what may lie somewhere in an area of consensus Looking at the borrowing first, I guess it would be consistent with leaving that first sentence of the directive unchanged and nominally start off with something around $1 billion Maybe in the old fashioned nomenclature--particularly if the market seems sensitive or somewhat disturbed in view of all these financial things or if the business news softens or if the money supply continues to come in low or all of the above--we should start off with some bias toward erring on the side of somewhat lower numbers but we don't aim at those  I'm talking about borrowing now I'm not saying aim at a lower number right now I'm saying that when we make all these decisions for the next several weeks--[taking into account] the specific reserve averaging periods--we are willing to err a bit in that direction, depending partly on our guidance on the funds rate and how tight things look I'd keep the funds band where it is, which is what most people have suggested Then we would aim more overtly for a lower number if in fact the money numbers came in low or we had some of these other contingencies developing; but we wouldn't do that without that evidence In terms of the numbers for the various aggregates, I don't think M2 or M3 are at issue, if I understand [the comments], except maybe for those who wanted "C" They are so close that it doesn't make any difference I'm a little troubled by the thought that somehow we would aim as low as 4 or 4-1/2 percent [on M1] even overtly and with that kind of symmetrical approach without knowing a little more about the economy and other things than I know now I would at least go higher on M1 than any of those alternatives suggest That's interrelated with how we word the directive With a higher number we certainly can make it symmetrical, recognizing that we're starting below so we already have this slight bias toward easing If we end up with a lower number, I don't know what we do I would make it asymmetrical in the other direction and, therefore, end up in the same place anyway  Well, if we started off with an M1 figure of 4 percent and we began running above it, depending on where we are, I would not be very anxious to raise the borrowing level  I don't remember the one after that  Well, I just think that in terms of the visuals you get more or less the same result Why change the number and raise all the questions about whether we had a different number than we had last time?  I don't know whether it's worthwhile or not, but we can even off all these numbers and make them 5 percent, 7 percent, and 9 percent I don't know what words of art we have; it already says "around"  [Unintelligible] I don't understand  I'm assuming your arithmetic is correct Is that correct?  Well, we're in an area of nuance That is not unimportant, but I'm not sure it's going to be reflected adequately in any directive I don't know whether this is the best way to do it, but look at it sentence by sentence It says "In the short run the Committee seeks to maintain"--the same language we've had Let me as a first approximation either leave [the numbers] the same or round them off to the lower levels Make them 5, 7, and 9 percent or where they are What I would almost do--I wouldn't necessarily suggest this because I don't know that I'd want to give that much of a signal--is reverse the whole next sentence So "Somewhat lesser restraint would be acceptable if growth in the monetary aggregates slowed significantly, while somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable in the event of more substantial growth In either case, such a change would be considered" We don't have to reverse the sentence but I certainly would make it "would" instead of "might"  -35-    8/21/84 -36-  Heck, I don't [know] It might raise some questions about attaching more significance to little tiny wording nuances than we want to tolerate through time That next sentence I certainly think should stay  It's probably considered boilerplate at this time We have 8 to 12 percent down below [for the funds rate range]  I don't have any line 74 on my copy  Actually, the two sides of that are not symmetrical as written The first half is quite clear "In the event of more substantial growth of the monetary aggregates" I assume means more substantial quite clearly than what is in the previous sentence  Use what?  "In the event of significantly slower growth" That's symmetrical with the top part of the sentence  "Of significantly slower growth" Now, what numbers do we put in up above?  Well, we've changed them in the past and sometimes we haven't changed them I just have a brief record here It looks like when we've changed them--well, there's one exception where we changed [M1] from 7 percent to 5 to 6 percent and kept the other two the same Others we have not changed at all Once we had 6 to 7 percent and we changed it to well above 6 to 7 percent; once we changed one from 6 percent to 7 percent and we changed some of the others by 1/2 point, basically A 1/2 point is the maximum we've changed the others What we've done before is change the adjective in front of it We've said "This action is expected to be consistent with growth of M1, M2, and M3 at annual rates of" and following some previous pattern we changed it to "somewhat less than" or "around" or something like that That's the kind of thing we've done before I suppose that may be an alternative--just to change the adjective in front of it--but I don't think it makes a lot of difference We can say "This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M1 of around 5 percent or a little less and growth in M2 and M3 at 7 and 9 percent, respectively"  Does that sound better to people? "This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M1 at around 5 percent or slightly less and in M2 and M3 at annual rates of 7 and 9 percent, respectively"  Well, we can leave 7-1/2 percent Do you want to leave 7-1/2 percent? Either way you like 7-1/2 or 7 percent  How many have a preference for 7-1/2 percent? One, two, three, four, five, six  SPEAKER(?) Seven  We have six "preferences" and at least two "don't cares" All right, let's try this for the language and then we'll discuss the nuances "In the short run, the Committee seeks to maintain existing pressures on reserve positions This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M1 at an annual rate of around 5 percent or slightly less, and in M2 and M3 at annual rates of around 7-1/2 and 9 percent Somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable in the event of more substantial growth in the monetary aggregates, while somewhat lesser restraint would be acceptable in the event of significantly slower growth In either case" All the rest is the same, including the 8 to 12 percent [funds rate range] We are aiming at $1 billion of borrowing We recognize that we're starting out at least with growth a bit on the slow side If we got evidence of some slowing in the economy--I guess in terms of the earlier discussion, I'm forgetting now about these special financial problems--and there are further upward pressures on the federal funds rate, we probably would be heading below $1 billion; but if we don't have those signals, we wouldn't, barring this other financial market question  Yes I don't know exactly what they are, but that's what I'm talking about  If we get a weaker employment number, weaker this number or that number--broadly lower than expectations, yes If we have financial problems that are great enough, we would provide some liquidity I don't know how one judges that in advance; I think we have to play it by ear We had this problem for a very short period of time with Continental when their borrowing went way up and the market was disturbed and we didn't take the money out right away, day-by-day, because the market was tightening up on its own I certainly would take into account if this were all reflected, as you put it, in a flight to quality and in fact the federal funds rate and the CD rates were going way up--and to make rather extreme assumptions --the prime rate were going up I would interpret that as getting a much tighter effect on policy than we calculated in making these assumptions on policy right now  Yes If they really got substantial, we'd have a Committee consultation Well, that question certainly would be raised  I think that is right in this cycle I think what we're getting, and it wasn't mentioned earlier, is restraints on the supply side of federal funds as well as a reluctance to borrow from the Federal Reserve People are cutting back on lines  It's a liquid instrument if you have a good borrower People are a little nervous about the borrowers these days I think you see that in the Euromarket and you expect that to put more pressure on the domestic funds market  I don't know in these disturbed periods how good those quotations are that we get on CD rates  They are probably people's imagination; they are rates they would like to aim at for CDs  Well, they're accurate for some banks that can operate; some just can't operate in these markets Anyway, it's understood what we're voting on and the nuances have been adequately explained? If there are no other questions, we will vote  I guess that completes [our agenda] I might say one other thing This is of no substantive importance, but I have found it convenient in defending why we don't release minutes right away among my other arguments to say that when we have a basic policy decision we typically do announce it right away These other things are just implementing policy that we've already decided upon And that broadly is reflected in the directive, it so happens We speak about a policy directive but that refers to the whole thing, which has all the long-range targets When it comes to what we were just discussing--the language is probably right here--it's called an operational paragraph [in the Bluebook]; I forget what it's actually called in the directive  SPEAKER(?) It's about that word  The phrase "in implementing policy" often appears I'd just like to sharpen up the language a bit in the earlier discussions to make some distinction between policy with a capital P and implementing policy This paragraph is implementing policy  Actually, I think it is a useful distinction I don't think it's just purely to handle the substantive points People can say "I want to know what your operational approach is" But in terms of our own thinking we ought to make the distinction I don't think we have changed anything here  I think [unintelligible] policy  Well, we're talking about semantics What do you call policy and what do call something else? I think there is a distinction between--to use another phrase--longer-term strategy, which is a more basic approach, and these more tactical decisions [Unintelligible] be tactical  Well, obviously, [what we did] in October, 1979--  --and in late '82 or October of '82 And we did announce that very promptly We didn't change the ranges but    8/21/84  we said we were deemphasizing M1 and we announced it--not clearly, I guess It was a more strategic decision  Yes  Yes, and I think it's written that way It says--  It's a directive to the Manager and it says "In implementing policy, follow this operational approach" That's what it says I think that distinction is in the directive now; it could be sharpened a bit The whole thing is called the policy directive, but it repeats all the basic stuff  Oh, I think it's probably true There's certainly a lot more noise about it It's the kind of issue that the Kemp group has seized upon and they make a lot of noise about it Certainly, the in-depth analysis is much greater now than it was It's one of these things that's like fighting motherhood Just like freedom of information, it's very hard to argue against it, even though you know it's a bad idea  Steve has just pointed out something that we can put in this directive we just approved, with your approval The previous paragraph says "The Committee understood that policy implementation would require continuing appraisal" and so forth The insert would be "In implementing policy in the short run" or "In implementation of policy in the short run"  I'd be a little reluctant to do a survey simply because if we do, that itself becomes [an issue] They begin asking why we're making a survey  I think it's something to keep our ears open to rather than taking a survey  But even if you just call around in an organized way, it becomes a [survey]  Our manager of reporting burdens points out that that becomes a survey too But apart from that, I think it's just the kind of thing that would raise more questions than we are prepared to answer I have had that comment reported to me--not by any banks, but by nonbanks Peter mentioned that it was attributed to a deliberate effort on the part of the Federal Reserve to police the discount window more rigidly And I assume that isn't the case  You've checked with other Reserve Banks too?  Well, presumably there's some fine balance here I'm just thinking out loud They try to hold excess reserves and not borrow; then we provide enough reserves to satisfy [their demand for excess reserves] And the equilibrium happens to be at an 11-3/4 percent funds rate [Unintelligible]--well, the M2 is not  Well, the money supply has gone down  It was down in July  But it's going down--  I am not suggesting that a minus 1-1/2 percent is reflective of the trend of M1 growth  I hope it does not  Well, it is [unintelligible] you have unrealistic expectations of month-to-month fluctuations We had a zero in April and a big May, and a big June balanced by a small July If you take the four months together, it doesn't look too bad  The sandwiches are out there  END OF MEETING       We can start, if somebody wants to move the minutes  Without objection Let's turn to foreign currency operations  Perhaps you could refresh my memory and that of others as to the nature of this informal limit  What is the operative significance of this informal limit?  Suppose we were not having a Committee meeting and these limits were threatened to be exceeded?  If the mark increased in value, we would exceed the limit?  Whether or not it's intervention seems to me semantic The question is whether we feel comfortable or uncomfortable with the amount of currencies we hold I personally feel that we hold an uncomfortably small amount    10/2/84  I'm perfectly happy to  Not at German interest rates or [rates on] Swiss francs  Well, do what you want to do, but it seems to me that this informal limit may be useful within the overall limit of $8 billion It confuses me a bit as to what it is, but at the minimum it is some kind of Committee checkpoint It is $55 billion presently I don't think it does any harm and it forces the Committee to review this, though not very frequently It hasn't been reviewed for however long it has been, but it seems to me it has at least a modest usefulness and I would think we probably would want to keep it I have no problem with [an increase of] $1 billion I think that's more appropriate, but that's because my bias is that we don't hold enough of these currencies anyway against the contingencies of an unknown world  Well, it would be $6-1/2 billion  Actually, the yen is within $400 million [of its limit] It's not so far away but the amount is not very large either--not that it is very difficult to change these    10/2/84  Well, without taking that major step, I take it this is an understanding and not a formal [vote] And I take it that what the understanding really means is that these are our foreign currency [limits] but in an emergency I can breach them But the sense is that the Committee is thinking in terms of these [limits] and if they were breached I would come back to the Committee at some point and I would at least explain why they were breached Limits of $5 billion [on DM], $1 billion [on yen] and $5 billion [on other currencies] is the minimum change we're talking about If there are no widespread objections to that, we will proceed  We've had a very strange exchange market during this period, as Mr Cross has described, and he rationalized as best he could why the dollar is so strong It's not so clear why it's so strong against declining interest [rates], weaker economic activity, and several developments indicating an easier Federal Reserve policy, all of which in days of yore--like two months ago--would have sent the dollar down They don't seem to have any effect right now  There was very widespread and deep concern about this among European Finance Ministers and central bankers-- really for the first time, so far as central bankers are concerned Certainly the intensity [was great] at the time of the IMF meeting, which was right in the middle of this surge Various proposals for coordinated intervention were explored and there was very considerable urging that we ease policy much more aggressively to deal with this problem The intervention that Mr Cross referred to was coordinated in a rather loose way It was a general agreement among 4 or 5 central banks, anyway, that upward movements in the dollar would be resisted in our respective markets over the past week The dollar did stay in a lower range, as Mr Cross indicated, but when it went up decidedly we had really rather modest intervention There weren't all that many strong movements in the New York market but there was [unintelligible] intervention on some scale abroad occasionally when the dollar was strong, and that was all agreed to last week  In a rising market The words you used, Mr Cross, were "a pronounced rising market"    10/2/84  We deliberately didn't do that I think it may have been helpful that they did it, but I don't particularly want to be in the posture of doing it  Well, we haven't done it at this point and I have no present intention to do it We weren't very aggressive, that's for sure But we need to ratify the transactions if there are no other questions  Mr Sternlight  Well, it is a very strange period Every indicator ordinarily would be associated with lower interest rates The money supply was very sluggish; every bit of business news, I think, came in on the lower side of market expectations; and there was growing evidence of lower reserve pressures We were in the market every day and the market just didn't react in any consistent way And now, after all this, the federal funds rate goes up where it was before, with fewer reserve pressures  It's a funny statement-date effect, coming after the statement date  That was back during the summer when we had all that other stuff What I don't understand is this last month It's the same phenomenon in the exchange market The same thing is keeping the exchange market higher It's a refusal to believe that [the numbers are] right--that the economy is slowing and that the money supply has weakened It has been [that way] in the last two weeks  There may be some developments in coming days that will increase the anxiety  I'm talking about banks  Just read the newspapers A lot of this may be the commentaries of all these people who make the newspaper every day They are always predicting every day that interest rates are going to go up And I think that must be--  I don't know whether statistically it shows up as any net shrinkage, but I hear that too They may put less or are prepared to put less with individual institutions  Well, I guess we'll turn to the business picture, which is crystal clear! We have to approve the operations  Mr Kichline  Let me raise a question about your initial comment to the effect that no decline or stagnation is ahead  Okay That's what I want to raise the question about You said that things came in a little less strongly-- or weaker or whatever adjective you used--than you had expected last time That was only about 6 weeks ago and you were assuming that GNP was going to rise 5 percent in the third quarter Now you're down to 27 percent That's a heck of a big difference in six weeks, which reflects the fact that all the news coming in has been very appreciably lower than you were assuming  I'm just raising a question You are amplifying what I am saying The statistics are quite a lot weaker than you anticipated six weeks ago We started the summer on a high note and we surely ended it on a low note GNP couldn't be much higher in September than it was in June It may be lower I don't know As we look ahead, it is very hard to see housing going anyplace; and you say housing sales have leveled off There was some figure released this morning that I was told last night would show a pretty sharp decline  Well, we've had a lot of downward revisions It's very hard to see housing going anyplace I would think an optimistic projection in the near term is stability Plant and equipment orders have been down quite sharply over the last few months Backlogs are obviously up from where they were in the recession, but expenditures are not that much lower than orders at this point In fact, they are very close, and orders most recently have been weak  I didn't see that  This is all accompanied by a great surge in imports, which certainly is eating into US production The however many percent increase in the exchange rate recently can't help that situation in the future; there was an enormous surge in the exchange rate I don't know what consumption is going to do but it wasn't very good over the summer The auto sales look all right But that's the only thing that looks pretty good All of these other things raise some question about the vulnerability of inventories in the sense of continuing large accumulation, which is the only thing going on now So, why can't you make a pretty good case for no growth in the fourth quarter?  Mr Boehne  Mr Rice  Governor Martin  Minus  Miss Seger  Mr Forrestal  You refer to evidence of a rebound in your District in September What is that evidence?  Well, I don't know I heard a lot of stories about retail sales improving late in August and in early  -14-    10/2/84  September More recently I hear stories that they disappeared again I don't know whether--  You must have been talking to different ones than I was talking to or I wouldn't have [unintelligible]  Mr Boykin  Mr Keehn  -15-    10/2/84  Mr Corrigan  Governor Partee  Governor Wallich  Mr Morris  That's what we all have been saying for a year or more Governor Gramley  Mr Guffey  I thought he said the oil business was depressed  Mr Roberts  Mrs Horn  Does anybody else want to comment at this point? Mr Griffith, if you want to, we'll give you 30 seconds  Maybe you can give us a quick recital, Mr Axilrod, and we'll [have coffee]  I might say that I don't have all these figures precisely in mind, but the latest indications on the money supply suggest that September is going to come in lower than was assumed And the quarterly figure for June to September will be in the neighborhood of 2 percent or a little more, right?  October will start off appreciably below the September average It's rather a very sluggish ending The other figures for the 3 months are without any clear change  It may be worth pointing out that reserves have done nothing over the summer A question was asked about the dollar earlier, and I'm not going to deal with all the questions of what happens if the dollar declines because I don't know I've been worried about that for a year and it hasn't happened yet Instead, it has been going up and going up very rapidly recently, as you know That is a factor in my thinking at least I suggest that something is the matter here in terms of some notion of longer-term equilibrium and is a factor in the business picture and, as I indicated earlier, a source of some alarm abroad I certainly put that in my thinking as a factor to supply more reserves rather than less during this period That factor alone is not the only factor, but I think at this stage it is not an insignificant one Well, with that much introduction, who would like to say something?  Mr Morris  What are you referring to in 1981?  That was an entirely different situation A drop in the economy and the money supply decreased [unintelligible] It was a mistake in retrospect, but I don't think we have anything like that now  You say 8 percent This is a piece of the framework that I hadn't even considered--that the funds rate might be down around 8 percent  It's a question of what kind of signals we want to give After all, we're very close to the 12 percent and we're nowhere near the 8 percent at this point Governor Martin  But not necessarily the money supply numbers specified?  Mr Guffey  Governor Partee  Mr Forrestal  Well, if you specify the conditions that you are imagining, I will develop a contingency plan  Neither do I That's the problem  I don't know what the conditions would be I suspect it will go down some day I don't know whether it will be in 1984, 1985, or 1986 I suspect when it comes down it will come down precipitously You tell me whether the economy is vigorously expanding at that point or whether it's weak and what the inflation rate is then and what the budgetary situation is and I would be glad to develop a contingency plan But I named three variables, none of which I know about at this point, and all of which would affect my contingency plan  Well, I invite anybody who wants to engage in that exercise to engage in it Mr Black  Governor Gramley  Governor Rice  Mr Boykin  Mr Boehne  Mr Corrigan  Governor Wallich  Miss Seger  Mr Roberts  It's a little dangerous that they said they were content with policy!  That's what it said in the paper Mr Griffith  Mr Keehn  -32-    10/2/84  Mrs Horn  Exactly We could all share that  Well, I think you have identified the right question There is clearly a strong consensus for "B" with a couple of exceptions That is not surprising when we are talking about numbers for the money supply, which look nice Most people have suggested not changing the fed funds rate [range] That sounds right to me too; I don't see how we can raise the lower limit without getting peculiar interpretations I thought we had a very full discussion at the last meeting of what to do in terms of contingencies and I must say I don't ever remember being in a position [during an intermeeting period] when every indicator that I looked at appeared to be in the same direction and neatly fit the directive for moving down Whether I looked at M1, M2, M3, reserves, the exchange rate, the economy--what else have I left out here?  Prices--except for that last consumer price index number That was the only fly in the ointment But the producer price index and everything else seemed to fit exactly in a contingency that we considered and discussed at some length at the meeting as to how we would react under those circumstances The one thing that was really surprising and added a little edge to the way we operated was the exchange rate One could have argued that we should have been a little more aggressive in our monetary policy [response] At least that's my thinking In any event, that's behind us  -33-    10/2/84  We seem to have votes for "B," which I interpret as including both the funds rate range and the aggregates There are some differences of opinion on how that is to be dealt with I would remind you of what Si Keehn just said We meet again in 5 weeks; it's a relatively short period of time I didn't hear anybody talking about a higher borrowings number Some people were talking about a lower one and a number of people were talking explicitly or implicitly about not being too slow to move lower, if the evidence suggests that Someplace in this area we ought to be able to reach some kind of consensus operationally I don't like the directive as Mr Sternlight and Mr Axilrod wrote it, I must say It starts out by saying policy is unchanged I'll be more correct in my words; it says the "implementation of policy has been unchanged" when it obviously was changed in the last month If we were to read all of our directives in succession, they would never say anything was changed, although in fact they were changed  Well, I recall we had an argument about this once before But it seems to me that the first sentence ought to acknowledge that we have somewhat less pressure on reserves than we did at the time of the last meeting [when we adopted a directive] that said no change unless something happens Well, something happened That's a more or less technical point The real question is what we do thereafter I certainly share the view that some have expressed that if things continue coming in on the low side and/or the exchange rate continues very strong, we shouldn't be very reluctant to ease further in the kind of range that has been discussed here I, myself, am somewhat indifferent as to whether or not we do that right now I don't think it is necessary [to take action now] We have a very peculiar technical situation now where the funds rate is very high-- and borrowings have been very high just in the last few days--relative to what one would think it would be with this borrowing level The actual borrowing level we're going to publish is going to be way above our target It's going to confuse people And we are looking toward a great excess of reserves later in the week that may or may not be reflected very promptly in the funds rate How we will handle that I don't know, but we are well above any borrowing number--about twice-- that anybody has been talking about for the first week of this two- week period And getting it down to any of these borrowing numbers in the course of this week is inconceivable It would have to go to zero right away So, during this period, we're going to have a much higher level of borrowing than any of these numbers we are talking about Whether there was anything that could have been done about that, I don't know, but it's too late now We are going to start off the first week of this five-week period with a very high level of borrowing relative to what we're presumably aiming at, which may mean that the funds rate temporarily will go quite low later in the week In that case we obviously will be selling--not necessarily this week, but later in the two-week averaging period  Yes, this is the first week of the two- week period Just as a guess, the funds rate isn't going to decline all that precipitously later in this calendar week but the banks may have such an accumulation of excess reserves by the early part of next  -34-    10/2/84  week that it may plunge And they will be even further confused by what we're trying to do I have my doubts about these two-week averaging periods the more experience we have with that; the banks don't seem to have a very good idea of where the funds rate should be and it moves all over the lot  I don't know how much that affects it It may be that the contemporaneous reserve accounting makes them so much more uncertain about their reserve positions that it contributes to it It may be a combination of the two  In any event, in substance I will attempt to interpret what people are saying or some mean of what people are saying We start where we are, or close to where we are, and are pretty prompt to move lower if the money supply weakness is further confirmed, if the dollar is strong, and if economic weakness is relatively further confirmed All these signals would have to be pretty strong to carry us to borrowing as low as $500 million, I think, but not so strong to carry us down to $650 million or $600 million The signals would have to be clear, but not extreme Before I talk about language, how does that sound?  Well, what we want to examine is how much is too much too fast I would remind you, we now have a borrowing level that is down by $250 million, presumably, in terms of the previous target, with the fed funds rate as of the last few days down practically not at all A lot of other things are going on I don't know what you're thinking of Putting it in terms of interest rates is easier to describe  I don't have in my mind a 10 percent funds rate at this point  Well, nobody knows And we get daily fluctuations in the numbers; we already have But to give you the state of my mind I'm not thinking of a 10 percent funds rate at this point as a likely outcome without a good deal more weakness than what we've already seen  I'm not sure what contingency you're talking about There could be a million of them Are you saying the implication, if the money supply should be high, is that--  I understand that, but if that gives a tight [funds] market and money supply growth is relatively low, presumably we would ease the pressures on reserve positions That's fairly easy  Well, then you've got a different situation  Yes, but he's saying he doesn't like that, presumably, when something looks contrary or peculiar If we had rising interest rates and high money supply growth, then I think we  -36-    10/2/84  would have to rethink it I don't know how you write that in the directive  I think that is clearly one where we'd have to rethink it  Well, we may; I don't know what we would do about it  If October is going to be strong, it's going to have to show up, I suspect, in the figure for October 8th, which we won't have for a while And, if it doesn't show up then, we'll be in trouble in October because we'll have a couple of weeks in October below the September average  Yes, they usually come in the first or second week in the month; that's why I say that If it doesn't come by October 8th, I think we're unlikely to get an increase like that  As in September, if we had a great big increase that first full week in October, it wouldn't mean much; it might be necessary to put October at 6 percent  Which is what happened in September  I don't have any great problem with that, but my only connection with all the various political or semi- political sensitivities that have been mentioned is that, just speaking personally, I'm not very impressed with any of them I must say I don't necessarily agree with the Vice Chairman's fiscal policy strategy I'm not sure we'd know how to play that one I'd just play it straight And, in connection with the next few weeks, I'd play it straight too  Well, you say overwhelming--  A reasonably clear case That's all I'm saying  Well, it's a matter of degree But I think it can be overemphasized The market may be wrong and then  -38-    10/2/84  we're going to look like damn fools, and pretty quickly The market couldn't understand that we were easing earlier But I think it's fully accepted and it's very hard to [find] fault with it, I think, in their view I don't get any sense of complaint about it or wondering about it at this stage, although they didn't quite anticipate it There was a kind of disbelief for some weeks  The question is how the economy and the dollar and all the rest will behave And none of us knows that  It wasn't just the numbers on the economy I think they began showing up immediately after the last meeting We had an extreme movement in the dollar and continued weakness in the monetary aggregates  It was pretty extreme In terms of my foreign colleagues, outrage is a little strong, but [their reaction verged] on outrage that we didn't pay more attention to it  I don't disagree with that, but there was very little support for intervention without monetary policy action on the part of the United States  Well, I think we are in an asymmetrical position; that's where my gut tells me we are [The issue is] whether or not we put it down in the directive I would If the economy suddenly rebounded and the money supply began running significantly higher than alternative B, I would question what we do, particularly in the context of the dollar not strengthening further I can imagine circumstances in which one might want to tighten, but I'd be pretty hard pressed to imagine what those circumstances would be in the next five weeks It does not strain my credulity at all to think that we might want to go at least modestly in the other direction in the next  -39-    10/2/84  five weeks And I would think that the directive ought to reflect that But just how it reflects that is--  Yes, I know We could do that  That, I think, is the minimum that one ought to do Mr Axilrod could distribute this [draft] that really is asymmetrical, if you're interested in looking at it It would start out by saying "In the implementation of policy in the short run the Committee seeks to maintain the lesser degree of restraint on reserve positions sought in recent weeks" That's more or less technical; it acknowledges that we did something Then, we'd put in the sentence with basically the alternative B [specifications] It would go on to say that a somewhat or slightly further lessening of restraint on reserve positions would be acceptable in the light of significantly slower growth in the monetary aggregates, particularly in the context of continued moderation in economic activity and inflationary pressures Then we'd go on with the standard language  It says "particularly in the context of"  In this version We can put it back in, but I'd put it in another sentence--unless you want to use something like "particularly" Otherwise, we could just drop the next sentence  The one thing that bothers me about this is that there is then no mention, except in another paragraph, of credit market conditions and the exchange rate That is obscurely in there now with financial market conditions That could be worked in somehow, I suppose Let's put a comma, and then "taking account of financial market conditions and the rate of credit growth"  -40-    10/2/84  It does, but it doesn't get much attention there It's not in the operative part of the directive I don't have it in front of me, but you are right that there is a--  Well, I think it's a mistake not to have something on both sides We can achieve the purpose you want by simply revising the existing sentence and putting the easier restraint first and then leaving the rest of the directive exactly as it is So, it would read "Somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the context of significantly slower growth of the aggregates or somewhat greater restraint would be acceptable in the event of more substantial growth In either case" and so on It just seems to me that, with a couple of months of weakness in economic activity, to send a signal out that we have completely ruled out of our thinking any possibility that we would react to events on the other side is wrong It's not the way to do things  I don't see why, but that's--  I think you are assuming much more controllability of the market than in fact we have  This great 1-1/2 percentage point reduction in long-term rates took place without any change in our borrowing assumption at all We reduced the borrowing by $250 million--this massive move that you talk about--and long-term rates are practically where they were before we started moving borrowing down And how far down the federal funds rate is, I don't even know It depends upon whether you look at it on Friday or Monday or Wednesday  But it depends upon so many other factors that thinking we can predict this with any assurance is a bit beyond our capacity  Well, I think you're assuming conditions that I'm not assuming on this  All this easing that you're talking about takes place in the context of continuing quite sluggish business numbers, a strong dollar, and low money growth  If it's too formalistic, I think we're just doing a very formalistic thing and not being very enlightening But I don't have any objection to dealing with that  I have no objection to something like that  Yes, I don't know whether you want the word "possibly" in there  This is a very minor thing, but I would not just take this existing sentence and reverse the order because it sounds so formalistic  We would have changed nothing and people are supposed to read great meaning into the changing of the order of a sentence without one iota of change in the substance That sounds a little too much But if you put in an adjective or two, I don't mind that if you prefer it  This time I'm partly objecting because it rather sounds to me like we're playing games instead of reflecting anything substantive  It sounds a little less formalistic to me than just reversing [the order]  Well, he's combining those two sentences  The way he would have it read is "A somewhat further lessening of restraint on reserve positions would be acceptable in the event of significantly slower growth in the monetary aggregates evaluated in relation not only to the indicated strength of the business expansion and inflationary pressures, but also to financial market conditions and the rate of credit growth" That's a rather cumbersome sentence, but it's all right "Conversely, greater restraint might" or "would be acceptable"  Is "acceptable" the word? We'd say "acceptable in the event of"--well, "significantly" is the obvious word to put in here but we used "significantly" up above  "Substantially more rapid monetary growth" Is that--  "And indications of"--we can't exactly say a rebound "Indications of stronger"?  "Economic growth and credit expansion" [Unintelligible] Jack Kemp's concerns  Yes, I think it's good to get the [reference to] inflationary pressures in there--"of economic activity and inflationary pressures"  I think that's right  Well, I know what I have now, and what's the rest of it?  The usual last two sentences, or just the last sentence It goes directly to the last sentence  Let me just read it "In the implementation of policy in the short run, the Committee seeks to maintain the lesser degree of restraint on reserve positions sought in recent weeks This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M1, M2, and M3 at annual rates of 6, 7-1/2, and 9 percent, respectively, during the period from September to December A somewhat further lessening of restraint on reserve positions would be acceptable in the event of significantly slower growth in the monetary aggregates, evaluated in relation--" Why don't we take out this "not only" bit to simplify the sentence?  SPEAKER(?) Yes  --"evaluated in relation to the strength of business expansion and inflationary pressures and financial market conditions and the rate of credit growth" Am I right?  "Domestic and international" Put in everything but the kitchen sink! "domestic and international financial market conditions, and the rate of credit growth Conversely, greater restraint might be acceptable in the event of substantially more rapid monetary growth and indications of significant strengthening of economic activity and inflationary  -45-    10/2/84  pressures The Chairman may call for Committee consultation" etc And we leave in 8 to 12 percent [for the funds rate range]  SPEAKER(?) Sounds right  "strengthening of economic activity and inflationary pressures"  If that is satisfactory, we will vote  Okay, I guess we are finished  END OF MEETING  -46-       Any other discussion? Well, I take it that there is a willingness to renegotiate all the swaps or to renew them for another year There is not much renegotiation involved  I guess we don't, do we?  We'll approve them when they are done We have to ratify the transactions  Without objection Mr Sternlight  Questions?  Any other comments? We have to ratify the transactions  Without objection Mr Kichline  You say the economy was expanding more rapidly in September and October This is what the employment figures for October show as I understand it That does not seem to be matched by industrial production or by consumption necessarily  In employment  I understand the number How do you interpret the unemployment claims figure?  To unload the imports and sell them!  Mr Morris  Governor Martin    11/7/84  Governor Rice  Mr Keehn  What business?  Let me just interrupt for a second I had the impression that heavy trucks were doing well--that they had gone down and then gone up  Mr Boehne  Mr Forrestal  Mr Black  Governor Wallich  What's a growth recession?  It's not exactly at 5 percent either  Governor Gramley  Mr Balles  Mr Corrigan  Mrs Horn  Mr Boykin  Ms Seger  Governor Partee  Mr Roberts  Mr Guffey  Mr Morris  [Unintelligible]  Well, why don't we hear from Mr Axilrod  Are there any more or less technical questions or comments?  How big are Super NOW accounts?  Super NOWs are what level?  Is that included in that $140 billion?  Why would that make NOW accounts go down?  Mr Guffey, did you have a question?  Do you have something to say, Mr Sternlight?  Mr Balles  We've had enough hypotheses We will go and drink some coffee  [Coffee break]  Let me express a few thoughts after listening to this conversation this morning, which I thought had quite a different tone than a month ago The big surge theory seems to have disappeared or has strongly dissipated at least Similarly, the economy has not been expanding very rapidly in recent months We had that very large--and confusing to me--figure on employment in October I would emphasize one point that a lot of people have emphasized already The impact of imports on the manufacturing sector of the economy is pervasive I won't go on at great lengths because it was explored earlier But there are signs that what was happening earlier was that the expansion in demand was so great you could knock off 2 percent of it for imports and nobody felt the difference Now, when domestic demand goes down, it makes a big difference And I guess the imports actually have surged You do get a sense of spreading layoffs among some pretty big areas in manufacturing industries right in the  -23-    11/7/84  middle of this expansion You mentioned textiles, shoes, lumber, and some others And I think that affects the manufacturers' moods anyway--not just in terms of the current competition but I think they are looking at some of their investment plans Some shoe businesses are going out of business, for instance  And it is leading to some moderation there But enough was said about that As I look at the business picture, I think we have a rapid rate of inventory accumulation That didn't look so bad when the economy was rising rapidly, but as soon as the economy stops rising so rapidly that rate of inventory accumulation has to come down One senses that that's what businessmen feel And I think the short-run question we have is How will that happen? If retail sales are strong in the next few months, we can get a declining rate of inventory accumulation in a very smooth way and have a good setting for business next year If retail sales don't pick up in the next few months, I think we have a quite different kind of problem The GNP figure for the fourth quarter may not be a bit different in total but it's going to include more inventories and less sales, and that has quite different implications for next year And I don't think we know Everybody reports on talking to retailers who seem to change their minds every two weeks about their feelings about sales--for good reason, I suspect, because there is some instability in them I surely don't know, but if I had to guess I'd say the retail sales figure in October is probably going to be weak because autos presumably were down The explanation that there are not enough cars [in dealer inventories] is beginning to wear a little thin on me Maybe it's all true; there is something curious in that industry I don't think the industry wants to produce many more cars I am beginning to think they get a nice profit margin where they are The dealers like it, manufacturers like it, and so long as they have the Japanese shut off why take on another worker with all the pension obligations and everything else? Although we'll get some expansion in production there, I guess it will not be very much We are in a period of great uncertainty, particularly about what retail sales are going to do I think plant and equipment [spending] is holding up fairly well I feel more comfortable about housing than I did a while ago simply because interest rates are going down I would comment that I don't have any particular quarrel with the forecast, but I think we ought to put a good deal of uncertainty around any forecast I would point out that the forecast level has been successively lowered in recent meetings at the same time that interest rates have been declining fairly precipitously We have a lower forecast now for economic activity for the next year than we had in August or in previous meetings, with interest rates 2 percentage points lower  No I don't know what the previous--  But two forecasts ago we had a 5 percent increase in the third-quarter GNP and we're now going to have 1-1/2 to 2 percent That's a difference of almost 1 percent [in level terms] in the estimate of one quarter's change I think it was still higher in an earlier estimate  It has been coming down by whatever the right amount is In a perverse kind of way, maybe compared to the comments that I heard from a lot of people earlier, I feel more comfortable about the forecast this month than I did last month, partly because interest rates are down and I think the housing forecast is better based We have the exchange rate at least moving in the other direction; we are not under the same pressure We have had some--it is so brief it is hard to tell--firming of commodity prices in recent weeks which is quite in contrast to the trend we had for several months prior to that And we do have that surprisingly good employment figure in services and retail trade in October, which I don't understand  Last month I saw no danger, frankly, that we could overease within the practical scope of whatever we were going to do This time I am not so sure Beginning at the level of interest rates that we have and given the feeling I have about the economy, I could conceive that we would get overly enthusiastic in terms of easing, whereas I didn't think that was possible last month In terms of generally posturing ourselves, I think we are in a far better position for a variety of reasons, given all the risks that exist, to not be too far behind the curve in easing if that is the way things develop That's partly because we have the risks of the dollar; I would hate to have to do a lot of aggressive easing in a situation where the dollar is already declining more than one would like to see I would rather be in a position where, if anything, we have the easing done and are in a position to tighten up a little if the dollar does get in real trouble at some point But in terms of our general posture, it's partly--and the point has been made--that there is room, obviously, for the economy to grow more than 3 percent next year I am talking about the probabilities  The inflation picture looks under enough control so that I don't think we have to worry about an explosion on that side apart from anything that would develop on the exchange rate end itself It is not a current concern but could be a concern almost at any time looking to the future depending upon how things develop And given the experience we have had, I don't feel any great sense of inability to prevent the economy from bursting out on the up side in the foreseeable future If we had to tighten some down the road, so be it I don't have the feeling that it would be an impossible job to keep the economy from an unfortunate and overextended surge of activity if we faced that possibility rather than the opposite one of cumulating excessive weakness in the economy, given all the risks and uncertainties that I see And one factor I might mention in that connection is that in the rest of the world I still do not see many signs of ebullient economic activity, to say the least The European economy still seems to me to be in a very sluggish phase I guess the latest information from Japan is not so bad, but it's on the slower side rather than on the stronger side And that has been the one  -25-    11/7/84  economy that has been showing a pretty good rate of advance The problems in the developing world are obvious enough  Where that all leaves us, I don't quite know But I think we may have room for a little more formal easing here if that's what you want to do But I don't know that we want to go overboard about it I might say that in view of the monetary developments, I think the only question in the past few weeks was whether we should have been easier and put in more reserves and reduced the borrowing level The reason that was not done was simply because I judged that the tone of the discussion and the instructions last time clearly reflected some concern if interest rates--and the federal funds rate in particular-- were to go down around the 10 percent level or below and other rates were declining rapidly There wasn't much eagerness for being very aggressive, so we weren't very aggressive In fact, interest rates obviously did get to those levels and in those conditions it didn't seem all that urgent But I don't know that I personally had the feeling that the interest rate developments were disastrously rapid in terms of lower rates, given all the conditions And I am not sure I would want to conduct a policy that I thought would actively back them up again as a deliberate matter of policy But with that much discussion, let us proceed  By going halfway in between you are making a final judgment of 1/2 percentage point on a figure that we may come within 5 percentage points of if we are lucky  I understand  You mentioned something about reducing the discount rate; I have a comment on that That may be a market  -26-    11/7/84  expectation, but I don't think there is anything technical that would raise the question of a decline in the discount rate if the funds rate were 9-1/4 or 9-3/4 percent or so We can do it if we want to, but I don't see any dynamic in the situation that forces that decision  I might mention Somebody tells me that Citibank reduced the prime rate by 1/4 point--a small move on the down side, considering  Governor Martin  Let me just say a word about that M1 number If I understand it, given the fragmentary information we now have for the beginning of the month, we would have to get a big increase in the second week of the month--  I will make an empirical comment that big increases don't ordinarily come in the second week of a month  Yes A figure that pulls down growth for the month of October at the end of the month by 1 percentage point means that November is starting appreciably lower than what they were assuming  Well, it is harder to get those figures in November I don't think there is any question about it Of course, if we get some momentum, it's not hard to get a big one-month figure December could be anything But it's going to be hard to get a big figure in November  Mr Roberts  Mr Morris  What meeting are you talking about?  My memory is that that happened before that meeting or very close to it  After hearing the discussion last month, I was almost tempted to raise the question on the agenda Do you want to target the federal funds rate? That is what most people seemed to want to do last meeting I wouldn't recommend it, but that's--  I think you're misreading this history a bit, if I may say so There is no doubt that the funds rate got higher than was anticipated, given any particular level of borrowings But this happened over a period of 4 or 5 months; we had several meetings when the interest rate was higher than we expected it to be and there was a deliberate decision not to do anything about it When it first happened, the money supply was rising very rapidly in May and June and the economy was going along very rapidly and we had quite ebullient forecasts that people weren't objecting to as to the rate of economic growth So, under those conditions people sat there and said, rightly or wrongly "The interest rate is higher than we expected it to be but it looks all right"  I don't know whether you have a particular proposal  This is not operative for today's meeting?  Well, perhaps we can return to that point  How long a time period are you talking about?  What information are we going to get in the next few weeks? We know roughly what industrial production is going to be The big information we're going to get is retail sales figures; there's nothing else of any significance  Is there anything else? When are durable goods orders? Is there anything else big coming out?  So we get retail sales and durable goods orders two weeks from now  I don't think the retail sales figure is going to tell us much unless it is quite strong If it is, I would think it significant Myself, I think it is likely to be weak  We get commodity prices and initial claims, yes Are you finished?  Mr Black  -31-    11/7/84  Mr Corrigan  Better use that seasonal, Mr Axilrod!  Governor Partee  Mr Forrestal  Governor Gramley  Governor Rice  Mr Balles  Governor Wallich  I didn't know we had that problem of easing too late in an expansion  We always got accused of the opposite  [You mean] $600 million would be the minimum  Mr Keehn  Governor Seger  Mrs Horn  Mr Guffey  Mr Boehne  The clearest vision we may have is that we're uncertain  Mr Boykin  Since I have not looked at these directives very closely, the first one is just like last time, right? We would have to put in different numbers  I ordinarily have a strong bias toward not changing these directives in mid-quarter, but this time we are so far off on M1 that maybe it would be better to change the whole thing than to put in a funny number, which leads me to alternative II A number  -41-    11/7/84  of people, but not everybody, mentioned II Let me ask whether we should work from II I am not saying every dot and tittle of it, but the difference is that it involves saying something special about M1 That's the substance of it  I have not really examined this closely but the thought just occurred to me Suppose we combine alternative I and II and avoid the two-month number It may be a bad precedent since we haven't the vaguest idea whether we are going to come close to it for two months and part of the two months is already over But suppose we said something like "This action is expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3" at whatever [rates we decide] Those rates are not changed in substance or even not changed at all Maybe we could even say "as indicated last month" However, then we'd put in a special sentence about M1 "In view of the shortfall in M1 in October it is anticipated that the quarterly figure would be"-- whatever And then maybe we should pick up this part "More rapid growth would be acceptable in M1 in view of the substantial decline of M1 in October which brought that aggregate in the bottom half of its long-term range" Or we could leave that last part off Maybe that's the way to do it Just put in a quarterly figure and a sentence on M1 and then say, just as you say here, that more rapid growth would be acceptable in view of the substantial decline Make that the third sentence of alternative I  At least we are admitting--  Well, I don't think it is going to change whatever we put in anyway  I presumed we were going to put in 2-1/2 to 3-1/2 percent or compromise between them and put in 3 percent  I know, but I presume that's the same as some quarterly figure  Well, it's going to take 1/2 percent bigger growth for the two months because we are one percent lower in October than we thought we were  Three is a nice round number and that implies a little over seven percent, I take it, for November-December I don't even know what you have What are you intending to put in here on the two alternatives? You said 7 percent for "B" What was it for "A"?  [Unintelligible] So, it is 8 or 8-1/2 percent, I guess For "B" you had 7 percent and for "A" you had 8-1/2 percent and it is starting out a little low so that adds another 1/2 percent So you would have 7-1/2 [and] 9 percent for those two months If we put in 3 percent--if I'm doing this arithmetic right-- that implies 8 to 8-1/2 percent for--  Well, 3-1/2 percent presumably implies 9 percent If my arithmetic is right, it comes out about 8-1/4 percent  With the new October figure?  There isn't that much difference between these two [alternatives] The only difference is that one sentence really It's a question of whether we state it as a quarterly figure or as a two-month figure  The rest of this is all open  I don't know how you got that figure  I think the only issue here, which is not a substantive issue but a cosmetic issue, is precisely that whether we want to cite a two-month number--whether that's a good policy on balance or not I have some sympathy for saying it's not We've pretty consistently used quarterly numbers  I guess I am saying that we might as well stick with the quarterly figure In either event, I would make a special sentence about M1 and say whatever we want to say about a shortfall in it  Well, let me try to resolve the problem we have here and then we can come back and try to write something Again, I don't think there is a substantive difference After "This action is expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3" why don't we put in the same figures we had before We're within a half percent of them, aren't we?  Let's say "growth of M2 and M3 at annual rates of 7-1/2 and 9 percent" All right?  What do you mean?  It's still a reasonable target, right?  Shall we stick a phrase at the end of that such as "as indicated at the last meeting" or something like that? Then go with another sentence on M1? Well, maybe we don't need that "as indicated at the last meeting"  "M1 is expected to grow over the period by" whatever Let's say 3 percent tentatively, which is halfway between and a round number We could just put a semi-colon and then say "more rapid growth would be acceptable in view of the substantial decline of M1 in October" Or we could say "M1 is expected to grow over the period by 3 percent, less than anticipated earlier in view of the shortfall in October"  And then we could go on to say "In the light of that shortfall, more rapid growth in that aggregate would be acceptable"  -45-    11/7/84  I think "decline in October" is all right Then we're going to say more generally "Lesser restraint on reserve positions would be acceptable in the event of significantly slower growth in the monetary aggregates" I sure don't know whether we need that greater restraint sentence  Let's get to that point Is that general framework of the directive--just in terms of the language--all right?  SPEAKER(?) Mind over matter  Let me take the funds rate first; that seems to be easier Most people have said 7 to 11 percent, which makes sense to me It's more centered and we raised it not so long ago I think after all this period of time it might be appropriate to have some gesture toward reducing it  Generally, we are at 7 to 11 percent?  The critical figure will be the borrowing assumption There we are dealing with a great deal of uncertainty I think all these comments about the seasonal borrowing are relevant but also I suppose it's possible that the seasonal borrowing will decrease now that market rates are so low We had an experience recently with a big bank waltzing in for a large amount of borrowing for no apparent reason And if one or two big banks waltz in during a reserve period, that uses up all our borrowing here and we're left in a peculiar position We have a full range of proposals here--from $400 or close to it to $700 million, which averages to $550 million  I do think there is some danger in easing too aggressively here I don't think that analogy in '80 is a terribly good one to give because we had those credit controls and other factors that were driving down M1 But we have had a pretty good decline in interest rates I personally feel a little more comfortable about the outlook simply because interest rates have declined I think we have to show some motion here and that seems to be the prevailing sentiment What anything means I don't know As a practical matter, I take it nobody would be very happy at this stage, contrary to a few weeks ago, to see the rates backing up appreciably in the market; the bill rate can go up a little from where it is today and so forth But I don't know what borrowing level provides assurance against that  -46-    11/7/84  I agree with that We don't know that, but I would agree that the odds are substantial in that case It could happen with $600 million but that is less likely, depending upon where you think it is now Driving it down to $500 million seems to me a bigger step than is appropriate at the moment Maybe it will be appropriate in a few weeks My view is that that could put the funds rate at 8-1/2 percent, given--  We could do that, but we're going to get the--  If the money supply is weak, we are going to drive [the funds rate] way down and then you get into the '80s [situation] That's what we did in 1980--  --until we finally stopped and the funds rate got way below the discount rate Maybe that's what we want to do at the next step but I am not sure we want to do it right now Given the way this market has been acting, my gut feeling is that we ought to be in the $550 to $600 million range And if the rate shows signs of backing up at that level--unless we get some really good business numbers--we ought to let borrowing go down further pretty promptly but do it over [a few weeks] We have one two-week reserve period and then we have another two-week reserve period I'd do it by the next reserve period maybe, but not all at once Are we in the first week of a reserve period? No, we're just ending a reserve period  SPEAKER(?) It starts on Thursday  Well, by the beginning of the next reserve period we will have the retail sales and the durable goods orders figures and some more data on unemployment claims, won't we?  You have a thing for pressed turkey  I don't want to be too arithmetic about it, but the great majority of the Committee is within $50 million of $550  If the money supply is weak and the economy is weak and so forth--  You have a pretty good microscope if you can tell the difference between $750 and $700 million  It was a feeble gesture to--  If they did, then we ought to move more; I don't think anybody is talking about a backup  Frankly, the difference between $550 and $600 million is not going to be visible in anything we do It's within the range of error that we hit anyway  I don't think the assumption is that we would automatically go down; the assumption is we would go down if the money numbers come in weaker than anticipated and if the business and general news is biased on the less strong side rather than the strong side If we come up with a positive retail sales figure in October and a strong new orders figure and the money supply is up $3 billion in the week of the 15th and another $2 billion in the following week, the 22nd, I don't think there's any assumption that we'd do anything  If we start at $550 million, it would  Why won't they just renew it for the following year?  We're getting pretty narrow From my standpoint, if you want to make it $550 to $600 million, it's fine with me I'll make it whichever I feel like  SPEAKER(?) That's the actual state of the art, I guess!  I think everybody is saying we play this a little [flexibly]; we've been playing it this way anyway It depends upon what happens in the market If the market gets way ahead of it, we go slower; if it doesn't, we go faster  I think that is within this anyway You can have an argument as to whether the market conditions and the economy dictate it but it's certainly within the range of where we can go as I understand it  Well, I don't know what alternative A means That's just a question of the number to put in, isn't it?  Frankly, the number that I thought of putting in there--but it's not going to make any difference to me--is the round number that is halfway between "A" and "B" If we do it on a quarterly basis, I'd put in 3  To some extent that doesn't bother me because I don't think the general business picture is very risky on the up side And if it gets moderately risky on the up side, we can tighten up I don't want to get the money supply [expanding so rapidly] in the next few months that we've got a problem, but--  51-    11/7/84  [Steve], did you write down the language that we had? I'll fill in some numbers as you go along  In sentence number one, I don't care whether it says "reduce" or "decrease" We'll take a vote on that "In the implementation of policy in the short run, the Committee seeks" "To reduce" is a better Anglo-Saxon term; no they're both Latin, aren't they?  "Reduce" sounds better to me "seeks to reduce somewhat existing pressures on reserve positions This action is expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 at annual rates of around 7-1/2 and 9 percent during the period from September to December" We're putting in there the same figures we had before; we're not very far away Now I don't remember what I said before  3 percent semi-colon  In light of that decline more rapid growth of Ml would be acceptable  Yes, and then it would go on to say "More generally lesser restraint" Instead of "acceptable"--we just used the word "acceptable"--let's say "Lesser restraint on reserve positions would be sought in the event of significantly slower growth in the monetary aggregates, evaluated" etc  Well, it's all right with me The other sentence says "acceptable," which is weaker than this other one If that sounds generally all right, we're still left with what level of borrowing we're starting off with I am perfectly happy with an understanding of $550 to $600 million that would be played in the first week depending upon how the market conditions look We'll stay  -52-    11/7/84  there if things are very equable If things come out on the strong side, well, we'd stay for a while; if things come out on the weak side, we'd make another step downward  We might well want a consultation staying within this, but we will have to see how obvious or clear it is Is that reasonable? Let's see whether we've got the votes  And 7 to 11 percent on the funds rate  You're quite right, neither "A" nor "B" has that, but they are within 1/2 point of it and I think that's--  We've typically done that, or tried to, when it's very close  Actually, M3 is running a little high and M2 is running a little low But gosh, we should be so close on these things ordinarily!  It works the other way if the economy is slowing down so much  I don't know what "in the context of" means and I don't think I understand Governor Partee's comment  It's in the context of what we're talking about, which is a figure of 3 percent for M1 and 7-1/2 and 9 percent for M2 and M3 and these general borrowing numbers It is talking about going to, say, $400 million, without making a great deal of it, if there is a succession of weak economic or monetary numbers  If no one has a better proposal at the moment, I think we ought to vote  We are finished  END OF MEETING  -54-       We need to approve the minutes No objection We'll go to Mr Cross  Any discussion?  I think it's fair to say the Bundesbank raised the question of whether it was worthwhile having the swap line at all  Any other discussion on this? If not, I will entertain a motion, other than Mr Cross' motion, to renew these swap agreements as amended  Without objection, they are approved Mr Sternlight  Any comments?  Approved We need to ratify the transactions Without objection, they're approved Mr Axilrod, you have presented a little paper on a number of items that don't have to be resolved now but should be resolved by the time we come to 1985  We seem to be talking about this little matter of the base, which I suppose is the simplest to talk about We don't have to make decisions on any of these issues today We're just exchanging some preliminary views, so why don't we stay on this particular question for the moment Frank, were you on this question or something else?  [MR MORRIS] I was on the other operating procedure  Well, let's stay on this one since we started with it  Sometimes we have and sometimes we have not  Not for all aggregates all the time  [We said] in July that we expected M3 and credit to be above [their ranges]  I think we have said from time to time in the past--and I'm not sure whether we said it ex ante or ex post--that    12/17-18/84  high growth or low growth in the earlier part of the year was fine because it made up for fairly slow or fairly rapid growth in the previous year  Congratulations I thought the staff would never do that I tried 3 or 4 years ago and could never get the staff to do that  I think once before we drew M1 that way Does anybody else want to comment on this rebasing question? I have not detected a lot of sympathy for it  If we continue to get $7 billion declines in M1 for the next few weeks--  [Unintelligible] something even less than that Nobody else has comments on this question? We had a couple of people who wanted to talk about the operating procedure Mr Morris and Mr Boehne  I'm not quite sure what you're getting at There is no instruction on total reserves, the way we have it now Maybe there should be  We don't have to have a conference call; we have a meeting  I'm not sure I fully understand You had the chance during the summer in a meeting, whether or not we had a conference call You had repeated chances in September, October-- How many times did we meet this fall? Nobody wanted to do anything about it  I understand that question But I say that at least once the Committee had a meeting and--for a while, anyway--said no And the opposite happened this fall  We've not focused on that aspect of it because reserves have been falling short for some time They are well below the mark Mr Boehne, I think, expressed a desire to talk earlier I have a note here that Manufacturer's Hanover has cut its prime rate to 10-3/4 percent  Mr Balles  Mr Black  Mr Corrigan  Mr Forrestal  Governor Gramley  Governor Partee  Just in the interest of accuracy, let me redescribe what I think our techniques have been during this period You said the contrast was between (1) setting a nonborrowed reserve path, keeping it, and the borrowings would fall out and (2) setting the borrowing and the nonborrowed reserves would fall out    12/17-18/84  The correction I wanted to make was this That may be true in the first instance, but we have always made adjustments either to the nonborrowed reserve path or now, conversely, to the borrowing, depending upon what the other was doing You're talking about some bias when you're talking about this technique But these things that Steve is talking about are so small that they're way within the discretionary adjustments we were making anyway with either technique We make discretionary adjustments when the Committee permits it  Well, we have to get back to that subject, too Mr Guffey  Governor Wallich  Mr Black  Mr Boykin  Miss Seger  Mr Keehn  Governor Rice  Everybody is willing to impose judgment, so long as it's their judgment!  But you think they're that much?  Just for my own edification When you say the result is $25 million, what are you assuming that's related to--a $1 billion change in M1 or something?  Yes, and how big a change in Ml?  A few people commented, favorably or unfavorably, on what they thought of M1 Does anyone else wish to make comments on what they think of M1? Unless you have changed your mind, you don't need to raise your hand  Governor Gramley  Mr Boykin  Mr Balles  How many people would like to put primary emphasis on Ml?  No, of everything We're not deciding anything today Who would put primary emphasis on M1 in the conduct of open market operations?  I see a few hands go up weakly and then they go down again  [It would] certainly go in that direction, but whether or not it's mechanical-- Who would put primary emphasis on Ml?  Everything Primary emphasis  I said primary; I didn't say exclusive  Primary relative to anything else  Well, fortunately, we don't have to do anything about this today    12/17-18/84  I'm not very happy with this proposal of Mr Axilrod's I'll tell you this It's Mickey Mouse in my opinion I don't see anything the matter with it, but it's trivial in a way Let me give you two reasons why I would point out that the money supply has been steadier when we depressed its importance and the automatic responses we have given to [the aggregates] Not so many months ago we were being praised by the monetarists for this new way we had found to keep the money supply steady I at least am suspicious that it's not entirely accidental--that any reaction we make to it of a sharp kind is after the fact and affects things with a lag And it may send things off in another direction So you get sine curves instead of stability Nobody has talked much about the fact that we are working with economic projections and I find, just as a pragmatic judgment, that the Committee puts tremendous weight on them The economic projections are consistently unreliable in terms of the ex post judgment that's made about what the satisfactory quarter-to-quarter movement is in the economy And I think that's just a fact of life; it's not that the projections are any worse than anybody else's You can't project the economy quarter-to-quarter or half year-to-half year with a degree of sensitivity that is required ex post to make everybody happy That's another way of saying you can't fine-tune on the basis of economic projections  I find the Axilrod approach--I call it the Axilrod approach though he was responding to a request--a little narrow because it's focusing on whatever M, M1 presumably Maybe the more relevant question, or at least as relevant a question, is whether we shouldn't be putting more weight on other indicators of what is happening We have an exchange rate that in my judgment is wildly out of line with the needs of this economy over a period of time And it should have been telling us something for a long period We've had commodity prices falling rather sharply for six months now, I guess, during a period when economic projections were pointing in quite a different direction Commodity pricing didn't prove to be the worst economic indicator in the world And it tells you something in that it makes a policy difference as well How well you do it in the first [unintelligible] The only reason I would worry about the Axilrod proposal is that I wonder whether we'd be kidding ourselves by making this little automatic rule, if I may call it that, [and if] that would inhibit making discretionary changes It is so minor in and of itself that it doesn't do much And if the Committee sits around and says "We have this automatic response mechanism so that's all we're going to do"--if that's the psychology of it--we may not be responding often or fast enough I don't know whether it would work out that way, but I'd be a little suspicious  I agree You can argue the opposite We used to do it 100 percent  SPEAKER(?) We'll have to go for Pluto!  -21-    12/17-18/84  Well, this [unintelligible] But there must be something drastic about doing more than that  Oh no, we are--  [Unintelligible] you're getting a wiggle in M1, too  $350 million less than the $11 billion that we didn't make the previous time or than the $1 billion?  Only $65 million--practically no borrowing?  That's with 100 percent?  Well, the success of what has happened since depends upon what happens in the coming months  We can provide a perfect monetary policy if you say we just can't provide a perfect economy  Mr Kichline, [after my] having given a great endorsement to all business forecasts, would you like to deliver one?  One of the questions that arises [with] the kind of outlook you forecast for next year--whatever the reliability of that may be--is where the risks lie And is it satisfactory or does it itself imply that one ought to be going for a higher or theoretically lower [outcome]? Where do you lean on policy with a forecast of that sort, if you believe it It doesn't tell me what the risks are on one side or the other  On this profit margin question, I have a very vague impression from looking at the figures, though not closely You can confirm it on the basis of a lot of careful work, I'm sure Why do I hear so many complaints from businessmen--pretty much across the board it appears, though it may not be across the board--that profit margins are under pressure? They say "I'd love to raise prices; I can't do it because of imports" But the [overall] impression is that profit margins are awful  [Unintelligible] the manufacturing industry  You're looking at so-called economic profits  You mean above the [unintelligible] in corporate profits?  -25-    12/17-18/84  Well, I mean the $6 billion figure  [Unintelligible]  You haven't any evidence, I presume, but how much gossip is there on what these tax proposals are doing? You say theoretically they might increase it I understand that, but I haven't heard a--  On depreciation If you invest next year, that accelerated depreciation continues through the life of that investment?  That's what I get, too  What are you assuming in the trade balance next year?  You're saying no further deterioration in the trade balance?  Does anybody else want to deliver themselves of a comment at this point? If not, we'll come back and make more pregnant comments in the morning  [Meeting recessed]    12/17-18/84  December 18, 1984--Morning Session  Mr Kichline, what do you have for us this morning?  Mr Axilrod, why don't you go ahead and say what you want to say?  December will turn out to be lower unless it's higher! That's about what that projection is worth  I think the time has come for some general reactions but before you do that I would like to suggest that you comment on several specific things We are approaching the time for [setting] long-term ranges for 1985 Indeed, in a couple of weeks we are going to be in 1985 We have some preliminary long-term ranges for 1985 and I think you ought to put your comments in the context of what you think the appropriate longer-term ranges should be in a general way, whether similar to or the same as we had in July or, if different, in what respect different In the same vein, [views] about the relative weight of some of these monetary aggregates or other factors might be relevant You can add anything on operating techniques that we discussed a bit yesterday; that would be relevant too  We also are going to have to present some forecasts for next year and we will get those between this meeting and the next meeting Let me make a couple of comments on that There is a question of where we're going and, at this long distance from the end of next year, where we want to go We have a projection of a little less than 3 percent [real GNP growth] next year, if you take the staff estimate  -31-    12/17-18/84  That presumably is based upon certain assumptions as to monetary growth The assumption on interest rates seems to keep changing from meeting to meeting and getting lower, I would think, consistent with those monetary growth estimates In any event, we're going to have to put forward a projection And I think that we should consider at this stage at least, since we're making up policy, where we want to be, as they say, as well as where we think we're going to be If you take the staff's 3 percent [real GNP growth forecast] as a starting point, is that satisfactory or not? I would put it this way I would have to be persuaded that that's the ideal outcome for next year It seems to me that the economy has a little more room to grow than that, ideally Now, I'm not saying we can arrange this all ideally But if we don't think it is going to grow 3 percent or faster, say 4 percent, I guess the question that arises is Why aren't we easing? And what are the things that are inhibiting that, if any? Maybe there are some If we were in a strongly inflationary period, for instance, I guess that would be an obvious inhibition Is that where we are? Is that a risk? I think some commentary about that would be desirable just in the sense of where the risks are in the economy As a benchmark, if you are in agreement about taking that 3 percent as a benchmark, Mr Kichline says that in his judgment the risks [to that forecast] are evenly balanced I'd like some comment as to whether that's what you think they are in some economic sense I think there's a question of whether the implications are equally balanced and whether the risks and dangers in the larger sense of overshoots or undershoots from, let's say, 3 percent or wherever you think we're going, are evenly balanced That comes back to the question of what the risks are of inciting inflation on the one side, I suppose, against inciting [growth] considerably weaker than 3 percent And some of those quarterly figures that are already in the staff's projection are quite anemic What are various bits of economic information including, I suppose, the condition of the oil market, commodity markets, gold markets, and exchange rates telling us about that?  Finally, I think some discussion of how this all fits into a larger world setting is relevant The United States certainly has been propelling, I think almost single-handedly, the world expansion for the past two years There are not strong signs of self-propelling growth abroad that I can see at the moment Japan seems to be slowing down a bit from a relatively rapid rate of growth Europe seems to be talking about--with the help of a large amount of exports to the United States--a growth pattern probably barely sufficient to keep unemployment from rising further That means growth of maybe 2-1/2 percent But are we looking at prospects in the United States that in a sense remove a motor from world growth and what are the implications of that? Who's going to make it up, if anybody? If nobody is, what's the implication for policy? I think this inevitably gets involved with the exchange rate question because the strength of the dollar and the converse weakness of other currencies--particularly as that affects prices of imported raw materials, especially oil--and the inflationary impact it has in varying degrees in other countries is a factor in their own policy direction and policy mix and certainly is an inhibition on their monetary policy in terms of moving in an expansionary direction So, with all those questions on the table, let me open up the [discussion] Mr Morris    12/17-18/84  Are you unhappy about that?  You'd want to put a lot of emphasis on M1, I bet!  You're not thinking of radical differences in the ranges for next year?  Mr Corrigan  Governor Rice    12/17-18/84  Let me just be clear When you say you're comfortable with the forecast, that means you're comfortable with it as a forecast And is it also desirable?  No, I just wanted to be sure  When you say this level, I think maybe we ought to discount today's federal funds rate for the purpose of this discussion It's the last analysis, but--  "B," okay  We have it on equal footing right now  Two meetings ago we put it rather explicitly on equal footing  Well, you and Mr Corrigan started out by saying you were going to answer all my questions You haven't answered the international questions  Governor Martin  Governor Partee  Mrs Horn  Mr Black  Governor Wallich  With all this talk about getting the dollar lower and improving the trade balance, let me just introduce another complication If we don't have a big trade imbalance and a big capital inflow from abroad, how are we going to finance the budget deficit? Mr Forrestal  Mr Boehne  Governor Gramley  Mr Keehn  Have you prepared your swan song, Mr Solomon?  -50-    12/17-18/84  Mr Guffey  Mr Balles  Mr Boykin  Mr Garbarini  Ms Seger  I think we can have some coffee The preliminary indications we have for the following week on the money supply are for a negative figure, which does not make December look particularly high at this point Let's go have some coffee  [Coffee break]  If I may, I will make some preliminary comments in reaction to the go-around this morning Really, I just have two One is that I heard a lot of talk about getting the dollar down and there was a certain amount of talk that that may not be the easiest thing to do It worries me a little to talk too casually about getting the dollar down, and I do think that we may have more difficulties in the future than we have now with the dollar beginning to go down too fast We have this basic dilemma of how to get the budget financed, and we're going to have a big current account deficit no matter what happens for the next 12 months Maybe to put it too starkly, if we have a lack of confidence in the dollar, we're going to have a real picnic in maintaining a decent level of interest rates or a degree of confidence in the inflation outlook in the next year I do think we have a problem internationally and much of it is of our own making; and we have the disequilibrium in the budget Perhaps the best thing that can happen is along the lines of what Ms Seger has suggested If there is a tendency for the dollar to decline, I suspect that other countries will ease; and given that they have enough room to ease, that might be healthy not only in their own context but if they expand a little more and have a little more confidence in their own currencies, that might over a period of time help to relieve the pressure on our trade position through greater expansion abroad and the dollar may come down in a healthier atmosphere I simply am a bit sensitive to saying that it's an objective of policy to get the dollar down regardless; I don't think that puts us in a very good posture I have no problem at all with the view--and in fact I strongly believe--that the strength in the  -57-    12/17-18/84  dollar gives us room to ease, all other things equal And that ought to be a factor in our considerations In listening to most people, I get the feeling there's more concern that growth will turn out a little less than the staff has projected than a little more Combine that with a view that it would not be totally satisfactory even if growth ended up precisely where the staff projected it, and it seems to me that gives you a bias toward some degree of further easing  We've spent a long time discussing all these general problems this morning Let me try to shorten the process now and see whether I'm successful in that by suggesting something like alternative B so far as those numbers are concerned But I certainly wouldn't mind rounding them off, given a healthy skepticism as to whether we're going to meet any of these numbers anyway and how precisely we're going to meet them Consistent with that--or maybe inconsistent with it as now written but I will assert consistent with that, particularly if we're willing to see some greater growth than what we provide for here, which I assume the directive will say--I would ease the pressures on reserve positions to the point of almost no pressure Borrowing would be, let's say, on the order of $250 million And I'd be inclined to put down a federal funds rate range [of 6 to 10 percent, which is] consistent with alternative A, since the current rate is about halfway in between [the "A" and "B" ranges] now and I'm not sure I'd want to contemplate the rate going up to 11 percent In terms of the directive, without getting into the precise language, I'm assuming some sentence along the lines of what we have in there now to the effect that because of the shortfalls we've had, more rapid growth in M1--or we could say somewhat more rapid growth in the aggregates generally--would be acceptable, particularly in the absence of evidence of a strong rebound in economic activity and in view of the strength of the dollar in the exchange markets It would say something to the effect that we would accept more rapid [monetary] growth unless we saw the economy moving ahead more strongly-- distinctly more strongly--than the projections suggest now, as long as the dollar remains reasonably strong in the exchange markets So, in general terms, that would be a proposal to shoot at  Well, I was thinking of rounding at least the M1 figure to 7 percent  It's "B" on the monetary specifications  I am asserting, based upon lengthy economic analysis and a presumed shortfall in December, that we've got to go with less pressures [on reserve positions] in order to even meet "B "  Well, of course, that would depend upon where the discount rate was  My own guess--and other people tell me I'm wrong--is that it probably would be hanging around a little less than 8-1/2 percent  My argument is very simple We've had a constant shortfall all through the fall; we've consistently missed the relationship And I didn't detect any ebullience about the economy in listening to the discussion around the table, and people would rather see it grow a bit faster than the projection rather than slower  I think we've got to look at reserve growth at some point; we probably didn't look at it enough during the fall, as we were constrained by a borrowing number And this is, in effect, a reflection of it You reduce the borrowing in view of the fact that there hasn't been reserve growth or you run out of [room to reduce borrowing] and I think at some point you just put in more  -59-    12/17-18/84  reserves If you don't, you run into this problem of things falling away  I suppose one can argue that in earlier days it would have gone into M1 and given us a good boost in M1 I don't think the most recent business news was so awful obviously in the last month but it has been pretty sluggish for some time  Well, in fact, Commerce doesn't know what the fourth quarter will be, whatever number comes out tomorrow  I don't see anything very major here but it's a matter of taste, I suppose  -61-    12/17-18/84  Just arithmetically, I guess what that implies is 4 percent growth in December and 8 percent in the other three months  Yes, but if you get 4 percent in one month and 8 percent in three months, you get 28; that divided by 4 is 7  Mr Boehne, I see you on the list in lonely splendor  Mr Balles  Mr Corrigan  -64-    12/17-18/84  Isn't it in there already?  It's put differently, but I think it's in there  Well, I guess we do have an "international financial market conditions"--  That was what I was thinking of We had a very explicit reference in the [announcement of the latest reduction in the] discount rate But, it's a matter of debate I would phrase it in a way that to me is unfrightening--say, that we might ease further if there is continuing strength in the exchange rate It wouldn't say we're pushing the exchange rate down  That seems to me an excessive description of the $50 million difference  Well, I'll tell you something that isn't perfectly clear to me that there is a difference between $300 and $250 million, whether the discount rate is reduced or not The Board of Governors is going to have to decide about the discount rate We had several applications in and, as you know, some were [submitted] with some vigor I don't know how many minds were persuaded on the Board of Governors I would suggest that it isn't going to be very critical It's not very critical in my mind, whichever way it goes  Well, what happened when you went in to drain some reserves?  Since we're totally preoccupied with this question, why don't we find out?  Who else would like to say something? Ms Seger  I haven't heard one way or another  What are you looking at?  Neither am I Is anybody else going to fight about it?  Use "significantly"?  I think if we say current information or information for current outlays and take out "plans"--    12/17-18/84  Let's take out the "spending plans"  Permits are, in fact, above starts  Mr Boykin  Would anybody else like to contribute to this? Mr Guffey  Is there any reason to believe the change in seasonals would add as much as 2 percent?  Governor Wallich  Governor Rice  Mrs Horn, we haven't heard from you  Let's look at the language a bit--going back from whether or not the borrowing proposal is supported What about the federal funds range? It seems to me that where the rate is now makes it reasonable to say 6 to 10 percent, but I don't know whether everybody else agrees Nobody else commented on it, I guess  SEVERAL I would support it  Well, let's assume it's going to be 6 to 10 percent Now, let me start with some language Mr Axilrod gave me here I suppose what we need is "In the implementation of policy in the short run, the Committee seeks to reduce somewhat" I think that encompasses everybody To say "maintain existing" may be a little confusing, given the last statistics that came out  -71-    12/17-18/84  I would note that all these concerns I've heard about declining interest rates for the last three months and not getting the borrowing level too low have been accompanied by a decline in reserves and M1  Yes, I'm not sure that's very clear I agree that technically meets the problem, but the markets are sitting there looking at not much more than $250 million in borrowing in the previous two-week period, right?  And they may be looking at something like that again when this comes out, but it doesn't come out for a while They'd say "Reduce from $250 million?"  Well, I'm wondering whether that kind of language wouldn't be less misleading somehow "The Committee seeks to maintain the recently reduced pressures on"  Theoretically, tomorrow--but who knows about these theories--there's going to be a lot of borrowing and the funds rate is going to be 9 percent or 10 percent maybe at 300 in the afternoon In fact, the funds rate is going to be 18 percent and [a major bank] is going to come in and borrow $2 billion because the funds rate is 18 percent! Now, there may be a miss here in the figures, so I think this is just a question that's--  It doesn't make that much difference probably, but--  Well, [the problem] is the previous two- week period or one-week period  "Seeks to maintain minimal pressures on reserve positions"  Well, we'll leave it "reduce somewhat pressures on reserve positions" Then, "This action is expected to be consistent with growth of M1"--what are we going to put in here? Mr Axilrod wrote in 7, 9, and 9 percent; we could use 7, 8-1/2, and 8-1/2 percent or 6-1/2, 8-1/2, and 8-1/2 percent What's your pleasure?  Well, let's leave that open for the moment Let us try this next sentence I'm just going to read what Mr Axilrod has written down "Somewhat more rapid growth of M1 would be acceptable" Do you just want to say M1 and not the others?  I'm tempted to say "Somewhat more rapid growth of the monetary aggregates would be acceptable in light of the currently estimated shortfall in growth for the fourth quarter"-- No, this is only M1  "relative to the Committee's expectations at the beginning of the period, particularly in the absence of evidence of a strong rebound in the economy and in view of the strength of the dollar in exchange markets" It would be more parallel if we said "particularly in the absence of evidence of continued strength and-- It's the reverse; it's not the absence of the strength  Yes, that would make it parallel all right How can we make this more parallel?  "Continues weak" isn't exactly right in terms of the latest figures, which aren't all that weak  "Particularly with evidence of continued sluggishness" or something like that  -75-    12/17-18/84  "Particularly should evidence continue of sluggish economic growth and strength of the dollar in exchange markets" Now, that raises the Corrigan question  I agree it sounds that way I don't know whether that's so bad It sounds like precisely the opposite concern of Mr Corrigan You can't have it both ways; you can't object on both grounds  Yes, that's right  Well, I think the question remains whether we need either of the next sentences  Well, I don't know how you put it in  -76-    12/17-18/84  I'm not saying this wording we have is great, but I don't know why we need either of the next two sentences when I look at them  We'd say "Somewhat more rapid growth of M1"--or the monetary aggregates, which in this case doesn't change anything else--"would be acceptable in light of the currently estimated shortfall in growth for the fourth quarter relative to the Committee's expectations at the beginning of the period, particularly should evidence continue of sluggish economic growth and strength of the dollar in exchange markets" It isn't the most felicitous wording, in terms of reading it  It's hard to get lesser restraint on reserve positions The second sentence, the "greater restraint" sentence, doesn't bother me; it's the previous one that just seems a little peculiar depending on how low we go [on borrowing] We can't do much less restraint  What are you suggesting here? That's correct You haven't solved the next one Mr Axilrod has suggested that we combine the first two sentences Go back to "In the implementation of policy in the short run, the Committee seeks to reduce pressures on reserve positions consistent with growth" etc That says, whatever figure we stick in there, we can go further if the growth isn't up to it We haven't got much further to go And we don't need either of the [next two sentences] Well, we could leave in the greater restraint sentence We certainly don't need the sentence on lesser restraint; we've already said that  I can give you simpler wording for this "Somewhat more rapid growth would be acceptable in the light of, provided economic growth remains sluggish and the dollar remains strong in the exchange markets We wouldn't tolerate the excessive monetary expansion if the dollar were weak in the exchange markets  No you can't, I don't think  Where are you? "Particularly if" or "particularly in the context of continued sluggish growth in economic activity and strength of the dollar in exchange markets" I'm not sure that this fourth-quarter preliminary flash on the GNP is going to look all that sluggish I don't know what you consider sluggish  Well, suppose we said "particularly in the context of sluggish growth in economic activity and continued strength of the dollar in exchange markets"  Maintaining present levels or higher  I don't think they would draw that conclusion in the sentence talking about more rapid growth of M1 than what we've--  Well, do we leave out the next sentence? What do we do with Mr Axilrod's suggestion "seeks to reduce pressures on reserve positions consistent with" That would become more relevant maybe, depending upon the borrowing number we put in here I must say, as I said before, my range of tolerance between $250 and $300 million is immense  It depends upon what we do with the discount rate But I think that is a dangerous thing to get hung up on This Committee has been hung up on that for three months and has not eased as fast as it should have in terms of reserve growth and Ml  I'm suggesting that I could go anyplace between the two I thought we attracted a great consensus on some number between those two, which would not bother me  $275 million wouldn't bother me  That's fine with me, too  I think this whole [paragraph] implies that if things remain sluggish, we will go down below that; I don't think there's anything that doesn't say that  SPEAKER(?) That's right  I don't think I'm indicating that we can come within $50 million when we're aiming there anyway  SPEAKER(?) Look, I'm not really from a world--  Well, we had in mind--on the order of a suggestion--$300 million or lower to start with and we make the errors on the lower side  Collective error  Is that satisfactory?  -80-    12/17-18/84  MESSRS MARTIN and BOEHNE Yes  SPEAKER(?) To whom?  Me, sitting here trying to figure out what to do We're going to take more chances that it will be below $300 million than above  It would be nice to get a consensus; I'm striving for consensus  I'm not sure We're combining the first two sentences Do you understand that? We have the second sentence "particularly in the context of sluggish growth in economic activity and continued strength of the dollar in exchange markets" And we take out the next sentence; it's implied by the first sentence That next sentence could be left in or taken out; it doesn't bother me It says that if we really get a significant strengthening in economic activity and inflationary pressures and if money growth is rapid, we'd tighten up some That seems to me to be inoffensive, and I'd leave that in Is that the consensus?  And we put in 6 to 10 percent  And the borrowing level, as I now interpret it, is up to $300 million  I tell you the only difference between $250 and $300 million is a great big fat nuance to me  Because a lot of people--the majority-- want $250 million  Yes  -81-    12/17-18/84  fits And we have [Let's vote]  Up to $300 million  Okay, I guess we're finished  [Secretary's note At this point the group ate lunch in the Board room During lunch, the following exchange occurred]  I'm afraid we left one thing open at the Open Market Committee meeting We'll have to regather We talked about the precise numbers to put in but didn't pin them down The options were 7, 9, and 9 percent or 6-1/2, 8-1/2, and 8-1/2 percent I guess I was assuming 7, 9, and 9 percent when we were voting but if other people were not assuming that, we ought to reconsider it  Well, if that was the general assumption, we'll leave it at 7, 9, and 9  Okay  END OF MEETING  -82-       [Unintelligible], but certainly the sense was that we were talking in that kind of time frame and that if there were a pronounced tendency for the dollar to strengthen, it should be combated in a more or less concerted way This would involve all the G-5 countries in one way or another in principle and might involve some other European countries as well So having in a sense agreed to that approach, I thought we'd better review it with the Committee before we went any further We haven't done anything but say we stand now prepared to do something All this would be in conjunction with the Treasury, as we have been operating, should the dollar strengthen appreciably this afternoon On Monday the New York market will be closed, so this probably won't be operational for us on Monday unless there are some fringe markets But on Tuesday or Wednesday, let's say, if the dollar strengthened appreciably, we would be prepared to operate potentially--not necessarily, but potentially--in greater size than we have operated for some time There is no precise indication of size but I mention that because we've tended to do little dribbles when we have [intervened] recently and this might be a bit more than a little dribble if the need were such  I don't think there's any need for any operational decision in terms of directives or limits We have adequate limits of various sorts for the moment I don't think it's inconceivable that we would run through some of these limits if the dollar were really strong, but we're not in any imminent danger of doing that That, of course, would be a point for further review I don't know whether Mr Cross or Mr Truman have those limits more closely in mind They might run through those for us; and Mr Cross in any event can give us a little summary of what has been happening in the exchange markets recently Why don't we start with the limits? Do Mr Truman or Mr Cross have them more firmly in mind?  Go ahead, Sam We probably don't have New York [on the line]  SPEAKER(?) Who do we have on this call?  Do we have anybody else?  Where have you been?  The significance of this phrase that Mr Cross used about being helpful--I don't remember the exact words, but the Williamsburg Communique said something to the effect that we were all prepared to intervene when it was mutually agreed that it would be helpful That is a nice diplomatic formulation of saying one will intervene when everybody agrees And that's the wording that was used to some degree yesterday I guess the conclusion yesterday was that it was a mutual agreement that it might [not] be helpful if the dollar strengthened appreciably at this point So, that's where we are And if it's strengthening enough now it may become operational today  Well, there was some discussion of that and I think it was in this context that if you could imagine a pound problem really insulated from this and not accompanied by the general strengthening of the dollar, this doesn't apply  In that particular circumstance, I think it's fair to say that it was not thought to be likely One could envisage a situation in which the pound was weaker than the others fairly easily, but there is a general movement that leaves a little haziness around it But it's not operational so far as we're concerned Now, the British might want to do something specifically directed at sterling  The amount of sterling intervention we have done that has not been part of a swap arrangement or something like that is nil, or close to nil, historically The general thought here is that, if and when we operate, it would be unlikely to be in sterling alone It would more likely be in the mark alone than in sterling alone But it might well be in both or in mark, sterling, and yen  I don't know whether you heard it, but the question was rather quietly put by Governor Rice Why not in sterling alone? I don't exclude it entirely on any particular day We're a little chary of getting into the business of wanting to support sterling specifically  Well, I think in one sense that is true But it raises the question of sterling weakness rather than dollar strength; we have intervened in the mark or the yen on the basis of those being the other two leading world currencies and we're dealing with the general relationship of European currencies to the dollar When one is dealing in sterling I don't think it has that implication, and I'm not sure we want to foster an implication that we are particularly concerned with a sterling support operation as opposed to a more general problem  You have to understand about all these figures that we're in this with the Treasury, so any buying that we do for our own account is multiplied by two in terms of what we do in the market  Yes If the market pressures got strong enough-- Let me put it this way I hope that we don't do an operation doomed to be ineffectual by its niggardly nature, which is what we've been doing recently So, while I don't particularly expect it, I don't consider it inconceivable that we might end up with an amount of currencies that would involve raising the question of changing some of these informal limits  "Concerted" not "concentrated"  But we all will be intervening in our own markets, so the amount and timing of any intervention wouldn't be simultaneous necessarily It could be simultaneous when the [hours of operation of the] markets overlap, but there was a clear understanding that if the development of the strength in the dollar was pronounced in Europe, they would intervene We wouldn't do anything if it's in the European market; we both might be intervening if both markets were open Let's take today, for example the European markets are now closed and ours is open We would be intervening alone today simply because we are the market in which the dollar's strength developed But it's against this clear background that they would pick it up if it continued strong on Monday in Europe They wouldn't do anything in Europe if the dollar weakened And as I said, there's no specific time limit on this operation, but nobody is talking about a commitment here for months Basically, we're talking in the context of the next week; and then we'll see what happens  Neither I think everybody would be relatively content, or more than relatively content, if the net result with intervention or without intervention was that the dollar ended up somewhat lower than it has been But we were quite clear that we did not want to make this operation an overt "drive-the-dollar-down operation"--that it was US policy to get the dollar down and that we were going to drive it down by pushing on a declining dollar operationally People certainly would be happy about not seeing the dollar go up, and they will intervene as it goes up, but there is no fixed target If the strength is great enough, it will go up; and I'm sure there is a hope that [unintelligible] First of all, there is a hope that maybe with the announcement and with normal market developments it won't go up at all and that maybe there won't be any intervention If there is, I'm sure there is some hope that the display of the announcement and the intervention will result in the dollar not going up But there's nothing magic about a particular number  In the absence of other comments, I will assume that there is no pronounced objection I don't think we have to--though we may well want to--put in the record that we had this consultation It's perfectly natural, considering the decisions that were taken [by the G-5] But I don't think we're going to make any decisions, because I think it is all in accordance with our operating directive and so forth  While I have you all, if anybody has any comments or burning questions about the domestic scene or operations you can make a comment or raise a question Operationally, of course, with all the fluctuations and misses and near misses that we have had, we're operating basically the same as we did when we came out of the Open Market Committee meeting, however many weeks ago that was You know what the money supply figures are; they're stronger than anticipated by and large But at least so far as M1 is concerned I think at this point it is clearly stronger but not extremely stronger; M2 and M3 are strong As for the economy, some of the economic news is on the firmer side and you all know that I don't know what other comments I ought to make Hearing none from you, I will call the proceeding to an end Thank you all  END OF SESSION     If we can come to order, the first item of business is electing the Vice Chairman  That second came awfully quickly! Are there any objections? I haven't heard any, so Mr Corrigan is duly elected and the Secretary will so record We have to approve the minutes  Without objection Why are the reports on foreign currency and domestic open market operations separated [on the agenda]? We will go to foreign currency operations first, anyway Are you prepared to report on domestic open market operations, Mr Sternlight?  Well, we'll go to Mr Cross first and you second  Any discussion?  [Unintelligible] go about intervention in the least effective way--in fact, I would say a counterproductive way You can follow up on--  Are you answering that question, Mr Cross?  There are several cooks in this broth and some are from rather provincial provinces  Well, we don't operate unilaterally Neither does the Treasury  I don't think we're bound by that, particularly Obviously, we haven't been acting effectively at all--  --in the burst of the last couple of days But I wouldn't say minds couldn't change [if] this [dollar] movement gets pretty strong But I think it had better get strong enough so that-- I personally am sick and tired of doing ineffectual things I want to be effectual, or at least have a chance of being effectual  They have done very little intervention  At one point they put their interest rates up 4 percentage points Do you consider that a strong action in the space of about 3 days?  Up another 4 points? They may not be prepared  I can see the essay now "In Defense of Ineffectiveness"  I will accept that You just gave the rationale for what we've been doing We have to go through this period of ineffectiveness Would you like to ratify these ineffective transactions?  SPEAKER(?) So moved  SPEAKER(?) Second  Without objection Mr Sternlight  How much of [the $6 billion leeway authorized for the intermeeting period] did you use?  Any comments?  Either one  Unless we increase borrowings  [Unintelligible]  Any other comments?  This is not a complete answer, but the domestic operation is very inflexible They operate--  It's a good question But [in the domestic market, generally] we operate at 1130 to 1145 am Once we have made that decision [after the morning call], it's over It's a revolution if we operate at 230 in the afternoon because at that point if the market sees the funds rate going up, that raises questions about whether we're pegging the funds rate So, it's a perfectly reasonable question But the fact is that the opportunities --just on an operational basis--during the day to take account of [exchange market developments] are limited If we miss it because maybe the market wasn't acting that way at 1130 am, we've missed it Now, maybe that's not the way we should operate, but that is the way we do operate  We may also find out after the fact that it wasn't necessary to operate that day at all because the forecast has changed That's not unusual; I suppose there's a 50-50 chance of that  A very good question Are there any other comments? If not, do we have a motion on this [intermeeting] limit?  SPEAKER(?) So moved  Without objection We need to ratify these transactions  No objection Mr Kichline  MESSRS KICHLINE, PRELL and TRUMAN [Statements--see Appendix]  I'm puzzled here In July we projected a real GNP increase, 4th quarter to 4th quarter, of 3 to 3-1/4 percent?  Oh, for 1985! Well, now is the time to comment on the business and price situation Governor Wallich  Let me ask you a question following that question In terms of these projections, we center on 4 percent for prices this year, which is an increase in the rate of price increase from last year I get a little concerned about presenting price [projections] of an increasing rate of price increase--which show a great faith in Federal Reserve policy--particularly when it's not clear to me why that should be You have this decline in the dollar in your projection--I'm not talking about your projection; basically,    2/12-13/85  I'm talking about other peoples' projections--but I don't know whether people assumed a decline in the dollar Last time we used the convention that we would not; I think we assumed some general range of fluctuation within historical experience, which seems to me a reasonable convention It turned out to be a lot better, because the dollar was up, than if we'd assumed a depreciation The actual price results have been at the very lower edge of our projections And I wonder why we're so pessimistic on prices this coming year when the wage trend looks good, the dollar continues to appreciate, the profit margins have widened, as was suggested already, and the unemployment rate doesn't go down much One can argue about productivity; the staff doesn't have terribly buoyant productivity estimates and maybe everybody else is very low on productivity But I would like to hear why [people think] prices are going to be worse this year than last year  Your philosophy is to catch up to reality slowly  Apart from the decline in the dollar, I presume over a long period of time unit labor costs go up the same as prices  Not a lower profit There's no [change] in margins  I'm going to have a heck of a time explaining to the Congress that a number that goes up is really essentially the same or a little lower!  I'm not sure as far as third years of expansions are concerned, but I don't see where we get any increase I don't see why we don't have a decrease here, with what I see going on  I don't want to get the whole conversation going on this point I think you might look at it again in the light of an unchanged dollar assumption Not as much as a lot of other people, but we have been high on our inflation estimates before I don't know what prices are going to be, but there certainly will be a range of uncertainty Maybe they will go up The question is where the greater probability lies  Mr Balles  Mr Forrestal  Governor Martin  Mr Keehn  Didn't those figures you had the other day suggest something like 50 percent of the increase in equipment was imported this year?  That's the share of the total?  You had a chart that had absolute numbers where one could see the increase in imports and the increase in the total  Mr Corrigan  I am  --more worried as you talked! Governor Gramley  -15-    2/12-13/85  Sounds like one of the least likely forecasts--not that anybody has any better one  Mr Boehne  Miss Seger  Mr Morris  Mr Guffey  Mr Boykin  Is the price $25 now?  Mr Forrestal  Except in prices, where you're much higher according to the--  42 percent, that's it  36 percent in prices?  That's not what I have on this sheet, but I'll take it  Don't read any further; 36 percent, you said?  We'll take it  Mr Black  Governor Partee  -21-    2/12-13/85  Governor Wallich  In the interest of accuracy, the staff has it about the same as it was last year  Their projections probably have been reduced  Mrs Horn  What are those year-end figures?  On the other hand, I raised the question because new orders are down and housing is going no place on the latest numbers, and there are real questions about the commercial construction area Who knows? The auto figure looked good, as did the inventory reduction  When do the retail sales figures come out for January?  You could make a bold comment about them Mr Balles  If nobody else has anything to say, maybe we ought to have Mr Axilrod say something about these targets for next year  We went over the question of whether to rebase last month You're aware that that is one of the Administration's helpful proposals in its economic report and elsewhere I detected very little or no--I don't remember [any]-- sentiment for rebasing last time You've had another month or more to think about it Maybe we can dispose of that issue quickly, if you haven't changed your opinion And if you have, let me know  No, no  No, this change in--  Well, let me get to that as--  I'm going to get to that issue too  They're somewhat related, but let me see what--  I don't hear any sentiment for rebasing here  I think they used the fourth-quarter average But another question, which I have looked at myself at times in the past, is why we put all this emphasis on the fourth quarter instead of on a yearly average target That's another way to do it  Mr Balles, did you have some comment on this point?  Well, let me get to that in a minute I take it there is no sentiment to rebase In fact, I don't think that this is an intellectually stupid way to approach it It's a perfectly reasonable thing to do, but I don't think there's any more reason to rebase than not to rebase It depends upon whether, on the basis of the year's events, we're happier to start out one way rather than the other way, depending upon some kind of an analysis And that's the way I would explain it But the convention is not to rebase, so the  -26-    2/12-13/85  burden of proof is on changing it In this particular year, if we rebased M1 up I don't know what we'd do about M3 We'd have to rebase it way down and have a peculiar explanation The same is true for credit, I suppose, if we took that seriously  I'm getting around to it right now If I view the consensus accurately on the cones [it is not to] rebase  Well, on this issue of how we draw the picture I will declare my position I have never liked cones I went on a little campaign a couple of years ago when the staff had palsy in that they couldn't write these things without making a cone But, one part of the substance, anyway--in fairness, I don't think it's all that the Council [of Economic Advisers] had in mind--is whether we are disturbed that we are above the cone now Now, this gets into the short-run policy decision a little as well as the longer-run But I think--  Well, I'm not quite asking that I'm asking Are you so unhappy that it's not so slow, having started in December above that cone as part of the low base, that you thought it was important to get it back in the cone in January or February? Now, I would just assert "no" But that's certainly an interpretation; I don't know what the Committee thinks  Technically, it is literally true that the way The Wall Street Journal depicts the picture, they can write that for the week of December 31st we were below the midpoint of the money supply target and that for the week of January 7th--without any change in the money supply--we were above target I don't think that makes a lot of sense, but--  -27-    2/12-13/85  This is literally drawing pictures, but pictures affect things I don't know how we want to draw this One way that appeals to me, but it's a really special case because I think it's more substantive-- If we just draw parallel lines, we have to ask ourselves the question Would we be particularly happy--right now starting off in the upper part of the parallel lines--to go down to the bottom part, which is way below the cone?  It would be quite a precipitous drop And I would argue--I think as a matter of substance, recognizing that all pictures aren't perfect--that we could just draw parallel lines and say this is the way it looks with parallel lines We could draw parallel lines and a cone That's one way of handling this; we've done that once We also drew a skewed one once I think it has some meaning to say that we have the points in the fourth quarter of this year, which are established by the basic target, whatever that is We started out above the cone because it was coming up, largely in January but in December too We probably don't contemplate--or wouldn't be really happy based upon anything we know now--going below that lower line in the cone And we could draw a line up from that point in the fourth quarter back to the upper part of the range in the fourth quarter of this year The result would be a truncated cone; I think that would be the mathematical expression And it would be, I think, a substantive portrayal of the area in which we might like to be But it's just one way of drawing the picture  Draw a line from the fourth-quarter target of this year to the fourth-quarter target of next year That's a line  If you do it that way, the bottom lines are the same as the cone Well, look at M2 here It does not look very different from that; that top dotted line there would be a little higher  At the beginning, yes  You're ending up in the fourth quarter just where you would end up anyway  Well, not at the end of the year I would start it in November  I'm not going to call it anything I would describe it to the [Congressional] Committee as a reasonable picture of the general zone in which we'd like to be as the year progresses  Actually, I think I drew a picture like this once without consulting this Committee I was probably using it in testimony  I don't think it's--  I think it recognizes that we wouldn't draw it that way unless we wanted to convey a notion that we were relaxed about being above this cone for a few months, or for the first half of the year or something  The other way I think it depends upon the substantive decision as to what kind of policy we want to--  -29-    2/12-13/85  For M2 we might just draw the parallel lines, I suppose  It's so close it makes practically no difference For M3, I don't know what you want to do We can draw parallel lines, I guess, and a cone Mr Sternlight, I have a note indicating that you wanted to talk  I don't think we have to decide just at the moment, but we have to talk about it and decide when we come to the decision on what the targets should be precisely and what to say in the directive We can just do it One way of finessing this, which we did once, is to draw the parallel lines and the cone--which is what the staff has there  Yes Well, we could just draw the parallel lines  I'm pretty [easy-going] about all this It doesn't--  The Wall Street Journal won't know what to put in their article! They'll have to reprogram it  It's not a mathematical equation; it's a pragmatic line  Besides, it's probably not just a truncated cone but--  -30-    2/12-13/85  A skewed truncated cone, with different slopes on both sides  There's also the question of what weight to put on M1 But it's getting late I don't know whether there is some spontaneous consensus on the range itself We can decide it tomorrow morning unless a spontaneous consensus emerges If I recall [our discussion at the December meeting] correctly--though nobody is bound, obviously, by what he or she said last time--in a vague way the predominant support was for alternative II but there was some support for something that would look at least partly like alternative I I don't think anybody was arguing for alternative III, although somebody may have said that the ranges should be tightened I don't know; I don't remember that closely Nobody is bound by that anyway We'll narrow it down anyway Is something less than alternative II in the ballpark?  I wouldn't--  But we're going to shape the economy anyway  Well, this may be a little side issue It didn't last year and maybe the year before; I don't remember But I was a little struck too when somebody--Mr Axilrod, I guess--said that, obviously, we can't lower that unless we're going to say something about all these mergers and so forth Why is the analysis so certain that what we have for nominal GNP growth--7 or 8 percent or whatever--is going to produce 11 or 12 percent debt growth when that's out of keeping with 90 percent of history? It is not last year's history, I agree; but what is the analytic background? Is it the deficit? Is it a high deficit that produces that? I don't know  What you're saying may be true; I'm not sure what it is--that the dollar of government deficit produces more debt than the dollar of private deficit?  That's one reason  Well, we're throwing out two questions to the staff now We'll get a response and go home Maybe it's--  That's 2-1/4 points  Just to clarify it in my mind What would your straightforward projection of debt be consistent with your whole model and whatever mergers and acquisitions you allowed for?  117 percent, which includes 1/2 point for mergers and acquisitions  But with a lower GNP  That's what you'd think might happen normally Well, let's stop for the evening unless somebody has something further they want to say  We were in the midst of discussing these long-range targets, but maybe we can interrupt that for Mr Kichline's report on the only new economic news we got overnight Why don't you insert that at this stage?  We were discussing what the long-range targets should be I think the conclusion has been reached not to rebase, though some imagination in drawing lines may be desirable We were on the subject of what the targets should be There was some expression that they ought to be the way they are in alternative II and some expression that at least M1 ought to be a 1/2 percentage point higher on the upper end There was one expression of that view Does anybody else have anything to say? Mr Rice  Refresh my memory, Mr Axilrod Do your technical gnomes think that M3 is [more] likely to run high relative to its range than M2?  Mr Corrigan  Governor Martin  I don't know what historians we have here How much have we changed these ranges? Do we never change them? We [unintelligible]--  I think we have, but not very frequently  -37-    2/12-13/85  Governor Partee  Velocity went up 4 percent last year Mr Black  Mr Forrestal  Anybody else have any comments?  Mr Boehne  We changed M1 only once?  Mr Keehn  Mr Wallich  Mr Guffey  Mr Balles  Mr Garbarini  Miss Seger  Mr Boykin  Governor Gramley  -42-    2/12-13/85  Mr Morris  Mr Gainor  There's a tremendous unanimity among nonmembers  I think we get into this problem partly because I suspect the inflation forecast is too high--not to beat a dead horse anymore There's room for real growth under any of the alternatives in here [if we had] more modest inflation assumptions The choice boils down to this I'm not going to make everybody happy; we have four targets here and 12 members and the permutations and combinations of that grouping are enormous The only proposal I can make is to stick with something like alternative II; I don't know how many people that would make directly happy Most people have been focusing on M1, so we can talk about modifying some of those other ranges if that's important But I would also say that we ought to give the message--we do that in the short-term targets, I suppose-- that we don't mind being above that cone for the time being I would be inclined, in the interest of reconciliation if nothing else, and it  -43-    2/12-13/85  may be meaningful, to put a sentence in the directive indicating that we wouldn't necessarily be unhappy if growth were in the upper part of the range I don't like the sentence that's there now; and I don't know why we should single out M1 given all the comments either I'd have a sentence to the effect that "The Committee agreed that growth in the monetary aggregates more generally in the upper parts of their ranges for 1985 may be appropriate, depending upon" something One approach would be to use "provided inflationary tendencies remain subdued" But I might say something about business too I don't know quite what we should say I don't think we want to say "would be appropriate provided business is weak" That sounds a little odd It's the fact of the matter, but it might suggest we're anticipating something in that connection  Let me just try this We have a majority that wants something like alternative II; it's not a very large majority but some of those said they didn't want to put in anything about being in the upper part of the range The obvious accommodation is something like alternative II but some acknowledgment that growth in the upper part of the range might be possible I wouldn't put it as an aim; I'd say it might be appropriate under certain conditions An alternative, as has been expressed, is to go to something like 4 to 7-1/2 percent and not say anything about being in the upper part Let me try broadly those two alternatives We'll return to fine tuning M3 and credit later Looking at M1 Who would have a preference for leaving it at 4 to 7 percent but with some acknowledgment--the precise language to be determined--first of all, that running above the range now isn't horribly prejudging the short-term decision; and secondly, that we wouldn't be amazed and may well find it desirable to be in the upper part of the range, depending on how things develop? To have a specific acknowledgement of that is one alternative The other alternative would be just to go to 4 to 7-1/2 percent and leave it at that  Right now I'm contemplating putting it into writing  It could be done in the testimony, but what I'm proposing at the moment is that some sense of that be written into the directive  Well, I guess I want to concentrate on the members at the moment Who would prefer what?  Well, let's raise hands How many have a preference for the first? Five How many have a preference for the second? Five  Two things were presented to you I don't know what you like and [unintelligible] If you have another preference that commands more support, that's--  Well, let me go to the fine tuning What do people feel about M2 or M3 and total credit? I don't know that we really want to raise the range for total credit; it's already awfully high It may be exceeded I don't know what kind of messages we would be sending by raising the total credit figures at this point  I'm not sure of that reason, but he has me confused on it Does anybody want to raise that from 9 to 12 percent?  Above 9 to 12 percent All right, that's 9 to 12 percent On M3 you expressed that opinion Do other people want to raise the M3 range?  Then, nobody is bothered by raising it to 9-1/2 percent?  SEVERAL No  Yes Well, 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent or 6 to 9-1/2 percent  M2?  Well, we had 56 percent real growth last year and inflation at 35 percent with 52 percent M1 growth  I know it did That's why--  Who said it's going to go up 1 percent this year?  The trouble is we don't even know what the trend is  Well, I'm going to defer this vote until we do the short run Maybe that will put some light on what we should do Will you introduce the short run, Mr Axilrod?  Apart from the numerology here, I think as usual the decision at the moment is Do we want to tighten up, ease up, or leave policy unchanged in the immediate future?  Mr Boehne  Mr Boykin  Mr Black  Mr Balles  Mr Forrestal  Anybody else have anything to say?  Mr Garbarini  Miss Seger  Mr Guffey  Mr Keehn  -51-    2/12-13/85  Anybody else? Mr Gainor  Mr Morris, we're left without a comment from you  [Unintelligible] we've really had a different program for seasonal borrowing, we'd have to take account of it It's going to develop in the next five weeks  Well, in this case, we seem to have a great degree of unanimity about alternative B, whatever that means Let me interpret alternative B Borrowing is roughly around $300 million It has been running a little above $300 million, actually, so I would think alternative B is consistent with something like $300 to $400 million, depending upon the tone and feel of the markets, including the exchange market If the evidence accumulated in the next few weeks that we're distinctly above it, the tendency would be to tighten a bit  Yes, above these numbers for the aggregates But probably we would not move very aggressively at this point It sounds fine in concept If this happened coinciding with weak business news and a strong dollar, I would have some question about it At least at this point I would interpret this as not absolutely automatic if those two condition arose But the presumption would be in that direction The prospects of easing, I think, are substantially less in the sense that we would have to have slower growth in the aggregates than suggested in alternative B plus greater concerns about the business picture than have been expressed around this table That's what I would interpret alternative B to mean Does that differ widely from what anybody else thinks? I  -52-    2/12-13/85  attempted to incorporate this into a somewhat rewritten directive but I don't have any copies of that  You might take a look at it  Well, I rewrote the whole thing I gagged a little at saying "maintain" the degree of reserve pressure when it's something of a euphemism to say we have any reserve pressure at the moment  Well, I made it "maintain reserve conditions" Presumably, this would be--what do we have there 8 percent and 10-1/2 percent and 9-3/4 percent? Those are awfully precise fractions I doubt whether we generally put "3/4s" in there, do we?  I would be sorely tempted to say 10 percent for both of them, just to round them off  Technically, we could separate out the M1, M2, and M3 and say something like "Growth of M1 would be at an annual rate of around 8 percent, and growth of M2 and M3" etc  We could put in a sentence on the aggregates and say something like this "Should growth in M1 appear to be exceeding an annual rate of around 8 percent and M2 and M3 a rate of around 10 to 11 percent"  I don't know how we should describe this increase in reserve pressures I was looking for a word that said we weren't going to be terribly aggressive about it in the next five weeks Given the conditions, a "modest increase"--  "Some" isn't necessarily "modest" What word do we typically use? It's probably "some," isn't it?  Well, in a sense But I think "some" is probably what we use all the time when we've made big changes  We can't say "increases in conditions"  You're right I don't care for that  Well, it has been pointed out to me that the typical version uses "somewhat greater or somewhat lesser"  We could go with "modest" or "some modest"  That's more than "modest"  Well, that sounds like more to me I understand it won't be published until later, but that's what we always say  Well, if this is where we are, do we make that sentence "Should growth in M1 appear to be exceeding an annual rate of around 8 percent and M2 and M3 a rate of around 10 to 11 percent during the period from December to March, modest increases in reserve pressures will be sought, particularly" etc? And then say "lesser restraint on reserve positions would be acceptable" and keep the federal funds range at 6 to 10 percent Is that where we are? This does imply, unless I'm wrong, that we will remain above this cone  And in all cases, I guess  I think this implies that we would be above the upper limit But I will return to that in the longer-term decision I think this implies--and we might as well say it--that we expect to be above the upper limit of the cone in the early part of the year  Well, I think we should say it, if we have this kind of short-term directive I think I'd probably say it in testimony  Well, I worry about this in the testimony I don't know how to word it We haven't exactly tightened but in the process of stopping the ease we're a little snugger than we were I don't know quite what word to use to convey the nuance It's hardly a snug  Well, it's implied I take it we're ready to vote on this Then we'll have coffee  I must say just for the record, and I'm sure it's apparent to all of you, that the exchange market has more prominence in this directive than it has ever had It has been mentioned in recent [announcements of] discount rate changes, but-- Let's have coffee  [Coffee break]  Somehow I didn't get a great message from outer space as to how to resolve this long-range target while eating doughnuts I continue to believe that what comes the closest to capturing the central tendency is leaving the 4 to 7 percent We could raise M2 and M3--at least the upper ends--by a 1/2 point, if that makes people feel happier We would make some note that growth is going to be running above the cone I don't think we have to say that in the directive; I could say in the testimony that we're running ahead of the cone in the early part of the year and we expect that I think that's normal and reasonable under all conditions And we would have some reference, probably, in the directive that it might be acceptable to be in the upper part of the range, but make it short of saying we're aiming for that I don't think we have to say what we're aiming for, conclusively, 9 months from now We review it again at midyear If we really find that velocity is not right, then we may have to change the target in the middle of the year; we've had some experience in doing that But, meanwhile, we give a reasonable signal And it all comes against the background that I would like to give a little more confident view as to the inflation outlook, which I will for myself [in my testimony] Therefore, it makes all these numbers fit better  So, I will try again something like 4 to 7 percent, with a modifier in the directive, which we don't have precise language for  -57-    2/12-13/85  yet; I'm fairly indifferent on M2 and M3 but if it really makes people feel better to add another 1/2 point, I don't think that does us any grave damage one way or the other; total credit looks awfully high to me, but I guess we could leave it where it is Let's see whether we can proceed on that basis Let me ask a preliminary question A number of people said they would rather have 4 to 7-1/2 percent or 4 to 8 percent but they may or may not have wanted another 1/2 point on M2 and M3 Does it make any of those people happier to have another 1/2 on M2 and M3?  That's not what I asked  Well, I think the trouble with that is that it's probably contrary to where the probabilities lie The probabilities are that M2 and M3 are more likely to exceed [the upper ends of the ranges] than M1  Well, I don't know what it means for the middle of the year mathematically  There's no question it means less than 7 percent  About 6 percent?  Sure, it takes all three--  That is more, I would point out, than we had all of last year when the GNP was rising by 5-1/2 percent  I certainly think we should be above the cone in these early months Now, just how do we draw it? We can draw parallel lines; we can draw solid-line parallel lines and dotted-line cones; we can draw dotted-line or solid cones and dotted-line bands  We can draw the kind of thing that I drew, which is the way I tend to think of it It doesn't make much difference in where the line actually falls I'm open to any of those variants I'd draw the parallel lines without the cone, if that's--  For a good reason, though, I would say In this particular case, we ended up with a slowdown in M1 growth last year, so it's quite natural--it's a characteristic of the band--that we would also be happy with an extremely low growth in the first quarter, if you took it literally We're not going to get that, but with just the band itself M1 growth would still be within the band if we had zero growth, I suppose--or close to it--for this quarter  None of this changes the fact that what we're fixing is where we'd like to be at the end of the year Indeed, I don't think it makes an enormous difference whether it is 1/2 percentage point higher at the top; it's visual We're talking about $2-1/2 billion of money supply, right?  I have no problem with a band I assume that at the least we would draw a band along with the cone  -59-    2/12-13/85  Since there has been discussion about it, just for the purpose of elucidating how the two things look, at a minimum we would draw them both  Well, does anybody have some striking suggestion as to how to draw the picture that they urgently want to bring to our attention? Left to my own devices, I will draw some kind of a band--a lopsided band or something--along with the cone  It will be a little flatter than a parallel line, but hardly enough to be discernable  It would be 1 percent flatter; well, it would be 3/4 of a percent flatter And since we're not up there at the beginning anyway, it wouldn't make much difference The simplest thing to do is probably a compromise between them I might draw a truncated line--draw the cone with just a top parallel line  Well, I'm not saying that now We would just make it 3/4 of a percent different If you draw parallel lines, they would both rise at a 5-1/2 percent rate of speed  The bottom part of that would be out of sight; nobody wants to go there initially The only modification I had was that instead of a parallel line, I'd draw it back to the fourth quarter  [The fourth-quarter] target, which would be 3/4 of a point higher because we ended up below the midpoint  And that's all The only rationale is that I find it easy to explain I say that that was last year's target and we presumed we would have been satisfied to be there Assuming we were satisfied to be there, we want to have some continuity to the next year We know where we want to be at the end of this year, we decided where we wanted to be at the end of last year, and that's just a line that happens to connect those two targets that we happened to agree upon It's no big deal, and maybe it does--  You're looking at these early months since--  Well, we're not all that much within it, are we?  It would be 3/4 of a percentage point more within it than--  You're unquestionably right in direction; I just don't know how far it will go I'd have to look at it Where are these great pictures [in the Bluebook]?  That's the way I drew it before; that's right In the fourth quarter we're going to be 3/4 of a percentage point above the parallel line and it would get progressively less I don't know what it would be in the first quarter; I suppose 5/8ths of a percentage point or so  -61-    2/12-13/85  It won't be more comfortable in the fourth quarter  You come out the same place in the fourth quarter  That is correct It's 4-3/4 percent--  I think all these implications are the same Wherever you are in the first quarter, to meet the target at the end of the year growth has to slow down  Well, I think clearly [unintelligible]  Oh yes  I think we always reserve this right and we have done it Suppose it ended up that business is sluggish, inflation is doing fine, and the dollar is very strong, but liquidity preferences are high and money growth is running high We said money growth is expected to run high in the first quarter of the year; if at the middle of the year we say we don't think it's reasonable for it to go down, we have to raise the target What I would hope would happen is that inflation will be less, we will get nice orderly growth, that this trend appears in M1--which it may or may not--and that everything works out just copacetic Who knows? How much do you think the consumer price index is going to be affected by this orange and vegetable situation?  Just as a matter of curiosity, the same thing occurred to me--  How much of a bulge do you have in the food prices?  Are Japanese cars in the consumer price index?  I suspect that's right But suppose they take the quota off?  How big a car do they put in the consumer price index?  You're not the man But they don't price the expensive ones, do they?  I don't know what they call expensive  I'm afraid so  Well, I don't hear any bright ideas about how to draw these parallel lines If I don't hear any stronger ideas right now, I will reserve that prerogative unto myself with the understanding that there's going to be some kind of parallel line picture But I will go back and ask two questions Are those who want higher ranges at all consoled by making M2 and M3 higher? And are those who don't want higher numbers distressed by making M2 and M3 higher?  Well, let's look at the language Steve has given me a modified sentence I don't know whether you'll like it "The Committee agreed that growth in"--  It continues the first page Change the "M1" to "monetary aggregates" and otherwise the first part remains the same "The Committee agreed that growth of the monetary aggregates in the upper part of their ranges for 1985 may be appropriate, provided that inflationary pressures remain subdued and depending on velocity trends" If we use that kind of language, it just reads a little more smoothly to me to say "may be appropriate depending on velocity trends and provided that"  Well, I think that's broadly encompassed in this term "velocity trends" It may not be a trend, but in this context we're not really talking about it depending on long-term velocity trends; what we mean is depending upon velocity this year  One could say "depending on velocity developments"  Yes  "Depending on developments with respect to velocity and provided that inflationary pressures remain subdued" How do you like that language?  Well, I wouldn't say that in the directive But it would be said; it's implicit in the decision we have just made We're talking about a fourth-quarter target here and it sounds a little awkward--I don't object to it, but it seems to me totally unnecessary--to say here that consistent with that fourth- quarter target we intend to be above the cone in the first quarter  I think that point should be made; I just don't see that it's necessary here I have no objections to saying it here, but it just seems rather complicated to me  No, but I think I could say something about that in the testimony I don't think we should set a range and say we might be above it We might We haven't been within the ranges all that consistently, but it's rather peculiar to say that in the directive  I have no problem with saying "Obviously, we'll look at these at midyear; we expect to be above in the first half of the year and if velocity were really slow we'd have to look at this range again at midyear" I think we probably ought to say that What about M2 and M3? Let me examine the proposition this way I am assuming this language and-- Where are we on these three ranges? I found myself testifying the other day unable to remember what the ranges were At least psychologically that tells you something  What's the preference for [upper limits of] (a) 7, 8-1/2, and 9 percent, which is exactly the same as alternative II, as opposed to (b) 7, 9, and 9-1/2 percent?  You want the (b)?  -66-    2/12-13/85  Well, I didn't get around to asking the question!  I'm going to ask both Option (a) is alternative II as shown [in the Bluebook]; (b) is 1/2 percentage point higher for M2 and M3 How many prefer (a)?  Option (a) is alternative II  All of this has the language in the directive  Now, (b) with a 1/2 percentage point higher on the upper end of M2 and M3  Well, the in-between course is raising M3  I don't think that's 100 percent true  So, we use 7, 9, and 9-1/2 percent [as upper limits] and 9 to 12 percent [for credit], I guess Does that have the largest amount of support? It does raise a question in my mind If we raise those M2 and M3 limits, maybe we should go back to just talking about M1 in that sentence we just wrote  Yes, we could but it--  Your point estimate is what?  This actually makes M2 and M3 higher than we had them last year What were [the ranges for] last year? I don't guess there's any--  6 to 9 percent for both of them? So we can make M2 the same and M3 a little higher  Let's try that (b) 7, 9, and 9-1/2 percent; and 9 to 12 percent How many go along with that? Well, I think that's as close as we're going to come Let's vote on that  Well, we can, but we decided not to  Well, that is the reason in my mind for indicating that we might be happy in the upper part of the range, based upon what we know now All right Do you know what you're voting on?  SPEAKER(?) Not now  7, 9, and 9-1/2 percent upper limits [for M1, M2, and M3, respectively], 9 to 12 percent [for credit], and the sentence as we talked about it in the directive There's nothing else in the language that raises a question is there?  On the understanding that there will be something like a parallel line on the [unintelligible]  Okay  All right I guess we have nothing else to do The Secretary points out to me that we had better modify that sentence about retail sales registering a large increase in November and remaining at a higher level in December since it's no longer true The language he suggests is "Total retail sales rose moderately in January following a decline in December" With all that [unintelligible]  You have a chance to go back and redo your [Humphrey-Hawkins] projections if you do that within a day or two I won't register my concern about the price numbers, except that I'm reminding you that I registered it  Yes, I think the assumption would be stated as the value of the dollar will not be substantially changed I think what we said last time was that its value would not be outside the range-of trading in recent months or something like that We could have an 8 percent decline and not be outside that range  I really don't know The assumption for money at wherever you want to make it within that range, I guess  We can proceed to other things [and adjourn now]  END OF MEETING  -70-       Nominations closed!  None of that!  Are there any objections? I'm not hearing any We will proceed to the selection of staff officers Maybe the Secretary can read the roll of proposed staff officers  Without objection We need to select the Federal Reserve Bank for the execution of transactions for the System Account The New York Bank has performed this service for some years Do we have a motion?  We need a second  SPEAKER(?) Second    3/26/85  Without objection We need to select the Managers for Domestic and for Foreign Operations of the System Open Market Account Do I have a nomination for Mr Sternlight and Mr Cross?  Without objection You presumably have reviewed the current Foreign Currency Authorization, the Foreign Currency Directive, and the Procedural Instructions with respect to Foreign Currency Operations There are no changes [proposed] in any of these Are there any objections to continuing those? In the absence of any objections we will proceed  In the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations, we have a proposal to change the intermeeting limit Mr Sternlight, do you want to speak to that?  Any discussion?  Let's dispose of this limit first I take the silence to mean acquiescence We had better get a motion then  With no objection, it's approved Maybe we can wait [on the issued raised by Mr Keehn] until we get to the agenda item on domestic open market operations We need to approve the minutes  Without objection Mr Cross  All in all not much of a market  I'm not sure everybody interprets intervention as having that large an effect  We have to ratify the transactions  Without objection Mr Sternlight  Are there any comments on this general subject matter before we get to [the issued raised by] Mr Keehn?  If there are no other matters to raise for Mr Sternlight, we'll turn to Mr Keehn  The quid pro quo of your comment is that it is not appropriate?  We haven't added for some time, have we?  I don't see how we can't roll over the ones we have  There is more than the occasional investor not buying these things Every country banker you talk to says he is kicking them out In total they're not big enough to affect the market I think these agencies are anomalous institutions anyway, and I would just as soon we didn't hold any or buy any But we have a history [of doing so] My own feeling is similar to what Mr Keehn has expressed We would be in an awkward position if we ended up lending to them and buying [their obligations] in the open market at the same time If, say, we buy them now, that could be interpreted as support in a way that may or may not be desirable I think we have to support them if they get in trouble; but I'm not sure we should be treating their securities as the equivalent of government securities, which is what they would like us to do and which we did for awhile-- still do, I guess, in some sense Anyway, I guess we are doing what you are suggesting, Mr Keehn  I don't think we can reduce them in this particular year    3/26/85  I don't see how we can back away  I'm not sure it's running off all that much; some of that is seasonal  They were anticipating having to raise money from about now on, if I remember correctly They had a flat period or a slight decline that would be natural but it would go up seasonally Well, we have to ratify the transactions [Approved without objection] Mr Kichline  Well, it all sounded rather complicated I'm not sure of the message that emerged, but I'm sure that we are in a situation without any precedent in our lifetimes in many respects There is instability in exchange rates and domestic financial markets, a very high dollar, an enormous budget deficit, and an enormous and growing trade deficit Services are doing fine and the rest of the economy is not doing so well What do you make out of it?  Without concentrating on the precise growth paths and the precise monetary policy decision, how do you assess the situation generally in the economy and financial markets, and what are the broad implications?    3/26/85  Let me make a few comments, partly reinforced by going to a few board of directors meetings of various Federal Reserve Banks recently and hearing businessmen from the industrial sector of the economy talking I think there are quite different trends in the industrial sector and elsewhere in the economy But I don't think there is any doubt that the present trade picture and the prospects for the trade picture are having effects The question is whether it is cutting the legs off of any expansion in that area or worse We have seen the analysis We have seen the event in the past couple of years where a lot of domestic demand has gone abroad, perhaps most strikingly in the area of investment goods  -8-    3/26/85  I think the question now--and the answer is not fully ascertainable but there are some symptoms--is whether the level of the dollar and the competitiveness of foreign goods are cutting investment expenditures--not just the supply of investment spending but the willingness to invest at all Well, I mean "at all" as a relative term; let me say "at anything like the momentum that it had before" We have had a long series of production and orders figures that, with the exception of February which had some recovery, have been pretty flat I don't have the sense, and computer manufacturers don't seem to have the sense, that there is any great thrust anymore in that area of the economy that had been the strongest Now, that may be partly because supply conditions have increased but the indications are for less robustness there And, of course, in many other areas of heavier equipment there wasn't much recovery at all anyway In the commercial construction area that Governor Martin alluded to, the current figures are still going up strongly but it's hard to believe that they are going to go up indefinitely New single-family housing is doing all right and could continue to do all right; I don't know how much of an expansionary force it is going to be The mining and energy areas don't seem to be going anyplace, to put it kindly I don't think the farmers are going to be a great source of expansionary thrust in the economy in terms of what they buy So that's just reinforcing all the questions that already have been cited on the investment side  In the meanwhile, consumption so far is doing all right and service spending, of course, goes on I might mention automobiles, which are doing just fine, but I don't know whether there are any prospects for any increases there partly because if the demand increased, I don't think the manufacturers--many of whom are more [unintelligible]--want to either increase capacity or employment in that industry They have gone about as far they are going to go If there are going to be any more cars sold, my sense is that they are going to be imported So, while that's been a good area, it's not an area of great upward thrust I can't avoid having the feeling that the kind of forecast the staff has may be as reasonable as other forecasts, as we always say, but it looks to me like something within the limits of a ceiling It's hard to see where we can get more thrust out of the economy than they are projecting and I can see conditions arising, particularly on the import side, that might undercut the kind of forecast they have  On the inflation side, I think we also have a two-sided situation On the services side, prices tend to go up with some momentum, and I'm not sure that's going to change I'm sure it's not going to change much in the short run; it may be getting a little better but it's not suddenly going to turn toward stability Prices on the goods side of the economy are basically flat So, it's a little hard to see in these circumstances--and I'm assuming no major changes in monetary policy, fiscal policy, the dollar, and foreign developments--any great break-out there Of course, we have the background of the financial strains that have been mentioned I'll at least stop there and you can all shoot at that analysis Mr Boehne  Mr Black  Governor Partee  Governor Gramley  Governor Rice  -12-    3/26/85  Mr Stern has a special burden to say something fresh and insightful!  Mr Forrestal  That is an artificial statistic that is virtually meaningless--not economics  So people look at it It's not reflected in any other inflation figures  You might just address yourself to that figure, Mr Kichline I don't think you mentioned it I hope your conclusion is similar to mine  We have virtually no increase in producer prices this quarter, apparently a moderately low increase in consumer prices, and the fixed-weight index declined or actually, I guess, stayed the same I don't think you should worry too much about the GNP deflator  We're expecting a higher real number and they say that real is going to be too low Maybe it will be, but when you look at the assumptions they have made to put that figure together you're not automatically led to that conclusion They assume that the trade balance will diminish from the January figure to a not very high level All that has to happen is to have a higher trade balance If it ran at the January level, that's going to knock off half the GNP growth that they have They have no cutback in inventory accumulation; in fact, they have a slight increase from the January level, if I remember These are figures they don't know at all and nobody knows at all But just glancing at it and making some judgment, I don't think you can argue that the assumptions they have made are wildly on the down side If I were making those assumptions, I would make them the other way We just don't know what the trade balance is and [whether] production is flat or down  Mr Corrigan  Mr Balles  Mr Morris  They're all run by good conservative Yankees!  They used to be anyway  I suggest to you that imports are a great antidote to animal spirits  Mr Keehn  Mr Boykin  Governor Martin  I just note that prices of plywood have declined by 10 to 15 percent in the last two months to the lowest point since the [unintelligible] of the recession Lumber prices are not doing a lot better than that  That reflects part of the import situation; no doubt about that  Mrs Horn  What are those long-term favorable aspects?  Mr Garbarini  Ms Seger  Mr Guffey  I think we can go help the farmers by eating a doughnut or two!  [Coffee break]  I detected a consensus on only one point We're in a very difficult set of circumstances I haven't heard anybody arguing for very bold moves in any direction They may be justified, but I don't detect that we're in the mood to act on that Given that we're in a very narrow sector, I'm not sure that what we do here is going to have major implications for the course of events in the next few months We'll see what happens We didn't talk much about all the contingencies that could happen later in the year, mainly revolving around the dollar and the budget Nobody knows If the dollar goes up much more, our dilemmas will be aggravated If it comes down sharply, we'll have a different set of dilemmas but maybe a clearer set A very steep drop in the dollar would give us, I think, some sense of the outlook turning more favorable over time, though maybe not immediately, but it also potentially could give us some inflationary problems But I don't see what we can do to deal with that now I don't think there is much we can do either about all this fragility in the short run [save] in some sense not aggravating it I do think we are getting a very rapid growth in debt but I'm not sure we can do much about that either I think that reflects some of the underlying imbalances in the economy In the natural course of events it seems to me [appropriate] to remain somewhere around alternative B We did have this fact that has been alluded to that borrowings have run consistently above what we started out to maintain, anyway--I suppose technically in part because excess reserves kept running above what we had assumed they would run If one were starting with a notion of "unchanged" one has to define what "unchanged" is--whether it means borrowings or net borrowed reserves Presumably we have been using borrowings recently I must say that I think an overt tightening step at this stage--given the uncertainties in the business picture, the height of the dollar, and the financial markets--could turn out to rank as one of the more unfortunate bits of timing in our history That's about where I am  Suppose those two doctrines are inconsistent?  I didn't say that  I suppose you could say by tightening that you mean reserve positions; that's what I mean  -27-    3/26/85  The latest very fragmentary numbers suggest that March might be just a touch higher than estimated I don't think enough--well, we just don't know what it is It could change from week-to-week It's not enough to make a significant difference  It depends upon the environment in which we're operating We don't have to slow it down  Nobody knows Although I guess that is the best econometric estimate--not quite perpetuating itself but that it is consistent with "B"  The borrowings have been running higher, that's for sure  -28-    3/26/85  When we have borrowings this low--and we had a couple of days when some big banks borrowed a large amount for what might kindly be called technical reasons--  They mismanaged their reserve positions And when we're operating with borrowings in this range, a big lump is enough to affect the weekly average One of them was $15 billion or something like that, I think, in one day For a two-week period that's $100 million--and for a one-week period, $200 million--on the average And it kind of comes out of the blue; the market wasn't all that tight but they--  Mr Boehne  Governor Martin  Mr Keehn  The staff did revise the forecast downward a little  It looks like we're doing something wrong Mr Morris  Mr Black  Mr Stern  Mr Balles  Mr Forrestal  Mr Corrigan  Governor Gramley  Governor Seger  Well, that isn't exactly my understanding I think we tried to explain that in a memo a couple of meetings ago  We ended up with more borrowings than we intended, more excess reserves than were assumed, and we had somewhat higher interest rates than one might have guessed But the Committee isn't operating on an interest rate target If we wanted to operate on an interest rate target, we would; that's a decision the Committee could make  There's a certain temptation--  Mr Garbarini  -34-    3/26/85  Governor Partee  On the funds rate range?  Mr Boykin  Who else do we have here?  No  Mr Guffey  -35-    3/26/85  Are you getting any demand for that?  Well, either one  It's lower than normal  Well, two left [to speak] Mrs Horn  Governor Wallich  Well, we have a great desire for "B" if people know what "B" means Just in terms of the numerology a number of people have said 6 percent [for M1 growth], and I would declare a victory for 6 percent on the simple basis that it's a round number  It's a wonderful 6, 7, and 8 percent, and it will have no discernible effect on what we do! Now, whether the borrowings will have a discernible effect on what we do, we have some differences of opinion My own bias would be on the lower side of that In all this hypothesizing about what we might do, it's easy if money runs low; if it runs high, I'd want to know if it was running high after three consecutive months of decline in industrial production and the dollar 3 percent higher than it is now or whether it was running high with industrial production rising and the dollar falling Then I would have a quite different attitude I don't know how you forecast that at this point And that's my problem I have a sneaking suspicion that one of those is more likely than the other, which biases my attitude toward this a bit The low end of the preferences on borrowing is roughly the $350 to $400 million range; then there are those who said a $500 million range and those who said $500 million or more  Who knows? According to the analysis, $350 million is consistent with--  $350 million is the midpoint of the range of our experts' [views] after examining all the entrails  -37-    3/26/85  Well, I'm not so sure about that No, I think that would be a mistake, because we might get more demand for excess reserves If we set a net borrowing target, that's putting more pressure on the market; I think that's in effect what happened last time And I think we would not be getting the results that we wanted What we do is make some judgments ex post, as a result of this meeting, that we have made an excess reserve assumption that is too low, though too low is a kind of qualified [assessment] We didn't mind that so much when M1 was rising rapidly If the business news isn't too weak or isn't doing anything extraordinary, we lean on that side or tolerate that side If we're not so tolerant of that, we will be a little more aggressive in making sure that borrowings don't get too much above where we're talking about It's very hard to judge that mechanically, because it depends upon what the market is thinking --how high the market shoves the federal funds rate Therefore, we can get some surprisingly high borrowing in the beginning of the period, and there's not much we can do about it, once it is borrowed, without really putting out the money later in the week  What you can do, if that's the judgment-- you can't provide any insurance but if you want to lean against getting those kinds of borrowing figures--is put the money in a little earlier than you otherwise would put it in  From my standpoint, a not unreasonable approach would be to say that we're aiming at something like $350 to $400 million That doesn't guarantee that in particular weeks or two- week periods it wouldn't be above that in particular circumstances; but we aim in that area with a little more caution or aggressiveness-- depending upon which side you look at it--than we did last interval That is lower than some people preferred, but there was a substantial body of opinion in that area I think this would be consistent with the funds rate not going above 9 percent, but I don't know Nobody knows I've asked people what they want We have a suggestion from Governor Partee to narrow that [funds rate] band Does that attract support?  Want to argue further Governor Partee?  Well, let's assume that the funds rate band stays But the message is that if the rate got above 9 percent, some people might be concerned enough to want to have a discussion of that I think that message is clear There aren't any other variables The question is this borrowing number, if the 6, 7, 8 percent formulation is generally acceptable Should I propose $350 to $400 million?  Yes, we might be into very [sensitive]--  Whatever number we put down here, I think one can be pretty sure that if excess reserves really jumped in some week, the way it would work out is that the borrowings probably would jump too But we would be more cautious of them, probably, than we have been There's a little peculiarity in the record The last time we said [in the directive] that we didn't change, and we didn't have much change If you just looked at borrowings, it looks like we tightened up If we say we're [not] going to change this time and they go down, it looks like the opposite  What did you say--$350 to $500 million?  I said $400 million  Well, sometimes we have one number and sometimes we have a range In any case, it's implied as we play this out during the period, depending upon how money and other numbers run, that we take the risks of it being higher or lower Well, I don't know where we are on this We have a fair number of people around $350 to $400 million; we have a fair number who have something like-- I'm checking off numbers here Mr Balles and Mr Forrestal have not expressed themselves recently  I know; I thought maybe you'd become more flexible  That's $350 million  And Mr Rice is there too  In that case, we're not worried about the federal funds rate  Well, we ought to talk about the wording, which I suppose is related Most people are reasonably satisfied with $350 to $400 million I think it reduces itself to a simple question Does it help in terms of happy harmony, in people's best opinions, to make it $350 to $450 million?  What about those on the other side?  All right, why don't we say $350 to $450 million? [Whether we] remain within that range in one particular week or two-week period will be gauged in part on how the money supply and other things [behave]--money supply and the exchange rate being the most obvious short-term indicators All right, it's 6, 7, and 8 percent, $350 to $450 million, depending upon money growth and the exchange rate  Well, the economy too; but it's not likely to change enough to remake the economy  I'll get to the wording now This [draft] has so many words crossed out and put in that I find it a little difficult to read The first sentence is fairly straightforward "In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, taking account of the progress against inflation, uncertainties in the business outlook, and the exchange value of the dollar, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions" Then it goes on "This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M1, M2, and M3 at annual rates of around 6, 7, and 8 percent respectively during the period from March to June" Now we have the "woulds" and "mights" in this next sentence Before I get to that, in that next sentence, which begins "In either case, such a change," I'm not sure I like all those things here, but I think we ought to mention all of them somehow We have a 6 to 10 percent funds range with the understanding of Mr Partee's concern I might say, based upon what I know now, that I'm a little more reluctant to tighten than to ease I can imagine conditions in which one might want to tighten; I can more easily imagine conditions in which one would want to ease  I guess at least we could do that--put ease first and use "might" in both sentences That's not too bad  If we put "might" in both cases, that's even more clear  We'll do that, if that's acceptable, and reverse the sequence We use "might" in both cases and take out the word "only" Is that all understood?  The funds and it's 6, 7, and 8 percent [for the is except we reverse the order of the and take out "only" All the rest is  rate range is aggregates] sentence, use the same  6 to 10 percent It all reads as it the word "might"  Yes that anybody else has an opinion  I think it's Okay  useful I don't know  I guess we're finished  END OF MEETING  -44-       We have to approve the minutes  Without objection I have an extraordinary item this morning We have had a request from the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers to receive the weekly report of the Manager for Foreign Operations and the weekly report of the Manager for Domestic Operations  I will say it is sent to the Treasury; it has always been sent to them, historically The question is whether we can change this rule and send it to the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under our rules of confidentiality Does anyone have a strong opinion on this? Do we have to take a formal action? Does this have to appear in the record so we have to have a vote?  I don't know that we ever had a problem; I know we worried about it  Not hearing any objection--  I think once you begin this-- The problem is I don't know whether any subsequent Chairman will be interested  It's worth reviewing  I assume we are going to add it  We can add "upon request"  It's not supposed to go to anyone else other than those who receive it But--how many people here read this report?  [Secretary's note Among those whose hands were raised, only Mr Wallich spoke]  I think I have the sense of the meeting Mr Cross  Comments? Questions?  Are the banks not making any money these days?  There's short-term variability, hourly variability, daily variability, and intra-daily variability  Well, in the absence of a constructive suggestion we'll turn to Mr Sternlight  Discussion? If not, we'll ratify the transactions Motion?  SPEAKER(?) So move  SPEAKER(?) Second  Without objection Mr Prell  When I listen to you, I wonder how you get all those projected GNP increases Well, what comments are there? Mr Black  We're in the comment period  Governor Martin  I don't know whether [that means] we should tighten up or ease up  Mr Keehn  Mr Forrestal  Mr Balles  Mr Black  Mr Morris  I hear the threat all the time Everybody I talk to--  Governor Rice  Mr Corrigan  Mr Stern  Governor Wallich  What is that price?  I thought you indicated earlier that that wasn't going to bring it down, but I--  Mr Boykin  Governor Seger  No new froth  Want to be gloomy? Look at how lousy that means productivity grew  Mr Axilrod, why don't you pronounce an invocation  Let me just make a couple of very brief comments In terms of the business situation and outlook, I myself would be quite surprised if we have seen the end of the import penetration at anything like the current exchange rate I think that process is maybe not in midstream--it's beyond the midstream--but we are not to the other shore by a long shot in my own appraisal Mr Morris expressed a bit of surprise at the timing of the discount rate change I am not quite sure what you had in mind You may have had in mind the timing relative to this meeting  That was a factor that we considered and we thought on balance that it was better to get it out of the way before the meeting--kind of as a benchmark--rather than leaving some question as to how it would fit in connection with open market operations I would simply say that I did not have in mind that we would be reversing direction of that action by tightening up on open market operations With that much preliminary, who would like to comment?  -21-    5/21/85  In Super NOWs as opposed to NOW accounts?  Before you say that, let me just ask A one percent differential between what and what? That's not what it looks like  It all sounds very plausible to me I asked a similar question to the staff recently and they told me there was nothing to it, so I will let them respond I may have misinterpreted their answer  Well, what I asked you, [Mr Axilrod], explicitly the other day was Does it look different if you look at the old M1 and M1A? You told me no, but this would seem to imply that it should look different  What were the fourth-quarter figures?  That's another thing you can look at--that this money growth may not look all that odd compared to demand [Unintelligible] 4 percent in the first quarter  Well, what I conclude from all this discussion is that we better have a little more orderly analysis of this before the next meeting when we have to look at those [long-run] targets  I think we can face that issue then Meanwhile, who would like to make a suggestion? In the absence of any other suggestions, I will make a suggestion Keep the reserve pressures about where they are  I would think you could [unintelligible] out of extended credit as you do out of adjustment credit  Those institutions are under some pressure  Mr Balles  Mr Forrestal  Mr Stern  Mr Morris  Mr Boehne  Governor Partee  4 percentage points for one month?  These M2 and M3 numbers are quite low however you look at them If they were really that low for the quarter, I'd worry a bit It allows much room for increases Mrs Horn  Mr Guffey  Ms Seger  Mr Garbarini  Mr Boykin  Governor Wallich hasn't been heard from  It may well be It's probably unduly optimistic to think that they decided not to make so many bad loans  Mr Balles  Which is clearly wrong at the extreme, it seems to me  Small or large Well, there's no great desire to change things aggressively That is a point with which I agree, but let me just make a couple of supplementary comments I don't know where we are on the economy; it's not looking very good I do know the exchange rate is awfully high and I surely wouldn't want to push it higher I would rather do the reverse I don't know what is going on with M1 or M2 or M3 I know they are giving out different signals, but I don't feel very religious about M1 at this point If the economy shows further signs of softening and the dollar is going higher and financial strains in a number of directions continue or get aggravated, as they well might, I think we're running some financial [risks] in the financial system, clearly There are financial strains across a large part of the structure of the American manufacturing industry at least One is partly related to the other And I think we have to maintain some flexibility on the easier side, although I wouldn't [move in that direction] right now I think that's a much more likely hypothesis than the opposite, although I don't mind maintaining flexibility on the opposite side either This alternative B/alternative C business never appears in anything [we publish]; maybe we ought to look at the [draft] directive language, which I don't like much in the sense that it doesn't change anything from last time There have been a number of comments that we ought to mention the discount rate someplace I think that would be wise Let's put something in the first sentence there I'm not quite sure why we would say "uncertainties in the business outlook" It seems to me what we ought to be saying is "relatively slow growth"  That's long term Another thing on the inflation front, as we said in our announcement [about the discount rate], is that the commodity prices are just continuing to fall The averages for the most part, except for the very low level at the bottom of the recession, are as low as they have been in two years and the level is about where it was in '79 or '80  That is a real reduction in commodity prices of 30 or 40 percent, I suppose And it's just about across the board in agricultural prices, industrial, mining--  Well, it's rising and it's mainly in the prices of services But there has been a little bulge in gasoline prices recently, which we may have for another month in the statistics, but that seems to be over in the commodities prices  Car prices went down last month  Well, I just read it Used car prices were down slightly and the new car prices were unchanged It's a rare thing for used car prices to come down  Well, the easy thing to do, and maybe it's sufficient, is just to mention in the first sentence that the discount rate went down  Let me suggest something radical take out all this business about progress against inflation, uncertainties, and the exchange value of the dollar  Say "In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, against the background of the recent decline in the discount rate" We mentioned all these things [in our announcement of the discount rate action] Put a footnote on it that says "See the statement on the--"  "In the implementation of policy for the immediate future and against the background of the recent reduction in the discount rate"--is it worth mentioning market rates in there?  SPEAKER(?) You don't need it  -35-    5/21/85  I guess we say "The Committee seeks to maintain the existing--" Does it sound a little more accurate to say "The Committee seeks to maintain the range--"?  "The recent"? Borrowing is going to be very high this week isn't it? How about "in the period"?  [Mr Axilrod,] you had a rather selective recitation, I think, of the average borrowing  It's going to be high without all the thrifts, isn't it?  I guess "recent" is better than "existing" in that connection When I say it, it doesn't sound very good; but I guess "recent" is better than "existing"  "In most recent weeks"  I don't know The more we try to explain it the more difficulty we get in "The Committee seeks to maintain about the same degree of pressure on bank reserve positions" Let's go on to the next sentence, having resolved that one I think this bracketed suggestion may be better; what do you think? M2 and M3 are awfully low looking  Just put it in there baldly Look at the alternative "This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M1 at an annual rate of around--" We can say "6 percent or a little higher"  Well, but those differences are so fine I don't mean to sound--  No The way this is written the M1 is a three-month rate  Yes, that's right  Well, everything is a little peculiar because they are not ordinarily that far off  I hate to put two-month growth rates in there, but we could do that--roughly 6 to 7 percent--for all of them for April to June  M3 is actually higher than that I think    5/21/85  I suppose we could just say something more vague such as "expected to be consistent with growth of M1 at an annual rate of around 6 percent or a little higher, while M2 and M3 would be expected to increase at a slower rate of speed than implied earlier, due to the sluggish growth in the--"  My only trouble with that is that I don't like two-month growth rates and if M2 and M3 turned out to have a little bulge on the other side--well within what we thought earlier-- it wouldn't bother me But I don't know that it makes a lot of difference  I don't mind that Let me try something like that The alternative, I guess, is giving a two-month growth rate but say "expected to be consistent with growth of M1 at an annual rate of around 6 percent or a little higher, while M2 and M3 are expected to grow more slowly over the quarter than anticipated earlier in the light of the--" One of them was actually minus wasn't it?  "Their sluggish April performance" or "their weakness" maybe  The way this would read is "This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M1 at an annual rate of around 6 percent or a little higher while M2 and M3 are expected to grow more slowly over the quarter than anticipated earlier in the light of their weakness in April" The advantage of this is that it has M1 a tad higher than what we said we envisaged before and it's immediately balanced by saying M2 and M3 are considerably lower The alternative is just using the two-month growth rates Or we can do what we have here Which do you prefer? I guess I slightly prefer this  Well, let's assume that for the moment [The next sentence is] "Somewhat lesser reserve restraint--"  I'm perfectly happy to have it "would" in the first part and "might" in the second part  Under a magnifying glass!  This isn't going to come out until two months from now  That's what I prefer too, but what do you all want to do? It doesn't make that much difference  How many members of the Committee prefer "might/would"? The alternative is going to be "might/might"  That's right "would/might" Did I say it wrong?  I thought that's what I gave first Who prefers "would/might"? Wait a minute; let me see How many "might/mights" do we have? Five Somebody didn't vote  SPEAKER(?) Probably you  I picked the "would/might"  I count one vote [more] for "would/might" at this point  What's this federal funds rate range? We have it at 6 to 10 percent and that still seems to be ample to cover all contingencies  Well, where do you want the federal funds rate? I don't think it's worth changing to get it to 5-1/2--  Well, we're left with this borrowing figure The center point seems to be $350 million  Well, all the emergency thrift borrowing  SPEAKER(?) Only emergency thrift borrowing  Whether the discount rate is threatened or not will depend upon what goes on in the economy or the exchange rate, I suspect  Leaving a little margin here is fine, obviously We can leave a little margin by saying $325 to $375 million  I think nobody is talking about trying to force the federal funds rate down at this point below where it would naturally lie, which is a little above the discount rate  -41-    5/21/85  I don't know whether we sent a very strong message; they were anticipating it for two weeks before it happened  The bond market was down 1/2 of a point this morning; I don't know where it is now  What did the stock market do this morning?  I think we've learned that from experience  Well, you ask this question every time, Roger, and I'm not a prophet  I would assume it's somewhere in that neighborhood, give or take 50 basis points  Well, I don't know that we need to linger over this point forever I assume we will start--and probably miss it by $100 million plus or minus--somewhere around $350 million or slightly above with a bit of flexibility on either side  We start at $350 or a little above and have some flexibility either way as we move along  How do you want to express that noble thought?  Just say $350 for the moment with an understanding that there's a little flexibility All right  I think so We more or less settled it but various people are unhappy It reads "In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, and against the background of the recent reduction in the discount rate, the Committee seeks to maintain about the same degree of pressure on bank reserve positions This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M1 at an annual  -43-    5/21/85  rate of around 6 percent or a little higher during the period from March to June, while M2 and M3 are expected to grow more slowly over the quarter than anticipated earlier in the light of their weakness in April Somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the event of substantially slower growth of the monetary aggregates while somewhat greater restraint might be acceptable in the event of substantially higher growth" All the rest of it is the same with 6 to 10 percent [for the funds rate range]  By one vote as I understood it, with one person not voting  Whatever they were What were they?  For both?  Add "the 7 to 8 percent range anticipated earlier" Would you want to say "grow significantly more slowly"? It was 7 to 8 percent for both?  So it should say the "7 and 8 percent anticipated, respectively"  Okay Well, if that's all right and nobody wants to raise any further points, [we can vote]  Okay  END OF MEETING       We need to approve the minutes  We'll turn to foreign currency operations  Comments or questions?  No other comments, observations? You provoked nobody! Domestic operations, Mr Sternlight  Comments?  Without objection We'll see whether the economy sparks any more [comment]  MESSRS KICHLINE, PRELL, and TRUMAN [Statements--see Appendix]  Are there any comments or questions?  My impression is that it is moving higher quite rapidly You have the first-quarter figure here, right?  That's the trouble with senior bank lending officers!  Mr Boehne  Mr Keehn  I'd be surprised if there were 4 percent inflation abroad in the kinds of things they export to the United States  Going back to this chart that Mr Keehn referred to Is that a 1 or 1-1/4 percent difference between the red line and the compensation line?  If we had a 10 percent decline in oil prices--you have more than that in here--how much does that lower GNP prices? What is oil, 5 percent of the GNP?  No, no--a 10 percent decline  Excluding energy  I think what Mr Prell just told me is that if the energy price goes down that much you would have a slower rate of increase  Mr Balles  Mr Stern  I want to return to this price issue for a moment I cannot resist giving you this little background--and I may as well do it now--on the record of the Federal Open Market Committee's price forecasts over the last three years In the beginning of 1983--just taking the central tendency--we estimated prices at 4-1/2 percent, and we continued with that in July; they came out at 3-3/4 percent We started out [in July 1983] projecting prices for 1984 at 4-3/4 percent and maintained them there in February; they came out at 36 percent We started out in July 1984, in our first forecast [for 1985], projecting 5-3/8 percent and then we lowered it substantially [in February]  Any other comments?  Governor Wallich  Mr Boehne    7/9-10/85  Let me make another comment about these forecasts [by Committee members] If that is true, it is not reflected in the forecasts given in preparation for this meeting They are almost invariably higher than what the staff is forecasting, sometimes substantially  I'd just make that observation Also, they are [unintelligible] Now, one thing may be that the staff is assuming a lower second quarter than other people may have been assuming  I am going to make a modest procedural suggestion In the future, when you present a set of charts, you might number them so that we can refind them  Governor Martin  I think that we will inevitably get to that You are talking about the assumptions I would have wished earlier that $50 billion [in deficit cuts] might turn out to be reasonable, or in my wildest thoughts, low I must say right now that I think it is much too high for an assumption as to how much the budget is going to be cut in 1986 Mr Black  Do we have any other comments on the business situation?  That's the way it's supposed to be  My comparison was for 1985, but I guess it's also true--well, less so, for 1986  Mr Morris    7/9-10/85  Mr Keehn  You have a forecast very close to the staff's on real GNP; you're quite a lot higher on prices  Why are you pessimistic on prices?  -12-    7/9-10/85  Mr Stern  Mr Balles  Mr Forrestal  Mr Guffey  Mr Boykin, you can tell us about the energy business  All those inflationary pressures!  What equity in it? The equity is a loan from the bank! We have a strategy for you, Mr Boykin You are going to take one of those deals where you get three years called "free rent" and then we'll let you build a building three years from now!  I don't want to suggest that everybody has to defend their differences in forecasts here; they are all in a very narrow range  The comment made about the budget earlier is reinforced by the fact that I now read that Mr Stockman has resigned as Director of the Office of Management and Budget It's not encouraging to think that we'll have striking new vigor toward budget cuts We are going to have a difficult arithmetic job, if nothing else, to explore everybody's ideas and where all of these targets should be There are umpteen different variations; I am a bit concerned about the time I think perhaps we ought to spend time this evening having Mr Axilrod explain to us all about the money supply  [Your report] might be more condensed  I think that we should not try to get into a discussion of just where to set these targets for the short-run policy at the moment, given the time [of day] But I think we have a little more time for any questions or comments people want to make about the kinds of issues that were raised in the paper that Steve distributed and touched upon in his comments as a kind of a philosophic background to the discussion  The model is symmetrical  Mr Melzer, first I would like to take the opportunity to welcome you to these deliberations We look forward to some clarification of all these doubts that others have expressed  We claimed at that time when there was a lot of innovation that it affected M2 and M3 more than M1  Mr Corrigan  I don't want to get too deeply into those precise questions now Mr Balles  We said that was only a monitoring range  We have someone distributing some pretty little charts here; I keep expecting someone to comment on them  Perhaps I can call upon you and we can pronounce the benediction  I can't understand what these numbers are; perhaps you can explain  Cumulative deviation from the trend line established earlier?  You're permitted a brief rebuttal, Mr Axilrod  You are permitted to discuss that between you men I would like to make one observation in closing for the evening What we are struggling with is not exactly unique in the central banking world these days, or recently In many ways our situation resembles what the Swiss had in 1978 when they said the Swiss franc, in their judgment, was getting way overvalued And finally they said The heck with monetary targets; we will operate under the exchange rate M1 went up 21 or 23 percent that year; I am not sure whether they are happy in retrospect or not They still have a pretty good inflation record relative to others I am sure there is no cause and effect but the Bank of Canada, for the inverse reason I guess, gave up monetary targeting a couple of years ago and their inflation rate promptly sank for the first time in 10 years The English are apparently debating right now whether to abandon the monetary targets or not, again in favor of the exchange rate This  -25-    7/9-10/85 -26-  debate is proceeding on an international scale We will see you at 9 o'clock in the morning  I think we better make it 9 am  [Meeting recessed]    7/9-10/85  July 10, 1985--Morning Session  As I sat here and listened yesterday, I did not detect enormous differences about the short-run outlook, although I think there are a lot of uncertainties I do think that we somewhat neglected in our discussion the rather large problems of why, as a practical matter, we have some enormous disequilibria in the economy that we are dealing with We can't save enough to finance all of our investment and we have a government deficit; we are buying abroad much more than we sell I don't think either of those phenomena can last forever, and all of these nice projections that we have assume that the expansion is going to go along rather smoothly without any great discontinuity That may be right for the next year and it may be right for the next 18 months I don't think it'll be right forever and I wouldn't count on it for the next year  We face a very sluggish picture abroad, as near as I can see, with no great growth I think we will see some growth, but not enough to reduce appreciably their unemployment or increase appreciably our exports I don't see many signs of change in policy there We have a lot of financial strains around, whether internally or externally, and they are going to take a long time to cure We may even break an axle as we proceed in the financial markets Henry Wallich tells us we still have an inflation problem People from the farms tell us we have deflationary problems In the oil area, we have a deflationary problem Mr Corrigan tells us we have lots of liquidity When I look around at all the figures, it looks to me like we have a lot of bankruptcies, which isn't exactly consistent with overflowing liquidity in the economy  Wild distribution; I think that's right Everybody, seat of their pants, was telling me that the economy isn't going anyplace The M1 figure tells you it is going to zoom, if you believe M1 So, we have a lot of questions and I don't know how we contribute to the answer to all of these problems I think the answer is that we don't We can't magically deal with the budget problem, the trade problem, and the financial problems and cure them all very easily We can maybe avoid aggravating them But when I look around and think about what to do in the short run for the moment, I am not sure that we can do much differently than what we have been doing And I approach the long-run targeting from that standpoint I would suspect, from what I heard yesterday--you tell me if I'm wrong--that I am not going to be hearing any proposals for radical changes in operations in the short run  We would all like to see it slow down The question is whether anybody wants a tightening action to slow it down These long-term ranges all depend upon the unknowns of M1 in the short run If we had one month of zero [M1 growth], it would look better But we are entering [the third quarter], as you know, at a very high trajectory off of June; and any number we put down is going to be above [the long-run range] in the short run Well, that's a fact we face So long as we don't have the base as June--we could do  -27-    7/9-10/85  that, I suppose--we wouldn't be above in the short run I don't know as anyone proposes that We could have a base of two months, I guess  Well, I am a little uncertain as to whether we should discuss the short run or long run first because obviously they are interrelated Let me just test my assumption that nobody wants any radical changes in the short run--maybe Mr Black is an exception A radical change I assume is a change in the borrowing target by more than $50 or $100 million  Well, we will have you on the other side; you want a change Does anyone else want a change of that magnitude?  You all want to tighten policy right now?  You really don't want to tighten  The actual level has been way above the target a good part of the time So have free reserves Who could say that wouldn't happen if we did the same thing again? I've heard from three people saying that they would like to tighten Does that mean that the other nine don't want to?  I would not have thought anyone would think 10 percent was likely  First of all, I would say that I don't know what the answer is Obviously, we went off course in May and June from what was expected Maybe that will continue and maybe it won't The best staff input that we have says that roughly unchanged reserve paths will be reflected in a markedly lower M1 growth rate  The fact is that we don't know; we never know But it would not be unlike all experience if we had a month here of something [near] zero at some point I don't know why demand deposits are so high; it's the most intriguing part Good ole demand deposits seldom jump around that much I don't know whether it has anything to do with E F Hutton or not There is no evidence for it, but one wonders a little If it does, we ought to allow for it If it doesn't, past experience would suggest that it is going to go down at some point  Didn't what happen?  The latter part of 1980 was certainly a period where we kept underprojecting the money supply; it kept rising more rapidly in the latter part of the year than we anticipated There's no question about that  That is correct Last fall it kept increasing less than we anticipated So you can take your pick of experiences  That's about the way I would read it, yes  I didn't hear any suggestion yesterday-- now, I'm just reading into the comments--that anybody was talking about working off the overshoot  Let's do the easy part first What do we do with M2, M3, and debt? The obvious thing is not to change the ranges for this year The argument, I guess, revolves around M2 and whether we give ourselves a little more room on M2 We're a few tenths above the range now  Oh, six months ago! You're not assuming that now  Then that's theoretically consistent with M2 being within the target and M3 being within the target  I'm on M2 and M3 and debt at this point  We're having a little more of that, I think, than we assumed at the beginning of the year Does anyone strongly object to that conclusion?  Well, let's very tentatively assume that we are not going to change M2 and M3 and debt--we'll go back to look at them--as background to the discussion of M1 Does anybody want to change the range for the year? I haven't heard any sentiment of that sort to go back to the beginning of the year and just raise the range for M1 for '85  I'm not saying that now That is another option  Change the range through the year  That's not ignoring it  Subject to change in an hour  Anybody who is going to move out of savings deposits already has  How can you make an instrument more attractive than a money market deposit account already is?  There's no minimum balance on the MMDA now, is there?  The principal change next year will be to take the ceiling off the [interest rate paid on] NOW accounts so that it will increase the transactions--  Mr Guffey  Mr Forrestal  Mr Boehne  I must say, if this is right in substance, that this is a most peculiar sentence, it seems to me We reaffirm the range and then we say it doesn't mean anything  Mr Stern  Governor Rice  Mr Boykin  Would you like to see some reduced growth in M1--just for instance--if trade problems continue to get worse and the dollar goes up and the economy is in recession?  What major long-range problem will you be adjusting by curtailing M1 with the dollar strong and the economy in recession?  That's not what he said ex post in 1933  We can conclude that everybody would be delighted if M1 subsided without doing--  We will stipulate that  I think it is a heck of a lot more important what we do than what numbers we put down here, myself  I don't think that's a question in many laymen's minds  Well, the sense of this, I guess, is that if we don't do anything other than keep the numbers the same, we probably ought to rebase We can pick numbers that are the same arithmetically and that are a more forward-looking, easier translation of what we intend, rather than changing the range for the whole year to take account of what took place in the first half of the year  If we change the existing targets, it also implies that to the market It depends on the language surrounding it  Well, an alternative is not saying anything about M1, in effect I think that that does suspend it But that does not reflect the desire that everybody would like to see it lower  Mr Corrigan  Well, you can make them arithmetically equivalent  -45-    7/9-10/85  It's not even a monitoring range if you don't expect to make it  The hardest thing to explain is why we wouldn't change the range and yet expect to be over it I can see where one can abandon the range That's easy to explain If it's wider, that's another question But I don't know how we can sit there and say we reaffirmed the range for M1, but expect to be well over it  I must say, I don't see much difference between rebasing and raising the range  Cosmetically, I don't see any substantive difference; arithmetically it is equivalent  -46-    7/9-10/85  Well, I just don't see the cosmetic difference in your own terms between saying we are raising the range or we are rebasing They both amount to the same thing  You escape me We raise the [M1 growth] rate for a year and that expresses a great conviction  What's your good explanation as to why you are raising [M1 growth] rates?  You lose me  You wipe the slate clean and end up with a lower number; you don't wipe the slate clean and end up with a higher number I don't think it takes any genius to say that you are at the same place at the end of the year  It doesn't make any difference either way; you end up in the same place, except in the one case you are putting in higher numbers and in the other case you are not  I can agree with that  Rebasing carries a little more implication that we think this is probably an exceptional circumstance If you don't rebase, you are starting with a higher number, and it's harder to put it down lower the lower you get That's what it amounts to  Well, the trouble with that from my standpoint is that if we ever have to tighten, it's good to have that M1 number out there  If we abandon it completely, we've lost a [unintelligible] Suppose it runs [above] whatever we put down, whether we change it for the year or rebase We could always say, if we have to, that we have persuasive enough evidence that says we're going to run above it If we don't have it out there at all, and we don't want to run above it, that's a little hard to do  I guess what the cosmetic issue comes down to is whether we want to say primarily that we think this is an exceptional case or whether we want to build the kind of background for a permanent increase in the rate of increase in M1 It might be right, if in fact the trend velocity is changing Maybe it is I think probably it is Maybe we don't want to move the money supply down to where we used to think that we wanted to move it, because with the changed structure, it's going to have to be higher relative to the  -48-    7/9-10/85  nominal GNP If that's what you think, then change the range for the whole year and begin getting people used to higher M1 numbers If the odds are this is once and for all, rebase it Who knows?  Well, that's what I am saying The differences are relatively minor, but I do think it depends upon whether you want to get people used to higher M1 figures as a kind of norm or not I think we are getting used to higher M1 figures anyway, because that's probably the fact of the situation So, it's a question of how fast you want to go in that direction I think it's hard to go from 5 to 9 percent--or whatever we are talking about if we don't rebase--down to 4 to 7 percent if that's where you want to go next year Or less It's much easier to do that if you rebase and don't have to go down at all or go down a relatively minor amount  All I'm sure of is that we are going to decide one way or the other  That doesn't say that you cannot do it I just say that, marginally, it takes a little more explanation  Right Do you express a one-time aberration more clearly by rebasing or by raising the range for the whole year?  Don't do either?  But what I find a little difficult to say is that we haven't changed our range but we expect to be above it  -49-    7/9-10/85  We will admit that we are above the top That's where we are  Well, if we express it strongly enough, they might stop showing the chart But I take it that that's not what you want to do You want to retain some discipline  I don't know quite what words we would use to say our range is 4 to 7 percent but it doesn't mean anything  I can explain abandoning M1; that's straightforward But I don't know what the 4 to 7 percent means if we are not intending to-- There is no content  Well, I have to say I think we expect to be within the range That's not a promise We can violate it again, if that's the wisdom But at least I can say we expect to be around the upper edges We do think it's once and for all--well, not quite once and for all--a step function I don't find that very difficult To explain that we don't have an M1 range is simple enough too What I find a little difficult to say is our range is 4 to 7 percent, but that doesn't mean anything  Well, much more comfortable is an exaggeration I don't feel very comfortable with no change at all  -50-    7/9-10/85  Probably a better expression of where we want to be is to rebase-- assuming that the arithmetic is all the same anyway [and] there is no argument on what it should be  That's a perfectly coherent approach Presentationally, it's easy I don't see any objections to that side That's a question of substance whether we want to set aside M1 that far, which says we can't come back later in the year and say we think M1 is too high, in effect It makes it more difficult Do we want to throw out--throw out is a bit exaggerated--the possibility of saying that M1 is just too high and we want to tighten up?  In 1982, what did we do--rebase in the middle of the year?  What did we do in 1982? We didn't do anything in 1982? We just ran above it  We were within the range at the midyear meeting, I guess, in 1982 and we just let it run above [later]  What we did was We didn't change our range in mid-1982 We ran above it We set a new monitoring range at the beginning of 1983, and then we rebased in the middle of 1983  And we said we were going to be more serious about it That's the difference In the middle of 1983 we  -51-    7/9-10/85  rebased and said we were going to get a bit more serious about it, I guess  This time we rebase and say but we're not going to get more serious Well, we didn't say much more serious, as I remember We still called it a monitoring range Okay I guess we didn't get a lot more serious about it in the middle of '83--only slightly more; we got more serious about it at the beginning of '84 Well, we'll go to something easy, like next year Does anybody have strong feelings about next year?  For M1 for next year?  You're for alternative I for next year  It just reduces the top end of the range for M3 by 1/2 percentage point; that's all it does  It reduces the debt range  Yes, we're leaving M1 aside for the moment The other three--  I think that's correct The GNP estimates [of Board members and Presidents]--well, there is a 5-1/2 percent on the low side and an 8-1/2 percent peak--are bunched in the 6-3/4 to 8 percent area, roughly If you just took that and said there shouldn't be any velocity changes, you're more or less satisfied there And for M2 and M3 and debt you could take alternative I or you could take alternative II too; there isn't much difference Alternative III begins to look like a squeeze on our projections of nominal GNP  There is so little difference between I and II that it's negligible, it seems to me Alternative III does begin to be a pretty tight fit, given the nominal GNP figures that are projected You can argue that they're too high, I suppose, if you want to tighten it I think you have to begin arguing that, though  Well, here I'm just talking about M2 and M3 and debt for which, presumably, in the long run there isn't any trend  Oh, I'm sorry  I don't know where our real GNP average [projection] is It looks like it ought to be over 3 percent Well, I don't know; some are more pessimistic  Well, I think it's fair to say by and large that the projections for next year cluster around a 3 percent  -53-    7/9-10/85  real growth So, alternative I and alternative II would allow for that You could argue that that's too low, but [unintelligible] probably higher price figures than are likely Another fall of the dollar-- Well, I'm just looking at the easy aggregates now M2, M3 and debt Who's for alternative I? Who's for alternative II? Who's for alternative III? That knocks out alternative III Not everybody raised his or her hand by a long shot The difference between these is very small it's 1/2 percentage point on the upper end of M2 and 1/2 percentage point on the upper and lower end in the debt range M3 is the same [in both] If I don't hear great howls, it seems to me those are nice round numbers; we don't get into halves  Alternative I for M2, M3, and debt--that's all I'm talking about Now, M1 is another story That may affect what people want to do about this year  The choices given range from 3-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent to 4 to 8 percent Who has a strong feeling about that?  Maybe it's even zero  [Unintelligible] maybe you get 1 percent increase in velocity with that projection  Even if you're in the top of it  I suppose there's something to be said for 4 to 8 percent simply on the basis that it's a wider range, given all the uncertainties we have talked about  Well, 4 to 7 percent looks like a perfectly reasonable figure on the kind of analysis we used to use Whether that's still reasonable in terms of potential velocity under today's conditions is the question; it's an awfully tight fit And it assumes an increase in velocity  Well, how many like 4 to 7 percent? How many like 4 to 8 percent? That encompasses the range, unless somebody else has some other feeling  Well, I find it difficult to work up a great deal of emotion in assuming what the language is going to be; it's quite tentative anyway  I think we probably ought to do the short run and come back to this  The situation we have is that the economy looks pretty sluggish and there is not much sign of a breakout on the up side, apart from looking at the M1 figure If you look at the M1 figure you might say that maybe we are going to have a great increase [in GNP] I don't know where that's coming from But as a practical matter, if you wanted to stimulate, where can you stimulate? You can stimulate housing, which is already high, and maybe consumption and you would get more distortions in the economy and more imports It's hard for me to see, particularly in the midst of this, that we should tighten up, barring evidence that the economy is expanding [too fast] or further evidence on Ml So, I conclude that we [should] stay about where we are  I suppose what that means, just in terms of setting forth specifications, is that we do something like alternative B, with a clear understanding that everybody would be delighted, I'm sure, if July and August suddenly had a jump downward in M1 We would not take that as a sign for great easing unless it were accompanied by very clear evidence that, say, the dollar was strong and the economy was weak Conversely, I certainly would agree, if M1 continued high and there were pretty definite signs--or some signs anyway--that the economy was expanding more rapidly, we might have to react Even then I'd be a little more tentative about that if the dollar turned out to be very strong I don't think the dollar will turn out to be strong during this period Hypothetically, I think we could get a combination of a declining dollar, a little more evidence of business firmness, and a high M1, and then we would tighten up Except we don't make that decision today We would make the decision to do that if those circumstances arose  -57-    7/9-10/85  When you say alternative B, you are also encompassing something around the borrowing target that's in there?  You're in favor of "B"?  Corrigan is in favor of "B"  I myself, just in the area of fine tuning, would say $350 million played somewhat cautiously In other words, it might be more likely to be higher rather than lower, depending upon how market conditions develop  Well, that's getting a little narrow, considering what we've gone through Basically, I would aim at $350 million but not put funds in there if the market is very easy and--  -58-    7/9-10/85  SPEAKER(?) That's right  Well, let's make this all tentative until we come back and look at the package as a whole And we have to consider the language too But you're basically "B"?  I wouldn't say trending up Trending up if the economy gets stronger  Tolerance, okay  Well,--  Well, if the economy turns out weaker, then we have different circumstances Then, I presume we would write a directive that says if everything comes out weak we would ease and if everything turns out tight, we would tighten But I'm talking about apart from that now; I think the word "tolerance" is for a little higher [borrowing] depending upon market circumstances It's what we have been doing, basically  Okay  Well, under certain conditions, it may be necessary to do something before then That would not be to get a lower M1, I guess, but in response to a still higher one Who else?  You have different public relations in mind than I do, Emmett  Governor Seger  That's alternative A by golly Does anybody else have anything? Well, it looks like the center of gravity is at B Is the coffee out there?  Why don't we have our coffee? We'll come back and consider what the directive should say for the near term and consider the longer-run alternatives, working around alternative B  -60-    7/9-10/85  [Coffee break]  I think we might return to this issue of the targets for the year If I am correct, I think the sentiment is to change the targets Let me assume that for the moment, one way or another If we change it to 5 to 9 percent for the year as a whole, that is roughly the same as rebasing it at 4 to 7 percent Is that correct, Mr Axilrod?  It's not quite the equivalent, I suppose If we change it to 4 to 8 percent or 5 to 8 percent with rebasing, what's that equivalent to? That's equivalent to 5-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent?  I assume we're going to do something in that area with some language fuzzing up M1 to some extent Those are arithmetic equivalents, so I think it's purely a presentational difference Let's talk about the substance for a moment, which I will say whichever way you [want me to] present it Is it 5 to 9 or 5 to 9-1/2 percent, which are the equivalents of 4 to 7 and 4 to 8 percent, [respectively] Is it the lower or the higher of those that we're talking about?  I'm not discussing whether we rebase or not  Looking at it in annual terms, the issue is whether we make the high number--which is the relevant one--9 or 9-1/2 percent; they are equivalent on rebasing to 7 or 8 percent  Do you want to talk in terms of the rebased numbers so we don't have to keep talking in terms of both, without in any way prejudging that decision? Let's just refer to the rebased number or the other number  Let's use the rebased number, which gives us two round numbers We're talking about 7 percent or 8 percent  How many do we have? One 8 percent--  7 percent  Who am I hearing 7 percent from?  Well, it's the same--  I'm assuming people want to be consistent arithmetically whether or not we rebase So, I'm automatically assuming anybody that says 8 percent is for 9-1/2 percent on M1 if we change [the range] for the year  To repeat The arithmetic equivalents, I think, are 9-1/2 and 8 percent and 9 and 7 percent  Now, cosmetically, people may think it's different They may be happy to do 4 to 8 percent but not 5-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent, even though they're the same thing  I'm not sure I've heard from everybody here Mr Balles  Mr Black  Well I've heard from all the Committee members Do I want to hear from anybody else?  Any non-Committee members have a strong feeling that they want to affect this narrow balance here?  This is if we rebase, which is the equivalent of 9 or 9-1/2 percent if we do the full year  Well, I'll just add that we're going to start off high and we're just stuck here Unless we rebase on the first week in July, we're going to start out above I don't know that we start out above the parallel lines, but the parallel lines close up pretty fast; we've only got six months But we're going to start off well above the cone simply because the trajectory was so sharp in June It's not going to look appreciably different whether we pick 7 or 8 percent because it doesn't make any difference when we're that close to the origin  There are so many permutations and combinations What we have is a slight majority for 8 percent at the moment Now, let's see whether this has affected where you are on rebasing or not Let me just ask the Committee members; we'll probably be 50/50 Now, all of this is going to have some kind of language that depresses the importance of M1, probably somewhat short of calling it a monitoring range, if I understand this [discussion] correctly It won't be demoted all the way to a monitoring range but it will be deemphasized a bit  That's right Who wants to rebase? One, two, three, four, five, six [Secretary's note Messrs Balles, Black, Forrestal, Keehn, Martin, and Ms Seger] Did I count that right? Yes, just what I figured  Do you mean Who doesn't want to rebase?  You think that some are indifferent  Who doesn't want to rebase?  I don't think this is the most crucial issue in the world Let me ask the question somewhat differently Who feels strongly that we should not rebase?  Who feels strongly that we should rebase? That was 3 or 4 members We have more qualitative strength of feeling on that side Now, we'll lose them all when we put the numbers on The majority was for 4 to 8 percent if we rebased Or we could make it 3 to 8 percent Does that help? Would people like to make it 3 to 8 percent?  Does anybody object to saying 3 to 8 percent?  Who's in favor of 3 to 8 percent, rebased?  Yes Well, I don't think we're going to get any combination that's better than that, but the floor is open for anybody who wants to try another number  Well, a way we could face that, I suppose, is if the dollar were weak, quite weak, and we felt it necessary to respond to it If we began getting low money supply numbers, we might want to say that's fine--with that big increase we had in the first half of the year and the dollar weak, the economy is going to get better That's the kind of conditions It may be a very outside [chance], but I don't think it's absolutely impossible  Yes, just as a kind of natural reflux plus something else As soon as we want to be pretty restrictive we might run into a low number  I think that probably is fair enough, isn't it, given all the uncertainty we've expressed? That seems to be consistent  For what?  What does?  I think it's very unlikely we would get 3 percent, but I don't--  If we had a combination of a desire to tighten some plus a kind of natural reflux, I don't think it's absolutely impossible I don't think it would be very hard from a June base, but it's awfully hard from a second-quarter base, given how high we start out  I agree with that I don't know what the arithmetic is, but to get 3 percent for the year we'd have no growth from now on, I guess  That's pretty low  It was 4 to 7 percent that we were talking about, wasn't it? Well, is there a preference for 3 to 8 percent as opposed to 4 to 8 percent?  Well, I've found a fair amount of support for 3 to 8 percent, all things considered Does anybody have a proposal that they think will attract more support? We were going to keep the other aggregates unchanged, right? Well, let's try some language Let me suggest something like this--and this is surely not written in concrete--looking at the language on page 20 [of the Bluebook] "In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this meeting reaffirmed ranges for the year of"--whatever they are for M2 and M3 What is it, 6 to 9 percent--?  --"and 6 to 9-1/2 for M3 The associated range for total domestic nonfinancial debt was reaffirmed at"--    7/9-10/85  --"9 to 12 percent" Now, if we change the base we would say "The base for the M1 range was moved forward to the second quarter of 1985"  "--was moved forward to the second quarter of 1985 and established at 3 to 8 percent, tentatively, in the expectation of a return of velocity growth toward more usual patterns, following a sharp decline of velocity during the first half of the year" I would insert something like "the appropriateness of the new range will continue to be reexamined in the light of evidence with respect to economic and financial developments, including foreign exchange markets" That is an attempt to say that we'll look at this with some flexibility but not use the term "monitoring range" And then I would leave that last sentence, I think "The Committee agreed that growth in the aggregates generally may be in the upper parts of their ranges, depending on continuing developments with respect to velocity and provided inflationary pressures remain subdued" How does that package--  Well, let me read the whole thing again This has some preliminary boilerplate sentences, if you go back to get the whole thing, to the effect that the Federal Open Market Committee wishes to do wonderful things "In furtherance of these objectives the Committee at this meeting reaffirmed ranges for the year of 6 to 9 percent for M2 and 6 to 9-1/2 percent for M3 The associated range for total domestic nonfinancial debt was reaffirmed at 9 to 12 percent With respect to M1, the base was moved forward to the second quarter of 1985 and a range was established at 3 to 8 percent in the expectation of a return of velocity growth toward more usual patterns, following a sharp decline in velocity during the first half of the year The appropriateness of the new range will continue to be reexamined in the light of evidence with respect to economic and financial developments, including foreign exchange markets More generally, the Committee agreed that growth in the aggregates may be in the upper parts of their ranges, depending on continuing developments with respect to velocity and provided that inflationary pressures remain subdued"  "Established at an annual rate of 3 to 8 percent"? It sounds awkward That's the way to make it sound lower "established at 1-1/2 to 4 percent"! I guess we say "at an annual rate"  Obviously, if we change the range for the year we have to have a somewhat different sentence here, taken off from the other sentences in the directive But how does that sound?  Where is that?  Why do we need that?  We already have it  It's in the short-term part Why can't we just take that out?  Well, the way I've just written this sentence, what I inserted has some of that sense The appropriateness of the new range just applies to M1 If that general language seems all right, this of course assumes that we rebase It also contains some numbers I don't think there's any dispute with the numbers for M2, M3, and debt I don't know that anybody has any better number to put in for M1 Does anybody have anything further to say about whether we rebase or not? If not, maybe we better vote on this  Let us go on to the 1986 ranges; I'm not sure I remember what we decided on before  I think there was agreement on M2, M3, and debt It would be "The Committee agreed on tentative ranges of monetary growth measured from the fourth quarter of 1985 to the fourth quarter of 1986--" Well, the first question that arises is whether we want to leave M1 in that same sentence or deal with it separately The numbers anyway are 6 to 9 percent for M2; 6 to 9 percent for M3; and the associated range for debt was 8 to 11 percent I think we pretty much agreed on that part Now, whether we leave M1 in this sentence or not, I think we probably would want to say something separately about M1 Wasn't that the sense of where we were? Or we can just leave it I don't know What do you think? There was some disagreement about whether it should be 4 to 8 percent or 4 to 7 percent, with a majority at 4 to 7 percent  It starts out by saying "tentative ranges" I think that's the question whether we somehow want to try to indicate that M1 is even more tentative than usual  "Agreed on tentative ranges for M2 and M3 and an even more tentative range--"  Well, 3 to 8 percent was not in the ballpark when we discussed it earlier I'm not saying we can't do it now I just have the feeling, in light of the earlier discussion, that if they're all left in the first sentence that way, which may be all right, we should put in a sentence saying that the Committee recognized that the behavior of M1 velocity was subject to particular uncertainties that would require reexamination at the beginning of the year or something Does that thought make sense?  I agree  Well, I just wrote a sentence here We could leave M1 in the same sentence at the beginning but then say "With respect to M1 particularly, the Committee recognized that uncertainties surrounding the recent behavior of velocity would require careful reappraisal of the target range at the beginning of 1986"  Whatever number we put in there-- If we put in 3 to 8 percent, we can just say "With respect to M1, the breadth of the target range reflected the uncertainties surrounding velocity, which would require--  That's right '82 and '83  '84 is the only one--MR MORRIS    7/9-10/85  Well, what number do you want to put in for M1?  3 to 7 percent, let me note, is [unintelligible] low  I think the choice is between 4 to 7 percent and 3 to 8 percent Who's for 3 to 8 percent? One, two, three, four [Secretary's note Messrs Martin, Partee, and Wallich, and Ms Seger] Who's for 4 to 7 percent? And we'll see how many are indifferent here between them One, two, three, four, five, six [Secretary's note Messrs Balles, Black, Corrigan, Forrestal, Keehn, and Rice] I guess that says we make it 4 to 7 percent Do we leave it in the same first sentence?  It's partly special now because we put in a special sentence It's a great subtlety as to whether it's doubly special or half the same and half special I don't detect any ground swell to take it out of the first sentence So it would read "For 1986 the Committee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1985 to the fourth quarter of 1986, of 4 to 7 percent for M1, 6 to 9 for M2, and 6 to 9 for M3 The associated range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt was provisionally set at 8 to 11 percent for 1986 With respect to M1 particularly, the Committee recognized that uncertainties surrounding  -72-    7/9-10/85  recent behavior of velocity would require careful reappraisal of the target range at the beginning of 1986" We better change that last sentence "Moreover, in establishing ranges for next year, the Committee also recognized that account would need to be taken of experience with institutional and depositor behavior in response to the completion of deposit rate deregulation early in the year" Does anybody want to suggest any modification of that language? Well, I'll get the question Does that mean it's a monitoring range?  Oh, you don't need it here, but I will be asked That's pretty fuzzy, so I will be asked What do you mean?  If nobody has any improved language to propose here, I think we have 4 to 7 percent, 6 to 9 percent, and 6 to 9 percent  8 to 11 percent [on debt]  All right Now we get to the operational part Forgetting about the language for the moment, what we were saying I think fits this definition of "maintaining the existing degree of pressure," to be interpreted arithmetically, I suppose, as $350 million plus We have a week this week that started out with a  -73-    7/9-10/85  high level of borrowings and we're saying we won't drive the average level of borrowings down to $350 million and push a very easy money market simply to meet that target We make allowances on the up side more than on the down side, depending upon market developments That's what we're doing initially Heaven knows what happens from now on If the money supply continues to rise fast, that certainly is a factor pushing us toward a tighter direction That's easy to say, but suppose that is combined with a tone of worse business news; we'd be pretty cautious about it, I suppose What we may have is a decided weakening of the dollar here We may have broken through this three mark level of the dollar and we may see a continuing decline, which sooner or later probably has to come But if it begins getting momentum, I think that's a factor on the tightening side It's easy to say any one of these things singly When they go in opposite directions at the same time--  They probably will I don't think we can say much except that if this gets extreme enough, we will have a consultation We get a nice clear picture if the dollar is weak, the economy is strengthening and M1 is high; we clearly would be leaning on the tightening side But if things don't all go in that direction, we have a bigger mess I don't know what more we can say about it, really  Well, it's a matter of degree If the economy looks soft, the other aggregates are behaving, and M1 is within the general range here, we might ease, particularly if the dollar were strong Apart from that, we don't have a lot of room for easing anyway, on reserve pressures [The Board] can easily make a change in the discount rate, but we can't get borrowings a heck of a lot lower  Do you want to say "might" and "would"?  [Unintelligible] change the order "In the implementation of policy for the immediate future the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve    7/9-10/85  conditions This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 at annual rates of"--what is that?  Yes, but we don't want 7-1/4 percent in there  Continuing "of around 7-1/2 percent during the period from June to September and with a substantial slowing of M1 to a rate of 5 to 6 percent" We could put that first, if you wanted to  All right Well, I just changed something Instead of just putting that number in parallel [with the others], I said "with a substantial slowing of M1 to a rate of 5 to 6 percent" And then the rest of it would be "might" and "would" There's nothing else there that needs to be changed particularly, is there?  We could But where are we now? We're not quite at the midpoint of a 6 to 9 percent range; well, we're pretty close to the midpoint We could if you wanted to I don't--  Yes, they surely would I might even get a little excited if it went to 6 percent, too  I think the only argument against that-- and I don't even know that it's against it--is that a month from now when this is published the press will play that as an easing, despite what we said earlier I don't know if that's a big deal  6 to 10 percent  I think I would have one somewhat before that  -75-    If it gets to 10 percent, I may not be here to make the telephone call! If nobody has any further comments to make, we will vote  Well, we seem to have worked our way through this Maybe you ought to get some clean typed copies of this [directive], Mr Secretary, and we'll leave the record open for any editorial changes  Just in the normal course of events, you ought to reconsider the projections at this point I would remind you that these are explicitly projections of members of the Committee and are presented on that understanding to the Congress These projections are closer than they usually are, I think There is usually an array of different numbers Under the assumptions made, some of these inflation numbers look high to me I think we have a substantial risk of inflation and worse when and if the dollar goes down, but that's not the assumption of these projections And we will have a real mess on our hands if the dollar goes down sharply We will have a real mess on our hands if it doesn't, which is unpleasant, and which is the measure of our difficulty But I don't know how we turn around this trade balance without overtaxing at this point the industrial side of the economy, apart from the direct effects of the lower exchange rate on higher prices We haven't got 10 percent of spare capacity and that's what it takes--probably more than 10 percent --to produce a trade balance in the course of three or four years  2 percent of GNP And manufacturing is 20 percent of the GNP; it's more than that value added  3 percent of GNP  SPEAKER(?) That's right  7/9-10/85 -76-    7/9-10/85  Three, or more than three We face the prospect of some indefinite number of years ahead of having lower domestic consumption than GNP, lower domestic demand than GNP I don't know how you manage that except by budgetary policy and even then it's not very happy Barring an equally violent shift in fiscal policy from what we've had, I literally don't know how it gets managed If you try to do it by monetary policy, you tighten money and you hit the investment side of the economy--which is precisely the side that has to expand to meet the foreign demand The tax reform bill hits the investment side of the economy and not the consumption side of the economy And you say some of it is in agriculture; I think part of the problem is agriculture The major part of the problem is that people aren't eating enough or the crops are too good in the rest of the world, depending upon which way you want to put it In a residual supply you have a little difficulty in selling to a surplus market  When does the next GNP, or whatever they call it, number come out?  The day before I testify, so I'll know what that is  -77-    7/9-10/85  July 19th  The 17th Oh, it's the day after I testify! I'll get asked what that figure is and I'll have to take a stab Who does that now? Who's the head of that?  That's a terrible day I'll say I think it's really going to be low and then they'll raise it They'll testify the next day with it  House side first I don't know whether the sandwiches are out there Will somebody investigate?  SPEAKER(?) They are out there  Well, I guess the Open Market Committee meeting is over I declare it over   We need to approve the minutes of the last meeting [Secretary's Note Approved without objection]  Comments or questions?  Mr Sternlight    8/20/85  Questions?  [If no one else has] any comments, we might as well turn to Mr Kichline  Mr Axilrod  Now it's all very clear!  What has the old M1A done through this year so far?  It is a little hard to know where to stop  -10-    8/20/85  What does $20 billion amount to--1/4 of one percent?  All these charts here would suggest that we are about to launch into a sizable boom, if you believe that  Well, you could argue, depending upon what lag you put in, that it could be delayed to the fourth quarter  Well, that is the question that I raise  This is the figure that hasn't been published yet?  A characteristic of the forecast you alluded to earlier is that we are going to have--I hate to call it major--a significant change in the trade trend and a weakening of the gross national expenditures of some magnitude That is what the forecast is anyway  Your directors don't seem to think so  What is happening in the energy area? Is there anything new?  Drilling activity is doing what?  -12-    8/20/85  Well, does anyone have a different economic outlook?  There is a lot of evidence that the Northeast is doing better than other areas of the country  Mr Guffey  It doesn't sound like a highly inflationary report  What do you sense land prices are doing now? I was talking to some farmers the other day who claimed that they were going down faster, if anything  Mr Keehn  Mr Forrestal  Any other comments?  Enduring what, these slower rates?  Governor Partee  Ms Seger  -19-    8/20/85  Mr Stern  Governor Rice  Mr Corrigan  To be optimistic  -21-    8/20/85  Maybe we better celebrate with a cup of coffee  [Coffee break]  I would judge from the comments I heard earlier that there isn't much stomach for dramatic new initiatives at this stage of the game, in terms of our own [policy] behavior I think that is a correct conclusion Let me just add a few comments to what was said earlier to summarize and to put some different light on them I think that we are operating in a worldwide situation and sometimes we focus too much on an uncertain outlook for the domestic economy What happens over a period of time, I think, is very dependent on a larger setting Bob Forrestal mentioned being shocked by the protectionist sentiment that he heard That gives an accurate picture of the extent to which that sentiment has built and may be still building And we are going to have quite a different economic situation, I suspect, here and around the world over the next year to 18 months, if we have big protectionist legislation in the remainder  -22-    8/20/85  of this Congressional session I have felt myself a relative optimist in Washington in believing that this can be held off this year I don't have any illusions that it can held off next year, if things don't improve Many many people think that I am unduly optimistic in saying that it can be held off this year; we shall see My optimism is not based on any great analysis other than such things as the fact that the [Congressional] Committees mainly involved that have to originate the legislation fortunately are tied up in tax reform and so forth That is a political excuse for fending off some of this; I don't know whether it will hold  Some reference was made to the dollar this morning I think this is a very sensitive area We can all argue that the dollar should be down for the trade balance and in time it may well have to be But if we achieve that lower dollar in a way that undermines confidence in where we are going, I think we are going to have lots of problems As Jerry Corrigan said, we depend on that inflow of money to finance the budget and maintain reasonably low interest rates And when I look ahead, this clearly is the overwhelming threat on the price front We are going to have to swallow a decline of the dollar over time But how it comes is going to make a big difference as will how fast it comes--whether it is manageable or not I don't know whether it is going down, but just to draw a policy implication It is an interesting conversation when we can talk about whether the dollar has come down very much when it has come down 17 percent or whatever it is in about three months By any historical standards, except the last three or four years, that is an enormous change in the value of the dollar in that period of time Of course, it followed a period during which it went up 17 percent, I suppose, in the previous six months It is a very unstable situation I have a feeling that we are teetering--that is maybe stating it a little too strongly--but we are beginning to run some risk of a loss of confidence in the area We have managed a 17 percent decline without, I think, raising a lot of concerns so far on the confidence front I think we have to be cautious about that We face the situation in terms of the price front where the prices of commodities--many of which are produced in other countries rather than here and not all of them are down here, I guess, but I can't think of a [unintelligible] one--are just terribly low in terms of historical experience relative to other prices [They are below the cost of] American production anyway; I don't know whether they are below the cost of foreign production Some day they probably will have to go up somewhat; but they don't seem to be moving in that direction now There are deflationary forces in certain contexts of the economy; there is no doubt that the prices of services are still going up I think this is a long-term problem; we can't cure that in the short run  I don't have anything to add on all the domestic financial strains that were mentioned by a number of people earlier I would just report that I think the international debt situation is in a period of some fermentation and if we have a break it could easily come there It's not that it would put us under any greater economic strain at the moment but it certainly could put us under greater political strain There is a great deal of restiveness in that area; whether people are going to jump the [unintelligible] and follow the more aggressive interpretations of the Peruvian situation is very much in doubt  -23-    8/20/85  Finally, looking at the growth in industrialized countries, there may be some room for feeling a little better They have taken some easing measures, largely in response to the weakness of the dollar I think that is one of the constructive repercussions of the decline in the dollar, but those measures have come pretty late If you just look at the outlook there, it is hard to build up a great feeling that there is going to be great support for the world economy; it may not be a deterioration but you don't get any sense of great exuberance abroad  I don't think we ought to get in the mood that these problems are all unsolvable They are going to take a lot of work, even in the monetary policy area, and in the regulatory area and other areas Monetary policy has something to do with how it comes out My interpretation of your views is that this isn't the time for strong new tightening or easing, and I share that view We have edged insubstantially tighter in this intermeeting period, reflecting primarily the more rapid growth in M1 I think our discussion last time suggested that that would be appropriate We started out with a notional $350 million borrowing level and never hit it in fact--not always deliberately As the period went on we became more cautious in the provision of reserves but only slightly so So, I think something like an unchanged approach would imply $400 million plus on borrowing I could conceive of a little more substantial tightening if people thought that was appropriate, but I don't know how other people feel about that So let's proceed and get more precise I don't have any feelings about these various [draft] directives, not having read them until about 10 minutes ago I might just say as a preliminary thought that I am not sure these directives--depending on what we do--are very accurate reflections anymore of what we think We really ought to think about rewriting them in a more basic way, but I don't think we can do that in the next--  We will have to change M1 I would like to say that the latest figures that we have on M1 are not terribly different They don't suggest any [big change] in the M1 estimates If anything, they are consistent with a less optimistic view--if that is the way to express it They are slightly stronger but growth is not substantially different from the very high August number we were talking about  Let me interrupt the flow here because I forgot to get confirmation of the transactions of the domestic Desk It occurs to me now and I raise it now or I will forget about  SPEAKER(?) So moved  SPEAKER(?) Second  Without objection Mr Black  Just in the interest of clarity, where do you interpret the federal funds rate to be?  Having had this strong endorsement of Ml, I think it is appropriate that we turn to Mr Morris  Mr Forrestal  Governor Partee  Governor Wallich No, Mr Stern first  Okay, Governor Wallich  It's his best guess It has a probability of 10 percent!  Mr Corrigan  Mr Boykin  Governor Seger  Just in the interest of clarity, the decision last time was something like $350 million tilted toward the high side, with the directive saying that we might move higher if the money supply was higher  -31-    8/20/85  In the context of some other things as well But the dollar was down and the economy [unintelligible] Now, we had an odd week in there  Mr Guffey, I guess you're the only one left out  I would rather describe it as a well balanced, astute, careful-- We have a great predominance, obviously, for "B" with some shadings as to what that means Now, in what way should that be tilted? A range of $350 to $500 million encompasses almost everybody's view; that's a wider range than we normally talk about I want to be ecumenical in this exercise What are borrowings running this week?  Where were we last time?  Well?  That's where you can read it one way or another, depending  -32-    8/20/85  Well, that's one variable We would have to define that a little more Given what we have now on the money supply, it would be awfully hard to get that down over the next three or four weeks to a figure that to many people seems low for the quarter I guess this doesn't answer your question It just raises the question of what you mean by weak  For the quarter?  Well, I'm not objecting to what you say, I'm just saying that as a practical matter--  Well, it might But we're not going to know until shortly before the next meeting That doesn't say we shouldn't do it But since we are going to get a high August, to get down to 8 percent we would have to have-- The projection already is for a lower September I don't know when we next meet; it's the first of October It might become apparent along about September 20 unless something very surprising happens I'm not saying you're wrong; I just wanted--  If we put it in that kind of number, there is no substantial prospect of easing purely on the M1 number for a month That may be all right, but I just want to make clear the implication of what you're saying  The only way it could be different would be if we had a $5 billion drop or something like that right away It would have to happen in next week's figures If I were to write down a number, I would say $400 to $500 million, depending upon the aggregates and the dollar If the economic news clearly weakened, we would have to say that we may go below it If the money supply remained very strong, or if the combination of a strong money supply and a declining dollar produced a progressive loss of confidence or loss of credibility, if that's the right word--I'm very chary of the credibility argument for all the reasons that have been stated [We could have] a great increase of credibility with the monetarists in the short run and if the economy plunges into recession or we have a great financial crisis, we will suffer an enormous loss of credibility in a more basic sense  Well, I don't expect that to happen I think there is something to this credibility issue as appreciated by the markets Whether or not it's dependent upon M1, I am not so sure But I think there's something to it It's not the only factor It depends upon what's happening to bond prices, the gold price, the dollar, and the economy Well, I have to get some expression of consensus here I'd say $400 to $500 million; $450 million is not much different A lot of people just said $350 to $450 million, a little lower than what we have been running  That $350 to $500 million is a wider band than we have been expressing, but I don't think it's unrealistic The starting point or the center of gravity is $425 million, if I average the $350 and $500 million  I don't think that Governor Martin is suggesting that; he's thinking that's the center of gravity of the funds rate with this  Let me just try that, in the interest of evoking a response I don't know what the $350 to $500 million means, except where we start It's kind of an acceptable range within which borrowing would be varied--nothing much different happening from what we have now--depending upon short-term tactics It says that the number that Mr Axilrod would write down would be $425 million If things changed enough so that we deliberately would go above $500 million or below $350 million, it might be a point where we would have an intermeeting consultation anyway  Well, I am afraid I cannot translate it quite that simply You have to tell me some other things that are going to happen too It would certainly go in that direction, if you were just looking at M1 But, if you were telling me that M1 growth was going down at the same time housing starts were coming in at 2 million a year and leading indicators were shooting up and everybody was feeling ebullient about the economy, it might or might not  All other things equal, I would tend to agree with you But if the economy looked as sluggish as it did and all the rest-- I would also remind you We have worried about the dollar falling in an atmosphere of lack of confidence, but if the dollar for some reason were very strong in this period--I don't think we expect that--that would be a factor I'd put certainly on the side of taking my chances with M1 It wouldn't be an atmosphere suggesting lack of confidence and credibility and all of the rest  Well, if it rose exceptionally I would I'm not [sure] the Treasury would even though it would seem to make lots of sense  I have not found that terribly productive but I think if that happened, the question would be raised  Anyone else like to respond to that?  You want an assymmetrical midpoint  That is what makes a horse race Well,--  Well, I would interpret this ordinarily as where we are As I said, we just start at $425 million here And you are right, within experience But I guess I would interpret this wide margin as saying that something outside of that--not necessarily [unintelligible] obviously--might be the occasion for a little mid- meeting discussion  I think this will be a little different twist There is some mistake, I guess, to reading this [unintelligible] as you tell me But I think this is a little different from saying, for instance, $425 million and then raising it a little or [lowering it] without specifying the reasons Excuse me, did somebody have something to say down there?  If you are only looking at the money supply  Well, if I could blink my eyes and wake up tomorrow with a lower dollar and no accompanying change in attitudes [as a result of] that, I might argue that that is a good thing But that is an impossible scenario The question is How do we get a lower dollar if that is what we inevitably have to get over time, without throwing inflation off course, interest rates off course, and without overshooting on the down side, in some short-term sense anyway, and if that would bring more pressure on the industrial sector than we can stand because we are so far behind the eight ball there? And we do have to shift literally--it is going to happen It's not going to happen in the [unintelligible] but it may happen expectationally and in terms of prospects What does it come to now, Mr Truman, with a $150 billion trade deficit--maybe 15 percent of our manufacturing output? If we went from where we are now to balance in two years or three years we wouldn't have the capacity to meet [the  -36-    8/20/85  export demand] without a lot of inflationary pressures, I am afraid, assuming the economy generally isn't otherwise in recession  We are at what [on manufacturing capacity] --roughly 80 percent--if you believe these figures?  That is not going to [happen] It is another way of saying it is impossible to correct the trade balance in that timeframe But if we had a set of conditions that went in that direction and put in that kind of potential demand on our capacity, even though we could not meet it in three years, we would have a [difficult] circumstance in the manufacturing sector of the economy in terms of sustainability, inflationary pressures, or whatever Looking at this more broadly here, we are importing 3 percent or more of the GNP We are consuming 3 percent more than we are producing If we correct that, we are going to have to have some period of time when consumption is rising by 3 percent less than GNP Countries don't find that very easy to do It means lower real incomes If productivity were rising by 3 percent a year, which it is not-- Let's be realistic about it; it could be rising by 1 percent a year; so it takes three years' growth of productivity to do that without increases in real income  Well, I got off the question a bit but--  It's not too much if it doesn't--  Yes One would hope to get it down as fast as when it first began coming down and get it over with and then have a feeling of greater stability Could we take another 4 percent [decline]? That depends, really If people thought we were concerned about 4 percent and concerned about the inflationary impact, we would    8/20/85  get a different situation What I would fear the most is a feeling that we were driving it down, that we were easing policy to drive the dollar down, saying "Let's get this thing going" That, I think, is fraught with danger  The situation with that 4 percent may be that it's the first 10 percent of a 40 percent drop So long as there is a feeling that it's not getting out of hand, I think--  That's my problem We may just have an impossible problem But to the extent the dollar is declining because people feel genuinely better about let's say, Germany and Japan-- Or it could decline against sterling Sterling got very low and to the extent that people feel that was overdone and sterling went up, one result would be a decline in the dollar exchange rate But I don't think that is the kind of thing that sets off great expectational movements in the rate; it is much less likely to I don't know how to quantify it  Yes Just in conceptual terms If there were a firm feeling in the market that the dollar was going to decline gradually, I assure you it would decline suddenly  Now, it might not be the worst thing in the world if it happened--if, as I say, you woke up tomorrow and the dollar was 10 percent lower and people said "That is the end of it We are down there now We have great confidence in the dollar at this lower level" That would be great, but I--  The question is whether they think the first 10 percent is--  Oh, it is not even the suddenness I think we are getting along within limits If it were sudden and people thought it was over, that's fine But I don't know how you arrange that particular scenario What you want is a little constructive uncertainty in the market concerning all the ways it could go  I think we have been pretty lucky so far, that is, with what the dollar has been doing in a very compressed time period But it is so compressed that markets are not going to forget that this trend is pretty clear and sharp Even though we may get stability for one week, it may go down 2 percent the next week So far we have been able to play that quite nicely--again by luck, lots of luck Whether we can continue that, I don't know; it is the best scenario we could have  That may be, and that is a reason why the dollar has to come down But that does not tell you how to get there easily We cannot cure the underlying problem that we are borrowing $150 billion a year abroad  And that you can't dispense with that without it having other consequences  Within limits it is probably not all bad But you are saying tighten up on consumer loans, tighten up on all other kinds of loans What you are saying is higher interest rates That is one consequence, I agree  -39-    8/20/85  I don't know You have to look at manufacturing capacity That is where? You say [85] percent?  Mr Truman has a subtotal of 100 percent capacity utilization  I think that is probably exaggerated a little  That's not going to happen that fast But the tendency, with a sharp enough decline in the dollar, would be in that direction  Well, let us return to an operating decision here We had a proposal on the table  What we are saying in traditional terms is $425 million with a band of flexibility around there that is significant but not huge It's barely significant, I suppose, in terms of its flexibility If we got much beyond that, conditions probably would justify some discussion That, I guess, is fairly obvious  I haven't looked very carefully at these Has anybody thought or felt some strong predilections? We have a couple of alternatives here Which alternative do we start with?  Well, apart from the specifications, we have some language labeled alternative I and alternative II Is there any feeling between alternative I and alternative II, apart from what numbers we pick?  Alternative I spotlights the overshoot on M1; that's the substance of the difference in approach It may be appropriate Having not read it carefully yet, I will express an opinion that the fact that M1 is kind of out of bounds would lean me toward II just in terms of format, not substance, here  That's my offhand feeling Shall we work from alternative II?  All right Let's for the moment work from alternative II I think we are saying "maintain" basically, but that does leave a question in my mind Either here or in the discussion [in the policy record]--maybe we can do it just in the discussion--we might say that we did have an insubstantial firming  We could say here "maintain the degree of pressure on reserve positions sought in recent weeks" and then explain in the policy record that that is very slightly tighter than when we said maintain last time  I would be very delicate in what words we use "A somewhat more cautious provision of reserves" I think is about--  We would have to explain the aberration in the one week and say we approached it a bit more cautiously That's enough Now, what numbers do you want to put in here on M2 and M3?  I don't like to use the quarters  What did we say last time?  -41-    8/20/85  Suppose we said 7 to 8 percent for both of them? One is slightly lower and one is slightly higher but--  Rates of around 7 to 8 percent  Well, I don't feel strongly about it but--  I would have some preference, or more than a slight preference, for not changing the numbers if we don't have to That is the only advantage of 7 to 8 percent, but I will not press the point Would you rather say 7 to 8 percent or 8-1/2 and 6-1/2 percent?  Well, we'll just be wrong on both  I didn't realize they did when you said--  So did I  8-1/2 and 6-1/2 percent "M1 growth is expected to slow markedly--"  Why don't we say "given relatively rapid growth in recent weeks" What number do you want to put in there?  Come on! You wanted to put in a precise number on the others  You prefer 8-1/2 percent to the 8 to 9 percent?  Where does the sense of the meeting lie?  The trouble that I see with that is the 7 percent; it is realistically less than most people think it is going to get to, I guess  Well, take out the "relatively"  That's acceptable?  What number do you want to put in?  In terms of a policy statement, we'd accept [unintelligible] depending upon what we do and given this uncertainty It sounds like the right thing is 8 to 9 percent, but I'm not sure If we have a consensus for 8-1/2 percent, that's fine  8 to 9 percent?  Now, on this next sentence it strikes me that we don't need that "although" part It sounds awfully precise  Yes  What do you want to put in? Well, we'll go to the "woulds" and "mights" First of all, forget about the clause at the end; we'll take that up separately Just on this standard phrase about somewhat greater or somewhat lesser restraint, the issue is Do we want a sentence like that?  In the absence of any objection we will have a sentence like this Now we have to discuss whether to put in "mights" or "woulds" Is there some expression for "mights"? What's the--  We're just talking about the first sentence  I think we did  Well, we did it slightly On this basis too I--  It's not very substantial  Well, how many opt for "would"?  How many are for "might"? I suppose 5; I count 4; somebody is not voting  Tentatively, we have "would," [not] I guess by an enormous majority Now, the next sentence We had "might" last time  SPEAKER(?) I'd say it should be "would"  Let me propose that we put in a "would" here too but leave out the bottom part  Is the last part of that sentence off?  SPEAKER(?) Yes  Somebody suggested that in this next sentence we move up "foreign exchange markets"  How would you do it specifically? I don't disagree with the sentiment, but that's--  This is the kind of thing I had in mind I don't know whether we can make this any more substantial and I don't know whether--  Yes, that's the problem with changing it In substance, I don't know whether we should do it for the reasons Governor Martin suggested but in a short-term tactical sense it belongs there But these other things are very important and provide the general background I guess it would be--  No "In either case such a change would be considered in the context of appraisals of the strength of the business expansion and--" What's the word "conditions"?  --"developments in foreign exchange markets, progress against inflation and conditions in domestic and international credit markets"  SPEAKER(?) Yes  "Changes in developments in foreign exchange markets"  Where is this "acceptable"?  Why don't we leave that  Also take it out  [Unintelligible] acceptable and--  Do we put the "acceptable" back in?  SEVERAL Yes  Does anybody have any other comments or suggestions on the whole package?  "In either case such a change would be considered in the context of appraisals of the strength of the business expansion, developments in foreign exchange markets, progress against inflation, and conditions in domestic and international credit markets"  Out They are both "woulds" and "acceptable" Well, we're going to vote unless somebody has a--  6 to 10 percent at the bottom and borrowing of $425 million, which is about where we are now and with flexibility around there in either direction depending on the money supply and other circumstances  We're having a luncheon for Governor Gramley  END OF MEETING  -48-       They all got unwound in an orderly way?  Any comments or questions? We need to ratify the transactions  Without objection Mr Kichline  Where is the dollar today, roughly, compared with the second-quarter average?  Any other questions or comments?  From which you've already had a 12 percent decline?  No more questions or comments on the business situation? If not, we'll turn to Mr Axilrod  Well, I assume that they're going to come later  Now, who would like to comment? We've run out of staff; it's up to the Committee  I don't know about the credit card explanation but I have a couple of charts in front of me depicting just a very simple part of velocity, M1 velocity, with various lines And it just stands out in these charts that--well, just how it looks depends upon the lag--there has been a flatness or a downward tilt for four years now This chart shows a break in trend, not just this year, or not just in '83 It has been flat for four years  Well, this began before that I think, but I don't know what the connection is  Mr Morris  You didn't look beyond M2?  You didn't look at M3 and liquidity and debt?  Mr Black  We may need some  Well, why don't you just review this little frightening exercise you did yesterday, Mr Truman  The first case meaning let interest rates go up but--    10/1/85  That's your extreme assumption?  It doesn't go up beyond what it otherwise would  From what they would otherwise have been  I don't want to get involved with the particular numbers, but what these exercises illustrate is that if you take extreme--I hope extreme--assumptions and you're going to correct that $150 billion current account deficit, you have a helluva relocation from domestic consumption to the external sector You would have what's going on in Latin America where they have had no increase in domestic consumption while they are putting all [their expanding production] in exports And unless events force some of it out of domestic consumption, you have a helluva inflationary impact    10/1/85  and capacity problems and employment goes up and unemployment goes way down  In your little exercise where you kept the GNP where it otherwise would have been, Mr Truman, what kind of interest rates did you get?  Well, I think--  Well, you see more of that excess capacity, I think, than I do It's arbitrary  I would note that our trade deficit, largely in manufactured goods, is the equivalent of something like 16 to 17 percent of manufacturing output  That's probably right  Well, we're in trouble politically the way things are now and I think it's unsustainable That's a pretty good definition of trouble in terms of the overall performance of the economy, employment--  Not sacrifice output  Which could most logically come by cutting the federal budget deficit  Why don't we have a little presentation at the next meeting? I hope that's not too late But I think these issues are clearly at the heart of our problem  We have a disequilibrium in the economy How do we correct it? Frankly, how to correct it--to produce a nice smooth correction--is not all within our power, I'm afraid There are certain extraneous forces that are going to foul us up Well, I think we better have a doughnut after this  [Coffee break]  I think our discussion [about the exchange value of the dollar] needs further elaboration, because the problem is evident in what was said The success of countries in the past of pushing their own currencies down without creating problems is extremely limited In fact, I don't know of any case where any country has done this and been happy about the end result Just to sharpen the dilemmas a bit, the funds rate has been up the last couple of days over the course of the [quarter-end] statement date Ordinarily, we would think that [rise] would have a strengthening effect on the dollar; the dollar is weakening quite a lot today The latest money supply figures are down rather significantly, so the possibility of a minus in October is not remote, given the [September] average that we start with These are very fragmentary data; I hate to even mention them on this unfortunate day, Tuesday, when we get this fragmentary information [The weakness] may loom larger tomorrow and remain We do not have a weekly figure but a fragmentary    10/1/85  indication of a weekly figure But September looks lower than was projected and October may be starting lower  September started higher  Well, there hasn't been much discussion of the straightforward business scene or the inflationary scene or anything else while we, I think usefully, were preoccupied with the basic [dollar] adjustment problem I think we can proceed and go around the table Mr Black  Well, time is passing, so if you want to be more specific, you can  These new numbers, if they stand up, will reduce September by about 2 percentage points or more  I think we can stipulate that  Mr Forrestal  And a very low saving rate  Just in terms of the discussion, I think we should leave that until the last because, on the face of it, that's not substantive Mr Corrigan  Some of them may even want it  You have the vote protecting money?  Governor Martin  Mr Keehn  Mrs Horn  I hope you encourage that discussion  Let me just make an observation on this price situation The recent figures look pretty good and promise that we will have overestimated [the rate of inflation] for the fifth consecutive year in our projections But I don't think there is any doubt that inflationary expectations in the longer-run sense in some anemic way are increasing The survey evidence--what we have--says that But I feel it in my bones too that fooling around with the dollar and questions about the dollar may restrict Federal Reserve freedom of action It tends to go in that direction It is not an abrupt or major thing, but I think it is quite clear--just when you go out and make speeches--that people are much more open about saying that than they would have been six months ago  Governor Partee  I am confused about the things you are worried about an increase in money for four years and an increase in investment for four years When does it become timely to do something about it?  Until the crash comes a passive approach Mr Morris  Mr Guffey  Ms Seger  Governor Rice  Well, I don't know what I can add to all that discussion since every contingency and every threat has been mentioned by somebody There are a lot of contingencies In the broadest sense, we are constrained by circumstances I wouldn't put all that much emphasis on the G-5 matter; we're constrained by more fundamental contingencies on either side But I wouldn't interpret that too strictly in the short run I don't know what is going to happen in a number of dimensions A lot of people talk about the economy being a little stronger in tone I think that's probably right, but against the background of the money supply figures in particular--Governor Partee said he could imagine [real GNP growth] going to 4 percent--I could imagine it going to a lot more than 4 percent under a certain set of circumstances All you need is a kick in those inventories and a downward movement in the trade balance at the same time and you could get quite a little kick I'm not sure I would predict that, but I don't think it's out of the bounds of possibility And that makes those money supply figures look more in accordance with historical experience, and everybody has expressed uneasiness about what that means  I do think that everybody--well, not quite everybody--but it's clear where the center of gravity lies I don't disagree with that at all I think the most likely risk we face--or the one I worry about the most, let me put it that way--is that the dollar may decline too far too fast and create inflationary expectations and eventually inflation If it does pass some point of undermining confidence, it's going to be very hard to manage and it's going to produce higher interest rates That's the real threat of a sudden drop in the dollar decidedly higher interest rates as well as inflation Worrying about 1/8 or 1/4 point on interest rates now will pale in significance compared to the kind of direction Mr Truman was alluding to if those kinds of conditions ever arose That would really throw a lot of things off course, beginning with the debt situation and  -23-    10/1/85  recession and possibly agriculture; you name it That's the one threat that gives me nightmares as I look ahead For that reason, I think it's counterproductive to give any signals that we are easing at the moment It would just create additional risks of that happening I'm not talking about a month from now or something If the money supply gets weaker and the economic news is weak--if we had a clear basis for easing--we should ease I don't think we have that clear basis right now I would also say that if we had a clear basis for tightening, we should tighten If that arises it's going to arise, I suspect, more from the dollar side But if we continued to get big increases in M1 combined with a real strengthening in the economy, I don't think we would have much choice, whatever the G-5 says There are no commitments made there But for the moment, I think we are in the area of what is loosely called "B"  I would also suggest that a certain amount of unusual maneuvering room is needed in the short run, within a narrow range, because I think a lot does depend on almost day-to-day psychology in the exchange markets We can lean a little toward the easier side if the dollar is strong and we're having a great test on the up side, and we can lean on the other side if the dollar decline appears to be building up momentum there At the moment that's where the momentum is, if it has any momentum That could change any day, I well recognize But I would come out about where most people are in terms of something like a $500 million borrowing level as a center of gravity, but I'd be prepared to go moderately above that or potentially moderately below that in day-to-day or week-to-week tactics, depending particularly upon the dollar; but as the weeks go by it also would depend upon the money supply and the economy We are now in a period where I think within a limit--I don't know whether I'd call it $425 to $575 million or $400 to $600 million, or something in that area--we could use a little maneuverability And I think that is consistent with a federal funds rate somewhere around 8 percent or a bit higher or lower; I'm thinking about 8 percent or a shade below 8 percent  Well, relatively small I don't know if it's any smaller in some sense than they have been playing I am a little influenced at the moment, inevitably, by the fact that the odds on a slowing in the aggregates look a little better to me now than they might have a week or two ago We had a big decline last week and little change this week There may be a sizable decline in the following week three weeks in a row of decline I think it's so high that I wouldn't respond immediately by easing; I would be more inclined--  It certainly would be a factor in saying we would be less eager to tighten if other things are pointing in that direction It's simple if everything is pointing in the same direction If the dollar were rebounding, with M1 softer and the economy looking rather weak, it's easy--ease The problem arises when these signals are not all in the same direction in a specific period  -24-    10/1/85  On the contrary, if the dollar were softening, with M1 continuing high and the business picture looking better, tighten That's too easy when all of them are moving that consistently I think that's what the directive ought to say, whatever the particular form that if all these things--or the weight of them--are moving in one direction or the other, we would ease or tighten It's perfectly reasonable  Well, I see it as symmetrical in an analytic sense My gut feeling is that it continues to-- Well, the one thing I really worry about is the dollar getting out of hand on the down side It's--  Well, I am talking about very short-run tactics At this moment you get the impression that we're a "captive" as some people put it, and we have to ease to get the dollar down The dollar has come down quite a lot I am very sensitive to the psychology going the other way, based upon all we have experienced here and abroad as to what happens sometimes when the market gets to expecting ease Maybe everybody is ready We will have a great test on the up side I would much rather have a test on the up side and do a lot of intervening and maybe ease a bit, than I would a test on the down side The upside test is much more manageable than the downside test There is no catastrophe if the dollar gets a little stronger than it has been and we have to do a lot of intervening and we even have to ease a little I don't see any lasting damage from that scenario, except that politically it undercuts the anti-protectionism [position] but I don't know how much weight to put on that in terms of sensitivity to day-to-day developments It's a question of what and where When I look at the broad strategy down the road--inflation, and all the rest--I am more worried, though I don't know which is more probable, about the risks we run from a deteriorating dollar if it got out of hand than the others I'm not worried about the current level but I don't know how much longer [unintelligible] I would say with all the hoopla this thing gets that there is a lot of sensitivity to this point I see it was in the papers that there was some insistence in the G-5 meeting that they redo the language of the statement to get the word "orderly" or the wording "orderly decline or orderly rise" in there That was a Latin American inspiration; they among others were sensitive to this point Nobody pays any attention to it, but it reflects that concern that this could get out of hand I'm not saying anything different here about the [borrowing] numbers than anybody else was saying But I am suggesting some tolerance of some day-to- day, week-to-week maneuvering, influenced by the dollar but against a background of these other things  Not particularly during a period when the dollar is weak I would if the dollar were surging up; I would not under today's conditions in the market If we were having a great test on the up side, we would not choose those days for making any tightening move If anything, we would resolve our doubts in the other direction, if that's the direction we think we are going  Well, I'm not saying we aim above 8 percent I would accept something like, say, $500 million, which is the figure most people picked one way or another as the center of gravity And that's where we would aim as a kind of starting point  It would be 8 percent or a little below, I would guess We don't know; we often get caught in just implementing policy during the week that things do not turn out the way we expected because of a bad projection or for some other reason How frozen are you to pushing toward $500 million if it is above $500 million and the market is already easing or vice versa? I don't think this is a period when we want to give these day-to-day signals that may be contrary to our basic intention, in an effort to get a lower or a higher [borrowed] reserve figure because that is mechanically what we are supposed to be hitting I guess what I am saying is that this is an operating technique The basic point remains We meet fairly soon, of course, for our next meeting But if everything or the great weight of evidence was in one direction or another, these directives always call for changing the center of gravity either in an easing or a tightening direction I say an easing or a tightening direction, but my own suspicion is that I wouldn't expect either, outside of that range I talked about Given how high the money supply already is, given that the dollar is moving lower, given a little better feeling about the economy, I would be prepared to tighten if all those things came down in that direction Well, I don't think we'd do anything drastic in the next 5 weeks but we could lean more consistently toward the $600 million than less  So I am told by the Secretary  Of course, we could always have a consultation in between, and I would presume we would if we were going to make a really big change It's hard for me to conceive of--I shouldn't be so flat-footed I should say I would be surprised if we wanted to go below $400 million or above $600 million as the center of gravity, as opposed to in a particular week in the next five weeks  -26-    10/1/85  I don't know We went from $400 to $500 million with no change in the tone of the markets  If Mr Corrigan's banks have computer problems, or at least alleged computer problems, they borrow more for a week than we do with all our open market operations  In that connection, I'll make an ad hoc comment--not about computer problems in particular This happens mostly with a handful of very large banks They waltz in at 530 on a Wednesday afternoon when the funds rate has been 7-1/2 or 7-3/4 percent all day and it gets to 9 percent at 530 on Wednesday afternoon and they say very conveniently "Whoops, we're in overdraft and we want to borrow from you" I think they ought to be told to go shove it  I will modify that comment; I'd tell them the next time they can go shove it But, we have this question of the directive What we are talking about in terms of the numbers in the directive is alternative B I think we are saying "maintain" There is this question we need to deal with about whether we say that we expect M1 to exceed the range for the year Obviously, that seems highly probable although less certain this minute I don't think it's absolutely certain--highly probable but not absolutely certain--if we get a big decline in October I think some are in favor of changing that if we are [positive]; maybe we should face up to that if we are It raises the question of whether we should say so publicly I haven't any very convenient occasion to do that right now; I would hate to go out and make a special announcement just on this If we do, it lends itself directly to the interpretation that we picked this particular time to ease policy because of the exchange market situation, which I think would be unfortunate I don't think we want to give that impression So we're caught in a dilemma We may face this as a fact, but it's a bit awkward We may have a probable occurrence, but is it that much more apparent this month instead of last month, let's say that we are compelled to make an announcement? It's almost bound to be misinterpreted, simply because it will be interpreted in the light of this exchange market  That is certainly true, and that would take care of this announcement  Well, let's leave this out then But if we are even more convinced 5 weeks from now, then we ought to decide it Now, I'm not sure I looked at all these variants that closely, but the main theme is what not sticking M1 in the same sentence with the others?  Let me have a short recess for 15 seconds to understand what the difference is between these variants The first sentence is the same  I guess there is no difference between them, but shouldn't it say the degree of pressure on reserve positions "sought in recent weeks"?  Didn't we have this small change?  Well, let me just see where the changes are "This action is expected to be consistent with--"  Well, you have no differences between them in the first three sentences  We're combining in one sentence what we said in three sentences  Well, I think one can exaggerate the difference between these two variants The fact is that the second one is somewhat less cumbersome  Well, it seems to me either of these versions ought to say "sought in recent weeks" in sentence number one since we did change it, however modestly, during the last period And we're talking about "maintain" I think What are we putting in here in either version? What do we say--  6 to 7 percent? Is that--  Annual rates of "about 6 to 7 percent" or "6 to 7 percent"? With 6 to 7 percent, does anybody want an "about" or "around" in there? ,    10/1/85  "M1 growth is expected to slow--" Heavens, I don't know whether it is going to slow  It leaves it plenty open there  My version doesn't say anything about marked  SPEAKER(?) I think it's in variant II  SPEAKER(?) I thought you wanted variant II  Oh, I'm sorry Okay  Okay, I guess we really are expecting a marked decline  What do we want to say here 6 to 7 percent or something? Everything is 6 to 7 percent  We took out this sentence What do people think about that? "Slower growth would be appropriate--"  SPEAKER(?) "Would be acceptable"  You want to put it back in?  Yes, just M1  It would have a semicolon or something Let me ask you the question I wouldn't say "even"--  So it's "slower growth over the next three months would be acceptable"--  --"in the context of satisfactory economic performance" Do you want that phrase "given the recent rapid growth" in?  I'm not hearing any dissents on that, so that phrase goes in either version Now, we have "somewhat greater or lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable" with a number of alternatives here Who prefers variant II?  Only two people, Governors Martin and Seger Add Governor Partee  Well, I'm just skipping from that to simply who wants to combine three sentences into one sentence  Mr Keehn, did you have your hand up?  -31-    10/1/85  I'll rephrase it I would declare there is no difference in substance, as near as I can see But the change is considered by some, and I think it's probably true, more accurate and a better [representation of] what we're actually doing  No, no It's in  Why are you troubled with that?  Well, I think that's a fair consideration I'm not sure they can read too much into this except less emphasis on the aggregates What do you have besides the [unintelligible] variant II? I'm not hung up on this because we've gone too many months in which there has been the proviso that [unintelligible] has been operative since 1979  Well, I asked how many preferred variant II Maybe a lot of people are neutral here How many have a distinct preference for variant I? [Secretary's note Messrs Balles and Black] About as many votes as for variant II How many--  -32-    10/1/85  That's another way How many people don't care? That's a majority  I must say that at this point it doesn't make any difference to me I guess I'm with all those who stuck up their hands in the middle, but I-  We need one of those fancy electronic gadgets that people can squeeze so they can measure the intensity of feelings  Well, that's what I'm trying to do Who feels intensely about this? [Turning to Mr Black] You're going to vote against this, anyway, so--  Well, okay Just let me get an expression --I realize it's no big deal--[of preferences] How many would have some preference for I? One, two, three, four [Secretary's note Messrs Balles, Black, Forrestal and Rice] How many would have some preference for II? Four [Secretary's note Messrs Keehn, Martin, Partee and Ms Seger]  Maybe I should read it more carefully  -33    10/1/85  Do you have any comment about this subject, Mr Axilrod?  Well, I just thought of adding three words here that make them maybe exactly the same, but more condensed Leave it variant II, but after the first comma--after "depending on the behavior of the aggregates" add "taking account of" before "appraisals of the strength in business expansion, developments in foreign exchange markets," etc  Does that strike anybody as an improvement?  All right Let's just do it that way Add these words "taking account of" Does that make it--  -34-    10/1/85  And then for the federal funds rate I guess we're sticking with 6 to 10 percent, right?  Yes What we have is take out the word "existing" and say "maintain the degree of pressure on reserve positions sought in recent weeks"  "This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from September to December at annual rates of 6 to 7 percent A marked slowing in M1 growth to a 6 to 7 percent annual rate is also anticipated; slower growth over the next three months would be acceptable"--not appropriate, but acceptable--"in the context of satisfactory economic performance, given recent very rapid growth in M1 Somewhat greater or lesser reserve restraint" That's right, we didn't discuss that Do we just leave in the somewhat greater or lesser reserve restraint respectively?  Okay, take out the parenthetic phrase and continue "Somewhat greater or lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable depending on behavior of the aggregates, taking account of appraisals of the strength of the business expansion, developments in foreign exchange markets" and so forth Then "The Chairman may call for consultation if it appears that reserve conditionsare likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 6 to 10 percent" Now, I take it that's a common denominator We have this little discretion of day-to-day or week-to-week operational flexibility around $500 million influenced--not solely--but influenced by exchange market problems in the context of these other developments And certainly, if we were really aiming in a semi- permanent way as high as $600 million or as low as $400 million--as opposed to a weekly decision to go to one of those numbers--we would just have a consultation Understood? I guess we can vote  Okay, thank you I guess we're finished We meet again in five weeks Lunch is over in the other building   In Germany?  Any other questions? We have a recommendation to renew the swap arrangements  [Secretary's Note Motions to renew the swap arrangements and to ratify the transactions in foreign currencies were made, seconded, and approved without objection]  Any discussion?  Any other questions? If not, we have to ratify those transactions  Without objection We can go home unless you want to hear an economic report Mr Kichline are you prepared to give an economic report?  You want to go home?  We'll see you all in the morning  [Meeting recessed]    11/4-5/85  November 5, 1985--Morning Session  Comments?  Does anyone have any more comments on the business scene?  Mrs Horn  Governor Martin  Mr Boykin  Mr Forrestal  Who is?  Mr Black  Mr Keehn  We haven't had the last 10 days' auto sales yet have we?  Mr Melzer  The first I've heard  Mr Stern  Mr Balles  -12-    11/4-5/85  What are you assuming in your budgetary projections about a farm bill?  Not real?  [Unintelligible] pretty optimistic-- that's [unintelligible] Why did you lower prices in your forecast?  Well, I'm looking at any of them--gross domestic business product deflator  Excluding food and energy  Governor Seger  Do you ever find a businessman worried about his ability to raise prices when-- They like that  Governor Partee  You have made our forecast a bogey  You seem to be a GNP targeter  I am not sure that the Committee has accepted that Mr Boehne  Mr Guffey  Let's turn to Mr Axilrod  The only long-term fixed rate borrower we have is the US Treasury I think there is very little in that idea  First of all, I don't think the difference in their rate levels will be visible to the naked eye; and I think yes, that is a possibility  In fact, I don't think there are many private borrowers out there in the long-term markets  It's probably related more to the short- term rates  Some of it is fixed rate and some of it is floating rate  If we want to do it for a particular reason, we presumably want to signal  The only argument I hear for buying long- term issues is that the market expects us to buy long-term issues in some [unintelligible] or that we expect ourselves to buy long-term issues and, therefore, we ought to buy them  But we buy them once in a while, you know For what reasons, it's not quite clear to me  M1 is very high Well, I think our problem on that is relatively simple and difficult at the same time I don't attach a lot of weight to small changes in this forecast, whether it's prices or GNP within the ranges that are set I don't think that we know what GNP is going to be in this quarter Things have somewhat less than an ebullient tone to them, so I think "Fair enough; one might think of easing slightly if the dollar gave one room to do that" I am not sure it does right at the moment, but that's [unintelligible] a shorter-run perspective I am considerably concerned that a continuing sharp decline and a real change in sentiment there, which I think we're on the edge of, would give us more difficulties than we bargained for And whatever we do has to take that into account The stronger the dollar is, the more we can ease; the weaker it is, the more stuck we are  Well, it's all a matter of judgment The intervention that took place when we were intervening heavily is what two weeks old? The big intervention was what ten days ago? Since then the markets definitely have been on the other side How much of this is short term? It could go back the other way; I don't know I wouldn't be unhappy if it went back the other way; it will give us a little more room But this is all a fairly narrow focus Mr Morris  I think there is another element that could arise I don't know what the odds are, but if Congress really passed one of these budget resolutions that calls for a sharply lower deficit than I think is at all probable in the current fiscal year, it necessarily follows that within weeks after they passed this bill, I presume, they would have to do something to cut expenditures in a big way I might point out that the way some of those bills are written, it could include the Federal Reserve Then I think we have a kind of platform, and maybe a necessity, for seeing that interest rates go down I don't know how much easing that would take; they might go down by themselves  I don't know what the odds are on something like that happening I am totally confused by this process; I don't know whether it is all a game, whether there is any chance that they are going to get together, or whether they are carefully making positions that are mutually inconsistent so [unintelligible] They may end up with a bill that is vetoed If it happened that we  -21-    11/4-5/85  got a dramatic difference in the budget, in one sense it would be constructive and in another sense it may be rather chaotic if they do it in a hurry Then I think we have a new ingredient that we'd have to take into account  I don't think that it's going to make much of a difference--maybe in the short run I don't know how good that survey is Retail sales are assumed to be down because of auto sales; I guess you look at the rest of it  That's sort of where I am  Well, let's not assume too much  Well, looking at operational policy in our usual format, I didn't hear anybody talking about anything that sounded like alternative C I suppose it's impossible that the monetary numbers would come out that low Who knows? But I don't think anybody wants to drive them there, if I heard the conversation correctly The difference between "A" and "B" in the actual numbers I'm not sure is big enough to send anybody very much We had 6 to 7 percent last time We're in one of these mid-quarter periods when, just as a matter of form, I prefer to make fewer changes rather than more in these targets that we don't meet anyway But--  Well, that is my inclination unless somebody--although where we had them was 6 to 7 percent and that may be a little high  -22-    11/4-5/85  I think it was--  --6 to 7 percent for all of them We can easily say around 6 percent for all of them without it being a substantial change But in terms of the borrowing and our actual operations, I heard more worries about being too tight than too easy purely on the domestic business outlook, which is not the whole equation, certainly From the standpoint of the international debt situation and a lot of other things if interest rates came down, it would be nice On the other hand, I continue to be impressed by the amount of credit that this economy is dealing out, including in the real estate construction area I'm not sure that inviting it to spew out a little more is in the long-term interest of anything But there we are Right now, as I suggested before, I would look toward not making any very startling changes; but if the dollar really gave us the opportunity or--more remotely but conceivably--if the budget gave us more opportunity, I'd be alert to go down in the absence of any new striking news in the other direction There's a slightly peculiar situation in the market right now We have had borrowing low all week but the federal funds rate is higher than one would expect, presumably in reaction to Treasury financings I presume that's just a passing phenomenon and that the market doesn't seem to be taking it seriously Well, let's see what others have to say  Well, I don't know I have no idea what's coming out I don't particularly expect this, but I suppose one possibility is that they could pass something that virtually demanded expenditure cuts pretty quickly I don't know how you avoid them if they pass something The budget is clearly running above what they say I can see how they might ignore this law next year if they pass it; it's a little hard to see how they ignore it three weeks after they pass it I have no idea what's going to come out of this I would think from the Administration's standpoint, Congress has managed to screw it up enough that the bill would end up being vetoed, so you have nothing I would think that may be the most likely scenario--or that they just never agree so they finally pass the debt ceiling bill and they give in on the thing  Or they could pass it in the Senate version and could say that it has no implications for this year so they'll think about it next September, in which case it would not have much implication for us either, I guess Any one of the above [is possible], and I have no idea how it's going to come out  Well, I think we ought to leave ourselves a little range on the dollar side I don't mind consulting when the change gets significant in any event, but a little week-to-week flexibility or two-week flexibility is useful  Well, what do have now $400-$600 million?  $350 to $550 million I think we're in that neighborhood someplace  Just in case we get too involved in the numerology here These are always starting points and if something else happens, we can go below it or above it  SEVERAL Sure  It's clear enough Mr Melzer  I might say in that connection, just in case there's any uncertainty around the table, that this move of the Japanese to increase their rates came out of the clear blue sky as far as I am concerned I still don't quite comprehend it I'm not sure, but in the larger scheme of things I assume they did it--maybe it will affect the yen in the short run--given that the Japanese economy is    11/4-5/85  not showing much pep and that they just absolutely are blocked on the fiscal policy side It's not the move that I would have chosen  It goes I think in the wrong basic direction Excuse me  Well, let me introduce another small refinement, given where the dollar is now and given the greater hesitancy in the market and all the rest It is given that there are risks on both sides But given the risks of this thing getting a little out of hand--in terms of speed anyway--I guess I don't see much point in intervening aggressively to push the dollar down or to hold it down If the dollar is all that strong, in the short run it might be that the proper response is through a modest monetary policy change rather than trying to do it by intervention It takes a little flexibility to get it on the monetary policy side So, intervening very heavily increases the risk you are talking about it freezes us; it has the opposite effect  I am not sure I see that distinction  It is down  I know  I'm not talking about the long run--  -26-    11/4-5/85  They would like the yen at about 120 and--  Precisely The dollar going down isn't a free ride That's what the people were supposed to demonstrate yesterday It may have to get down over a period of time; it probably does How it gets there and what the accompanying policies are makes all the difference  Then if domestic business looks somewhat on the softer side, then it is an opportunity to ease--to lower interest rates  Well, then we're in the dilemma that we have been in for years You have a simple choice What sector of the economy takes the rap for inflation?  This is all very useful, but I detect that we have a rather more limited range of possibilities I think this conversation is very relevant, but I don't know whether you want to extend the general conversation or focus on just what we put down here for a directive  Making it 5 to 6 percent [unintelligible], I guess--that's one possibility We could just reduce it from 6 to 7 percent to 5 to 6 percent  What this will be, I suppose, is "maintain the existing degree" It has fluctuated a little  If you take the most recent week, it's down below $400 million, I presume The most recent 2 weeks--  But all these words imply more precision than we have had in the last 4- or 5-week period in terms of a precise level of borrowing Most of the time we have been below what we are talking about  Well, it wouldn't bother me But I'm just wondering whether there is some word in that first sentence that implies something consistent with the existing degree but also implies a little broader interpretation of what the existing degree is  We could say "about the existing degree" We could say "seeks to generally maintain about" Do we put in 5 to 6 percent or 5 to 7 percent?  Do we still say "a marked slowing of M1 growth"? It depends It's certainly true for the quarter But it is not exactly true if you take October as the base I guess it's over the period there as a whole  Well, I don't feel strongly about this but that implies that we drop out the other part of the sentence that says we don't mind if M1 comes in quite low Do you want to drop that out or not? As I look at it, it might be useful to keep that  5 to 6 percent is what's anticipated Well, I am not sure how much that captures what we are talking about "The Committee seeks to generally maintain about the existing degree of pressure" Then it is "6 percent," "6 percent" again, and "slower growth would be acceptable"  The way it is written now there is one verb for both of them How do we split it? We used to split it Now it seems to take a radical change in language  -29-    11/4-5/85  Boy, I tell you! That really emphasizes it  Well, it's just a matter of language We say "generally;" "about 6 percent for M2 and M3;" and "6 percent for Ml" Then "Slower growth of that aggregate would be acceptable in the context of satisfactory economic performance, given the very rapid growth in M1 over the summer Somewhat greater reserve restraint might and somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable" We leave the range of 6 to 10 percent [for the funds rate] Now, does anybody have improvements on that language?  We have one vote for both "woulds" The borrowing range we're talking about is roughly $400 to $600 million; the possibility of making that $350 to $550 million has been broached I don't think there is an enormous difference between those two Mechanically, it's $50 million  Well, I think that depends a little You say start off at $500 million; I don't think we will want to go to $500 million this week when the federal funds rate is high, although the dollar is [weak] Even with the dollar weak, with the federal funds rate as high as it is, we weren't anxious to go to $500 million this week It may have been what we had in the path but we--  I would say consistent with $350 to $550 million, the center of gravity would be a little less than $500 million but not much I would say something like $475 million, which is right in the middle No it's not; it's $450 million I can't do my arithmetic right!  -30-    11/4-5/85  If the dollar was not weak, I see nothing the matter with that; certainly, you wouldn't expect it to stay where it is now And I think there is no expectation in the market, as near as I can see, that that's the appropriate funds rate  I don't have that mechanical a test--that it takes ten consecutive days of decline  I am not sure I can describe it purely in exchange rate terms, although obviously a weak dollar means that the exchange rate is tending to weaken However, when you try to quantify that, I don't know Sometimes it doesn't feel good  If we were actively intervening on kind of both sides, that would be a good test Two weeks ago, or whenever it was that the dollar had a little strong feeling to it, there was a lot of intervention to keep it from going up It was clearly, in that time period, strong I would say in the last week it has been a bit on the weak side  That would be one of my measures If it was just the yen and it wasn't infecting the psychology generally and rates generally, we would have a different situation But that's not what we had in the last week I guess the movement was greatest against the yen, but it was clearly affecting the others too I suppose the preferable thing, if the yen really got weaker, is that the Japanese might ease up a bit, but I don't think they'll do it That might be the better way to do it  If the dollar is weak, you can see it in the market, but I don't think you can measure it by the extent of a mechanical measure or movement  One way of getting out of it is to have a bad policy  Well, so we divide it up What borrowing level are we talking about? Who prefers $350 to $550 million?  I think the alternative can be anything anybody thinks of  Somebody expressed an opinion of $400 to $600 million, staying right where we are That's slightly higher but others may be lower  At this point, you have any choice at all, but I don't know if anybody's going to join you  Well, who wants it higher? Who prefers higher than that? Well, do you prefer slightly higher than $350 to $550 million? I don't hear anybody expressing that These differences are very small The other alternative, I guess is Who prefers slightly lower than that?  We have one on each side, so I--  I think $350 to $550 million is the closest we're going to come to a consensus  I have no problem with $450 million being the center of gravity But--  -32-    11/4-5/85  An illustration of that, if I am not wrong, is that when we were above $500 million the funds rate was below 8 percent and now that we are at $375 million, it is above 8 percent  My guess is that it would be a federal funds rate slightly below 8 percent--or maybe even more than slightly --depending upon expectations in the market It isn't very reliable from week to week If people think rates are going down, the federal funds rate will probably go down; if they think they are going to go up, it is going to go up It sits there for several weeks until people change their minds  We have a situation where in the past few days it has been above 8 percent If the statistics are right, the market is going to be quite easy tomorrow, but that will show up maybe at 430 in the afternoon In the previous two-week period, it was below 8 percent most of the time and showed up in a tight money market what--at 530 in the afternoon? For a whole day it was above 8 percent on that Wednesday I think we are at the center of gravity as nearly as I can see We are left with what flexibility there is around it  But the plan gets a little tricky here I think we have been avoiding, except in more extreme cases--well, not that extreme, but 1/4 percent, 3/8 percent above where we would expect it to be--just intervening on the basis of the federal funds rate, because then you really feed this notion that we are going to guide the federal funds rate within an eighth or within a quarter We got in trouble in the past with that and I want to avoid it if I can  At 10-1/4 percent, we'd probably put some money in, even if it is contrary to what the statistics seemed to show  Yes, if it's 10 1/4 percent in the morning, I think that might suggest something is the matter  But that's an outside [case] If it were 8-1/2 percent or something, it's a more difficult question It may well happen tomorrow that the federal funds rate is 8-1/4 percent, even though the borrowings are running whatever they are running now-- $375 million Then we have a much more difficult decision to make We may not do anything, but 8-1/2 percent begins getting marginal; I wouldn't like to do it at 8-1/4 percent or 8-1/8 or 8 percent, just because we theoretically thought that the funds rate should be 7-7/8 percent--or the reverse when it got lower A few weeks ago it was rather consistently lower We might do it earlier or later in the week, depending upon how the funds rate was going I would be less than forthcoming if I did not say those judgments as to whether to anticipate or delay action a little bit partly would depend upon what the dollar was doing on that particular day  Not mentioned apparently, that's right  I don't know that we want to take such a radical step this morning at this late hour, but--  Well, the problem with it is that it pins us to a very precise number You are right that it is a wide range, but we don't always have that kind of a range Our ability to hit that consistently is not overwhelming  Well understood After you put the borrowing level in there for a while and don't meet it, then you will be looking for something else  We will put in next quarter's GNP--this is Mr Partee talking! I don't know whether he wants the flash or the preliminary or the final revised figure 10 years from now  Well, I think the difficulty with that approach is that it rather promises more than we can deliver  That's right That's precisely it It is true of most things If it were as simple as that, we'd never have a recession or inflation Well, maybe we're prepared to vote Are we prepared to vote?  Well, the numbers are all clear in the directive and the language They are all 6 percents with a "would" and a "might" worked in there It's 6 to 10 percent, I presume, on the federal funds rate And we are talking $350 to $550 million, with $450 million the center of gravity and with some flexibility of going up or down depending upon the aggregates and all this other evidence, including the exchange market  Which is expressed to some degree in changing the range itself and in the "would" and "might" language  -35-    11/4-5/85  They are at the bottom end of the range  We have to discuss this other paragraph too, but if we know enough to vote on this one, let us vote  Now we have this other paragraph Some people's consciences suggest that something like this is appropriate  You are right; we had some language in the discussion six weeks ago; we could sharpen that and say something like this in the general discussion as an alternative, if that's desirable Now, the question that was raised was whether we have to make an announcement of this I don't mind saying this Since everybody anticipates it anyway, it looks a little odd to go out of one's way to find the special occasion to say it I might be testifying later this week If I do, I could just plant a question; that's easy But if I don't, I need some natural occasion to--  I don't think there's any doubt If we were making a change in targets and that implied some change in the way we're approaching things, the implication is that we'd announce it Now, this has kind of crept up on us--well, [not] crept up; it started out with a burst when we did it But the point of interpretation is that we haven't said we had to announce it when we thought we were going to miss a target We have missed lots of them Is this missing a target or is this a change in target? That's the question  Well, I think that takes care of it in substance, but that's not announced for a month; that's the only real problem Are we forced to make an announcement here? We probably are dancing on the head of a pin, but I don't know whether you can find some previous time where we missed a target--I suspect that you could --whereby this late in the year it was evident that we were not going to hit it and we weren't aiming at it  People think it is  Oh, I think that was announced The substantive difference is that then we weren't so far off We were off, but not so far off, and it was meaningful to say we were not  -37-    11/4-5/85  [aiming to hit it] This time people know we're not going to hit it, I think  This time it would take a minus  I don't think there is that expectation, but the question may be there It's a question of how hard we're trying to come closer; I think that is the practical question If they did their arithmetic, I don't think anybody really would think we are going to hit it or even are trying, because we would have to say we are aiming for a minus figure in the fourth quarter like we achieved in October  I feel under no pressure to make such an announcement on this  Well, I have no trouble with doing it if an occasion arose to do it in the next few days very simply My little trouble is what do we do--put out a press release or something? I don't know what the heck people would--  I'm sorry now in retrospect that I just didn't say that I wasn't thinking about it, but I could have easily said that we're not going to meet the target a little more directly I'm sorry I didn't because that would have taken care of it  The issue, it seems to me, is do we put it in here? What would you do as a practical matter apart from what we put in here? Go out and make an announcement tomorrow?  I do have a speech on the 19th or some time  Yes, but that's two weeks off  Yes, I agree with that  Well, if that's the way you feel about it, I'll couch it in appropriate words in Los Angeles if I don't find a suitable occasion when I'm in public to say it before then  Well, what do you want to do? I would leave it out of the directive but say it pretty clearly in the discussion  Well, I can put it into a speech easily enough I could just put in some sentence saying of course we're not going to meet this--that given what has happened, we don't have any expectation that we're going to be within the range That's not difficult  -39-    11/4-5/85  Well, I haven't answered those yet, have I? That's another thing we can do They send a letter and say What comments do you have? I could just put it in the answer That's what I could do put an answer in that letter  I think those are on my desk, aren't they?  I think I have those letters on my desk  It doesn't make any difference--one or the other  Okay We'll word it in the answer to "What do you think of our report?" I can say that we take your report so seriously that we are not going to meet the M1 target I think that's quite a natural way to handle it, if I can get it out in the next couple of days, although one can argue about the timing and so forth Okay, that's the way we'll do that Do we have anything else to do?  The Open Market Committee meeting is over then  And we agree that the next meeting is--   How much do you have in government securities now?  How much?  We, in fact,  I don't know to what extent we are in public markets at all  It might be worthwhile, just to see what you are doing with our money, for you to send out a little memorandum  Mr Boehne  Or both?  Both  I will make a profound statement If they really have some assurance that it's not going to go up, it will go down  Having explored our uncertainties in that area, we will ratify the few transactions since the last meeting  SPEAKER(?) So moved  SPEAKER(?) Second  Without objection Let's turn to domestic open market operations  Questions?  Other questions? A question occurred to me as you were talking Would you judge that we are engaged actively in monetizing the Treasury's deficit?  Would anybody like to ratify our usual thing?  Without objection Now we'll turn to Mr Axilrod, who will introduce Mr Lindsey  I think maybe we ought to stop you now and ask for any questions we might have of a quasi-technical sort I have a question Maybe I'm wrong, but when I look at this velocity change that you're projecting for this year [unintelligible] focus on GNP for the first part of '86 When is the last time we had such a change in the velocity of M1?  Literally unprecedented? Go back to the 1930s  If that decline was all that big in '82 and surprised us, that quarterly model didn't come in very far off in that period  If you look at that quarterly model, it looks like '81 was way down but '82 and '83 not so much Presumably, in '81 it was the transition to NOWs    12/16-17/85  [Unintelligible] centered around [unintelligible] Governor Partee  Governor Martin  Well, if there are no more particular questions, you can proceed  A straight reading of the interest rate differential between a demand deposit and a market rate  Well, I don't think it would hurt any--I started to say just for the heck of it, but it may be a little more than just for the heck of it--to show what some of these weighted measures look like at the next meeting  Its burial may be a bit premature; it depends upon what happens to the economy over the next few months  I would agree with that We'll see whether it has had a partial recovery; I'm not sure it will return to full health We would have to have one heck of an increase in the economy in the next 3 to 6 months, which is contrary to the projections we have before us  Mr Black can defend it  There are a few other guidelines that one could have other than interest rates  Exchange rates, prices--  I am not quite sure that I followed all of this complex analysis delivered to us orally Looking at these interest rates, it's clear that super NOW rates are more sluggish than Treasury bill rates But before we had super NOWs and all of these [deposit] rates were zero or when we had ceiling rates, movements in market rates were sharper relative to the transactions rates Therefore, one would have thought velocity would now be steadier relative to history rather than less steady  That raises the question of whether M2 used to be more volatile  Mr Corrigan  -13-    12/16-17/85  What is it telling us about the economic outlook?  If the debt is so high, and that is what we should be looking at, does that say that the economy is going to begin expanding after two years?  Then it seems to me that credit isn't telling you anything in the way you look at these monetary aggregates as telling you something about the future of the economy  That's different; it's not a leading indicator  Well, a simple factual question is What would a new aggregate--M3 plus commercial paper--look like? That must pick up most of the off-balance-sheet financing  How else--Euromarket?  Maybe If you take that line, why are all these aggregates rising so much faster than the economy?  [Unintelligible] got a lot of Treasury securities  You're including stock at market value  Well, all I know is that we should have started this discussion some months ago because at the next meeting we have a law which says that we have to set forth some monetary and credit aggregates and we have to decide which ones to set forth and--  What kind of a range I think Jim Kichline has the answer to all of these things because he put in an M1 consistent with the business outlook  If you're right, I think you would have to get very low levels of plant and equipment and housing expenditures and I am not sure that they have been all that low  -17-    12/16-17/85  Mr Morris You already made your comments [Mr Boehne]  Well, I have been assuming that If we are not going to assume that, we better do a lot of work in a hurry Governor Seger  Mr Stern  -18-    12/16-17/85  Governor Martin  Just in the interest of nomenclature, when we had M1 on a so-called monitoring status before, we had a range, didn't we?  SPEAKER(?) Yes  If I understood you correctly, you said we didn't  I'm not talking about substance When we called it monitoring before we had a range You are going beyond that and don't even have a range  -19-    12/16-17/85  Not for M1; legally we have to have some ranges I think there might be a certain amount of disappointment-- though maybe not so much after our recent experience But a couple of years ago we wouldn't have gotten by without having an M1 range  I remember a comparable experience in the past when we said it was premature to have ranges for the following year; I guess we said that for all of the ranges, didn't we? [Congress] kicked that back to us in about 2 seconds [and told us] the law says we have to have a range Mr Griffith  Does that imply that it is cheaper to run an MMDA?  Are you saying that as it stands today or as we press on?  I've wondered about that too Mrs Horn  Mr Forrestal  I think it is going to be a little hard to really abandon M1 just in terms of the law It doesn't mention M1 but it talks about monetary ranges and nothing is more monetary in the public mind than M1 I think that we can deemphasize it--I'm just talking in terms of the law--all we want Actually not presenting it is going to raise a little ruckus  I don't think we ever set a target we didn't think we were going to meet [We thought] M1 was going to slow down from this great burst in July; we didn't say it with great confidence  Mr Keehn  Mr Black  Or a 5 percent drop off  We have a problem here When I listen to this conversation we have a law that says "monetary and credit aggregates" The only credit aggregate that we have is as far off as M1  -23-    12/16-17/85  Nobody knows what to do about it The implication is to tighten up, but nobody wants to tighten up  It still intrigues me that the previous incident we had of debt rising so fast relative to GNP was in 1928-29 I've been assuming that we would have targets of more or less the traditional type with a lot of [explanatory] language, maybe put M1 on a monitoring basis the way we did before, with a target That is clearly within the scope of what we can do The same thing is true for credit; that could be a monitoring--  I meant the general public  We may be That's the problem Ex post, after 1928-29 [it's clear] that the Federal Reserve should have been tighter  Just by instinct, I don't think we are prepared to throw out much of this without at least a very careful  -24-    12/16-17/85  consideration of replacing [what we throw out] with something else Outside these ranges we could say, well, we're going to stabilize exchange rates or move interest rates or commodity prices  I am tempted to ask--it is so late in the afternoon I won't press for an answer--what you may want if you have targets and you can't have monetary and credit aggregates in the sense in which it is called for by law What would you use a year ahead, midyear, 18 months ahead?  I'm throwing out those things  Are you prepared to suggest that?  There are those who would say that; it is a small but hardy band  Take a basket of commodity prices; stabilize the general accounts  I don't hear anybody arguing It's practically impossible in the time that we have--without creating a revolution--to move away from some combination of these aggregates, as bad as they are  You may be promising more than you can deliver  You may put the straw on the camel's back, if you keep grasping!  I'm not hearing great inspiration I think we ought to adjourn for the day  [Meeting recessed]  -26-    12/16-17/85  December 17, 1985--Morning Session  Would you repeat or amplify what you said about energy prices?  You're not assuming a big decline in oil prices?  Comments?  Fortunately, we only have to look ahead instead of back  Does anyone want to comment on where we are and where we're going?  Mr Black  Mr Keehn  On this farm situation, I don't know whether you or anybody else had any comments, but we've had quite an increase in agricultural prices from a very low level in the last month or two months Does that make anybody feel any better?  MESSRS KEEHN & GUFFEY No  I wasn't thinking of the bankers so much as whether anybody has any more hope for--  It has been by far the sharpest, indeed; but it's also significant in corn and wheat, though from a very low level  There is no question that they are lower in the longer-term perspective Governor Martin  [Unintelligible] 4 to 7 percent projection in the long-term M1  You like part of the monetary policy assumptions  Governor Rice  Which is what?  Mr Forrestal  Mr Boykin  -36-    12/16-17/85  Mr Corrigan  Mr Guffey  Mr Boehne  Mrs Horn  Mr Griffith  Governor Partee  Mr Melzer  Governor Seger  Anybody else who wants to be heard from? Why don't we get Mr Axilrod  [Unintelligible]  We'll go eat a donut  [Coffee break]  Well, indeed, we have to arrive at a little decision here I listened very carefully to what you all said this morning I'm not sure it eliminated all the confusion that might exist or the differences in views around the table I must say I think we're in a rather strange situation historically Three years of expansion and nobody's very happy The economy, from one point of view, seems to be stumbling a bit There is not a very good growth trend in the gross national product, but I remind you that the unemployment rate has been trending down very slightly and not up When we look at those gross national product figures it mesmerizes us I put it in the perspective that unemployment has been edging down and not up Our productivity has been rather dismal When I look at what we're doing in terms of stimulus or spending it's pretty good Gross domestic purchases for the last three quarters have risen 39, 32, and 53 percent Domestic final purchases have risen 41, 64, and 41 percent--not exactly an economy that is starved on the spending side We have a decline in the trade balance, which arithmetically accounts for the low gross national product There is a lot of speculation about whether that's going to be changing or not or to what degree I guess nobody knows There seems to be a consensus that it is not going to continue to get worse One question is how fast the economy should be growing I don't think I know the answer to that, but I would express a little skepticism, given the productivity performance, that a 4 percent rate is sustainable for all that long without creating inflationary problems Maybe the higher  -44-    12/16-17/85  growth will help the productivity, but I don't know how much It should help it in manufacturing [unintelligible] but manufacturing is far from the whole of the economy [Unintelligible] expansion in the rest of the economy and no productivity growth; I guess it's practically zero outside the manufacturing area Is that right, Mr Kichline?  No, for the past year or so  It isn't high, whatever it is  Is that for the whole economy or just--?  So even with the increase-- So it's minus outside of manufacturing  The total is zero and manufacturing is up; it must look that way  Well, maybe so  Well, that may be right too, but--  --it isn't very good And we sit here debating whether to ease some more In a way, that's not an uncomfortable position to be in Usually 3 years after an expansion we worry about how much to tighten because we don't see any capacity out there and unemployment is too low, or appears to be too low, or we get inflationary pressures None of those things exists It's not the worst situation in the world On the external side, I feel a little better about Europe I might foresee a little faster growth there, or at least it's tending toward the more optimistic side; but it's certainly the reverse in Japan, where things look kind of sour  -45-    12/16-17/85  Everything that has happened recently makes the Japanese economy look less favorable We have a lot of problems in particular sectors of the economy You all know that We have problems with the LDC debt None of these problems is going to be cured by easy money, but all of them might be assisted at the margin by an easing in money  The greatest dichotomy is [monetary growth] I jumped when I saw this Bluebook and the list on monetary and credit growth If you look at the November figures, we're talking about M1, up 13 percent; M2 and M3 rather moderate; domestic debt, up 16 percent; bank credit, up 16 percent; total reserves, up 20 percent; the monetary base, up 10 percent If you just looked at those figures and you came from Mars you'd say "Geez, it's mildly expansionary" If you look at the bond markets, we have had a rally of--I don't know whether it's of record proportions, but it couldn't be going more nicely in terms of lower interest rates in that market; [the lower rates] may not affect much except US Treasury borrowing costs and the mortgage market Just a sidelight on this housing start figure I heard a hypothesis from some major homebuilders of small houses who were in town about a month or six weeks ago They said sales went dead in October, and we may be seeing some reflections of that in this current housing start figure Why did they go dead? Well, they didn't fully understand it, but part of their reasoning was that people bought so many cars in August and September that they couldn't afford the downpayment on a new house That was one reason Another reason was that mortgage rates at that time were going down and everybody was anticipating further declines, and nobody wanted to go house hunting until they saw how much further mortgage rates were going to go down They said if that was the reason, it was a pretty good forecast on the part of those potential home buyers I don't know whether--  What?  Oh, I don't know It's the difference between seeing the bird in the hand and saying how you feel If my forecast is so correct I'm going to [unintelligible] With respect to why sales should go dead in October followed by [unintelligible] the builders apparently concluded that  In any event, we have this situation where interest rates are going down very rapidly in the long-term markets and the stock market is going up at the same time It's a rather strange--well, maybe it's not a strange combination--but it's kind of strange when you put into  -46-    12/16-17/85  it that gold prices and silver prices are going down at the same time Leading indicators have been up for a while It is a situation that does not give me a great sense of urgency about the necessity to make drastic moves in policy at this stage, unless this clarifies itself one way or the other The only other point I would make is that in terms of overt moves, and given the risks on the dollar side, I think it would be important to try and get some coordination with our trading partners I'm not sure how easy that is or how difficult It may be easier with some than with others at this stage, but that would need a little exploration I don't hear anybody talking about any tightening I presume the center of gravity is toward some easing so we can get these money and credit figures really moving! [Laughter]  Maybe so  So, who would like to say something? Mr Morris  All of us have a little gnome in the back of our heads  You reminded me of a couple more comments I wanted to make When I talk about 4 percent [GNP growth], obviously, I would not be concerned about a 4 percent growth in some quarters for a period of time My skepticism is really that if growth were sustained there for very long whether it would be desirable Maybe we can do it and maybe we can't But I think it would depend upon a considerably better productivity performance than anything we've seen lately or anything the figures give us hope about at the moment You say it is a long time until the next meeting I think a lot could go on here, including the possibility of a discount rate change, which may require a consultation--even fairly promptly We just have to assume that, in terms of that [intermeeting] action and how it could be integrated conceivably with some foreign moves I don't think we can sit here and sort out every permutation and combination of possible developments over the next whatever [time period] it is  Eight weeks So, I would think that's quite likely that at some point, with shorter or somewhat longer notice, [a consultation] would be necessary Mr Boehne  Let me just make a comment on something you expressed I'm not sure about your interpretation of long-term rates in the bond market Maybe I read into it what I hope I think it certainly has been influenced by Gramm-Rudman and the prospect of the oil price moving lower Everybody has been talking about that for a year and it hasn't happened But I would like to think that reflects partly a feeling about inflation--that it is less of a threat now--rather than [expectations of] an imminent monetary policy easing If I thought it was mostly the latter--if much of it was based upon monetary policy easing--I'd have to ask myself why short-term rates haven't moved lower [Unintelligible] my interpretation would be that it's very constructive in terms of inflationary expectations I would hate to upset that; it would be counterproductive Mr Guffey  Mr Forrestal  -49-    12/16-17/85  Mr Martin  Mr Black  Honesty compels me to say that we have not been terribly sensitive to small changes in Ml, but higher concern--  Mr Stern  Mr Keehn  Governor Seger    12/16-17/85  Governor Rice  Mrs Horn  Mr Corrigan  Mr Boykin  There have been a lot of comments made about a speculative feeling in the financial markets I guess I would look at it slightly differently now I think there's excessive debt creation there; whether it's speculation or other motives, I don't know It's certainly excessive in some very long-range perspective So far as the bond and stock markets are concerned, I would like to interpret that constructively I would hope that a 9-1/2 percent long-term Treasury bond rate is sustainable or normally reflects a reasonable appraisal of the outlook; it may still be high indeed A 1,500 level on the stock market ought to be sustainable with a reasonable outlook I think that's partly because people have changed their views on inflation, which is constructive And I wouldn't want to undermine that by undermining what underlies it That's my perception of it, myself Mr Melzer will tell us what the real attitudes are in the financial markets  Mr Griffith  You're missing, Governor Partee  We'll just blame whatever goes wrong on Mr Partee!  [Unintelligible]  You said [unintelligible] that it wasn't serious  The discount rate is not a matter for this Committee, as you technically point out, but I would [be interested] nonetheless if anybody wanted to express any great feeling about a 1/4 or 1/2 point cut We haven't done a 1/4 point for a long time--since '79 or '78 It's certainly getting down in a range where it has been done before I don't know if anybody wants to comment on that  I'm not quite thinking of it in that perspective--that those are the only two alternatives But I just [wondered] in general if there is anything to be said strongly one way or the other  It depends on whether things are clear to you or not  I suppose it's anybody's bet But I do not believe the long-term rate structure is dependent upon whether we change the discount rate or not I think it is readily arguable that it would be perverse I think the short-term rate structure is  It goes up a point a day, including today, I take it Well, nobody else wants to comment about the appropriate size of a discount rate cut I take it? So far as the international implication is concerned, there are two [countries] involved One I think would be extremely reluctant to do anything The other may be less reluctant  Well, that's what I had in mind From our standpoint that obviously would be very helpful The economics seem to dictate it, but in a way I think we're psychologically more vulnerable on the other side But the Germans are feeling quite content with themselves  I think across the Pacific they're much more likely than across the Atlantic  I'm 50 percent optimistic  I think you can get one side; I'm not sure about the other side I'd be very skeptical on the other side You may get an exchange rate realignment in Europe; I don't know whether that's good or bad There's considerable pressure over there now  Well, it's hard to read this as a great consensus And since there are too many variables in the equation, it is neither a  -58-    12/16-17/85  consensus nor by and large an enormous difference The tactics make it very difficult This is a little messier than I would like to make it, but let me try to suggest something For the moment we have a somewhat lower level of borrowing, but not so far that we couldn't reverse it without being too obvious about it, if the discount rate went down If the discount rate doesn't go down, we might want to press that further If it does go down, we might adopt this strategy that a number ofpeople have suggested of reducing the discount rate but not the borrowing, which means something like--particularly taking into account a minor point, but nonetheless one that is there, that seasonal borrowings are running very low--$350 to $400 million or $300 to $400 million at the moment, and going to the upper side of that or maybe above it if the discount rate went down by a half If it doesn't go down, depending upon the aggregates and other things, we would push toward or beyond the low side If the discount rate goes down, or if it doesn't go down, we could reconsider or fine tune that after New Year's Day I will be more specific Assuming the discount rate doesn't go down, I think a borrowing number of $300-$400 million or something like $350 million would be the mechanical number the staff puts down [in the path] for the next week or so  Well, the funds rate is coming down, I think It has a lot of psychology in it; it surprised me a little If the discount rate expectations are all that strong, why has the funds rate stayed so high? I'm not sure that they have been all that strong But it seems to be coming down a little now I don't know whether that's lasting or not, but I would guess that we are talking about no more than 7-3/4 percent and maybe a lower discount rate, depending upon the anticipation You fellows down the end of the table can refute that if you want  You made a comment earlier that if expectations of a discount rate cut really became strong, then short- term rates will go down before the discount rate cut  Well, I figure it's wide enough for the moment But, as I said, I might consider a wider band in opposite directions [depending on] whether or not the discount rate changes wider on the up side if it did change, particularly by a half; and wider on the down side if it didn't change  -59-    12/16-17/85  Well, that's consistent with what I said, if you conceive of the upper side as an after the discount rate cut [level] and the lower side as a no discount rate cut [level] over the space of the next two or three weeks  $350 million, I think I said  Assuming no discount rate cut, $350 million and possibly moving lower, depending upon developments It's $350 million, possibly moving higher, if the discount rate is cut-- again depending on developments And we will explore the discount rate possibilities abroad  The federal funds rate is close to 7-3/4 percent today?  It's pretty close I don't know whether these numbers on the aggregates mean anything in any of these  Is that what we have usually done at this time?  Do you feel strongly that M3 is going to be a little lower than M2? Given the uncertainties surrounding all of these figures, it's nicer to use one figure  Just given the vast amounts of uncertainty in these numbers-- We had the same number [for both] last time, didn't we? For several times? Wasn't it the equivalent of 6 percent?  The same small range?  I wonder if we have to say something indirectly or directly about the discount rate in the directive It's a little misleading, whatever we say, to leave it out  Well, if we mention it, it's a question of where to mention it, I guess Consistent with what we said, we presumably say we decreased "somewhat" or "slightly" the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions I'm just thinking "Somewhat greater reserve restraint--"  Well, "degree of pressure on reserve positions" is our euphemism for the borrowing target  How would that be read if we did it that way? It might be read that if the discount rate were decreased, we would decrease reserve pressures further, and we are saying the opposite  It doesn't exactly clear up that ambiguity  I don't reject that suggestion, but I suppose if we said "In the implementation of policy the Committee seeks to decrease somewhat the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions, particularly should the discount rate be maintained at current levels"--  We are talking here about "may"--  We just put in there "taking account"--  Well, I think if we don't mention it here [in the directive] we should say something about it in the policy record discussion If the discount rate is changed, we could have a consultation and follow that by a paragraph--  All right, we will put something in the record--as it should appear anyway, because it has been in the  -62-    12/16-17/85  discussion--that would make this point clear as to what direction we are talking about So then we just say "decrease somewhat"  It's hard to call what we have "pressure," but- -  The trouble with these very low levels of borrowing is that we get that level of borrowing from computer breakdowns sometime  "Seeks generally to decrease somewhat the existing degree of computer-adjusted pressures on--"  Well, we keep this ritual of saying "is expected to be consistent with"-- Shall we demote M1 a bit by taking it out again?  "This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from November to March at annual rates of about--" If you really wanted a wide range, I guess you would say--  6 to 8 percent  6 to 7 percent?  6 to 8 percent takes in the full range, then  have it? "This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from November to March at annual rates of about 6 to 8 percent"  Well, on M1 we don't know  The latest estimate for December, for what it is worth, isn't all that much It's what around 10 percent?  But that shows [the uncertainty] We are dealing with an aggregate that three days ago the staff estimated at 15 percent and now they are estimating it at 10 percent for a month that's half over I don't know exactly what we should write down We can take something like 7 to 10 percent Anybody have an inspiration?  We could start off the sentence by saying "While recognizing that particular uncertainties surround the behavior of M1--" Well, that's all right with me if people are willing to live with 6 to 8 percent I guess we take the curse off the 6 to 8 percent for M1 by the initial clause  Well, I'm just referring to the fact that the range for M1 for what it is worth--and I don't think it's worth much--is running below any of the numbers for M1 except for those in alternative C  Well, I think the basic trouble is whether it is really worth trying to get M1 in that same range I think it's a little tough  I think that's probably better too [unintelligible] Go back to the second [sentence] and say "expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 of 6 to 8 percent" Semicolon Do we need this phrase "assuming little net impact on the aggregates"? It implies a degree of knowledge we don't have anyway  Just put a semicolon and then "while M1 is expected to grow between 7 to 9 percent, the Committee recognizes the exceptional range of uncertainty surrounding that aggregate"  Put a semicolon and "while the behavior of M1 has been subject to unusual uncertainty, growth of 7 to 9 percent over the period is anticipated" Is that all right?  It says "decrease somewhat" in the first sentence "This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from November to March at annual rates of 6 to 8 percent; while the behavior of M1 has been subject to unusual uncertainty, growth of 7 to 9 percent over the period is anticipated"  Let's look at this next sentence Do we want after the "be acceptable" to take out the "taking account of"?  But in reality I'd be putting foreign exchange markets [first] if I were doing it Not that I'd argue this, but from an operational standpoint that's much more likely to have an important change in a matter of weeks than the business situation There is some merit in that  I would agree with that too  Well, I wouldn't be allergic to putting business expansion and progress against inflation last In an operational sense, probably, that's the order in which they come We probably won't get a sharp change in the inflationary situation in the next few weeks either In the first place, do we take out "taking account of"? It's probably a little more accurate, but I wouldn't bleed or die [over it]  It elevates them slightly  "be acceptable depending on behavior of the aggregates, appraisal of the strength of business expansion, developments in foreign exchange markets," etc  We agreed not to "Taking account of" is out  I don't think it makes any difference  Oh! But you are probably right; the "appraisals" now refers to all of them It might be better to take out "appraisals of" to avoid distinctions between appraisals of the strength of the business expansion and developments in foreign exchange markets Does anybody else have any suggestions? Does everybody know how it reads? "In the implementation of policy for the near term the Committee seeks to decrease somewhat" Is "somewhat" the right word?  "the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from November to March at an annual rate of 6 to 8 percent; while the behavior of M1 continues to be subject to unusual uncertainty, growth at an annual rate of 7 to 9 percent is anticipated Somewhat greater reserve restraint" What do you want to do with these "woulds" and "mights"?  Leave it "might" and "would"?  SEVERAL Yes  "be acceptable depending on behavior of the aggregates, the strength of the business expansion, developments in foreign exchange markets, progress against inflation, and conditions in domestic and international credit markets" When I look at this I really wouldn't mind changing the order of those last things  Operationally, I think it's more accurate that way Do you want to change it?  It isn't a big point Do you have any overwhelming sentiment one way or the other?  Yes, "depending on the behavior of the aggregates, developments in the foreign exchange markets, conditions in domestic and international credit markets"--that way we could  -68-    12/16-17/85  reverse those two--"and the strength of the business expansion and progress against inflation"  We leave it unless there are strong feelings and somebody wants to press the point  Possession is nine-tenths of the directive  Initial borrowing in a $300 to $400 million range, starting at $350 million  If the discount rate were down, we presumably go toward the upper end of that range or even beyond, say, up to $450 million If the discount rate doesn't go down, depending upon these other things, we might get down below the $300 million The outside range is $250 to $450 million with an inside range of $300 to $400 million Is that all comprehensible?  Any further elucidation? I guess we will vote  All right We're going to leave for sandwiches  END OF MEETING       Comments or questions?  Any other questions?  If there are no other questions, we'll turn to Mr Kichline and company  MESSRS KICHLINE, PRELL and TRUMAN [Statements--see Appendix]  That was an exhaustive, comprehensive, and analytically complete briefing Now, what questions can anybody ask?  At [a per barrel price of] $10 for oil?  Two strong currencies, anyway They were referring to chart 16; I had a small point on chart 15 That Economist index looks like it went up all last year You said, if I understood you correctly, that in the last two months it has gotten higher than a year ago It sure doesn't look that way on the chart  These are year-over-year changes?  It was decreasing at a slower rate of speed Now it's right  Mr Boehne  I expect this is a non-collapse scenario?  Mrs Horn  Mr Parry  Mr Stern  [Unintelligible]; maybe I don't understand it You have one percentage point lower prices; it just takes two years to get it You have 1/2 percentage point in each year  It's not an additional 1/2 percentage point the next year?  So it's 1 percentage point over two years  Mr Guffey    2/11-12/86  But the drop of the dollar helps them to the extent that they export--well, Mexico is mostly a dollar exporter If a country has some mix of non-dollar exports, that helps them  Mr Johnson  But--if I understand the chart--you are saying that in 1988 in this hypothetical example the money supply would be 4-1/2 percent higher than otherwise, right? And only 2-1/2 percent of that shows up in prices  Oh, okay  This is, all other things equal [unintelligible]  If we don't have any more specific questions, we're at the point where people can express their opinions about the general economic situation With the wide range of opinions in what was distributed, I am sure we will have a lively discussion  3-1/2 to 4 years Are you suggesting that is a long time?  Would you care to speculate whether this steadiness will likely be interrupted on the up side or the down side?  We are hoping for steadiness I guess what we are supposed to be debating now is the likelihood of that Mr Morris  These forecasts were made up before the latest numbers?    2/11-12/86  You wouldn't want to expound beyond the first quarter?  Mr Corrigan  Mr Black  Mr Boehne  Mr Parry  Let me just interject for a moment to remind people that you get a chance immediately after this meeting to revise the forecasts [you have submitted] You all have made some comment, but I don't know when you look at them whether you'll change them or not What unemployment rate are we talking about here? Are we talking about the civilian or the total?  The Administration projects the total?  So you subtract a tenth from theirs I just wanted to remind you as you talk about the outlook that you may change your forecast after this discussion if you want to Excuse me for interrupting you  Mr Forrestal  Canada does have a big weight in that index and that's why it doesn't go down very much  No, there is no effect on those lumber people  -15-    2/11-12/86  I want to remind you all that these forecasts in the last analysis are yours; I'm reporting to the Congress that they are personal forecasts Mr Stern  I am nonplused by the copper mine opening  Who is working on this?  Mr Keehn  Wait a minute; let me understand that comment It depends upon what "past" you are talking about Are you suggesting it is lower than it was in the past or higher?  It's a sea change from the '70s and a continuation of the recent '80s  Okay I just wanted to make sure I understood you  Mr Boykin, we all remember those bumper stickers about freezing in the Northeast!  You had a one percent increase in employment over what period of time? Over a year?  Mrs Horn  I forget Is the auto industry up in this calendar year?  Governor Johnson  I'm waiting--within the Federal Reserve  Mr Guffey  Did you find a copper mine in Colorado?  Were coal prices down earlier? Has there been any downward movement in coal prices?  I am out of [names on] my list here There are a few people who haven't commented We should finish up this discussion this evening and then start afresh in the morning with everybody having made some initial comments If Governors Angell,    2/11-12/86  Rice, Seger, or Mr Melzer want to say anything, this is your chance or forever hold your peace until tomorrow  My word, 39 percent! Governor Seger  Whether you are going to be last, I guess, depends upon Governor Angell  Well, I think we are at the end of today's agenda Let me give you some materials that will be presented to the Board on Gramm-Rudman, if you would like them It'll come up at lunch tomorrow We will have some discussion there but it has to be a discussion not leading to a decision I don't know how we will manage that but we will not be in the sunshine and we will manage it somehow This Open Market Committee meeting is over--not over, in suspense We have the meeting scheduled to start at 930 am tomorrow morning It might be a little safer if we moved it up a bit, if that doesn't bother anybody Do you want to move it up at least to 915 am or to 900 am? Does everybody want to move it up to 900 am? All right, we will move it up to 900 am  [Meeting recessed]    2/11-12/86  February 12, 1986--Morning Session  One small point of clarification, Mr Axilrod You referred on a number of occasions to "further" declines in the price of oil I don't know what you are looking at in terms of "further" declines as opposed to declines that have already taken place  If there were a further decline in the imported price of oil, that would be a reasonably safe bet I would say  Let me make two small observations and see whether they will command support First of all, you have very small changes between all your alternatives here It's hard for me to see the significance of these changes other than pictorially and psychologically Therefore, I don't think any of these necessarily imply one thing or another in terms of very current policy The other observation is that your changes are almost minute on the M2 and M3 categories and there is nothing that says the Committee has to be bound within the bands of your hypothetical examples here But just in the interest of perhaps slightly simplifying our discussion I want to ask a general question Are there really significant questions among members of the Committee about the M2 and M3 tentative ranges? Obviously, I think, there will be questions on what weight to put on M1 and what the M1 range should be Is that all we have to concentrate on this morning at this stage? I don't want to forbid anybody from talking about M2 or M3 if any of you really want to, but I just thought in making comments, people don't have to make a point about M2 or M3 and don't have to keep repeating their ranges unless there is really a disagreement It seems to me hardly worthwhile to horse around with a half percentage point on those ranges, unless somebody has a bigger concern about that    2/11-12/86  Well, that's a question you can raise Of course, we were within the ranges, so velocity didn't look bad last year  It depended on whether you were using the parallel line or the cone We were pretty much in the range all the time using the parallel lines Of course, it was toward the upper end; there's no question about that Well, I couldn't if I wanted to, but I don't want to [unintelligible] not discuss the wider aggregates But the principal concern, I suspect, is on the weight to be given to M1 and on the ranges for M1 Perhaps we could concentrate more on that, anyway Does anybody want to say anything?  Well, why don't we proceed and talk about Ml; but if anybody wants to make some [unintelligible] comments about M2 and M3, obviously, you are free to do so What do we do with Ml next year?  You are going [unintelligible] the M2?  -27-    2/11-12/86  This is not where we would expect to end up this year, is it Mr Axilrod? Your projection doesn't put us at the top of the M2 and M3 ranges, does it?  I am not talking about the debt--[just] M2 and M3  But M2 and M3 are not expected to be so near [the upper limits]  We'll get the rebuttal from Mr Black  Mr Melzer  Mr Corrigan  Mr Forrestal  Mr Stern  Mr Parry  Governor Angell  Mr Boehne    2/11-12/86  Mr Keehn  Mr Guffey  Governor Rice  Governor Wallich  Governor Seger  You had difficulty in discovering the difference?  Governor Johnson  Mrs Horn  Mr Boykin  When things start happening, how do you interpret that?  How do you interpret--    2/11-12/86  Well, the band of disagreement isn't particularly wide; it's rather narrow I'd just raise a couple of points based on listening to this I'm not sure we know what we're doing I guess the psychology of this is that most people talk about widening the range for M1 for obvious reasons and then we end up with something like 3 to 8 percent or 4 to 8 percent I'm not necessarily opposed to that but I just raise the point that we will be asked the question Why did you do that? It makes a 1 percentage point difference on the up side Does that mean that we're really going to get the 8 percent this year and that we have reduced the option for doing what we did last year, which is say it's not confirmed by other factors in the economy but it's running a little slow? I don't get the sense that that is what you want to do but I'm asking Is that what people are going to read into it--that there's going to be more importance attached to Ml? [Will people think that] we went to the great trouble of changing the range to 8 percent and that's a more liberal number, so we better stay within that 8 percent? In some sense and in some conceivable conditions that has the opposite intent of what I detect the sentiment is That's one question I raise On the debt issue, which is a lesser question, I do think there probably is a difference given what is essentially double-counting in the state and local area I don't know what the magnitude of that is; I asked the other day [unintelligible] the answer I probably have one, but they didn't see it You go up against them--  Don't forget, it's not just the advance refunding but all this mortgage financing is double-counted too, isn't it?  Well, I'm not sure; theoretically I think that's right In practice I'm not sure that there isn't a difference between an advance refunding by a state and local government and some consumer--  It's hard to know where the line is, that's for sure But I think there is a difference And it might affect our judgment at some particular time, whether we lean in one direction or another I think it is a question of whether it would be useful--and a couple of people made this point--to have some kind of a benchmark out there [against which to judge whether] it is excessive or not In those terms I rather like it, but in fact the numbers that we have here seem rather excessive, even as a benchmark of excessivity We start out with very high numbers, but that is a relatively minor point  I could argue it the other way I just argued against not keeping it One could argue that these numbers are so high anyway that we can comment on the excessiveness of it without having that benchmark So, I guess you could argue it either way; it's not all that critical On the M1 range, I'm not arguing substance here but I just want to make sure we really think about whether we would be ahead of the game or behind the game by changing the upper limit We are going to have some language in here--language that we may want to take a little time to play with--indicating that we are not going to be locked into this Ml figure, depending upon a lot of other developments Given that kind of language which is not yet defined, unfortunately, if we change the range I think there is at least a risk of it getting read as if 8-1/2 percent, let's say, really is bad To make my case in extreme form--I'll make my case but I don't feel all that strongly Suppose M1 were running at 9 percent and all things considered we didn't want to do anything about it That's a modified example of what we had last year, which wasn't very troublesome Is that more troublesome if we have just raised the upper end of the range to 8 percent? Does that raise more questions about why it's running at 9 percent than if we haven't raised the upper limit of the range from 7 percent? That is my simple question  You can argue that we're doing the same thing that we did for the second half of last year; but it means changing what we said for 1986, which is what most people will be looking at, I think But you can argue that point  My presumption is that the 7 percent wouldn't be a real upper limit any more than it was last year under those circumstances  Maybe we ought to think a bit about the language we should use Unfortunately, I don't have a good suggestion to put before you I wasn't crazy about what was in the [draft in the Bluebook], although that is the minimum we would have to say--that there are great uncertainties about Ml We can say more Should we say more than that?  You put my point in extreme form; you raised it even higher But then you really get tied to it  Unless you get velocity like last year  I am reminded that there is a side issue that we had a little discussion about I don't even know what we call these things Do we call them weighted monetary indexes? I don't think they helped us very much, but I thought it might be a contribution if we had a short appendix to our report describing this work We would intend to add it to the Humphrey-Hawkins Report, if that is agreeable, just as an explanation of the work in progress It would not be long, but would describe the characteristics and tell the world that we are looking at these indexes anyway I take it there is no objection to that  -39-    2/11-12/86  I scribbled down a couple of sentences here dealing with this M1 issue I don't know whether I like them myself, but let me try this out on you Substitute for what's there "With respect to M1, the Committee recognized that based on the experience of recent years the behavior of that aggregate was subject to substantial uncertainties in its relationships to economic activity and prices depending upon, among other things, its responsiveness to changes in interest rates It agreed that an appropriate target under existing circumstances is--whatever we make it--but it intended to evaluate movements in M1 in the light of its consistency with other monetary aggregates"  This would explain the wide range, I think--well, assuming whatever range we decide [is wide]  I think it is independent of the range Maybe I ought to get this typed and we can look at it Nobody can read my writing, I suspect; I have it scribbled here We clearly need some language A range of 6 to 9 percent seems to represent the consensus on M2 and M3 I don't know what the consensus is on debt; most people thought we ought to keep something We had scattered views as to what it should be if we kept it If we want to avoid half percents, we could use 8 to 11 percent or 9 to 12 percent Can we dispose of that one? Was it 9 to 12 percent last year?  Well, nothing  Let me just ask for preferences How many prefer 8 to 11 percent? Seven; we have a majority already How many prefer 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent? We have one, anyway Let me just get preferences of Committee members at this point Who prefers 9 to 12 percent? Four Well, there is a clear preference for 8 to 11 percent Can we live with that? The compromise is Mr Rice's [8-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent]  We have reason to believe that we might miss it But those estimates last year were off by 2 percentage points or so  I think the point is that if we put in something like Frank Morris' caveats about mismeasurement, nobody will care about 8 to 11 percent  Nobody pays great attention to this as an operational variable I think "monitoring" is absolutely the precise word to describe it We look at it in a general way but it doesn't have much policy significance This is no federal issue to me We have a majority for 8 to 11 percent; we have a substantial minority for 9 to 12 percent; the obvious middle course is 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent, but that looks like fine tuning What do you want to do?  8 to 12 percent?  That's another way to compromise  Tentatively, it looks like 8 to 11 percent On Ml, I expressed my only concern about Ml; I think we have--    2/11-12/86  Three or four times  I think it is not typical, but it is not really unusual either  There is nothing to say that we can't change these targets other than in July I don't know that we ever have But we have announced other than in July or February that we were not observing-- There was some rigamarole that got some attention when it shouldn't have last October/November when we tried to say in an unobtrusive way, because people were conscience stricken, that we clearly weren't going to meet the targets We thought we ought to tell people that we weren't really trying to meet the targets and we did tell them It got a lot of attention at the time and had a little market effect for a few days We obviously weren't [going to meet them] anyway But we do that if we make a decision that we are, in effect, giving up on the target  After listening to all of this, the initial preference of most people--but not everybody, for sure--was 3 to 8 percent We have one 3 to 9 percent and some at 4 to 7 percent or 4 to 8 percent You heard my reservation, but I don't feel all that strongly about it Whatever range we have, we need some [explanatory] language Does 3 to 8 represent the best consensus we have? I don't hear any opposition to that You want to change the tentative range, with caveats Well, that sounds like where we are tentatively I guess we can vote, but I don't know whether we should vote without seeing the language Why don't we turn to the language for the ranges and see what other comments people might have? This draft language takes out all the business saying that we might be in the upper part of the ranges I don't think we are saying that, if I understand correctly, with respect to M2 and M3--or at least I need guidance on this We have at times in the past, not infrequently, said that we expected to be in the upper part of the ranges We are not saying that this time; the estimate says that we ought to be roughly in the middle of the ranges, right?  Well, I'm looking at the earlier version, the part that's crossed out At midyear sometimes we have said that we expect to be in the upper part of the range We're not saying that this time  [Unintelligible] we take that out  I'm not saying that's inappropriate; I just want to understand We're not saying that  Yes, that covers it on both sides Now, my language is a substitute for that capitalized language in the first sentence, but not for the second sentence It's pretty standard boilerplate or close to it "The Committee understood that policy implementation would require continuing appraisal of the relationships among the various measures of money and credit, their velocity trends, and indicators of economic activity and prices"--this is apart from smaller grammatical errors--"depending among other things on its responsiveness to changes in interest rates It agreed that an appropriate target would be," I suppose  "Target range" it should be I'm not sure that last phrase quite captures what--  That is all right with me I guess if we did something like that it almost replaces the next sentence too  What did you say?  All things to all people What I really contemplated in doing this--and maybe you don't want to do it--was not to cite M1 in the first sentence of the targets We could start out by establishing ranges for monetary growth measured from the fourth quarter for M2 and M3 And then this would cover the M1 target  No, I don't have in mind a monitoring range, but in some sense I think this doesn't give it equal weight  No, I wouldn't do that But another way of doing it is to put a sentence like this in first  And then follow with the--  Let me see how this flows here How does the first paragraph start out? We need another transitional sentence if we put it first, I guess "In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee agreed to establish ranges for monetary growth measured from the fourth quarter of 1985 to the fourth quarter of 1986 With respect to Ml--"  If we take this other tack, I think I would say "The Committee agreed that an appropriate range in the existing circumstances would be" whatever that is "It intends to evaluate movements in M1 in light of its consistency with the other monetary aggregates, developments in the economy and financial markets and potential inflationary pressures" That is a simpler way of saying it and covers everything, it seems to me  We are going to be responsive ultimately to developments that indicate excessive strength    2/11-12/86  I think this is kind of neutral What about the number? Is 3 to 8 percent what we want it to be, after due consideration?  Then I guess what we'd say is "In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee established the following ranges With respect to Ml, the Committee recognized that based on experience in recent years the behavior of that aggregate was subject to substantial uncertainties depending on, among other things, its responsiveness to changes in interest rates It agreed that an appropriate target range under existing circumstances would be 3 to 8 percent It intends to evaluate movements in M1 in light of its consistency with the other monetary aggregates, developments in the economy and financial markets, and potential inflationary pressures It adopted a range of 6 to 9 percent for M2 and 6 to 9 percent for M3 The associated range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt was--" What did we say?  SPEAKER(?) 8 to 11 percent  --8 to 11 percent" Then I guess we don't need that other sentence at all and that's the end of the paragraph What we don't say specifically is that we'll evaluate those other target ranges depending upon velocity I'm not sure that's necessary Do we know what we are voting on? Does anybody have anything else to say? If not, [let's vote]  We can turn to the discussion on the short term or whatever else we are going to do  That's usually true  What did we have? We had 7 to 9 percent for Ml and 6 to 8 percent for the two others?  Let me just deal with that pictorial question Ordinarily we would change to a December base at this point, but there is the peculiarity this year that we had a very high December, at least for Ml, and a low January So, presumably, if we moved to a December base, we'd have to lower all these figures quite significantly just to reflect the fact that when we leave out December we start off with an exceptionally low figure Arithmetically, you arrive at the same result; it is just a question of whether we want to stay close to or the same as what we had [in the directive] last time  Do we accept that method of proceeding?  Why don't we take a break right now and come back and resolve this issue?  [Coffee break]  Let me just make a couple of comments with respect to this decision; these all relate to the operational decision, which I presume will be on the level of borrowing I think that most people are [not] going to want to change our approach radically at this meeting The setting that we are in--Governor Martin used the word "uncertainty" and that is one way of putting it The synonym is "confusing" That is what I got from listening to all of you yesterday You have varying views about the outlook You emphasize quite different things, and that is quite understandable All of the individual views are quite persuasive, but they are not all consistent with each other, which I think is the confusing aspect Obviously, we have had stronger data recently; the employment data in particular have been very strong One is left with this uneasy feeling that that is not matched by equal strength currently or prospectively in a number of the key sectors of the economy It is a little hard to piece [together] just where the strength will come from through the year We have had a lot of monetary expansion and a lot of debt expansion, and from that standpoint there seems to be ample liquidity But I hesitate to believe this recent good data or to believe the part that states there are potentially weak sectors out there, looking ahead a year or so I am reminded of the old adage of Charlie Kindleberger In this kind of situation, just don't do anything; stand there I suspect that may be good advice in this circumstance  I get more concerned as time passes about an underlying factor here I had assumed that we were at least a year, or maybe 2 years, off from any concern about general pressures on the economy or capacity, looked at very broadly These productivity figures sure look pretty sour And that raises a question about what our growth potential really is We have had unemployment declining something like a half percentage point over the last six months, if one believes this last figure Maybe we will get a reversal of that in February so that will look different But where we are now, getting a sizable decline in unemployment with the economy growing--I don't know what it has averaged over the last 6 months--less than 3 percent hasn't it? Well, that looks low; it makes you wonder On the other hand, you wonder how much we can take without pushing the unemployment rate pretty fast None of the projections suggests that, but the projections are not consistent with what has happened over the last five or six months either in the relationship between economic growth and unemployment Maybe it is a fluke; maybe it will all go away in the figures over the next couple months But it leaves me with more questions in my mind than I had before about what our growth potential is  And, of course, that bears on the inflation picture over time I don't know who Governor Angell was referring to [in his comment] that people are overestimating the inflation rate I think that has been generally the case among economists and others surveyed on inflationary expectations; people pretty consistently over the past  -48-    2/11-12/86  few years have overestimated inflation We have an unblemished record as a Committee of overestimating inflation collectively for 5 consecutive years I don't know if that is going to change; the expectations have been reduced somewhat in this latest set I think we are seeing some good things in reference to a change in the labor bargaining situation I suspect a lot of credit for that has to go to deregulation I think the air controllers' strike five years ago had something to do with changing this trend From my viewpoint, it is a very healthy development in the manufacturing sector and in some other big labor union sectors The situation has never looked so great on the financial side Si or somebody referred to one insurance company anyway, but that has been fairly typical of the service side of the economy That is, I suspect, where we are getting on balance particularly poor productivity performance My own bias is that once we lose that favorable inflationary [climate] it is the devil to get it back again I don't think we have lost it yet, but these underlying factors raise some questions The biggest threat is clearly from the dollar side Can we absorb this kind of a reduction in the exchange rate and have just a temporary influence on inflation without affecting the whole climate, which has been improving? From that standpoint, I suppose we should count ourselves very lucky that we may have this decline in oil prices coming It may not be at the superbly right time, but it's about as good a time as one can ever imagine in terms of offsetting the potential--and I think they will be actual--effects from the exchange rate side of the equation Here we are getting a tremendously lucky break Because of the oil situation, can we get through some of the exchange rate adjustment effects without the same degree of impact that otherwise would have occurred?  The oil situation, on the other hand, obviously raises all those questions of financial fragility--questions like Karen Horn raised yesterday I guess the only answer is that while there is in fact a lot of fragility, it has been contained and diffused; so we really haven't had a test of what happens to the economy if something really happened in a way that was not controlled We have the clear and present danger in that respect internally, but I think in terms of the general risks--if one looks for the one place where things might break down with unknown consequences--just because of the sheer magnitude, it is still in the area of the LDC problems On top of that are a lot of continuing domestic struggles We can't handle all that with the monetary policy I guess the challenge continues to be to keep monetary policy on track while those things get handled primarily [in other] directions, although they obviously could affect the tone of monetary policy at times We have to continue to do so But it all adds up to me that we are about as easy as we can be without actually forcing excess reserves on the market There may be a bit of margin there, but we've been pretty accommodative The most recent business news looks a lot stronger, but we get fooled lots of times The most recent monetary news doesn't look disturbing, at the least in a very short time perspective So it doesn't seem to me a situation where we want to make any very violent changes With that much introduction, what have you got to say? Mr Black  Okay We don't want to do all the drafting [of the language] right now, but your point is noted [What] way do you come out on these numbers that we have to put down because of this?  Let me just make an immediate comment Presumably, we don't want to go with short-term targets down to the 1/4 of a percentage point When I look at "B" I would assume that we don't want to go with 5-3/4 or 6-3/4 percent  SPEAKER(?) As I understand Steve's earlier comments, "B" is roughly consistent with what we had initially specified  Well, we said 6 to 8 percent then, so it is fine for M3 and it is okay for Ml It isn't okay for M2, just talking--  I would normally interpret these as saying 7 percent, 6 percent, and 7 percent, [for Ml, M2, and M3, respectively] Is that what you mean, Mr Black?  Theoretically, we are aiming at the lower end of the range which, as we discussed last time, is $350 million or so But we have been taking chances on coming in somewhat below that You get to comment on that point for the sake of completeness  Well, for just these last two weeks--we are all finished but one day and--  The market is acting peculiarly today so I hesitate to say what it will be All the numbers say there are lots of excess reserves out there, but the funds rate went up today So, I don't know whether that means we are going to get a lot of borrowing  -50-    2/11-12/86  on the last day of the statement week even though statistically we should get none But, in fact, the [funds] market is on the firmer side today Did we drain again today?  If you believe the projections, and there is only one day left, [reserves] are $400 million above the target with an allowance of $800 million for excess reserves Excess reserves should end up at $12 billion, so the market is firming It is probable that we will end up with borrowings below $350 million, but that assumes the market eases this afternoon again  You can ask the staff but it used to be, historically, that when you had borrowings this low you would get the federal funds rate at the discount rate or below But it's not happening now  When [unintelligible] are low--assuming you are aiming that low--unless you are very active, even then you run into all sorts of quirks Once in a while there is some miss on guesses by the banks on their reserves or something comes out that you don't expect and you get high [borrowings] on one day And because the target is so low, you can't go below zero but you can go high on a particular day, and it is hard to get borrowings consistently to average that low  Yes, on balance, I think it is We have been a little below because the market has been a little tighter than one might otherwise have expected Mr Melzer  Mr Boehne  Would you technically interpret that as "B" or what?  Mr Forrestal  Mr Martin  Mr Guffey  Mr Stern  Mr Angell  You may have less so for the Chairman's judgment Let me say that I find the analysis of this oil situation a little ambiguous Obviously, it is a plus on the price side but the famous analogy is to a tax cut on the other side and an expansionary influence on the economy It seems to me to pull in the other direction from what you are citing Be that as it may be, I think what you left out of your analysis is a big inflationary impact from the exchange rate which has gone down 25 percent or something like that over the same period, roughly, that the oil prices came down; I don't know how you factor that into your thinking You are on the low  -54-    2/11-12/86  side of the projections; I hope you are right But the projections collectively, for what that's worth, don't show much change in the inflation rate  I wouldn't interpret our policy as a peg, be that as it may  An unchanged discount rate during this period and we've been kind of sitting there with the economy moving without much change in either inflation or growth I am not sure objective circumstances in the market call for great changes in interest rates And that is what we have seen for the past year  I can't see getting into a long argument, but some people might say 12 percent expansion in M1 was not artificially increasing liquidity and keeping short-term interest rates lower than they would have been in an unfettered market  You are taking one factor  Is it bigger than the exchange rate factor?  I hope so, but I don't know I would guess they are roughly counterbalanced; I hope they are roughly counterbalanced just on the pure inflation range They are both expansionary in terms of the impact on activity  It depends upon your model If you use a strictly Keynesian model, you get a big increase in purchasing power from the decline in oil prices  Well, that's why it depends upon what model you use A popular thought when the oil prices were going up    2/11-12/86  was that policy ought to be more expansionary to offset the contractionary effect of the rise in oil prices--equivalent to a tax increase Now we get the equivalent of a tax decrease  I guess what we are saying is that there are different models of the world I didn't want to divert you Did you express a judgment as to what--?  What alternative do you suggest?  I really don't want to press you unduly, but do you have a position on these targets--borrowings or whatever at the moment? It is not compelling that you express an opinion right now  Mr Keehn  Governor Wallich  Governor Seger  Mr Morris  Governor Johnson  It may be too early Just as a technical point, is that oil price decline likely to show up in either of those?  I think we may have to wait a month or two beyond this January number to see any real impact, but I may be wrong  Meaning $300 million?  Mr Corrigan  Governor Rice  Mr Boykin or Mrs Horn, do--  Well, we had no trouble arriving at a consensus for alternative B, whatever that means What I think it    2/11-12/86  means in writing this directive is-- What did we say before? Did we say [unintelligible] as compared to 7 to 9 percent, 6 to 8 percent, and 6 to 8 percent? Is that agreeable? A more subtle, and I suppose important operational question, is how we play this I don't even remember what the formal decision was last time on borrowing Was it $350 to $450 million?  The outside range was $250 to $450 million and the inside range was $300 to $400 million and then it depended on all these factors, including the discount rate Just for those who weren't there, the thought was that the higher borrowing would be appropriate with the lower discount rate rather than the reverse  I think there are two things that bear upon how we conduct this from day-to-day; they're fairly obvious One is that people have not wanted to encourage higher interest rates On the other hand, I think the consensus was--though it may not be unanimous--that people didn't want to encourage a lower exchange market feeding upon itself, anyway, on the down side As those two factors played out we ended up at least at the lower end of the range that we were discussing last time in terms of our intention We're in a pretty narrow range here I'm trying to sort out how to express it I'm not sure we would capture all this if we said absolutely our lower limit on borrowing was $300 million I'm conscious of the fact that we've been running below that You can tell me, but I don't sense from the comments--basically the "stand-still" comments--that people would want to go up necessarily on the borrowing, or let's say, get toward $400 million right now, just for the sake of getting up toward $400 million if that meant the federal funds rate was moving up and the dollar was fine and all the rest We might move up in other circumstances, but not in those circumstances I wonder whether we capture this best with something like $300 million with some margin of flexibility higher or lower depending upon those other two factors particularly Otherwise, maybe it could be worded as $250 to $350 million; it's the same thing, I guess  No  Keep in mind that the borrowing at any time could be above even $400 million for some--  --for maldistribution or expectational reasons or whatever, but not as an intention A $200 to $400 million range doesn't bother me, if it doesn't bother the Committee  It's a matter of taste whether you want to say $200 to $400 million or $250 to $350 million, recognizing that even if you said $350 million it might well be $400 million or $200 million  Yes  Well, I think what you'd do is probably start off at $300 million, and that might vary, but be thinking that you might shade that as the week progressed depending upon what was happening That's, in fact, what we do  Well, on the one hand, a feeling about [not] deliberately pushing up interest rates on the one side or deliberately pushing down the exchange rate on the other side Other factors obviously can enter in, but if important factors intervene we would have a consultation  My assumption is no But I would think we would express this as unchanged, given what's been happening recently within--  Well, it's a relevant question Maybe I'm wrong, but I was going on the presumption that they wouldn't see it at all, given that we've had a couple of periods when we've been below it That is my interpretation of an unchanged posture; or that would be perfectly consistent, anyway, with an unchanged posture  Well, I set it forward with a feeling that it is unchanged I don't think the market would interpret it [differently], but I'm not--  It seems to me that the funds rate, at times at least, has been surprisingly high considering the borrowing If we got a different relationship somehow and [market participants] got it in their heads that-- The funds rate in the very short run is half psychology anyway; it is where they think it should be So I can't rule out that if we did this, the funds rate might settle down in the lower range; but it hasn't so far  Well, just in terms of Mr Melzer's question, at the last meeting we said we were easing a tiny bit I think what could be happening and has happened--if somebody wanted to look at it through a magnifying glass--is consistent with that in terms of the funds rate But my interpretation of what we're saying is that we would not be saying that this time    2/11-12/86  Do I hear objections?  Well, I share that nervousness Maybe there should be more comment in the short run One comment on that external point Everybody loves to sit around waiting for us to change our discount rate before they change theirs If you look at Japan in particular--there was some mention of this yesterday--they're going to have an exceptionally favorable inflation rate this year and so are the Germans From an already good record, they have two big influences working in the same direction the exchange rate and the oil price I forget just what the short-term Japanese rates are; they're 5-1/2 percent aren't they, Ted?  Well, if anything, a little higher than that Their real rate--  Okay Their real interest rate--depending on the importance you attach to that in the short run--is something like 6 percent It's much higher than ours; the German rates I guess are less striking, but nonetheless--  There is one country, Japan, with its growth prospects really pretty dead, particularly against the Japanese potential, and another country with an unemployment of 9 percent, both of which have higher real interest rates than we do You sit around and say Why don't they move?  That depends  And what I would say, just as an observation, is that if we aim pretty religiously at $350 million, that would de facto be a little tightening from where we are That's saying the same thing in the opposite way It's in a pretty narrow range  Well, let me just look at the language here What we'd be saying is "maintain" And we would use whatever these numbers are for M2 and M3 "6 to 7 percent, respectively, while the growth of M1 is expected to be at an annual rate of"--what do we say, about 7 percent?  We've come to Mr Black's "would" and "might"  We had it asymmetrical toward the easing side last time Do you want to make it symmetrical?  Suppose we made it symmetrical by using might in both circumstances? Would that suggest that neither one is all that [likely]?  The federal funds rate is still in the middle of that range of 6 to 10 percent What it would say is maintain; 6 to 7 percent; might and might; and 6 to 10 percent  Well, $300 million, however you want to express it $300 million plus or minus; $250 to $350 million; I don't care It all amounts to the same thing, I think  Express it any way you want  There is some flexibility here in adjusting the borrowing level But I think one would have to put a few other ingredients in here to have confidence in what we would do or what the fed funds rate would do What are those price figures going to show? What's the exchange rate going to be doing in a couple of months?  It's anyone's perspective Considering how little we [have done] in changing things, the federal funds rate-- even on a week-to-week basis--just strikes me as being rather volatile That all [depends on] where one comes from, I guess We haven't been doing much in changing this and the funds rate has been surprisingly high, considering Ml and these statistical relationships Sometimes it aggravates you, but basically it hurts you because we're not sitting on it within a 1/4 of a percentage point or an 1/8 of a percentage point the way we used to  That is correct  Well, I think we're ready to vote I don't know if anybody wants to pin down whether we're saying $300 million plus or minus or $250 to $350 million or $200 to $400 million I interpret them as equivalent    2/11-12/86  I don't detect any policy difference between those ways of expressing it; I don't know if somebody else does We can discuss it, but on the understanding that those are roughly equivalent maybe we can proceed  I don't think it precludes anything That's a separate decision  All right I guess the meeting is concluded  END OF MEETING       I haven't heard any objection We need a Vice Chairman, too  Without objection, Mr Corrigan will be Vice Chairman  We have a list of [proposed] officers Do you want to read the list, Mr Bernard?  Do we have a motion, if that's appropriate?  Is it seconded?  SPEAKER(?) Second  Without objection Do we have a motion on the redesignation of the New York Reserve Bank as agent [for the System Open Market Account]?  SPEAKER(?) So moved    4/1/86  I did hear a second someplace!  Without objection We have Mr Sternlight and Mr Cross as Managers, with the concurrence of the New York Bank I assume No objections to that You have a series of what are listed on my agenda as policy instruments We renew those once a year I assume everybody has had a chance to look at them and I don't know of any questions being raised With no objections, those are approved There's one item that may not be on your agenda We need one member of the Committee and an alternate to serve for Freedom of Information appeals I understand this is not terribly burdensome; there haven't been any appeals from 1978 to 1985 But there is now an appeal pending, I understand Governor Rice serves in that function with Governor Johnson as an alternate for the Board of Governors, and it may be convenient just to have them also serve for the Committee if that's all right with them and all right with the Committee Hearing no objections--apparently there's an appeal on which you will have to rule Now we're through with the annual organizational work We can go to foreign currency operations, Mr Cross Oh, wait a minute! I'm sorry We have to approve the minutes [of the previous meeting] Is there a motion on the minutes?  Without objection Mr Cross  Any questions or comments?  You can quote some economists, or one anyway, who says the rate has to get down to 100 yen to the dollar  Not right tomorrow, but he kind of makes it tomorrow That's the most extreme  Any other comments or questions? We haven't had any transactions  Mr Sternlight  Questions?  If there are no other questions, we will turn to Mr Kichline Oh, wait a minute! We have to ratify the transactions  Without objection Mr Kichline  Jim, I was curious as to why you're projecting further depreciation of the dollar over the last Greenbook Is it basically lower interest rates, or what?  You are using the assumption of $16 for the oil price It's an area where nobody knows But what would the price of oil sold in the United States today be? Do you have any idea?  Well, this is the time for any commentary that the Committee members might want to make on the business scene Mr Boehne  Mr Melzer  Mrs Horn  Mr Forrestal  Mr Parry  It seems to me that I read something to the effect that Alaskan oil begins closing [down] when the price gets down to around $10 or so The price is getting down to around $10 or so Do we still fear that?  Well, a lot of that is revenue for the government  At these prices is there talk of actually decreasing production?  I hate to raise disconcerting thoughts when I hear about these strengths in the second half of the year, which I can understand It is a popular forecast these days But what would happen if OPEC really got its act together and we suddenly found oil prices going up in the second half of the year instead of down? That is not a very popular view these days, but there are some people who hold it; I don't know what the implications are We don't know whether they're going to do it, much less the implications, but I am not sure that we can assume lightly that there is no possibility of that  Mr Keehn  Mr Morris  Mr Stern  Mr Black  Mr Corrigan  We will resume our quest for somebody who isn't in the Boehne camp Mr Boykin    4/1/86  Governor Seger  Who has a good theory as to why General Motors picked this particular time to increase prices?  Well, you could have a theory, I suppose, that he raises the base price so he can have a bigger incentive  Dealer cost--  I thought those days were gone; [unintelligible] discouraging  Governor Rice  Governor Johnson    4/1/86  I would like to say a word about this foreign situation, particularly with respect to Japan There is talk in Japan about some kind of stimulative action within a week or so-- not on monetary policy particularly, but presumably some kind of budget action--and I don't know what it means Whether the action is [going to be] significant or trivial, cosmetic or real, I'm not quite sure But there's going to be something there I do think--not necessarily as part of that package--that they are debating at the very least, and probably debating in a positive way, whether some further reduction in their discount rate is appropriate in a period of weeks, presumably before the Summit, which is some time in early May I continue to have some concern about the rate of Japanese growth, although I guess our staff forecast has it a little faster now Governor Angell  I'm a little surprised on this price forecast that last quarter and this quarter the GNP deflator stays up as high as does in your forecast with the wholesale index going down and the consumer price index going down You have it going up very narrowly Would you explain that to me quite simply?  This is the implicit deflator you have in this? Does that happen in the fixed-weight deflator?  Much lower, I guess All right  We can turn to Mr Axilrod and--  Sure  As I listen to this, I come away with the view that while the second half of the year may be happy, and everybody has good reason [to believe that] provided the oil situation doesn't snap back at us, I wonder whether the uncertainties presently are being emphasized quite enough To get this growth in the first quarter and I suppose in the second quarter, we have to have inventory and trade improvement, right? In your projection?  Well, it's certainly true in the first quarter, right?  The inventory change is all in CCC?  And you have the trade balance improving in the second quarter?  Yes, declines means improving  Oh, it isn't? No contribution?  Well, I was simply going to suggest that there still are great concrete questions about capital spending,  -19    4/1/86  commercial construction, consumer debt load, the governmental budget, foreign growth, the impact of the oil price and other things I think there are good reasons why the economy isn't looking all that robust right at the moment  I don't know as I see it presumably going downhill a year from now if all these nice things that everybody has been emphasizing happen If we can get through a little--not exactly a valley, but a mesa or something--  Maybe that, and not the budget presumably; hopefully, not the budget  I hope so, but that reduces the [unintelligible] presumably--  Well, we will see Let's turn to Mr Axilrod and then we'll have some coffee  [Unintelligible] that you can sit there and talk about interest rates for 10 minutes and not talk about monetary aggregates I'm not sure whether I'm less confused by the interest rates than I am by the monetary aggregates  I [unintelligible] that it was in passing Are there any questions or comments that you want to direct to Mr Axilrod before the coffee break?  Yes, but the forecast was made up two weeks ago  When you hear all this, it makes monetarism sound good!  Any other questions or comments? If not, let's break for coffee  [Coffee break]  Who would like to express some more detailed policy preferences? You are looking eager, Mr Melzer  Desiderata We want no inflation and good growth and external equilibrium Those are the desiderata now  I think that's true Mr Black  Mr Forrestal  You mentioned, understandably, a concern about getting this break in oil prices converted maybe into some permanent progress or some further progress against inflation That's a goal I suppose we would all share The problem there seems to me to be How does one ratchet down somehow the cost pressures in the services side of the economy? The manufacturing side is doing pretty well except for this--Martha Seger is our representative of Detroit-- General Motors [price increase], which I don't like because--  --it's part of a pattern of price and wage increases reverting to normal But in general, in manufacturing, in construction, and in some other areas--certainly, commodity prices are depressed--it all looks pretty good How do we convert this better short-term price performance into some kind of ratcheting down for all that long series of service prices where the economy is doing pretty well and the wage and salary [increases] seem to be stuck at about 5 percent or maybe a little more? I don't know  A ratcheting down of the levels, but I don't know that you have a ratcheting down of the trend  Well, it has done something; I don't disagree with that But ideally, if we had a better inflation performance for a year, let's say, and that gets built into salary and other behavior in the services area to a degree, that's what you would like to see happen If the consumer price index is running 2 percent or so, a 5 percent wage increase looks pretty big given the productivity increase I am not sure if it looks big to the people giving it or receiving it  We have stopped the wage increases in government--at least the federal government--for better or for worse  So far it has worked Mr Parry  Well, we have run into that problem before Let's worry about the wording of the directive on the next round I think you have a legitimate question But meanwhile, when you say "B," you are thinking in terms of something like $300 million?  Mr Stern  Mr Keehn  Governor Johnson  -25-    4/1/86  Mr Morris  Mr Corrigan  Governor Seger  Mrs Horn  I didn't hear that last sentence Carefully meaning--?  Mr Boehne  Mr Boykin  Governor Rice  Governor Angell  Looking at these velocity numbers, what do you compute for the velocity--I think you do quarterly averages-- implied by alternative B, for what it's worth? It is just arithmetic  Just looking at it, it looks like what-- about a 3-1/2 percent velocity decline?  That requires believing both the M1 forecast and the economic forecast, which are two very large assumptions Mr Guffey  What is seasonal borrowing now?  What was the peak last year for seasonal borrowing?  Want to add something, Governor Wallich?  You didn't break the pattern  Well, we have shadings of differences We have some full-blooded "Bs" and we have some weak-kneed, but the view is generally around "B" We might as well see what shadings we have here and [address] Mr Parry's point The last two reserve periods, which means for four weeks, borrowing has been averaging just a little below $250 million We played it a little on the cautious side and it has come out pretty close to where we intended because we didn't have any computer problems and so forth during that particular period We came in a little under $300 million One interpretation is we could continue doing that seek something like $300 million, but played somewhat cautiously in the absence of other developments I guess we could call that maintaining I don't know whether it needs [explanation]; the difference is so small We have sometimes done exactly what Mr Parry suggested, if I interpreted him right When reserve pressures have changed during the period, we put some language in saying "the degree of reserve pressure that emerged during the previous period" or something like that I guess it is a matter of taste as to whether that's where the center of gravity lies or whether it's worth putting that in there if the difference is so small  Actually, it came before the discount rate lowering, as I remember it, or it began--  This is no big deal, because it was so high the previous two-week period because there were computer problems one weekend We actually had $600 million one week, but I do not--  The $630 million was a freak; I don't know where it would have come out without the computer problems One or two people said they would be reluctant to see the borrowing go below $300 million and others suggested that at least there ought to be some flexibility to go below $300 million These are pretty fine shadings Let me jump down [in the directive] I don't know if this language in the directive is great, anyway Do we want to make it perfectly symmetrical in language in the third sentence? Or would we better capture [the consensus] by changing that sentence to say either "somewhat" or "slightly lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable and somewhat greater reserve restraint might be"? We've used that device from time to time I think there is a question--we've discussed this before at times, though it wasn't appropriate when we changed the discount rate this time If for some reason, because of international considerations or otherwise, it seemed appropriate to reduce the discount rate at some point, I take it that the sense right now--other things being equal--is that we might increase the borrowing level a bit rather than the opposite    4/1/86  SEVERAL Yes  I don't think we can write that into the directive  I don't think we can rule that out either but it's a question of whether we bias it slightly  An oil price move upward?  Well, who knows what's going to happen? But I would be a little surprised if that happened in the next 6 weeks or so I wouldn't be at all surprised to see it happen in a slightly longer time perspective But suppose it happened in the next month or two Would the right reaction be initially to tighten a bit? I don't know  Certainly, over time it would go in the direction of more inflation You can't escape that What it would do to the business picture in the shorter run, I'm not so sure  Well, I don't disagree with that, and I don't think it's going to happen over this time period But who knows? Well, let me put it this way the straightforward thing to do is just to say "maintain" and keep all the wording the same, putting in whatever these percentages are You can all [react] to that Who wants to shoot at that?  I'm looking at a different sheet where I don't have the line numbers  Well, it's hard to object to what Mr Boehne suggested, and it's hard to object because I don't think it does anything but make a few people feel better I guess the question is whether people want to go beyond that and just shade it very slightly  We're only talking about 7 weeks It's a reasonably long period between meetings, but it somehow seems like a very long period If we get March set and whatever April data we have coming in on the weak side, do we react at all? That's the question  I think you are right  I think that's--  Well, I don't know whether it's worth changing the order to say somewhat lesser reserve restraint or somewhat greater The numbers we put in here--these are not very rounded numbers We've been using rounded numbers recently haven't we?  Well, it might sound slightly more consistent, given the uncertainties expressed, to say 7 to 8 percent for Ml; it has the same midpoint as in "B"  We've often stuck ranges like that in here, but it's no big deal  Well, 7 to 8 percent just sounds a little better to me than 7-1/2 percent, but it's no big deal The difference between 7-1/2 and 8 is not very great; neither is the difference between 7-1/2 and 7  No, no This converts into a 9 percent or so quarterly average If that's the way you measure velocity, which is the way they measured velocity, you'd get 3-1/2 percent negative velocity consistent with these numbers because the quarterly average is higher You're starting high  Yes Well, I said it comes out over 9--  The quarterly average measured growth of  -33-    4/1/86  While we're picking at these numbers, is it worth saying 7 percent for M2 and 6-1/2 percent for M3 or should we say 7 percent for both of them?  About 7 percent, unchanged Well, I would suggest that we say "maintain" and note in the record that reserve pressures have eased a trifle during this period We expect this "to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from March to June at annual rates of about 7 percent; while the behavior of Ml continues to be subject to unusual uncertainty, growth at an annual rate of about 7 to 8 percent over the period is anticipated Somewhat lesser reserve restraint or somewhat greater reserve restraint might be acceptable depending upon the behavior of the aggregates" I would interpret this as $300 million [on borrowing], but play it somewhat cautiously in the actual provision of reserves We anticipate a little more to ease than we anticipate to drain  In the absence of other [unintelligible] I don't see why it implies any change Although historically I think it would have implied a lower federal funds rate relative to the discount rate, it doesn't seem to these days  It's consistent with what this says  The only thing I would ask is How much weight do we put on those rather short-term changes in the aggregates compared to what information may be coming in simultaneously on the economy or whatever  Pardon me?  Well, that's precisely what this says Is that as close as we're going to come? We have a funds range--well, wait I was about say 6 to 10 percent for the funds range Is the funds rate low enough so that we want to change that?  -34-    4/1/86 -35-  What did you say on "B"?  I have the feeling we should just leave it at 6 to 10 percent because that's where it has been for a long period of time or change it to 5 to 9 percent I just think that--  It doesn't make a lot of difference This has no practical significance except a month or so from now when it is published some newspaper article will say the Federal Reserve eased  SEVERAL Yes  How many want to leave it 6 to 10 percent? Eight, and those are all Committee members I guess the consensus is to leave it 6 to 10 percent I don't think it will change anything All right With that, I guess we're ready to vote  We have this rare event I don't think a unanimous vote is all that rare but by 10 minutes after 12 it is pretty rare And the lunch is set for 1 pm Well, I don't know whether there are any other burning issues to be raised at this time The Open Market Committee meeting is over  END OF MEETING       Is there a motion to approve the minutes?  SPEAKER(?) So moved  SPEAKER(?) Second  Without objection Mr Cross  Any questions or comments?  Excuse me, I was distracted  Would what look toward continuing pressures?  I don't think there's any safe bet as to what the market will do over the next 6 months to a year  SPEAKER(?) Or two weeks  I'll ask you an impossible question, Mr Truman What will be the GNP increases in Japan and Germany in the first quarter? What would be your best guess at the moment?  You think they were both positive anyway?  Well, they had a more optimistic outlook earlier; there's no doubt about that Recently, I think they have been very concerned about how low [their GNP] may have been in the first quarter  This is true at the moment  In more extreme form here  Mr Sternlight  Any questions?  Any other questions? We have to ratify the transactions  Without objection Mr Kichline  CCC is way down in the first quarter on these estimates, but is that still positive?  Well, I guess we can take whatever comments people have on the business outlook generally Mr Parry  Mr Keehn  Mrs Horn  Mr Black  Mr Forrestal  Mr Boykin  Mr Melzer, you will improve the spirits  Let me just inject a question here There have been a number of references to what favorable wage performances are signaling, which I certainly think has been true in the manufacturing or goods-producing side of the economy However, that's a minority of the economy these days What do you see going on in the service side where wages and salaries have been relatively high? Is there any improvement there?  Mr Boehne  Mr Stern  We're not very good at manufacturing but we are really good at second homes!  Governor Johnson  You talked about the trade sector Just looking at these figures, the staff has a pretty healthy decline in the trade balance over the next 18 months Would you explain that, Mr Truman?  What kind of rise in exports do you have?  You actually have declines in the rates?  How do you measure a decline in domestic production?  Let's turn to Mr Kohn and get the monetary side of the equation, and then have a doughnut  Let me just raise one question that I raised yesterday, which you probably don't have any answer for at this point You mentioned the great liquidity in the economy; some other people have mentioned that Yet, if you look at our liquid assets series, it hasn't been doing much Can you explain that dichotomy?  Basically a phenomenon of how many bills the Treasury is issuing  If there was a big change, yes  Yes, I know  Governor Rice  If nobody else has any comments--  I haven't heard a lot of concern expressed--although there has been some--about the impact of this tax bill on commercial construction, which is in a vulnerable position anyway we keep saying A couple of people have mentioned it but they didn't put enormous emphasis on it I don't know  There is certainly a change in the tax incentives for all these partnerships and so forth I don't understand it all, but it's a big change  I don't know what business or who they are attracting! Governor Angell  Mr Corrigan  Mr Boykin  How are land prices doing, Mr Guffey?  Mr Morris  Governor Seger  Would you conclude that it had any policy implications or not?  Well, let's have a break  [Coffee break]  I'll make a few comments, which may be more in the nature of a summary I must say when I gaze at this table of the first quarter that Mr Kichline gave me, if you believe the numbers--which is a big "if" for many of these quarterly figures--from one perspective it's quite a remarkable performance to have an increase in the GNP at a 37 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate during a quarter when federal purchases are going down at a rate of 30 percent and plant and equipment [spending] is going down at 13 percent If I recall, those things are temporary; there must have been some strength elsewhere I guess one could raise some questions about how sustainable the inventory figure is But that doesn't seem to be in accord with what we've been thinking about the economy However, if you average the fourth and first quarters, I guess you have a picture that's more in keeping with what we thought was going on, or is probably more accurate--a little over 2 percent We had a description of a very mixed picture of different sectors of the economy and different sections of the [country] Manufacturing remains somewhat in the doldrums; we have a few excesses developing in New England and elsewhere in the country in all those financial operations When I look at the problems, generally, I'm not sure there's much that is correctable--looking at it on a world-wide basis now--by much change in monetary policy This trade situation that has been talked about, I think, is a very serious question But it's hard to see how it could be corrected by monetary policy in the United States; maybe it could be corrected by monetary policies in Germany and Japan But I'm among those who are a little skeptical unless we get more growth abroad, because I think that's what's needed to improve the trade picture    5/20/86  I might say a word about the LDCs I don't think that's going at all well at the moment for a variety of reasons, mainly in Mexico where the political situation has gotten very difficult-- stimulated in important ways by expressed American attitudes toward Mexico with regard to drugs and corruption and all that business The atmosphere is very foul for getting constructive changes in economic policy And they're going to run out of money one of these days They haven't yet; their reserve positions have been pretty well maintained, I think, probably by very tight money and exchange rate changes The degree of the tightness of money, at least, probably isn't very good for their longer term The economic policy mix is not very good for what you'd like to see happen constructively over time In the political atmosphere I think there is a question as to whether they will be successful or even want to get their act together to do a constructive financing And if they don't do it, there will be very serious problems in the rest of Latin America Again, I don't see that this is susceptible to monetary policy at this point; a moderate change in interest rates isn't going to do anything for the political situation, which is the root of the problem  It has been remarkable, I think, that the domestic financial pressures in Texas and Oklahoma that should be there aren't very visible on the surface We are learning--or we already have learned, I guess--how to run our savings and loan system without any assets We're getting to the point of [learning] how to run a commercial banking system without any assets Everything goes on faith But again, I don't think there's anything there that's particularly susceptible to economic policy We are getting the protectionism threat coming up again connected with the trade situation All of this to some degree bears upon world-wide economic policy, but again, it's hard to see how it bears very much on monetary policy at the moment, given what we've done  I had a little discussion about what the threat of inflation is I find that we pretty consistently have underestimated the progress against inflation But when I look at next year and the possibilities, I find it entirely plausible to say at the least that the inflation rate would rise quite a lot next year I don't think that's certain; but I just think there are a lot of persistent price pressures in the service area and that's so big One can list a whole bunch of services where that's true, including financial services and housing We're going to get some impact of the dollar [depreciation]; that's icing on the cake As for the energy situation, even if [energy prices] level off, that will be a different picture But if they rebound at all, we will get another aggravation I think we've done remarkably well so far on the goods side of the economy, but we're not going to have agricultural prices going down forever and energy prices going down forever The basic wage and the basic cost on the manufacturing side look fine, but it's a pretty hard [unintelligible] effort on that services side of the economy What we could hope for is that if [inflation] did come out around 4 percent or so--I don't know whether that will be right--but if it's during a period when we're absorbing the exchange rate change we might have gotten off cheap Maybe it will be temporary To a degree, I think that's what we've got to work for We can't offset that potential inflation if the economy is strong, but we could work to make it temporary rather than permanent and hope to see a little more progress over time on the service side I think we've got to look for  -24-    5/20/86  protection there from the budgetary action, which I hope comes forward, and not let the economy get overly exuberant if things go in that direction But none of that is certain yet  On the monetary side I'm told that the preliminary news on the latest money supply figures is not better; in fact, it's a little worse If anything, the May figure looks like it's going to get up toward 20 percent instead of anything lower than that At the least it's an awkward looking figure We have said all along, and I would continue to take the view, that the importance of all these measures has to be judged in the context of M2 and M3--to look no further than the monetary aggregates They got stronger but they are not so overwhelmingly strong as M1 in terms of our longer-range targets; they don't look alarming at this point If they begin leveling off--and their rapid increase is fairly recent and I guess it still doesn't look like that's going to parallel the semi-explosion in M1 in May So I don't know We have a few tremors; I don't think we have all the confirming signs on M2 and M3  I don't want to prejudge things but I get the sense that the comments heard around the table were not forcibly in the direction of doing anything particularly to monetary policy at the moment As we look out ahead--and maybe not very far ahead--the question of being a little more restrictive does arise I'm not sure that date has come quite yet It would await further evidence on both the monetary side and on the economy There we are What have you got to say for yourselves?  You've got to be a little more specific than that! Mr Parry  Let me just say a word about these directives One can debate the particular language but we are so far off the numbers in the directive labeled "alternative draft I," which is the same as the one we had last time, that that seems to me to be a kind of bare-faced evasion of responsibility [We should be] reac to what has happened in a somewhat more sophisticated way than just putting in different numbers in the existing directive, which raises the question of what has been happening here Mr Keehn  Mr Forrestal  Mr Guffey  They're somewhat different all right! That's an understatement of the situation  Mr Black  Mr Melzer  Mr Stern  Mr Boehne  Mr Morris Mr Morris has stepped out Governor Angell  Why don't we discuss the attitude toward intervention a little after we get finished with this instead of mixing it up If you want to discuss it, I think it may be a good idea We will reach this decision and then discuss that Mr Morris  You leave me totally confused, if I may say so I would think the thrust of your comments would lead you to want to change directive I  People can read the same thing differently, but I think the interpretation of keeping alternative I would be that nothing has changed in relative emphasis because we haven't changed the language If we want to change the relative emphasis we would change the wording of the directive The [draft] wording may not be perfect, but--  I don't want to argue the point in substance All I am saying is that if you want to make a change, I would think that the last thing you would want is the old directive repeated again, which says we are not changing anything  I don't think they're implying that  Governor Seger  Governor Johnson  Mr Boykin  Governor Rice  Mr Corrigan  Mrs Horn  Governor Wallich, you can interrupt all this unanimity for Alternative B  You want to tighten up a little?  Okay, with that exception, the easy part is alternative B The difficult part is what that means I have heard considerable expression that the wording of the directive ought to be changed, with only one exception We have to look at these carefully to see what the difference is Just to speak for myself, I am not sure I am alarmed--if that would be a fair way to express it-- over Ml Three consecutive months of high numbers do give me a little pause, however much I deemphasize M1 Even if I don't pay any attention to it at all, this is a time for a little perking up of the ears anyhow, particularly with some rumblings [unintelligible] in M2 and M3, although not at a serious level as yet I also have to agree that it's very hard to see what would make us ease during this period except reasonably clear signs of softness in business activity To see M1 falling below the particular M1 number would not impel a great easing at this point with nothing going on in the economy However--  We'll see what the salient differences are in these directives here The first sentence is going to be the same anyway--"maintain"  I don't accept that as a premise  The Committee may decide that, but I didn't think there was necessarily all that much unanimity that under no conditions would we change--  If that's what we wanted to say, that's the way to say it But I think a lot of people would not say that  There are a zillion contingencies as usual, but just on this point, I guess there is a question If monetary growth continued at the recent rates--I'm talking about all of the aggregates now--with Ml averaging about 15 percent if we use recent months, and M2 projected now for the second quarter at 9-1/2 percent and M3 at 8-1/4 percent, are we highly neutral about those growth rates or not? We had 13 or 14 percent growth in M2 in April and 11 percent in M3 Are we really saying that if growth continued at that rate of speed, just looking at the monetary aggregates alone, that we're neutral?  All other things equal at this point  I don't know how close we are, but I do know that these rates of growth of the aggregates have picked up substantially from what they had been  [Unintelligible] to hear you say that I don't know what the growth path is, but frankly I'm not sure there is all that much difference between II and III The first point we may consider is Do we expect whatever action we take here, which is not much change at the moment, to be consistent with a deceleration of money growth? That's what we are told, as a simple forecast; and I guess we would like to see it happen If that doesn't happen, we might tighten, depending upon the strength of business That's the most important thing I think that's what people are saying; but it is dependent upon the strength of business  I wouldn't rely upon a third-quarter number which nobody knows  We'd need a variety of hard evidence--say, some pickup in orders, continued strength in housing, and automobile sales continuing strong With regard to the projections of next quarter's GNP there's a certain amount of skepticism, although these current indicators tend to get reflected in those projections I am not talking about fine tuning the language It needs to be fine tuned, but I would have thought that you captured the essence of what people were saying Yes, we do expect a deceleration [in monetary growth]; if that doesn't develop, we are going to be a bit worried but we are not going to be worried enough to change things unless the deceleration is accompanied by some feeling that the economy is [not] doing reasonably well And the only thing that would make us ease, as near as we can see now, is a clear sign that the economy is not doing well relative to current expectations If that is the essence of what we are saying we ought to be at both II and III have the [prima facie evidence] of that, or more than the [unintelligible]  Well, that could be incorporated in III The difference in the wording as it starts out is not much in substance, as near as I can see  I don't think it was meant to reemphasize Ml; it's a recognition that M1 is the one that is growing at a jet propulsion rate of speed  We have two different things what's the inherent rate of Ml, which I don't think anybody is intending to change here, and what is way out of line with respect to what was expected, which clearly M1 has been It's like price and income effects It's a low-weighted aggregate way the heck out of line  Well, I think you're probably right Let's start with one or the other; I don't think that there is that much difference I can alter in either direction  Do you want to start on II?  The first sentence is "maintain Then "This action is expected to be consistent with a deceleration in money growth over the balance of the quarter" That's a statement of fact The next sentence is a simple statement of fact too We could say "In view of the rapid money growth thus far in the quarter and apparent weakness in velocity, the Committee anticipates faster growth in the monetary aggregates [than expected at the last meeting], particularly for Ml"  Now, what numbers are we putting in there for M2 and M3?  There is a slight peculiarity in that it says M2 and M3, and as it works out M3 is expected to be 8 percent and the 10 percent is for M2 If we put in 8 to 10 percent, it sounds just the opposite according to this  Would we say M3 and M2? This says "respectively;" you didn't mean that We want to take out the word "respectively" M1 growth at an annual rate of--  Are [unintelligible]?  Growth at the fantastic annual rate of-- Have we ever had a quarterly growth rate that big?  What did you say?  This illustrates the problem of--  What is it?  12 to 14 percent appears big [unintelligible]  Well, the real problem is the next two sentences  Well, let me just suggest that we pick up the two sentences with some modifications from the other directive, and say "If the anticipated slowing in coming weeks does not develop, somewhat greater reserve restraint would or might be acceptable in the context of a pickup in the growth of the economy, taking account"-- keep the rest of that Then "Somewhat lesser reserve restraint might or would be acceptable"  Well, that is all right with me if it is acceptable to others I don't know; some people may want to put it in there  Let's work on the second sentence "Somewhat lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable should there be"--do you want to leave in the marked slowing of money growth?  Would be acceptable?  "Somewhat lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the context of a marked slowing in money growth and pronounced sluggishness of economic performance"  Well, we could say "it would be acceptable only" Or "might" carries that  Sluggishness of economic performance  Now the previous sentence  "Somewhat greater reserve restraint"--do you want to put "would" or "might" in there?  SEVERAL "Would"  --"be acceptable in the context of a pickup in growth of the economy" Presumably if we did either, particularly easing--well, I'm not talking about some very minor thing--but if we wanted to make any pronounced move we'd have a consultation anyway Let's see now, reading from alternative II, "In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions This action is expected to be consistent with a deceleration in money growth over the balance of the quarter However, in view of the rapid money growth thus far in the quarter and the apparent weakness in velocity, the Committee anticipates faster growth for the monetary aggregates, particularly M1, than expected at the last meeting M2 and M3 are expected to expand over the period from March to June at annual rates of about 8 to 10 percent While    5/20/86  the behavior of M1 continues to be subject to unusual uncertainty, growth at an annual rate of 12 to 14 percent over the period is now anticipated If the anticipated slowing in monetary growth"--do you want to put in there "particularly M2 and M3"?  SEVERAL No  "If the anticipated slowing in monetary growth does not develop, somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable in the context of a pickup in the growth of the economy, taking account of conditions in domestic and international credit markets and developments in foreign exchange markets Somewhat lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the context of a marked slowing in money growth and pronounced sluggishness of economic performance" And then we have to stick in a federal funds rate here There is a question of whether you want to make that 5 to 9 percent, which is centered on the present rate We haven't changed that [6 to 10 percent] forever  5 to 9 percent sounds reasonable to me, but I think we ought to put something in the policy record that states pretty clearly that that in itself implies no change in policy, because the press picks that up as a change in policy So long as we are clear about that that this is a purely technical change to center it around the existing rate I think all this implies no change, as we said We aim [for borrowing of] around $300 million--recently it's been below $300 million--as long as these monetary aggregates are so strong We are not going to move anything for some weeks unless something very unusual happens If we have a combination of continued strong growth in money and clear signs, whatever they are, of some pickup in the economy, we might consider snugging up a bit If that became significantly more than a $100 million [snugging], let's say, we'd certainly have a consultation Is that all understood?  Are we ready to vote?  Okay Now, we had some question about the intervention that we might discuss for a moment Do you want to discuss this operational issue of yours, Mr Sternlight? Somebody mentioned to me that you'd like to have a biweekly report  To bring you up to date on one aspect of this dating from 1922 I don't remember just when, but when I was in New York I once thought that it might be a good idea to drop the weekly report altogether and just report for the intervals between meetings But this is a half way [alternative] It seems to make a lot of sense, but I--  Just out of curiosity How many members of the Committee read it? [Secretary's note Quite a few hands went up]  This is interesting Well, I don't [unintelligible] for discussion This seems not unreasonable It passes conveniently into the reserve--  It makes sense to do that I think that the new schedule is accepted  Well, let's discuss this intervention question a little I don't know if you really want to be operational about this, but some sense of the Committee's mood, I think, would be useful We have these concerns about the dollar from time-to-time, including quite recently, and the question of coordinated intervention to support the dollar arises I think it is fair to say that historically, although the Committee has not been all that gung ho by and large, in many particular periods we have been more receptive to intervention on either side--certainly including for several years restraining the rise of the dollar--than the Treasury has been I suppose one way of expressing this is that neither of us has chosen to act, although we have independent powers, when the other side has not been ready to act If the other side is more reluctant than we are, we don't act The most reluctant party has a natural advantage under those conditions But the question has arisen at times, just as in the most recent context, as to whether there wouldn't be some usefulness in intervening This question has not been pressed very hard Governor Angell may have some opinions of his own; he had a more detailed proposal But the question arises as to how useful you think this tool is and whether we should be sympathetic in the right conditions--meaning a weak dollar in these circumstances--toward perhaps providing some support for the dollar It is probably not relevant right now in terms of our present decision, but at some time it may inhibit us from being as easy in monetary policy as we would otherwise like to be for fear of its effects on the dollar We may not quite be in that mode right today, but we could be at some other time--even in the [near] future, if the second contingency sentence in the directive came to bear How do you feel about that possibility?  I hate to discuss this in terms of responding [unintelligible] sterilized or unsterilized intervention because I think we've got to make those decisions separately and ex post The intervention may be unsterilized but not in the technical sense that the amount of the open market operation is governed by what we do in the foreign exchange market It may coincide with a period of easing and in some broad sense you can say it was unsterilized We have this kind of separable decision The contingency that might arise--the one that I cited--is where we might be in at least a slightly easy mode and want to intervene in the opposite direction I guess it would be more than sterilized; in that particular case, it would be--I don't know what the term is--"antiseptically sterilized" We would be putting money into the domestic market and taking it out of the foreign exchange market; we would be going in the opposite direction Call it "sanitized" or "insulated"  "Ultra-sterilized"!  -45-  SPEAKER(?)    5/20/86  You are putting it in a negotiating context, which could arise, but I don't know whether I absolutely want to limit the question to that context One of the difficulties in world economic situations generally is that appreciation in their currencies, in fact, tends to depress their economic growth in the short run One other reason you get as much weakness there as you get is because their currencies have appreciated so much that their businessmen have not been as eager, at the margin anyway, to expand as they otherwise might be And that tends to support an idea that goes in your direction, in terms of some kind of trade-off, at some point  [Unintelligible] forecast I am thinking primarily of intervention to support the dollar If we were tightening monetary policy here, however slightly, one ordinarily would think narrowly that that might strengthen the dollar a little in itself and we wouldn't have to intervene We wouldn't have any interest in intervening on that side I think the more operational case, although it is not the case right at the moment, would occur if we were running quite an easy monetary policy or easing further, or if monetary policy were unchanged and the dollar was declining anyway, making them unhappy We would be raising some questions ourselves; we might want to intervene to support the dollar One could imagine circumstances--let's say we were tightening policy [unintelligible] or for other reasons the dollar was strengthening I [don't] think that is immediately ahead, but who knows? We might want to intervene on the other side  I am not talking about massive operations If we have a massive operation, that is another kettle of fish Presumably we couldn't leave that alone anyway until [unintelligible] I think of it more as a change in the kind of attitude we have toward intervention One particular reflection of that might be if the situation arose the way I described; that might make it operational but there might be other contexts too  [Unintelligible] could have a big fight about it More generally, putting the question operationally, there have been times in the past when, quite on its own, the Open Market Committee was not very eager to intervene and--to exaggerate a bit-- had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the table I don't sense that such an atmosphere exists now, under the appropriate circumstances, but I want to confirm that That's just the broadest way to put it A more active mode in which to put it is to take one example, one Wayne took If we see a positive desirability of doing it if we can get something out of the [other countries], that is one possibility  Barring some other decision, I think we would conduct a net of open market operations, domestic and foreign, to meet whatever the Committee decided upon    5/20/86  Well, that clearly would be one possible purpose; another would be the kind of thing that Wayne described Independent of that, if we really thought the weakness of the dollar was constraining what we wanted to do in reserve provision, we might want to send out signals Whether that would be very powerful or not we don't know But would it be useful to send a signal that says "Yes, we are worried about the dollar"? If we want to ease anyway, we could try to give ourselves room to ease by giving a counter signal on the dollar It might not work  Well, in some fundamental, theoretical, sense we would be moving in opposite directions It might not work But, given the importance of psychology in particular instances in the market, one can make a case for trying  Yes, that's easy But in the other case, suppose they didn't ease their policy and we were still stuck and we wanted to ease or not tighten and the dollar was weak Let's put it that way We weren't very eager to tighten or we wanted to tighten as little as possible, and they are not doing anything, and the dollar is a pain--  Well, that obviously would help But we could--  They might  I think you're right In all these circumstances, that would probably happen But the question still remains Would they sell a little less eagerly and actively if we were giving this contrary signal?  Maybe, maybe not  [Unintelligible] judgment at the time as to whether you're going to be And it's very hard to--    5/20/86  Mr JOHNSON I do agree there are rare opportunities when it could be useful  Well, right now, the direction we're talking about we would get coordination with them  I'll give you one not very far removed type of hypothesis--a situation that did arise a couple of weeks ago Suppose we were sitting right in the posture we're sitting with and, say, we don't want to move at the moment--we want to wait for a little more evidence of monetary growth or an improved economy Yet we have a little tendency in that direction as time passes, but the dollar gets very weak in the meantime So it begins forcing that decision sooner than we otherwise would want to do it We might say "Well, let's try a little intervention in here because we don't really want to take that step toward tightening but we're getting a little concerned, or more than a little concerned, about the dollar" It might work or it might not work But I guess the question is What do we lose by trying to buy a little time at the very least by doing the intervention?  Well, except unresolved fundamentals We go against; we might be doing it in the future We're not going to get into fundamentals  And that is more or less where we are now The dollar is weak at the moment We're slightly biased in what we see for the future but we're not very eager to have to respond by general monetary policy to a pronounced weakness in the dollar In that particular situation, apart from this negotiating Wayne suggested, is that the right time to be quite willing or--depending upon the situation--even eager to intervene?  Given all the permutations and combinations, I think I got about as much guidance as I could get in the absence of specifics  I think the question arises because there hasn't been any shift  I don't think that this conversation is inconsistent with that I'm not sure how we would come out on a specific [proposal], but I think we've probably gone as far as we can go in the absence of something specific If there's nothing else, we have a meeting in July We may have a consultation before that if something happens We can go eat lunch  END OF MEETING       I think we can proceed We need somebody to move the minutes  No objections Ms Greene  Any questions or comments?  I can recite the case But if you ask me whether it's convincing at the end of the day I am never very convinced, though the individual arguments are stated with great force and clarity They say consumption is rising pretty rapidly and the discount rate is at a postwar low That is always presented as number one They say We have reduced the discount rate three times so far this year and it is at a postwar low; consumption is doing pretty well; there are reasonably favorable reports about the rest of the    7/8-9/86  economy and we're happy; money supply is over the targets and the nontarget target  That is the transitory development  In Germany the arguments are more or less the same Germany, I think, can make a much better case There is a lot more evidence that the economy could pick up They have good investment survey figures, up above 10 percent in real terms; consumption was strong in the first quarter; and real income was way up and they say consumption is bound to be strong They had a weak construction sector, but that's over now They feel there is not much they can do about monetary policy; anyway, they are above target  What's my feeling about the likelihood?  Well, they wouldn't like it, but relative to easing monetary policy, I don't know They have expressed no eagerness to ease monetary policy If our exchange rate got weak enough, that would obviously be an influence but they are not going to interpret it as another [unintelligible] this summer It is going to--  Any other questions or comments? If not, we will turn to Mr Thieke  In the interest of completing my answer to Mr Boehne, the Germans have the argument that they are low in the EMS; they are a little less low than they were even a few days ago Both Germany and Japan are relatively low They say the recent inflation performance is just temporary and they have to guard against the relative resurgence of inflation  Any questions of Mr Thieke? Any comments, observations? If not, we have to ratify the transactions for a period marked by remarkable closeness to the borrowings target throughout the period  Messrs Kichline, Prell, and Truman  MESSRS KICHLINE, PRELL, and TRUMAN [Statements--see Appendix]  Mr Stern    7/8-9/86  Mr Parry  Mr Guffey  Governor Johnson  Governor Seger  A lot of appreciation against the Canadian dollar  Well, you have assaulted the staff with a few questions I haven't heard anybody committing themselves to the outlook at this point I don't know whether we want to do that after we look at the long-run ranges Why don't we put the long-run ranges on the table? Mr Kohn  [Unintelligible] the usefulness of the model Does anybody have any particular questions for Mr Kohn? Have we covered every contingency?  Mr Morris, M1 emphasis led us away from [unintelligible] so we can go back to it That gets to the question that I was going to raise Maybe we can, if not resolve it, at least    7/8-9/86  begin to form some consensus on what we want to do with M1 in these long-range targets I am not so worried about what precisely the target should be if we have a target, but whether we should have one or rebase it Do we chose a new target for this year? Do we have one for next year? Do we rebase this year, do we keep what we have, or do we say we are going to be over it and eliminate what we have? Of the various choices Mr Kohn gave you, what appeals?  You are talking about 1986? What do you do for 1987?  We have to set a target for something; we don't necessarily have to do it for Ml  You say just keep 3 to 8 percent this year and say we are not going to be within it?  Mr Guffey  Mrs Horn  You said particularly for 1987?  Mr Black    7/8-9/86  Mr Parry  Mr Corrigan  Mr Forrestal  How can you have a monitoring range without setting--?  Mr Stern  I don't want to get into just what the range should be at this point, assuming we have one Governor Angell  You can make a vague statement about that  Mr Boykin  Mr Keehn  Governor Seger  Mr Melzer  Just so I get it clear in my mind, is it literally true that 6 to 11 percent implies 8 percent from now on?  Governor Wallich  Mr Parry  It's not quite relevant, but I would remind people that once we tried to do that with all the targets We said We aren't quite ready; we'll set them at the end of the year And Mr Proxmire sent us back, threatening us with a legal suit But I don't think that's relevant, really, in terms of just one of the aggregates Do you have anything to say, Mr Boehne?  Mr Morris, you are against anything [relating to] Ml You would say drop it and bury it?  Whose growth is very low this year  So was debt a few years ago and that has been rising like crazy  Or commodity prices or something  Well, I think there is some disagreement about how much weight we want to retain on M1 for some indefinite future period that we don't quite know about I don't know how to resolve that problem I suspect it's unresolvable in the sense of getting agreement among the members I have a little logical difficulty with a monitoring range regarding what it means or at least whether we really want to do it If we establish a monitoring range that means anything, we've got to establish a new target  I'm really addressing it to the only persons, at least on this Committee, who said set a new range When you come up against Mr Melzer and Mr Parry, the problem is How do you know what you want to set?  We could change--  We could write down a new range and say this is now a monitoring range I don't know what we would say  Well, except that the present range is a monitoring range We are monitoring how far outside the range we are now It seems a little strange  But we had a range  Sure, we did  All I am trying to think about is how we should word it In the wording we can say all sorts of things; but how operational it is, I don't know  With a monitoring aggregate in the past, we have had a range There's no doubt about it  What page are you on?  I think we would say something like that  -20-    7/8-9/86  Well, the great majority of the Committee members--  We don't need [precise] language now  Well, just summarizing the discussion, a great majority of the Committee members want some variant but don't want to horse around with it--just admit we are running over it for this year The majority of the non-Committee members want to do the same thing So, unless people have any great changes of heart I think we are someplace in that neighborhood We don't need to decide this issue right now, but that is where we are unless there are great changes of heart tomorrow Unless somebody gets persuasive with a gold tongue, we're much more evenly divided regarding next year It's pretty evenly divided; I'm not being too precise about it I don't think these are the most crucial issues; I agree with Mr Boehne on that I presume the choice is that we either say we don't know right now and we may or may not have a range by the time we get to the end of the year and have to decide, or we write a figure down--I would presume something like this year's--and say we'll decide at the end of the year whether we really need it or not because we are not at all sure that we mean it And there isn't an enormous amount of difference between those two choices  I think I probably would feel slightly more comfortable saying we'll get around to it at the end of the year, but I am not sure it makes a lot of difference The only loss in doing that, and I don't think this is an enormous issue so long as we get the right language, is how easy it is to return to it if we want to Clearly, it's pretty simple to return to it at the end of the year, if we really want to at that point If we don't want to then, and we stated the range earlier, it isn't going to help much I don't think the difference is all that enormous  Well, I presume if we didn't have a target, we would say We are not crazy about being over it now, but we think we half understand and half don't understand it; and if M1 continues to run high and these other [aggregates] are running high we anticipate that we would get worried about it We would look at it and take it into account, but we don't have any particular number in mind If it was running high in connection with the others that would be of some significance to us Next year we would like to see it a lot lower, but we are not ready to commit ourselves at this point  Given that you [don't] think it's an enormous point, I think that's about where we are at the moment We will start tomorrow with the business outlook, which we haven't really dealt with, and then return to the long-term ranges in an operational sense But I would hope not to linger too much over this M1 issue and be able to dispose of that in something like five minutes tomorrow With the background of this discussion, I think that's roughly where the weight lies So, unless somebody wants to be very persuasive tomorrow and feels very strongly--  In that discussion I don't think I used the term "monitoring range" because we wouldn't have a range We would say "monitor"  Why don't we make it 915 am because we have plenty of things to discuss before we go up to that lunch Or, we can start at 900 am if you want to Let's start at 900 am I had some crazy thought to say about this, but it has escaped me  Well, I guess I would respond to that in some logical sense that may be correct I don't think it really is correct I think I am more certain even about the appropriate course for Ml right now than I am for debt I do get worried about debt rising substantially faster than the GNP, I guess; I might not do anything about it but it doesn't seem to me right in the long run I am not sure that one can say that about M1 in the very long run For 1986 and 1987, I am not sure I can say it I think something is the matter with debt rising as fast as it is I am not sure that something is the matter with Ml rising as fast as it is for this limited period of time Sure, if it grows that fast for five years, we would be in trouble But if we are in some kind of transition to a new world, maybe M1 relative to GNP is still very low historically  -22-    7/8-9/86  Debt is very high historically That is suggesting that we [should be] more worried about the level of debt than about the level of Ml in some sustainable sense  Well, it's statistically true, I think When you look at the levels, it's statistically correct  [Growth in] M1 is very rapid relative to that of GNP for this period in time There's no doubt about that, historically They are both equally out of line in terms of the year- to-year growth path  You are going to get your two minutes to [expound to] everybody in a much longer discussion tomorrow You can be really persuasive, but I guess you are going to have to convince people that they may not want to swear by your new range but monitor by it Suppose you made the range the numbers the staff has here What are they 6 to 11 percent or something?  Well, you are talking about next year; I am talking about this year Suppose you made it 6 to 11 percent? Does that make you feel more comfortable than some other figure in terms of--?  I'll give you one to go home and think about overnight Suppose the economy was moving more rapidly than all of these projections, and everybody was feeling much more buoyant, and maybe M2 and M3 were a little high but not outside the ranges, but M1 was behaving quite nicely within your new 6 to 11 percent range Say it's only 10-1/2 percent  -23-    7/8-9/86  Well, we will see tomorrow, with a short additional argument, whether you can persuade your colleagues  What kind of manufacturers?  Who is that?  Mr Parry  Mr Black  Mr Forrestal  Mr Boehne  Mrs Horn  Mr Morris  Mr Boykin  Mr Melzer    7/8-9/86  Mr Stern  Mr Corrigan  Mr Guffey  It doesn't seem to be improving much  Governor Angell  I don't want to interrupt this because we've got to move along But I don't understand this chart that we had yesterday on government payments to farmers It only shows that they are about $12 billion and I thought they were more like what Governor Angell was reciting  They certainly include something [unintelligible] Governor Rice  Governor Seger  The way I read it, [unintelligible] it could only be worse than what's in the Senate bill by the time it gets finished in conference  Governor Johnson  Do you want to say something, Governor Wallich?  Well, I think we have completed our go- around on the business outlook I don't have anything much to add to it, except I would pick up on the comments that Governor Johnson just made and that Governor Angell made to some extent We have had a lot of what seem to me to be shocks--if that is the right word--on the domestic economy oil and tax reform are probably depressants; we have been looking at overbuilding in construction for a long time and that's headed south; we have had an awful agricultural situation We have had 3-1/2 years of expansion I'd say maybe we are overcoming some of those depressing influences by a rather large amount of monetary and financial stimulation, which has its own difficulties down the road as to its sustainability  But the key problem is this trade problem I don't think we are going to solve it by depreciation That may be necessary over a period of time We have had quite a lot Without a better business picture around the world, I think depreciation in the short run will worsen the business picture abroad as well as be a depressing influence now on their economies Our growth has not been all that great during the first half However, in the world view it is not bad; in fact, it is better The most depressing thing to me, in a structural kind of sense, is that our economy is not growing very fast and we are still growing faster than they are abroad--in particular when our growth is being undercut by a continuing decline in the trade balance right up to date So long as that problem exists, we are on a collision course with something because we can't grow and build up the rest of the world when we are starting with a trade balance [deficit] of $140 billion or whatever it is, as opposed to three or four years    7/8-9/86  ago when we started at close to zero Over a period of time I think that also is related to the budget problem But how do we get stimulus abroad? We would like some stimulus here, but it is going to have to be less than what we get abroad in order to begin working on the underlying problem; it is a nice trick, which isn't within our control in any easy way It is really remarkable [to find] when you talk to these foreigners how happy they are about the situation They seem to be perfectly content not to have much growth or a bit of growth at the expense of rising trade surpluses  I think we ought to presume [that] in our short-run policymaking I want to turn to the long run now, but I would say that we are going to have a decline in the discount rate, say this week, if I read the tea leaves correctly I didn't hear anyone around the table say they were particularly adverse to that We just ought to assume that It is all backwards; the foreign countries ought to be reducing [interest rates] or providing some kind of stimulus I think many of them would say that ideally they ought to be getting some fiscal stimulus--that they ought to be reducing taxes or something That is what the German monetary people say and that is probably what the Japanese monetary people feel, but it is not going to happen regardless of what is desirable The second best approach for them would be to ease monetary [policy] Based upon what I know, if we visibly [act]--say, by changing the discount rate--I would assume that the Germans and the Japanese will not respond They say they will not respond Whether they will or not depends upon developments in the market The idea that we can orchestrate a general decline by the Japanese, Germans and ourselves this week or next week or the following week, I think is just not obvious I do think we will see some declines by the French, the British, the Swedes, and maybe by somebody else in Europe, but I don't know who else That may set up, apart from our change, a force that would leave the Germans embarrassingly stuck out by themselves and may raise [pressures] on the Japanese I think economically a change by the French, British, and the Swedes won't make much different But I think that is what will happen there will be a pretty prompt change from some secondary countries but not a change by the Germans and the Japanese on round one We talked vaguely about making a change in September, but that is a little beyond the horizon that seems immediately relevant But I think that is the situation we face Now, if we talked about a really big discount rate change, I don't know whether that would change [the reaction] But I make these comments in the context of a 1/2 point change on the discount rate That is the way they talk What the chances are, say, within a two week period, that they would feel somewhat forced to change, I think depends largely upon the exchange market and other factors; but that is not their mood now  Let's turn to the long run, to [M2 and] M3 I don't know to what degree we can short circuit this [discussion] We are comfortably within the ranges for M2 and M3 Does anybody have in mind proposing a change in the M2 and M3 ranges for 1986?    7/8-9/86  So, we can assume that they stay the same and dispose of that quickly Then we move to 1987 That's a different page, isn't it?  There isn't much difference in what is being presented to us but we're free to propose anything between keeping it the same next year or moving it all of one half percentage point I don't detect any enormous economic significance in the difference between 6 to 9 percent and 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent; there might be some psychological difference Obviously, the slight reduction fits in with the idea that we ought to lower the ranges over time And if you match this against the forecast--I might mention that you all have an opportunity, as usual, to change these forecasts in the next couple of days So, you ought to review them and see whether you want to [make any changes] in the light of this meeting Otherwise, we have a nominal GNP projection by the staff of 6-1/2 percent and [forecasts by] everybody else that run over a full range of 5 to 8 percent, probably, but [cluster] at 6 to 7-1/2 percent Either of these proposed ranges for next year seems comfortably to encompass a straight relationship [of money growth] to nominal GNP and would allow for some decline in velocity  Well, historically, you're looking--  Historically, it has been pretty close to zero, but it has been declining in the last two years  Well, it depends upon which way nominal GNP is running  It would allow for it  Well, a half point obviously shows some progress toward a lower range I don't think the substantive difference is great, but I don't know Does anybody else want to say anything?  Well, I am not sure one would expect this kind of decline in velocity to persist in those particular aggregates Does anybody else want to say anything?  What are you actually projecting for M2, for what it's worth? I am not sure it's worth all that much; nonetheless, what is the staff projecting for M2 and M3 for the year?  For 1986  Right at the midpoint  I presume that, as for Ml, in a much more moderate way you would assume that M2 and M3 velocity might tend to decline with a significant decline in interest rates  It's anybody's guess, but my guess would be that the decline in interest rates is going to be considerably greater this year than it is likely to be next year I'm assuming that we may get some more [rate declines] before the end of this year  Let me just get a general show of preferences This is quite a narrow difference between 6 to 9 percent and 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent Nobody wants to talk outside that range, I take it How many would favor 6 to 9 percent? I'll get preferences from everybody now, just for the fun of it anyway How many prefer the other way? We are going to be pretty evenly split, I am afraid We have a pretty even split  -43-    7/8-9/86  Pardon me?  Well, I didn't count very carefully but it's pretty close, I think Does anybody want to make an argument one way or the other here?  This is no life or death matter to me, but I come out about where you do as a matter of preference, in terms of everything else rising pretty rapidly I [don't] think we're going to get in great trouble with 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent and it's probably somewhat better to be in that posture rather than the other But it's not a life or death matter; I'm not going to put my body over railroad tracks for a half a percentage point  You can say that there's justification for moving it lower; but a few people look at it differently, I guess    7/8-9/86  We have the arguments on the table Does anybody have another argument they want to put on the table?  Well, let me get down to the [preferences of] Committee members For 6 to 9 percent 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 For 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and I count myself with that as my preference, so, 6 We only have 11 members these days, don't we? We can't be any closer than that That's--  If this minority is ready and willing to concede, we'll assume the 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent So, it's 6 to 9 percent for this year and 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for next year Let me return to M1 I haven't thought about this exhaustively overnight, but let me try something out just to see whether I am in line roughly with where I thought the sentiment lay yesterday in not trying to destroy M1 completely I tried to visualize how this would be presented in a table; it also would be reflected in the language, obviously Suppose we leave the 3 to 8 percent for this year and put it in brackets or add a star or maybe both in presenting the table and we say "The Committee did not change this target for this year in view of all the uncertainty, but it certainly expects growth to run above it this year" That's for 1986 For 1987, we could put in a target and also express a considerable amount of uncertainty That leaves the question, then, of precisely what the target should be And in the language we would indicate that even though all of these targets are tentative, this one is doubly tentative for next year So, we leave it there in a formalistic sense, but disavow it as having any real operational significance at this point The operational significance, with further explanation, would be stated in language    7/8-9/86  presumably in the [Humphrey-Hawkins] report, and in my statement [to Congress], that we would get more concerned over a rapid increase in M1, if it were accompanied by rapid increases in M2 and M3  And the converse, too, I guess that we would not be particularly concerned in view of all the factors-- interest rates and so forth--if a rapid increase in Ml were not accompanied by excessive growth in M2 and M3 Now, does that reasonably capture the spirit or not?  Well, that contemplates setting a range for 1987, but we'll have to discuss what range to put down for 1987 We had two alternative proposals yesterday One is rather pro-forma to keep it at the 3 to 8 percent with all the reservations I suggested, and Governor Angell resuggested a much wider range of 3 to 10 percent That looks so wide; it looks a little peculiar, unless we can make it 5 to 10 percent or something But if you want to make it higher--  I think we can I don't think we should fool around by a 1/2 percentage point or something like that That doesn't make any sense to me  From when to when?  That's when Milton Friedman wrote his great tome saying there was an inexorable secular decline in velocity  At which point it rose from 2 to 4  Whatever we say for next year--I'm just repeating myself--will be in brackets or something  I'm inclined to think we ought to leave it the same or leave it out To change it requires too many explanations; we would have to explain both why we changed it and that it doesn't mean much That's putting an extra burden--  For this year, you're talking about?  I think we settled this year We're talking about next year  Well, I think the argument for doing it is just to keep it in the ball game Some people feel it may be harder to come back and set a range next year  But if we leave it out, I presume what we would say is that we simply are not setting a target now and we will re-examine--  [Unintelligible]  If I understand correctly--on the theory that it is more important that we [not] fiddle around with it--I think the choice is between leaving it at 3 to 8 percent or leaving it out completely If we leave it at 3 and 8 percent I envision presenting it enclosed in brackets and with an asterisk, footnoting why we have left it unchanged for this year We certainly feel quite open about changing or even not having it at all next year  Well, let me get a preference among the Committee members for just leaving it out or for 3 to 8 percent, with suitable brackets, asterisks, and footnotes Let me take the 3 to 8 percent with brackets and asterisks Seven That leaves four on the other side  1, 2, and who's the other? Since this isn't a big deal, can those four live with it the other way with [unintelligible]? Let's look at the language of the directive Well, we have this debt question too Where are we on debt?  The range is 8 to 11 percent  Last year when we faced the same problem, we said we were going to keep the range the same because we thought debt was too high--that we were going to run above and we really couldn't do much about it, but we didn't like it much There is no difference now, but we can make it [unintelligible] Is that acceptable again for 1986? Do we leave it there and say we are likely to run above it?  But for next year, what are we going to do? Your forecast for next year is what?  10 percent  If that's what you are actually forecasting, it would be within the range  Why don't you make some money, Frank?  I don't know if we [should] keep it Assuming for the moment that we keep it, given the forecast I don't see much point in changing it next year Or are we running too high?  Was there anything in there that we could use to say debt isn't quite as high as it looks? It still has to look    7/8-9/86  high relative to GNP, but would it be within our targets with appropriate adjustments?  Even the equity, I suppose, wouldn't affect it much  Does anybody object to leaving it the same as it is this year? I think the argument against taking it out is that to some extent that says we don't care about it Personally, I do care about it--[not] in the sense that it's going to affect our policy significantly, but I don't like to give a signal that we are perfectly comfortable with the amount of debt being created  I don't think it's a big deal, but it's just another burden of explanation  The range is 8 to 11 percent now and the language the way this is written is "The associated range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt was retained at 8 to 11 percent" There is no acknowledgement there that it is running high The language you showed me this morning, Mr Kohn, was that assuming we kept the Ml range? I forget  Well, I am looking at [the language for] Ml now, not debt, in variant I "In light of these uncertainties and of the substantial decline in velocity in the first half of the year,  -50-    7/8-9/86  the Committee decided that growth in excess of the previously [established range] would be acceptable"--  Okay, "could be acceptable"--[they begin] to look the same--"depending on the behavior of velocity over"-- I was wondering whether we should break up that sentence and leave it the way it is with a "would" or just put a period after "acceptable" and then say "The extent of"--  "Overrun" or whatever the word is "would be acceptable to the extent that growth would continue to depend upon the behavior of velocity, growth in the other monetary aggregates, developments in the economy and financial markets, and potential inflationary pressures" or something like that I'm not crazy about the word "overrun"  We are talking about relative to the range  SPEAKER(?) Relative to the [unintelligible]  Maybe we should just forget about the range "Acceptable growth in Ml over the remainder of the year will depend upon" Or we could just say "The behavior of M1 will be judged in the light of"  I don't know whether we will have time to vote, we have so many--! I guess they are about the same It just sounds a little better to say "Acceptable growth of Ml, however, for the remainder of the year will depend on the behavior of velocity,"-- we don't have to say "over the balance of the year" because we just said "the remainder of the year"--"growth of the other monetary aggregates, developments in the economy and financial markets, and the degree of inflationary pressures"  --"and price pressures" That could be in either direction  Why don't we put that last, anyway; we sure don't want to emphasize inflation Now, turning to debt, I had wording--  Read that to me again  Actually, the debt measure is expected to slow quite a bit after the first quarter  Well, I don't know if this is any good, but let me try something along these lines "Given rapid growth in the early part of the year, the Committee recognized that the increase in debt in 1986 may exceed its monitoring range of 8 to 11 percent but felt that an increase in that range would provide an inappropriate benchmark to evaluate longer-term trends in that aggregate" Stick that at the end The directive would now read "The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary growth" After the sentence on retaining the 6 to 9 percent we would go to Ml and say "With respect to M1, the Committee recognized that, based on the experience of recent years, the behavior of that aggregate is subject to substantial uncertainties in relation to economic activity and prices, depending among other things on the responsiveness of M1 growth to changes in interest rates In light of these uncertainties and of the substantial decline in velocity in the first half of the year, the Committee decided that growth in Ml in excess of the previously established 3 to 8 percent range for 1986 would be acceptable Acceptable growth in Ml over the remainder of the year will depend on the behavior of velocity, growth in the other monetary aggregates, developments in the economy and financial markets, and price    7/8-9/86  pressures Given its rapid growth in the early part of the year, the Committee recognized that the increase in debt in 1986 may exceed its monitoring range, but felt that an increase in that range would provide an inappropriate benchmark in evaluating the longer-term trends of that aggregate"  Tne trouble with this all is that I can see that Mr Proxmire is going to say You have two ranges that are meaningless What are you doing here? And so forth and so on  Regardless of his tone, procedurally he will say that we are shirking our duty by expressing such ranges The defense will be Oh no; we have ranges here for M2 and M3 He won't be happy, but I don't know any other way we can handle it  He would say the same thing if we had no ranges  If we don't say anything, the obvious question is "Is it going to be within that?" And then I say "No"  It is pretty close, but I don't know If the projection were 11-1/2 percent, I would say "Yes" If it were 12 percent, "I don't know"  I am going to have to give an explanation, anyway I am inclined to think some explanation like this is what I would have to say  That would be a choice But we could overrun that too These are the choices, I think raising it, or    7/8-9/86  dropping it, [or leaving it the same] Whether we drop it, raise it, or leave it the same, I think we have to say something like this  If we drop it, then we have to add quite a few paragraphs saying that we haven't found it very useful  Can't think of anything else for a while, in terms of a pure correlation--  Well, I think I'll get boxed around the ears by Mr Proxmire I guess I can survive it [For debt] we take this sentence with the language [I read] Is that right? [For M2 and M3] we keep 6 to 9 percent and we keep [Ml] in the table and the range appears as 3 to 8 percent All we say in the directive is that we are going to exceed it How much we exceed it is not stated for now Let's vote on that as what we are going to have for 1986  Now, 1987 The first thing, I think, is that we don't put M1 in there in the paragraph "For 1987 the Committee agreed on tentative ranges of monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1986 to the fourth quarter of 1987 of 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for M2 and M3" I think I would put the debt last again; I'm not sure if it's going to be 8 to 11 percent again, but I'd put it last Then we would say "With respect to M1 [unintelligible]"  Well, the sentence sounds all right; but I think if we are going to put 3 to 8 percent in the table, we have to say something about it  I think the sentence that is in there is all right I'd take out the word "particularly" and I would take out the word "reappraisal" and just make it "appraisal" But I think we have to say something about or precede it with "While the Committee has plugged in"--  Why did we pick 3 to 8 percent?  I don't know; maybe I am getting too fancy But let me try something like this "While the range of 3 to 8 percent for M1 in 1987 would appear appropriate in the light of most historical experience, the Committee recognizes that the particular uncertainties surrounding the behavior of M1 velocity over the more recent period would require careful appraisal of the target range for 1987"  I am making a big modification in my mind "The Committee recognized the exceptional uncertainties"--that sort of particularizes it Well, does that sound all right? Does anybody have anything else to say? We have 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for M2 and M3 Debt we can keep the same or make it less; it was 8 to 11 percent For 1987, we can keep Ml the same [as for 1986]; we are not saying whether we are setting it as a tentative range or not It depends on what we want to do And in the table we would put [the range] in brackets with an asterisk Are we ready to vote?  We better go have a donut and return I do think, with regard to the short run, that I personally would make the assumption that the discount rate will be reduced in a few days  [Coffee break]  I don't know how many of you read that [staff memo] on debt The question is whether an abbreviated version of that should be added to the Humphrey-Hawkins report as an appendix [Secretary's Note Several members expressed agreement]  Who wants to say something about the short-run posture?  I don't see any reason not to assume that the funds rate would go down as much as the discount rate  Mr Melzer  -56-    7/8-9/86  Let me suggest something in that connection, just in terms of clarifying the record To me it seems very awkward--and undesirable--to put in the directive some action that hasn't been taken yet, however probable it may be But I don't see anything the matter with making clear in the record of the meeting that many people suggested--if that's the way it comes out--an unchanged degree of reserve restraint on the assumption that the discount rate is reduced and that when it is reduced, they presumably might be in favor of a lesser degree of reserve restraint But [there should be] something in the record so that when people read the record it says that decision was made in the light of an anticipated reduction in the discount rate, without actually putting it in the directive Now, people may have different opinions about the discount rate; but if that is the underlying assumption, I think that ought to be clear in the record someplace, whatever the directive says  I would resist putting that in the directive with [unintelligible]  But I think it can be made clear in the policy record, if that's what we are assuming and if that were the basis--for many people anyway--for however they voted  I don't think it will be quite unilateral, but it will be with minor actors rather than major actors  Sorry to interrupt, but I want to raise a procedural point We were going to invite the Justice Department lawyer who is defending us, hopefully, in this [Melcher] suit to come over after lunch But he couldn't come after lunch I don't know what the chances are that we will be finished by 1230 pm or 1245 pm today We may run into the time of the luncheon for Mr Axilrod  But we have a theoretical action If the discount rate is reduced, we can increase the reserve restraint a little As for the argument about changing the discount rate and the effect on the economy, we haven't got a good choice There is obviously a lot to these arguments If it were entirely up to us--if you conceive of it as I do--the question is whether we have any chance of getting some improvement abroad To a considerable extent, the dilemma for us is that it may [depend] less on our policy than on other people's policies And this is going in reverse from the way it should go I don't deny that for a minute But it's not going to go without our moving It is also true that we are not going to get an immediate response, as near as I can see it, from the Germans and the Japanese But should we properly sit here and say "Well, if you are not going to move--and at least as aggressively or more aggressively than we move--we are not going to do anything"? Where are our responsibilities? [Rather than] sit here saying that, we can take a chance that we can push them a little, given the risks that you eloquently described, which I think are there It's a question of where the risks lie I don't think the change--unless it's a much bigger one--is going to have any very significant effect on our short- run or intermediate-term business outlook Does it have an effect on theirs? It goes in that direction Maybe it's not very powerful; it's a pretty weak reed, but it's the only reed we have It's the only argument we can make  Well, I have a practical question I don't know how we can resolve it here If the discount rate does go down and the constellation of psychology is such that the dollar gets in a lot of trouble and the others don't move, there's a question of whether the assumption we make here should be changed in the market  The danger in the whole situation--and I don't know how to avoid it--is that if we do have a real decline in the dollar and they are not very eager to act, their business outlook may deteriorate from what it is now  If they don't act, then we are worse off But I think that's not demonstrable until it happens  Well, I think what we are saying is that all of this isn't very predictable  I don't know what alternative A really means I guess I don't have much faith in projecting these numbers to the last percent I take it that it ought to mean $300 million to--  Mr Forrestal  Mrs Horn  Mrs Seger  Mr Parry  Mr Guffey  Anybody else have anything to say?  Anybody else want to say anything? We have some other issues One is how to express all this I think we are interpreting alternative A very loosely at this point, until I get instructed [by you] otherwise Why don't we look at the directive? I don't know how to interpret the sentiment [on borrowing] if the discount rate were not reduced Those people who have said a $300 million borrowing level, would they be inclined to say less than a  -63-    7/8-9/86  $300 million borrowing level? I am not sure that's the preferable course; I am not suggesting that I just want to get theoretically--  I just want to make sure that I'm not imposing something on you People are saying--if they think we ought to be making some move in the easing direction--that it should come preferably through the discount rate rather than a lowering of the borrowing  I suppose the question that arises right in the first sentence--there is an awful lot of crossing out [in the draft and] it is a little hard to read There may be some ambiguity, however much we explain it [We can] explain it in the overall record but there is still some question, technically If we say unchanged borrowings, is that the same as saying unchanged degree of pressure on reserve positions? If not, I don't know how to reword this without saying the discount rate is--  We can say that in the overall record  How can we say [the Committee] decreased reserve pressures? Maybe the Federal Reserve System did, but the Committee did not  Suppose we took the opposite course "In the implementation of open market operations for the immediate future"--  We have been trying to avoid being specific about a borrowing target and being specific about interest rates  Well, presumably we would say if [unintelligible] exactly the same borrowings It is going to be confusing as the devil to people  Suppose we just added on here "In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to decrease somewhat the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions, taking account of the possibility of a decline in the discount rate"  To just say "decrease the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions taking account of the possibility of a change in the discount rate"  I think it can be explained in the policy record "For growth in M2 and M3 over the period as a whole--" I would resist going from [the existing language of] annual rates of about 8 to 10 percent, which are nice [round] numbers, to whatever we have [in the Bluebook]--8-3/4 percent and 7-3/4 percent  7 to 9 percent  If you want to dissent, dissent now Well, let me try something on the Ml, since I think it is consistent with what we just said Instead of putting in a number for Ml, what if we say "Growth in M1 will be judged in part in light of changes in M2 and M3," or something like that? I suppose there is some chance that if we put in this high number for Ml, we'll come in below it We are starting July pretty low; on the other hand, if we come in way above--  I will accept that There is a good chance that it will come in way below or way above  What was it in the second quarter?  "While growth in M1 is expected to moderate somewhat"--  --"it will continue to be judged in the light of the behavior of M2 and M3 and other factors" All right I don't see anything the matter in general with the proposal that Mr Kohn or somebody made here in capital letters "Somewhat greater reserve restraint" etc That about covers it It doesn't say what to do if we get strength in the business expansion and powerful developments in the exchange markets  It is covered by inference We're not going to pay much attention to Ml, if it is not confirmed by M2 and M3  We still have the question of "woulds" or "mights" I would make it the same for both Any preference between "would" and "might"?  A final issue is the federal funds rate range, which we changed to 5 to 9 percent last time The midpoint of 5 to 9 percent is 7 percent  Obviously, we are going to be well within this range, but I don't know where  4 to 8 percent or 5 to 9 percent  How about 5 to 8 percent?  We could make that big policy change of narrowing the range all the way to 3 percentage points!  It goes half way to 4 to 8 percent and it does center the range sort of where we expect the rate to be It is closer to the center of what we want  Leave it the same?  We already did that  We have already said that we are anticipating a decrease by the words "taking account of a discount rate change" And we are saying if the discount rate doesn't change, we want an easing of pressures In no--  I don't think it could be interpreted as much--  Who prefers 4 to 8 percent? It's going to be more than one-third  Who prefers 5 to 9 percent? Who prefers 5 to 8 percent? You really want 4 to 8 percent? Okay, put in 4 to 8 percent Should I read all this over again? "In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to decrease the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions, taking account of the possibility of a change in the discount rate Growth in M2 and M3 over the period from June to September is expected to be at annual rates of 7 to 9 percent While growth in M1 is expected to moderate somewhat from the exceptionally large increase during the second quarter, that growth will continue to be judged in the light of the behavior of M2 and M3 Somewhat greater or lesser reserve restraint  69-    7/8-9/86  might be acceptable depending upon the behavior of the aggregatesetc" And we have 4 to 8 percent [for the funds rate range] If there are no other comments, we will vote  I guess we are finished  END OF MEETING  -70-       Are there any questions or comments?  No other observations? We haven't got any transactions to ratify do we?  I might take up at this point the Mexican situation We have [distributed to the Committee] a memorandum in which you'll see a proposal described as bridge financing The Mexicans don't like to call it a bridge but a contingency support [facility] It was agreed to in principle some time ago and was pretty much put together after a lot of discussion last week We had some difficulty putting it together We are sort of in the middle, satisfying the BIS people on the one side and the Mexicans on the other side I'm just glancing through this memorandum to see what it says and what it doesn't say--it does say $11 billion We were thinking of $1 billion, but we added the kind of voluntary contributions of the Europeans and the Latin Americans We came up with the idea that the United States would be 50/50 with the others and they came up with a little more than $500 million to make it $11 billion [in total] The US participation will be some combination of Federal Reserve and Treasury participation, which hasn't been finally resolved yet; I think it will be resolved today  The banks were not very eager about this initially but agreed to go ahead on the basic conditions that were described in this memorandum They would go ahead with their bridge [financing] after they reach an agreement in principle on the basic bank loan--not only an agreement in principle on the terms of that loan but agreement on participation of the so-called critical mass, which is in the neighborhood of 90 percent participation That is going to take, at the very least, some weeks to achieve There was an original target set for the first week in September, but enough time has passed already that I would be extremely surprised if it is reached in the first week in September That negotiation on the basic bank loan is really only going to begin tomorrow and if we get it done before the IMF meeting, I think we will be fortunate One of the terms of the banks' participation is that the officials come in first and go out last in terms of the initiation [of the loan] and the conclusion That doesn't mean that the amount of the official facility has to be as large as theirs for the whole time that it is outstanding The banks originally wanted to come in on the same terms and conditions    8/19/86  that the officials did, but that violated another principle that we follow that the official bridge be paid off by official money--IMF payments and World Bank payments to the Mexicans There isn't going to be enough of that money to also pay off the commercial banks The logic is that the bridge part of the commercial bank participation gets paid off by the basic loan that the commercial banks presumably will make And that is why they have tied it down by saying they are not going to participate in the bridge until they have agreement in principle on the basic loan That makes the participants in the bridge pretty safe Sometimes these things have been done just by the advisory committee, which is about 13 banks, but this time they hope to involve 40 to 50 banks They will get all the major banks involved in the Mexican credit to participate There was quite a lot of difficulty getting full participation, even in the advisory committee, on the agreement in principle The have been very reluctant about this whole operation The were reluctant at one point The were bargaining with their own government about some other supervisory matters That has all been cleared up, in principle Then we ran into delays on the official bridge  The most important substantive question that arose from the Mexicans is this Mr Mancera, the Governor of the Bank of Mexico, told me that if the bridge is going to be repaid out of IMF and World Bank money on the time schedule anticipated for that money--and the bridge is going to be repaid pretty much by November and December-- that's just when Mexico is going to need the money the most if the bank loan is not concluded by December We have been assuming that the target date for the bank loan--the target date in the sense of actual disbursement of the first tranche of the bank loan--is December He is, with some justice, very suspicious of whether that date can be met And he says If that date cannot be met, what do I do? By December or January the official part, at least, will be pretty much repaid I am going to be losing money all during this period from a balance of payments deficit It doesn't look like [the plan] is adequately designed to meet my needs He had some other complaints too, including the cost, but we got those resolved last week We got them resolved with my intervention, frankly, which raises a matter I directed just to the Committee I think he has a point, if the bank loan is delayed--which is not what we plan, but I think one has to assume that it might not come through in December and might be delayed until January or even possibly early February If it's delayed longer than that, I think we have a big failure on our hands I have a piece of paper, which you might want to glance at, that shows precisely what I told him because he wanted it in writing [Turning to staff] Why don't you give the members of the Committee my paper? But I would like to have it back You have it? Well, I would like to have this back when you have read it because I don't think this is something we want in the public domain at this point You can just take a minute to read it I wanted to meet what seemed to me his legitimate concerns about what happens if the bank loan doesn't come through by December So I told him that I personally would be willing to recommend to the Open Market Committee--as you will see this is hedged--that if their program is on track and if the bank loan is in fact negotiated and the only real problem is that the bank loan is going to be dispersed in January, let's say, instead of in December, that we would provide, on our own, permission for a drawing upon the existing swap facility with the Bank of Mexico That would presumably    8/19/86  be toward December or January, until the bank loan is paid out in the amount I discussed--let's say $250 to $300 million Obviously that could be changed, but I discussed that order of magnitude and that provided him with enough reassurance so that he agreed with the whole thing  I told him I would report this to you I don't expect any action; it would be inappropriate to take any action at this point In fact, I don't think we can take action because it's all a contingency plan But if you have some fundamental concern about this we ought to know about it because it removes the point that reassured him to go on with the whole bridge We also made some other adjustments to help satisfy some of his concerns The BIS wants to charge him which is standard BIS practice That is not unexpected; that has been their standard practice But then they wanted to charge a  I also told him that as far as we were concerned, he could have drawings on our swap facility at the Treasury bill rate, which is our standard practice There is nothing unusual about that, except that I think once or maybe twice--just once?--when we participated in a bridge of this sort we charged  just to conform because everybody else was charging We were tentatively thinking of doing that this time, but we  went back to our usual practice of not charging any spread So he would get our portion [at the bill rate]; I don't know what the Treasury is going to do at this point That will force the Treasury, I guess, to do the same, so on our half of the official bridge or one third of the total he will pay no spread That calmed him down about the fact that this whole thing was costing the Mexicans money There is a back-up facility for the official bridge If everything fell apart--if, as would be the normal expectation, they haven't paid through IMF drawings and the money they get from the World Bank--an arrangement has been made, similar to an arrangement that was made with Mexico in 1982 when a bridge was provided,    8/19/86  The whole agreement hasn't been signed yet, but I don't think there are any open issues anymore Are there, Mr Bradfield?  We will get the actual details of the agreement written out I think it is in place, basically Exactly when they will draw upon it is not clear to me Mr Mancera wasn't too eager to draw on it before he had to because it costs him money On the other hand, they want to show adequate reserves at the end of August because that's one of the few dates during the year when they publish their reserves They will "publish" in this case by a speech by the President of Mexico, I understand, on September 1 They actually publish it the very next day on this one occasion during the year and they want to show adequate reserves as of August 31 That raises a different question, which I will return to in a moment As I say, this is all set--provided this Committee doesn't forcibly object to looking sympathetically at a request for a drawing in, let's say, the latter part of November or December if the bank loan doesn't go through [by then] That would basically be a two- or three-month drawing I have told him that I am prepared to recommend such a drawing to you at that time if such a situation should develop--that is, if the bank loan isn't dispersed As noted in my memorandum In the context of progress being made in carrying out the Mexican economic program and in light of the agreement by the bank advisory committee on a commercial bank new money facility and progress toward concluding that agreement at an early date--under those particular conditions--I would recommend that we extend to them, all on our own, a short-term swap for two or three months until it can be repaid The payout would be from official money but, in fact, the payout would be from the bank loan if it came through, let's say January 15 or so; if that's the first time they had the money, they would pay it out of that At that point they would have adequate money  So, the first question I will raise with you is whether you are prepared to receive that recommendation in a friendly spirit should the conditions arise in November or December As I said, I don't want any official action but I thought I should know if you were in basically an unsympathetic mood and I think you should know about this in all fairness I will interpret silence as basically a sympathetic mood, I warn you If that is wrong, please enlighten me  Oh, I am sure that some of the banks will raise the question The part of the tax reform package that directly affects this is the treatment of foreign tax credits and I am not    8/19/86  exactly sure how they finally resolved that The Senate bill, I think, had a reasonably satisfactory division I think that was cut back but I don't think it was cut back far enough to--  But they will argue that it's a problem because, whatever this will be, it will be a 10-year loan or a 12-year loan and this favorable treatment will only be for 5 years  It won't help, but I don't think it will make it impossible The theory of the phase out is, in part, that that gives the foreign countries time to adjust their own laws so that they don't have the withholding tax in the first place--or such a punitive withholding tax anyway It costs them revenue so it is an additional problem, but we hope not an insurmountable one  Well, there might be, so I want to return to that It's really different from this question, but it also might involve a drawing on the swap I take it that this doesn't seem unreasonable I don't know exactly what their reserves are now, but the indications are that on August 31st they would like to show around  It's not in their interest to show too many reserves because that would cool off the banks That's one point of view On the other hand, they are afraid that showing too small an amount of reserves will frighten people in Mexico and raise concerns on that side So, it's kind of a balancing act  In 1982 we did something when the particular conditions that existed in the waning months before the election in 1982 were that they were running out of reserves but felt unable to take any action because of the pending election in August Even if they do the planned disbursement of the official bridge, that would be $850 million in the first tranche This could be changed; it isn't crucial But what we were thinking about, notionally anyway, is drawing $850 million of the $11 billion fairly promptly and drawing the last $250 million probably simultaneously with the bank bridge, which would likely be in the latter part of September as things look now When I look at this it would not hurt my conscience too much if we provided something, if they really needed it, in terms of our swap    8/19/86  over the end of August in anticipation of drawing upon this bridge It's a little less window dressing under those circumstances because it's not that we're putting the money in and taking it out right away; we're just speeding up the disbursement that would take place under this official bridge anyway Now, whether that will be necessary or desirable simply has to wait for more conversations with them But I guess we can decide this We have a Foreign Currency Subcommittee that would ordinarily do these things or I do them myself in the absence of the Foreign Currency Subcommittee so long as it's in line with the Committee's guidelines But I just wanted to raise this issue with you and see whether there would be any overwhelming objections to doing that if it seemed desirable in the light of their particular needs and the anticipated drawings on the bridge a few weeks later  From their viewpoint, they are concerned about impressing the Mexican public What they are specifically afraid of is that if they show too low a reserve figure on August 31 that will contribute to capital flight There would be concern that they really don't have enough money to get through this period and it would undermine confidence within Mexico and make their problem more complicated by fomenting capital flight That's the way they look at it But I do think there is this other concern that an unduly large reserve position in the eyes of the banks will only encourage the banks to say There's no great urgency about our reaching an agreement and maybe they don't need so much money after all Those are the two things that have to be balanced I'm not certain of this, but I don't see why there would be any announcement of when the drawing takes place on this regular facility So I assume that people will interpret the reserve figure at the end of August, if it looks as large as as already including a drawing on the bridge So I don't know that it means all that much one way or the other  Well, their reserves at the end of July were what?  And I would guess, although I just don't know, that they would probably lose at least in a month-- that would be a fair guess--which would take them down to leaving them if that's what they want But that's just a guess And that includes some nonusable reserves Their usable reserves are under  Well, we don't know precisely  You put the family tableware in the public [unintelligible], I guess If the drawing is big enough it does, under our normal rules, require an official Committee clearance, which I don't think we should consider now anyway We might have to do it by telegram, but--  This would not be; I don't see any point Theoretically it could be, but I don't see any point dragging them into it; I'd do it myself And similarly, this drawing in November- December doesn't rest upon any Treasury participation, although it may be that they'd want to participate Not hearing any objections expressed, we will use our judgment If it gets above some nominal amount we would have to have an official Committee clearance anyway But if it gets that far--not that we didn't want to see it [unintelligible]--we would send out telegrams  SPEAKER(?) Aren't you going to get the approval?  Yes, I think the one thing we do want to take official action on is just approving the basic bridge I suppose we can approve it with an open-ended amount because it will be roughly 50-50, I think, with the Treasury I just haven't worked that out with them precisely It's not critical, but with that reservation as to precisely what the amount is, I suppose what we want to approve is suitable participation in an American bridge of $545 million under the terms and conditions that have been described That I think we can take a vote on  Is there any objection? If not, that official bridge is approved I assume a sympathetic view toward the November matter--should it be recommended to you under the conditions that are described in this memorandum--and a certain degree of flexibility if it appears desirable to do a very short-term drawing at the end of August  Yes There are several problems on that, starting with the fact that the estimates that were made on the size of the needed commercial bank financing were based upon assumptions of a $10-1/2 Mexican oil price this year and $11 next year I emphasize Mexican oil price because about half of their exports are heavy crude for which the price is quite a lot lower than the prices that you see quoted Their blended price rounds up to $3 less than, say, the west Texas [intermediate] price you see quoted in the papers because so much of it is heavy crude and there's a little transportation discount, too Before this OPEC decision, when the oil price was at its low, the blended price of the oil they were selling was less than $9 Obviously, it has been substantially higher than that in the last couple of weeks But on that assumption of $10-1/2 this year and $11    8/19/86  next year their gross reserves would rise by about or in that neighborhood, over this period In fact, they would rise from the end of 1985 to the end of 1987 by about that would take them back roughly in the range, which is something the IMF insists upon They always insist upon getting reserves back to some half-way adequate level The bank financing need, given all the other assumptions about financing, comes out to about $6 billion net to the public sector Now, that's a little misleading but that's a figure that gets quoted Those figures assume repayment, net, of about [$1] billion by the private sector to the banks So, if you look at total commercial bank exposure to Mexico, the assumption is that it will go up by about $5 billion; the $6 billion figure that gets talked about is the net exposure to the public sector But in Baker-initiative terms that are talked about the total exposure to the country is $5 billion Their total exposure now is $65 billion or something like that?  $75 billion? So if you think of it as a 2-year program for 1986-1987, which in some sense it is because the banks haven't been lending anything this year--they didn't lend anything last year, but forget about last year--that $5 billion increase in exposure is less than 3 percent a year That is on the high side but within the parameters that were talked about in the Baker plan all along If you look at the period as 15 months it comes out to a higher percentage, but I don't think that's quite fair because they haven't been lending anything so far this year So it's broadly within the parameters of the Baker plan but it's also larger than we or the banks anticipated some months ago before the oil price took its last decline And I'm sure the banks will argue that since the oil price is up again they will make a more optimistic estimate on the oil price and cut down the amount So, that's issue number one the amount  Issue number two is the concept stated explicitly in the program with the IMF that if the oil price declines below the $9 Mexican price there would be additional financing from the IMF and, by implication, from the commercial banks too That is symmetrical If the price went up above $14--I think that was the number they had in there--there would be less financing Actually, it's closer to the $14 level than to the $9 level if you took today's figure But there was this contingency arrangement which some banks liked and other banks seemed to dislike intensely Similarly, the Mexicans will certainly ask for a reduction or elimination of the spreads on the outstanding notes as a straight concession from the banks, maybe related to the oil price That is, if the oil price is below a certain level reduce the spread; if it's above a certain level they repay it They also want for presentational reasons--they think it's very important politically--to get an extra big concession on some portion of the new money which again, in their eyes, would be related to the oil price That would be a big concession--    8/19/86  They haven't put these cards on the table yet, but in concept it would be something on the order of  I'm just picking numbers out of the air, but that is the concept In fact, there was a bond issue sold in the market a few weeks ago by Standard Oil of Ohio, or whatever its name is now Is it still Standard Oil of Ohio? It was precisely on that basis that it was sold in the public market It had a rate of interest related to the oil price a low rate of interest when the oil price was low and a high rate of interest when the oil price was high And it was salable in the market A lot of banks have said they object intensely to that as a matter of principle--that they are not in the business of making loans whose interest rates vary in accordance with some external indicator They're in the business of making bank loans for other reasons There will be a big conceptual fight about that So, yes, it's going to be difficult That is why I think Mr Mancera probably has some skepticism about how quickly this could all be put together In fact, I think it's not going to be fatal if the amount of the loan is cut back a bit But it can't be cut back to $4 billion; that is out of the question; $5 billion with some contingency clauses, maybe I don't want to give away the Mexican's negotiating position but I think something can be worked out on an amount that looks reasonable But these terms on interest rates are going to involve very difficult negotiations; there's no doubt about it  I think those are the principal issues, but I'm sure other issues will arise What is unusual about this, in terms of past patterns, is the amount of official financing that's involved Even with the commercial banks at $6 billion to the public sector or $5 billion overall, there will be somewhat more official financing than there will be commercial bank financing, which is unusual This is a bridge, of course But if you count the official financing calculated over the full time period of the program there's a lot of World Bank money and of course the IMF money and there is an intention of there being a Paris club which provides quite a lot of money The Japanese have semi-promised some special project financing which could run as much as if you believe it I don't think it'll be that big but it could be up to that In terms of special bilateral financing to Mexico, there is CCC financing I don't remember exactly what it all adds up to, net, but it's a little more than the private financings Fortunately, the amount of World Bank money in any bilateral deal they do with Mexico is new  I haven't looked at that for some time I don't know if that's ever been officially adopted When the banks get a little further on in this negotiation they may well press us for a written statement and I'm sure it will look something like this But at this stage I don't think it should be given to them  It could well be that in two or three weeks we could have a joint statement by the regulators, which probably will incorporate this language, that could be published or sent to them  We made a statement along these lines on one or two of these previous occasions, but it arises every time and the statement gets slightly edited every time It's not entirely new, and it's not entirely a departure  Perhaps we can return to this subject later after the meeting, if you want The usual complaints go to the Comptroller's Office It follows a long technical procedure sometimes, but we are not exempt from such complaints Somebody told me the other day that there was an actual letter of agreement with some bank in which part of the agreement was that the bank would under no conditions increase its exposure to less-developed countries That letter was being used to say How can we participate when we had such an agreement? I don't think the agreement was with our cease-and- desist people; I think it was with the Comptroller I'm not sure  You have to be a little suspicious of these things I can imagine that that bank invited the Comptroller to put that provision in the agreement  All right Well, you have to be a little careful because banks will be very eager to apply--  Well, if you want to discuss this further I'd be happy to but I'm just worried about having the time in this meeting We're going to have that problem again Some of the major European banks, may insist in the end on doing this in the form of an interest-capitalization deal, and maybe if a very small margin of banks do it that way this all will come out But that bridge has not begun to be crossed yet and I wouldn't breathe a word of that at this stage It may be that something innovative will have to be done to pull in that last 10 or 15 percent, as you say We can return to the supervisory aspects of this later so long as the Open Market Committee aspects are clear Are there any other questions on that? If not, we'll turn to Mr Sternlight  Any questions or comments?  The issue is what?  I think we'll get to that question a little later--the tendency of business and the tendency of open market operations So maybe we can defer that question  Are there any other comments or questions? We do have to ratify transactions here, as always  [Approved] without objection The question has been asked from time-to-time--I confess mainly by me, and I don't want to take undue time on this question because it's not a matter of enormous urgency--as to why we purchase long-term securities occasionally I wonder about it every time the issue arises So I had some discussion about it with Mr Sternlight and he prepared this little memorandum for you on the pros and cons of occasionally    8/19/86  participating in the bond market, which in recent years we have done about twice a year As I say, it's at rather odd times in a kind of arbitrary guise, and every time I wonder Why now? What are we attempting to achieve or prove by buying some long-term bonds?  Let me just make one other comment first I have nothing philosophically against buying long-term bonds or coupon issues if they serve some purpose I'm not arguing a "bills- only" doctrine at all If we have some purpose we want to achieve by buying bonds, fine The purpose is rather elusive in what we do now  Sure  It has a slight effect on the rate, depending on how much we do and how much we turn over to the Treasury Of course, the counter argument to that is If the Treasury doesn't like the cost of the long-term bonds why issue so many?  The other consideration, just to throw it in here, is simply emphasized in this memorandum I'll point it out These days it may seem a little wild to you but I do worry a bit about the liquidity of our portfolio, given the possible contingencies in the banking world If we have to lend a lot of money--in tens of billions of dollars--suddenly to the commercial banking system we presumably would want to liquidate our portfolio to make up for that Under most conditions it's extremely difficult to liquidate coupon issues anyway And certainly, in those kinds of conditions it would be even more difficult I would never want to be in the position where I felt that we had any degree of inhibition from liquidating securities because of the composition of our holdings Now, it is also true that there is a constraint--what we have to have there in covering the note issues We could get into a bind regardless of the liquidity of our portfolio by not having the types of assets which the law says we have to hold against our note issues Certain types of discounted paper can be used but not the type that we ordinarily make these days And maybe some day we ought to think about changing that law or changing our procedures or something, but that is an additional constraint apart from the liquidity of our portfolio I have had these reservations from time-to-time and I thought it would be useful to have a discussion Mr Sternlight could you shed some light on the matter?  Well, the times are arbitrary only in the sense that there's no particular reason at those times to do coupon issues as opposed to something else But it is clearly consistent with the reserve needs at the time You don't do it right in the face of obvious reserve [reducing] indications  Yes  We're talking about the [unintelligible]  Planning the rollovers relative to what the Treasury has been offering, which is more long-term securities  When is the last time we sold a coupon issue or bond?  Basically when you buy a coupon issue you don't sell it  That's it The liquidity issue [unintelligible]  We do so [unintelligible] because of the [unintelligible], which I think is correct This probably goes back decades and decades If the Federal Reserve were to walk into the market and sell bonds it would have a big impact on the market, particularly since we never do it  I can, too, theoretically I would observe, or bet you, that in 40 years you can't find an occasion when we found a suitable time  In retrospect, but--  Well, Peter, I find it difficult to see the circumstances Theoretically, I can see circumstances in which we would sell For instance, that October I at least sat here with some hopes that we would have such a dramatic effect on the market that in a few weeks long-term rates might decline That shows you how naive I was at that time The last thing I would have wanted to do was to sell long-term bonds  Drive up the yield curve and oppose that hope--false hope as it turned out Sure, theoretically, you might want to sell them at some times I also would agree--I just want to make very clear--that I can see times much more practically when you might want to buy coupons If we have a specific reason, I have nothing against it whatsoever I would not want to give up that tool of being able to buy them The question is whether we should routinely buy them  You're right That's why we haven't sold any  I would be--  And what's the point of being so active in the market?  With maturing coupon issues, the pressure is always to roll those over so the Treasury isn't pressed with the bigger job of placing them in the public market I don't know Have we even let a coupon [run off]?  You can provide that, obviously, but the weighted average is not what you're selling You sell the very short stuff that you have; whether you have a 10-year bond or a 30-year bond doesn't make much difference You're not going to sell either one That is the argument that's made I don't understand it, frankly, because I don't see what purpose is served by it  That is the issue, I guess I don't understand it, but that seems to be the issue  I have no difficulty in conjuring up a policy where you want to buy; I have no problem--  My difficulty then is you get a policy reason for what--to buy bonds [if] you want to make a splash?  So far the liquidity argument is one [against] the central bank holding any long-term securities But on the liquidity issue, obviously, we've been buying so much in the past year that Treasury bill holdings look more adequate now than they did two or three years ago All you have to do is [consider] two or three years ago putting Continental together with--all apologies to the present company-- and a few Texas banks and you've got a big liquidity need rather suddenly  All these sins we've made in the past-- eliminating all these safeguards that were in the law--we can now make another one  This is not a big issue; it comes up from time to time But if we continue buying I would [unintelligible] and do rollovers into much shorter issues That's the alternative There's some value in buying [but] we pick up liquidity by doing rollovers into much shorter issues I don't see the value in buying  I am not for "bills only"; I'm perfectly ready to buy long-term bonds if there's a purpose in buying long-term bonds But I have a little difficulty being willing to buy them when there is no purpose in buying them  Well, we haven't done any for the last three months when we ordinarily might have Presumably, if there is an ample supply of bills we just wouldn't do the coupons at all  The reason was that we had scheduled this discussion and decided this was the first meeting in which the agenda wasn't cluttered with other things  It hasn't been that rigid, anyway We've only done this twice a year Well, I don't think it's worth a lot more discussion right now We can continue what we're doing and let it just fade for a month and reach a concrete decision next month or reach a decision now Do you want to let this matter gestate a month or do you want to reach a decision?  -19-    8/19/86  Well, why don't we come back and make a firm decision on this less-than-overwhelming matter next month?  Comments or questions?  Let me ask a question which often arises anyway and I think it was what Governor Wallich had in mind In assessing the overall tenor of this forecast, are the forces in the direction of sustained expansion or hesitancy?  Where do the risks lie?  The forecast, as you have mentioned several times, is heavily dependent upon a rather strong improvement in the foreign trade balance in real terms, not necessarily in    8/19/86  monetary terms It may be worth having Mr Truman justify the forecast  Maybe it would be worthwhile getting any comments Committee members may have at this particular point on the external prospects  This gets confusing Now, what--  You get a big difference between the real figures and the nominal figures, which gets very confusing But a real increase in exports is still there in the forecast unless, assuming the question--  A lot of what activity?  Mr Forrestal  Mr Morris  Governor Angell  Governor Johnson  It's not clear if some manufacturers export the cars up to Canada and import them back down or--  Governor Seger  Let me defend the weighted-average calculation, for what it's worth The theory about these countries is that sure, the Korean currency, say, may not change but their balance of payments won't change either And they now have an enormous incentive to divert some exports to Europe and Japan instead of to the United States and to buy more in the United States relative to what they buy in Japan and Europe Now, it may [not] work out so neatly, but that's the theory  Mr Stern  Mr Parry  Are you pessimistic, Mr Corrigan?  [Unintelligible]  It means they won't build anything  Well, I think we probably are getting off just this external side Let's wind this up with any comments anybody has about the business outlook generally Mr Wallace, do you have something?  Mr Parry  Mr Stern  Anybody else have any general comments?  Mr Black  -31-    8/19/86  Anybody else have any general comments? Governor Wallich  Anybody else? If not why don't you give us a little run-down, Mr Kohn, and we'll go and eat a doughnut  Reverting to Mexico for just a minute Mr Truman pointed out to me that the IMF has more than you want to know about the Mexican program in an IMF document, which he will be glad to make available to you It is only 53 pages, single-spaced  Sixty-eight, single-spaced or-double spaced I have reached the advanced age where I can't read IMF documents I haven't found that a great loss Returning to our present problems and dilemmas, I think we are in a situation where there aren't any good choices Let me just make a couple of points    8/19/86  A number of the Reserve Banks have proposed a reduction in the discount rate I think that is obviously on the table as a policy variable in the period immediately ahead [We'll be] judging more after the conversation than before in terms of how desirable that is  I have a few comments on the international setting which, of course, we can't expect miracles from, given all the lags But it is rather [unintelligible] in the short run in terms of exchange rate movements and somewhat [unintelligible] I hesitate to say in the longer run, but not immediately in terms of prospects for growth abroad I think the situation in Germany, which is of course typical in Europe, is dominated by what appears to be a rather satisfactory-- and they would almost say better than satisfactory--economic outlook, as they read it They did not do well for a couple of quarters or more; but apparently the gross national product will have a very large rebound in the second quarter The decline in the first quarter was probably partly statistical and the increase will be partly statistical, they think, however you look at it I don't know whether it will be as strong as they think, but they are expecting the data to show a very strong second quarter And they are anticipating a continued pretty good rate of growth, in the area of an annual rate of 6 percent or more, through the rest of this year anyway It remains to be seen whether that materializes; they need that kind of growth to come up to 3 percent year-to-year increases, which is what they were talking about earlier At some point we were talking 3-1/2 or even 4 percent; we're clearly not going to make that Still, in their view, they think they'll make the 3 percent, which requires rather strong growth from now on  German monetary growth is significantly in excess of their target--not significant in our terms, significant in their terms They usually meet their targets and that doesn't give them any eagerness to move If you just look at Germany, I think that is all understandable, if you have any confidence in their outlook The German failure to move on the discount rate not only gives us problems in terms of the immediate exchange rate repercussions of what we do but I think it also, rightly or wrongly, blocks action elsewhere in Europe where the economic outlook is not so ebullient The French and the British have been very reluctant to move because of their concern about their own exchange rates vis-a-vis the mark if the Germans don't move They would be delighted to see the Germans move Whether the Germans move or not, I think there is virtually no chance of their moving on their own initiative Whether they would move under some pressure within Europe instead of pressure from the United States-- That may be counterproductive because they have made it an issue of national honor not to respond to external pressure But I think there is a reasonable chance that they would move if other people move first and the exchange rate, in fact, reacted Then they could just throw up their hands and say We don't think it is a good idea but external developments give us no choice That is not certain, but I think it is a reasonably good prospect In fact, I think that  As for Japan, I don't feel I know much about the outlook there I don't see any reason for thinking it is as strong as the Germans think their outlook is It looks like a very sluggish picture being affected by the external squeeze, if that is the right word    8/19/86  It's hard to call it a squeeze when they have a surplus of $70 billion or so The external surplus is no longer rising except as a result of the oil price decline, and I guess there are some real declines in their exports that feed back into their domestic growth They do talk about putting together some kind of a fiscal package, but I think that really has a long fuse on it in terms of affecting the economy That doesn't do us much good in the immediate exchange market situation Again if they move at all, [it might] be merely a reaction to being forced into it I haven't had any real contact with them recently but it doesn't sound all that encouraging  The other point is that certainly the Germans, and I am sure the Japanese, would be much happier if we would intervene, along with them, at some rate not very far from today's rate We might in some sense be close to a point of "buying" a discount rate decline in exchange for a promise to intervene visibly, if not aggressively, to support the dollar I am not sure that wouldn't be a reasonable bargain for us to make, but the bargain has not been struck anyway They would like us to intervene without them doing anything, which just isn't a negotiating posture; I don't think the United States will find that acceptable Conceivably, if everybody moved that might be a way to encourage some action I think the upshot of it is--I am sure in the case of the Germans, I can't be absolutely sure in the case of the French and the English or the Japanese [unintelligible]--that if we move in the immediate future, within the next week, I don't think they will do anything; but they might do something in reaction to what happened  Well, I think they would probably intervene too, but what they'd like us to do is intervene They kind of say Well, you go ahead and reduce your rate and then we will all intervene to support the dollar The Germans would say that too You go ahead and reduce yours if you think it is necessary and then why don't we all conduct joint [intervention]  No, I'm saying I think it might be a reasonable view that they also would reduce their rates  Now, I am not sure that the Treasury would think it is a reasonable deal I am saying that from my point of view it seems a reasonable deal  I tell you there were very clear expectations; they had told me they would What changed their minds was that during that week both the franc and sterling weakened, in  -34-    8/19/86  their terms, significantly That probably [now] appears as a very small blip on the charts But they were both very sensitive to that fact We probably discussed that as late as a Tuesday, at an Open Market Committee meeting, and they had told me the previous weekend that they would move But on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, or at least on Thursday and Friday, their exchange rates weakened--the British pound because it kind of got caught up in this oil situation and the French franc for other reasons, I think They just felt uneasy about moving when their exchange rate was weakening And that is the same hang-up they have now since the franc has weakened further against the mark What is sterling doing?  I think both the British and the French are probably in an untenable position They would both like to ease but neither wants to pay any price in terms of their exchange rate  Well, I think the answer to that question is no Whether I would exclude it entirely, I don't know I am afraid neither of them will move without the other moving and I just [unintelligible] I can find that out, but my suspicion is they won't I can't entirely exclude a move, but the straight answer to your question is I wouldn't count on it purely because of [concern about] exchange rate movements There is no doubt that they would like to move If the Germans moved, [the British and French] would move in a second But one thing I am sure of is that the Germans aren't going to move in a second  I wouldn't characterize it as a timing issue From their basic standpoint, they don't want to move Just look at their internal situation They might move in response to external developments and a very strong mark That would make the move come later in time, but it is not that they think it will be great to move in September as opposed to now If nothing changed and they weren't under any pressure to move externally by September, they wouldn't move in September either They basically don't want to move And that is easy to understand, if you just look at their domestic picture and you give credence to their confidence about their own outlook It may not be as ebullient as they say, but that is what the argument is; it does look strong if you just look at Germany by itself They have had a big increase in real income because of the exchange rate and oil They have had a pretty big wage increase and no price increase is another way of looking at it They have a very strong consumption picture at the moment; I don't know whether to call it a boom because it hasn't been going on that long But they had strong consumption in the first quarter when GNP went down They were estimating--not in our terms, but the way they look at it--an increase in real consumption at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, I forget the exact figure, of 12 to 13 percent in the second quarter Now, those  -35-    8/19/86  are partly phony statistically because they don't make working day adjustments I don't understand it they seasonally adjust the figure but they don't adjust it for working days I guess it is a straight seasonal adjustment procedure and it doesn't take account of different numbers of working days They have a sharp alteration of working days between the first and second quarters, so the first quarter wasn't as bad as it looked and the second quarter won't be as strong as it looks statistically But nonetheless, it will look strong--they think very strong  Well, it is anybody's guess, I suppose You would think that the dollar might [weaken], given not very strong confidence in the market Anyway, it would depress the dollar but that is the chance you take How much, how far? I don't know whether Mr Cross has any inside story  Well, peculiarly, it went up for a couple of days [unintelligible] then came down  The Japanese--  I agree with that; people can make that argument I wouldn't put much weight on this What if we ease? Let's say we reduce the discount rate and that would make people feel so good about the economic outlook that the psychology of the economic outlook would outweigh the change in interest rates I think that is a theoretical possibility In the practical sense, [the probability] that a half percent reduction in the discount rate is suddenly going to make people feel ebullient about the business outlook is close to nil If it did, I think you would forget that psychology I just think the chances of that happening are extremely minor Now, if it was followed not just by strong consumption figures but by accident you got stronger investment figures and you had good employment figures for August then, yes, the dollar could strengthen regardless of what we did on the discount rate I don't think it will be because we reduce the discount rate  If you put a lot of weight on our staff forecast, that's right  Analytically you are correct, if your starting assumption is correct One of the real dangers we have here --it may be more apparent in the case of Japan now than in Germany--is that that same dollar decline would further depress business activity and expectations in Japan It works against you You may gain on the price side and lose on the income side  In nominal numbers you stretch out the J- curve  When we talk about intervening, I am not talking about a life or death struggle to protect any particular level of the dollar My own feeling is that if we are not competitive, particularly against the yen, at these levels heaven help us I don't know how we will get out of this problem But that may only be evident in a much more fully employed economy abroad where there are    8/19/86  some pressures on capacity and all the rest And we are some years away from that That is not going to develop this year and it isn't going to develop next year; it may develop in 1988, but you've got to wait until 1988  If you look at Japan as the big surplus country in the world, which it is, and say that is where the adjustment has to fall, the adjustment is not necessarily in trade with the United States but in trade with Third World Countries When you look at how [un]willing they are at any exchange rate to welcome more textiles from Korea, or more cars from Korea--or steel, I guess, is the more relevant product from Korea--they are going to scratch and dig and resist importing steel from Korea like crazy even though Korean steel is selling at half the price of Japanese steel It may happen over time but it isn't going to happen very fast The one developing country that is running a big surplus on current account-- the others aren't running big surpluses--is Taiwan Their current account is really huge; for the size of the economy, it is absolutely enormous That is the one LDC that has an adjustment problem of its own Korea has a lot of debts; they are not running a big current account surplus Canada is not running a big current account surplus; Singapore isn't; I don't even think Hong Kong is Taiwan is, but that is only one country  Half of our deficit is in the rest; its counterpart is the statistical discrepancy  We need a lower current account deficit, I think, over time The question is, how do you get there without--  If we were intervening, just to make it clear, I presume what we would do is intervene around 150 yen, which is already lower than what it is now, and 200 marks Getting down to there, say, with a reduction in the discount rate, would be very easy  -38-    8/19/86  to contemplate We are already about one-third of the way to the reduction that Mr Truman is projecting for an 18-month period  I don't seem to "force" very well  On the protectionist side, we are running out of steam This point of protectionism is the same I don't care where the dollar is, I don't see any results They just want protection in the same period but it doesn't hurt [unintelligible] But I think we could have managed in the worst of all worlds where you get a lack of confidence in the dollar and it damages their outlook and it damages our outlook at the same time and forces interest rates up in the end instead of down Then we are in an unholy mess But we are playing on the fringes of that whatever--  To my mind, the problems are not very soluble I see that time is passing Maybe we better get to a decision here Just in the interest of short circuiting this, given the time--I don't want to short circuit any discussion that people want to have--I suspect that the idea of tightening monetary policy at the moment is not very appealing [Hearing no objection] we can reject that option If we were going to ease, in the broader sense, I am not sure that the best way to do it is by easing what is already a very easy open market posture That leaves me the very easy decision, insofar as open market operations are concerned, that we have to stay about where we are That leaves open the question of the discount rate very specifically  Let me just make a little artificial distinction and ask, regardless of the discount rate Would anyone want to argue differently than staying roughly where we are? Actually, we've been playing it slightly on the easy side from where we were about one month ago--you can see it in the funds rate--when you adjust for Tulsa, Oklahoma borrowing  We often expect that and it often doesn't happen  I don't put much weight on it, but if I may summarize--Mr Kohn can go on and give you a more erudite answer-- when you put this stuff in the equations and you assume no short-run change in interest rates--and there hasn't been much in the recent past--the result always comes out that monetary growth will slow down Whether it does or does not depends upon what [else] happens But that is the way the equations tend to look  We're really putting the reserves out second  Actually, I guess CD rates now are quite low relative to the present discount rate; they are right on the discount rate  If I understood Mr Kohn right earlier, he was saying that if you combine an unchanged open market policy with a reduction in the discount rate, the probabilities are quite high that you will continue to get very rapid monetary expansion  Say, around $300 million of real adjustment borrowing, discounting this Oklahoma situation  [Unintelligible]  We changed them the last time  I don't think we ought to worry about whether it is precisely "A," "B," or "C" At this stage, we ought to decide what we want to do There may be disagreements about this because people have different ideas about what should be done with the discount rate I guess I am arguing that the decision ought to be left to the discount rate as the more appropriate tool now Whatever way that decision goes, the question in essence is [Do we want borrowing of] something around $300 million or a little less than $300 million if the discount rate doesn't move?  The assumption you make is the only operational assumption now with a high degree of probability to be right--that they are not going to move without us  And they may not move with us  Governor Johnson  Mr Forrestal  Mr Stern  Mr Melzer  Mr Black  Mr Wallace  Mrs Horn  Mr Morris  Mr Keehn    8/19/86  Ms Seger  Mr Corrigan  Mr Parry  Mr Boehne  Governor Rice  Governor Angell  Mr Heller, will you add something on your maiden voyage?  [Unintelligible] I think we have got to try to get a decision Governor Wallich  I think all of the situations have been eloquently described here and they leave most people with a sense of some unease because we are fine-tuning around what is hopefully a bottom The good news is that we are trying to fiddle around with the correct amount of shading, possibly further ease, in the hopes of maybe [unintelligible] There is no way of squaring the circle and I haven't really tried, but I feel for the views that have been expressed on both sides We are sitting here pumping up liquidity and pumping up debt at the same time, and somehow no good comes of that in the long run I don't know whether it's [inflationary] or what What I would suggest in listening to this is probably the [unintelligible] to the widest possible consensus, partly because I think it is probably right I think it is probably right in probing around specifically for the operational language here to say that the Committee seeks to "decrease slightly" and leave in that "taking account of the possibility of a change in the discount rate" The way I would interpret that is that even though the Board of Governors may not decrease the discount rate right now, we will continue this process of leaning slightly on the easier side in open market operations, and maybe get down towards $200 million or so on borrowing, leaving aside the Oklahoma borrowing If we do reduce the discount rate, not necessarily immediately, and we didn't like the repercussions on the exchange markets or some other things we leave open the possibility of increasing the borrowings slightly to, say, around the $400 million level I think both of those [scenarios] are consistent with language that says easing slightly in terms of the overall picture, including the discount rate That would leave a little flexibility on the open market side to either ease a bit if there's no discount rate change and, on a contingent basis but not on a planned basis, to tighten just a bit if that seems desirable in the way of exchange market reactions or domestic reactions In either case, it's rather a small band  I think it's a way of probing Somebody suggested this as a way to get a bit of ease without making the overt move of a discount rate change It's kind of a substitute but not a full substitute It tests the waters as to what the exchange market reaction might be or whatever  I couldn't say that that is what anybody had in mind, but we are sitting here with a group that is going to make the decision--  In the terms that we used the last time that was easing That's why I think this language we used the last time is suitable for either course The only real difference I'm suggesting from that language, just to capture this a little more    8/19/86  closely, is to change "decrease somewhat" to "decrease slightly" That's the tenor of the whole thing The basic thrust is that some people might prefer to reduce the discount rate; but if there is no reduction in the discount rate, those who prefer to reduce the discount rate probably want a little easier stance in open market operations Or vice versa if we have the discount rate cut people may not prefer any easing [in open market operations] Quite clearly, nobody has spoken of easing in open market operations plus the discount rate change  I'm not suggesting we do both at the same time I'm just getting reactions Presumably, if you want to argue for a steepening--of the Melzer school or the Stern school--I suppose you might say you would get an increase in the bond rates with the reduction in the discount rate  I don't know which you would get, but I am not sure that you would get both at the same time  That's what I am saying--take account of the major variable, which would be the exchange rate If we didn't like that, give ourselves a little room to firm slightly  [Unintelligible] 140 in the week or we go to the devil I think [at] 145 we would [unintelligible] going to the devil; 150 is not But if we go beyond 150 in a very short period of time--  I think we are prepared for going to 2 DM or 150 yen, but if it went suddenly beyond that I would get worried  Oh, there has been none I would expect nobody to follow us this time and--  I think there is a certain ambivalence as expressed around this table That is right; I think you have made a correct distinction  [Unintelligible] but I suspect that that decision will be reviewed this week I feel a certain mechanical urgency to make a decision this week, one way or the other, because I am going to be out next week and a couple of days thereafter We have to make a decision this week or, if we don't, I presume we are not going to make one for another week or so But that's no argument I think it is so close to the possibility, anyway, and I don't know what you do [Unintelligible] everybody seems to be at $300 million for the moment, anyway If we say it clearly is not going to happen for a couple of weeks, then we might ease I think we are capable of deciding that today instead of--  I can't be more specific than around $200 million and around $400 million, but I don't want to take those too literally  That's inevitably the case But what I am saying is that if the exchange rate fell out of bed on its own in the next few days and we didn't reduce the discount rate, I don't suppose we would take that particular time to go to $200 million But I assume if the exchange markets aren't doing anything [or if the dollar] particularly strengthened and we didn't reduce the discount rate I would  I did not say that we would just do it I said it's contingent upon things happening that could be strong business news, but that takes a period of time  I am not talking anything very major here in either direction That's a formulation that I propose here If somebody has a better formulation, propose it  I think that is consistent with your expressed view and the views of several other members of the Committee But I don't detect that that will command unanimous support; if it does, then that's what we ought to say  MR ANGELL It won't get a majority  It is an obvious alternative How many would prefer that kind of alternative?  Members  Well, how many prefer that course--at least other than Mr Morris? Have we got any other alternatives to put on the table?  Just leave it at $300 million and what? The problem with that is that people feel differently about whether there should be a discount rate cut or not  I think the alternative is leaving it at $300 million regardless of whether we reduce the discount rate That is a theoretical alternative  Well, I think it's more than theoretical It leaves the whole decision in our hands Would people prefer that?  I'm just a little reluctant; if we can't anticipate a reaction three days from now we're in pretty sad shape    8/19/86  I am not saying we would automatically go to $400 million with a discount rate reduction I simply would leave ourselves that room if it appears desirable in the light of events subsequent to the [rate cut]  I would say this is all within the range of a certain amount of discretion What's a little more sensitive is the numbers we get when the percentage change in the borrowing gets larger It seems to be a matter of greater sensitivity, understandably perhaps I don't care if we do it; that's what I started out with But I'm trying to capture a little more closely a center of gravity  That's correct We're just talking about timing Just to repeat what I said on that theory I'm saying we might have the flexibility to do that depending upon subsequent developments The other thing is that I am not saying we reduce the discount rate on day A and raise borrowing on day A Also, just to be clear, I'm saying we don't reduce it to $200 million tomorrow when we're going to make a discount rate decision one way or another later this week If we do not make a decision to reduce it that would imply slightly easier borrowing numbers for a while pending whether we make a decision a little later  I think you will agree--  What it means in terms of language is this to say "decrease slightly" instead of "somewhat" probably captures it a little more closely But we would leave in this language "taking account of the possibility of a discount rate change" Now, I don't know what numbers to put in here, because our staff is telling us that we're at least in grave jeopardy of exceeding the 9 percent Whether we want to admit that or not, I don't know We could leave the 7 to 9 percent    8/19/86  I think we're saying that one of the considerations, and it is only one of the considerations, is that we're looking at that contingency of whether we reduce the discount rate or not The option to slightly tighten reserve conditions would depend at least in part upon whether M2 and M3 continued to zoom with M1 continuing to zoom  It sure would be, relative to what has been happening That is one of the factors; the directive says it If we came out with 10 to 11 percent growth in M2 and M3 that would certainly be a consideration in moving toward the higher borrowing level I think that's what we would be saying Understood? And the same [language on] M1 follows that I don't care if we use "might" or "would;" it makes no difference here The trouble with this is it's exactly the directive we had last time And I don't know what it--  I suppose we leave in the 4 to 8 percent Any other questions? The language couldn't be simpler change "somewhat" to "slightly;" leave in "taking account the possibility of a discount rate change;" and the rest of the language remains as it was in the last directive The understanding is that tomorrow we do nothing--stay at $300 million--and that the discount rate will obviously be considered later this week If we reduce the discount rate we still do nothing in the [unintelligible] but, depending upon developments, we might use a little flexibility on the up side If we don't reduce the discount rate we might use a little flexibility on the down side but very slightly depending on what [unintelligible] but we're close to that now Understood? Just call the roll, sir  I think we have completed our business Do we have sandwiches?   We need to approve the minutes Do I have a motion to approve?  Without objection Now we'll turn to Mr Cross  The lesson is that we have too much official discussion  Mr Morris  If the long-term rate goes up because of concern about inflation, I wouldn't think it would help the exchange rate  Taiwan strikes me as rather a special case They have an enormous surplus, enormous reserves Their big surpluses, fortunately anyway, are with the Germans and Japanese  Current account surplus  We ought to make it a 51st state if that would help!  They get a lot of pressure within Europe when the Germans don't reduce their interest rates; that is one way of reading it Nobody wants a revaluation within Europe so they were driven to this intervention idea as a method of relieving pressure within Europe against the general background of concern about the dollar But that's not what led to that particular decision  Better get some--  Indirectly  Somebody else in the market has to hold them  As Sam mentioned, and I would just emphasize, there has been quite a pickup in the German economy after a very sluggish performance Nobody knows how long it will last But at the moment their domestic demand is doing very well That, together with fairly rapid monetary expansion, is why any ideas they had of reducing their discount rate have been turned off From the standpoint of results, if what we're interested in is growth in the German economy, the most recent performance has been good; although it's hard to know if it will carry them, at the moment it is good  Mr Sternlight  No questions?  If there are no other comments or questions on that, we will return to Mr Sternlight and the topic we covered to some degree last month about operations in coupon issues I'm sure we have all thought that through I think what the issue comes down to is whether we do it reasonably routinely two or three times a year, the way we've been doing it, or whether we do it when we think there's some purpose in doing it  Yes, we can do it in both circumstances; we could do it routinely and also when there's some purpose  Then we buy more longer-term securities  It is, necessarily, if literally you go in that market routinely and also--  Well, this question of selling arose last time I don't know whether there's anything more to be said on that The observed practice is that we don't sell  There's no doubt about that That's why we don't sell--because we expect an announcement effect  Yes, I don't think this [unintelligible] Now, we do have other constraints than that [unintelligible] We lend dollars to--  Twelve  We can turn in the badge but still handle the problem  That I think we can do But I think it is right to say that one issue is the liquidity crisis and the other is whether we see any purpose in buying coupons  You find a portfolio distribution you like and the Treasury is maintaining a distribution that it likes I have no doubt of the volume this could involve should it never involve buying, just rolling over what we have  I [unintelligible] this with it We might buy in proportion to what their--  I'm not talking about giving it up; I'm talking about--  Well, that's the question That's what the issue comes down to  I have no objection to buying long-term securities when there's a good reason for buying them My question is whether any particular purpose is served when there's no reason to buy them I think you want to argue that this [routine buying] keeps the machinery oiled or something That's the argument  I have no trouble answering that question as to why we're not buying If we wanted to adopt that policy we would say we're not buying them anymore except when some purpose is served in buying them    9/23/86  Certainly, that helps you  I would do that if we're going to continue buying I would go very short and pretty soon  Well, we'd [unintelligible] if we buy small amounts now, and even if we can, if we're going to do it at all That is my impression  No, I don't mean that From buying smaller amounts in the market when we buy  We don't buy  You can buy it if you [unintelligible] Even $1 or $1-1/2 billion isn't very much; it's pretty trivial considering the volumes in the Treasury market  No doubt you can protect the liquidity position by going shorter on the rollovers  Well, there's no question you could do that That is kind of in between It just leaves the question-- It's not like it's [unintelligible] every time we buy a coupon issue I personally wonder why we're doing it There is no other reason The answer I get is to keep the machinery oiled I don't know what that means  If you have a purpose, you want to surprise  That, I think, is one argument  I don't want to prolong this discussion or add to it Ordinarily, it's working just fine There's a lot bigger volume going through the market every day than what we're doing We might want to know how it's working at some point of strain or whatever Then I have no problem I have no compunction about buying long-term securities when there's a purpose here  Not for a long time Historically, yes, but not recently  Well, I will give you an example Ordinarily, if we had a strong reason for going in, the announcement effect might be welcomed If we really thought the market was in a    9/23/86  panic, say, and we wanted to show some support in the market, we would want an announcement effect An announcement effect would have been more important in July But taking the last few weeks, I don't know whether we had any particular reserve need which was suitable--  But we might have argued we were going to buy anyway and with the long-term rates backing up and the new rate [unintelligible] it might have been quite reasonable to have bought long-term securities Now, would we have been better off or worse off if we had decided in the last few weeks to do that against the background of a reserve need when we had no purpose--just a matter of having been in there and only been in for periods of that sort That's an arguable point  That's what I'm saying you could get in between cases of that sort But we're so constrained now, we could [only] do it when we're supplying reserves permanently Anyway, the chances of that arising coincident with a period of that sort are remote  Well, does anybody else want to express a view on this subject? If not, the issue having been raised we'd better arrive at some conclusion One option is merely to do more or less what we have been doing, which doesn't exclude, obviously, doing it on special occasions and [leaning toward] the shorter [maturities] in refundings The other option would be to [cut back] in our already pretty limited operation of being willing to do it--I don't hear anybody saying we never should do it or even that we should be all that reluctant if there is a need or some positive rationale--but confine ourselves as to when there is some positive rationale other than that we haven't done it for six months These are the two choices Who prefers option one, continuing fairly routine [purchases of coupons]? Most people prefer that so we'll continue that fairly routine--  I don't think it makes much difference in the market because now they have allocated these securities especially to us anyway and we can--    9/23/86  We can just go to shortening, which doesn't affect the market at all  [Why do you] say you're keeping contact with [the market] if you're buying them directly from the Treasury and never selling them?  In bills Coupons would presumably get shorter?  It depends upon whether the money supply continues to expand at the rate of recent years The marginal increase will rise with more bills, but as he said--  It depends upon    9/23/86  No, because they'll be rolled over into coupons  Short coupons, but they'll still be in coupons  The consensus was to continue to do it in small amounts  Mr Parry  Do we have any general comments on the economic outlook?  Mr Black  Mr Keehn  Mr Parry  What happened in that Weyerhauser strike? Is it settled?  Weyerhauser in British Columbia?  It has been settled?  On what terms?  He didn't get a good settlement?  Governor Rice  Mr Boehne  Mr Forrestal  Mr Boykin  Mr Guffey  Mr Stern  Mr Melzer  Mr Corrigan  Are you prepared to be careful, Mrs Horn?  Governor Angell  Mr Morris  American products?  That is a great expression of confidence about inflation as well as probably an escalator! Mr Heller  I don't know about those wage increases; those wage increases are low but so is productivity  -28-    9/23/86  Governor Seger  You think that big improvement in [unintelligible] How are they going to pay the interest on their debts?  Anybody else want to say anything?  From every point of view  Mr Kohn  Let's break for donuts  [Coffee break]  When I look at this economic forecast of the staff, I don't know how good it is as a forecast, but it looks to me in a less than perfect world to be about as good an outcome as one could wish for It has a nice tapering off of domestic demand, a good boost from the export side, real progress toward our longer-range objectives and we escape without too much inflationary pressure So, if we can achieve that result we would be fine Now, the question is How do we achieve that result? I will just make a forecast that we are not going to have very startling policy moves arising out of this meeting, so I would be glad to hear about your nuances You can prove me all wrong Who would like to comment? Mr Morris  That doesn't sound too nuanced Mr Melzer  Mr Parry  Mr Black  Mr Stern  If I can just interrupt a second There has been a lot of talk about the fiscal situation I don't know what's optimistic and what's pessimistic I think it's Mickey Mouse what they are going through to get $154 billion; it isn't realistic  -32-    9/23/86  But I guess I would just as soon that they didn't get to $154 billion from $220 billion all in one fell swoop If you believe the staff forecast, which is what?--$225 billion to $177 billion--that doesn't sound too bad to me as a change from a year ago It's not quite $50 billion less but $40 billion or so anyway  Oh, I thought the forecast was about $225 billion--whatever That may be about as much as it should be in one year in my view, if you really believe that number Now, I don't know how solid that number is; I would guess it may be higher than that, I suppose However, what do you allow for in the farm program?  Well, good luck  If you believe the $50 billion, I don't think it's all that bad But I don't fully believe the $50 billion  Some day they may have to think about even increasing taxes; maybe that's what you go through to prove you can't reduce expenditures I don't want to get off on this subject Mr Forrestal  Mr Boehne  -33-    9/23/86  Mr Keehn  Mrs Horn  With no nuances?  Governor Angell  Governor Rice  Mr Boykin  Governor Wallich  You want to tighten up a little?  Mr Guffey  Mr Corrigan  I don't know what all that means [for policy]  Mr Heller  I better read what alternative B says Well, something like $300 borrowing is fine and I don't have any problems with alternative B The question is what happens if, let's say, the business situation goes along pretty much as expected but the monetary numbers continue to run high or the dollar is weak, and [unintelligible] are weak To use a word I picked up from Mr Sprinkel in a different context when he made a comment about the business outlook gathering strength--that's not what I am referring to--we do expect that the inflation rate is going to "ooze up" The question that I raise is Under what conditions should borrowings ooze up?  I think it's [unintelligible] the oozing up word  Well, we have the current problem that the borrowings are so low that every time something unusual happens they get higher The first question is whether we are bothered by that; I'm not If somebody's computer goes out or they get caught late in the day by some withdrawals or something what do we do? Leaning over backwards to try to offset that seems not to be the order of the day We haven't been doing that and I would think that we don't want to do that We don't do anything at the moment but the question is beyond that A number of people raised the issue of liquidity If, for instance, the aggregates continue to run pretty high--higher than what alternative B straightforwardly suggests--and the business news continues reasonably on the firm side and let's say, just to put another thing in, that the dollar doesn't look all that great, should we ooze up on the borrowings more or less deliberately? I interpret what some people said as certainly in that direction, but I am not sure about the others Many people just said they were neutral I don't know what they meant by neutral That's what a straightforward interpretation of the directive permits  Well, it would in mine, too I don't know whether I would necessarily expect the yield curve to continue to rise; it might or might not But a sense of inflationary expectations would be a factor, however measured In those conditions, with the aggregates running high, I would ooze a bit  Well, I wouldn't offset those right now I figure actually changing [borrowings] a little, not very much Oozing is meant to convey that you lean with a slight drift, which wouldn't carry borrowings above $400 million, I don't think But you might ooze by less than that  Yes, and mostly on that side I see it less likely, given where borrowings are now, that we would want to ooze on the down side  That's the kind of thing we could do  Yes, spell out all the conditions in great detail If we can get a sense of that and then do it-- I am assuming there is no change now from what we have been doing, right at the moment  We could have another direction of ooze if something went wrong If the economy was clearly weak, the dollar was clearly strong, and the aggregates were behaving just fine, we would move in the other direction  You may get some argument about that  I am not talking about anything that will be a very overt move Anything we are talking about is within the range of natural fluctuation anyway, but it's a little sense of where we are aiming over time and in certain contingencies Why don't we just look at the wording and that will resolve the problem "Maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M2--" What numbers do we have here?  Is 7 percent too low or not as an estimate?  Well, the midpoint is 8 percent; 7 to 9 percent encompasses the midpoint We won't say "respectively;" we just say--  It refers to both at annual rates of about 7 to 9 percent  Well, 7 percent is below What the staff says is 8, 8-1/2 percent; that's roughly in the middle of 7 to 9 percent We have this great choice of whether we say "about 8 percent" or "7 to 9 percent" The "7 to 9 percent" doesn't bother me given the behavior of these things anyway  What we did was encompass different numbers for the two I don't care either 7 to 9 percent or about 8 percent    9/23/86  I detect no realistic difference between "about 8" and "7 to 9" This says "about 7 to 9" and maybe that is a difference We have a nuance of difference  Do we always say "about" even when we use a range?  I don't understand how these lines [unintelligible]  That's because it's not logarithmic  That's right I think it's either "about 8 percent" or "7 to 9 percent" What are the preferences? Who prefers 7 to 9 percent? I count 9 I guess we have a majority for 7 to 9 percent I am a little embarrassed by continuing this sentence on M1 about this great expectation that doesn't materialize  I don't know what we can do with it In the interest of variety we might express the same sentiment, but do we have to express it in exactly the same words?  All right, we'll leave it the same, as embarrassing as it is Now we get to the nuances Let me--  No we can't No, I wouldn't want to ooze in this language If we wanted to make it a little more explicit I guess we could say something like "slightly greater" instead of "somewhat greater" We could say "Slightly greater reserve restraint would be acceptable should the aggregates exceed expectations depending upon the strength of the business expansion, developments in foreign" etc, and "somewhat lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable" and so forth and so on  I made it non-symmetrical just by changing the "would"--  We have done that lots of times We can do it all in one sentence which is what we have often done But if we want to put a little more emphasis on the aggregates, we could just say "somewhat greater reserve restraint would and somewhat lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable depending upon" just what you have here  But that would put them both in the same sentence I tried to make a little distinction that the aggregates would trigger this depending upon the other things We could still say "depending on the behavior of the aggregates, taking account of the strength of the business expansion" and so forth That's our rather traditional way of doing it  -40-    9/23/86  I don't want to get too many things in there  I think international credit markets is meant to be a code word for--  I thought it was, frankly, a reference to the international debt situation Let's change "somewhat" to "slightly" and say "somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable or slightly lesser reserve restraint might"-- I guess "slightly" should go after the would, too "slightly greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable depending upon the behavior of the aggregates and taking account of"  Your way without the "and"; comma, "taking into account the behavior of the aggregates," etc Is that all right?  Well, let me ask the question this way I will give you the most extreme test of that This doesn't rest on anything very dramatic in the economy In this period of a few weeks, suppose the Germans and Japanese say We will reduce our interest rates, but you have to reduce your discount rate again to help us along Think of it as good politically, or for some reason or other I don't think they will say that, but suppose they do  You can make extreme assumptions about the business situation which are not inconceivable, but which I don't think are very likely during this particular period I think it's more likely that the question I raised could arise, but I don't  -41-    9/23/86  consider that very likely--don't misunderstand me But suppose it did occur?  I have to question their [unintelligible]  Well, does Mr Morris have any following for leaving [the easing alternative] out entirely?  You have a following but not [a majority] I think we appear to be for an asymmetrical nuance  I think I just gave you my interpretation We are not talking about a great [unintelligible]; we are not talking about one week or two weeks We are talking about some sense that it is indeed running high and that if other things were proceeding as    9/23/86  expected--if we didn't get any weakening in the economy, didn't get any strengthening really in the exchange rate, the oil price was not going down another $3--yes, we would ooze But it's only an ooze  I think it can go higher than 9 percent by some figure in one week or, necessarily, by one month's figure But if it was one month, the fact that it was continuing--as best we can make these appraisals--and there weren't any signs of tapering off, yes, we would ooze But it's only an ooze and, given all those other things, it's not much of a quibble Do we have enough understanding of what we are talking about to vote on this? It's maintain; 7 to 9 percent; slightly greater reserve restraint would and slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable depending on the behavior of the aggregates, taking into account all these things; and 4 to 8 percent  Okay, you want to tighten a little I guess we are finished  END OF MEETING       Are there any questions or comments on the swap extensions?  Well, what it may portend for the future is anybody's guess I don't know anything more about it Mr Baker has been looking for some reason to say something nice And he had it with the discount rate reduction and this report that the Japanese might reduce taxes sometime in the future But they said it hasn't got any operational significance in terms of intervention in any direct sense I think it is quite consistent with intervening if things perhaps became extreme in either direction, but it is no commitment to undertake anything  Germany? I think the situation is quite different in Germany in the very short run They have been growing pretty fast I saw Mr Poehl earlier this week and he's still armed with all these numbers, which I-- You can argue that 3 percent is too modest an objective for Germany But they can make pretty good progress if they are growing at 3 percent--which in their view is good enough--with 5 to 6 percent domestic demand and a minus on the external side, which of course is what people want And right now they can show it at least for two quarters Their monetary growth is still exceeding their targets by a significant amount, which doesn't make them very happy They are sitting there worried about how they are going to explain this They have to announce new targets in December and they say Do we rebase or do we [unintelligible]? It's the same type of problem that we have  I did His charts for the first time--he showed me charts [unintelligible] just like the ones that we have, but for two years [changing] the base One chart has a very expanded scale on the vertical axis, just the way some of ours do The chart looks at the last two years and it has these little wedges on it and it shows the actual movement in the monetary base And the actual movement for two years in a row now is way above the wedges While    11/5/86  they've been closer than we have, their scale was so expanded that it looked pretty bad It was just like the kind of thing that you--  They did this year  Their GNP deflator--that's domestic prices--is running at about a 3 percent annual rate of increase It's like ours running higher than the CPI; there is an even sharper discrepancy than in this country There is concern over what might happen as they get into next year I guess their Economic Institute's projection has raised some question about it A 3 percent growth next year--which is what they're projecting--depending upon what happened last quarter and what happens this quarter does not imply a 3 percent rate of growth from fourth quarter to fourth quarter next year but significantly less than that  But their unemployment is in the north That's what they keep saying, it's a regional--  Well, they won't do anything before the election and part of the--  Part of the problem is that the opposition party adopts an American view to economic policy, or vice-versa, which is very embarrassing to the government So if they did anything they would appear to be adopting the opposition's economic view; and for understandable reasons they don't want to do that Actually, the Bundesbank wants to take some technical actions that appear as tightening and wouldn't really be--I don't understand it all They want to get rid of rediscount quotas, which they think are getting out of line, and substitute some other way of putting the money in the market But I'm afraid if they do that it will be interpreted as a tightening  I think that was probably a little later My impression is that earlier [Mr Poehl] maneuvered so as to be potentially in a position to reduce the discount rate in early September, say, which is what he was talking about But then the aggregates got high and there was all the public discussion and so forth, and the GNP numbers came in as strong as they expected All those things together made a discount rate cut less likely rather than more likely as September actually arrived  Well, that's hard to tell It's a big subject Why don't we have a discussion about Mexico after the meeting? Are there any other questions about the market? We do have this question of routinely extending the swap lines  Any discussion of that? If not, you are authorized to routinely roll over swap lines, Mr Cross  Mr Sternlight  Questions or comments?  If there are no other observations, we have to ratify the transactions  Any objections? Mr Prell will clarify the economic outlook  Would people like to comment on their own views of the outlook? Bob Parry  Mr Keehn  How many plants do they have?  I keep hearing about all these great work rule changes and enormous hope for productivity increases and I look at these figures and I see no productivity increases Would Mr Prell please explain to me the discrepancy between what I hear and what I read?  -10    11/5/86  More favorable than past cyclical experience?  You don't think more computers mean less productivity?  That depends on how one--  It decreases the GNP; we don't have all those repairs that go in there!  [Unintelligible] but that's what he says Productivity in the educational system is going down  Mr Morris  It sure is in our projection I hope it's there  You're finished?  Mr Melzer  Mr Boehne  Mr Forrestal  Mrs Horn  Mr Stern  Mr Corrigan  -16-    11/5/86  Mr Black  What's a VAR?  Mr Boykin  Ms Seger  [Unintelligible]  Let me ask a question about multifamily housing I hear about all of these surpluses, which I assume are true, but my impression is that rents are still going up at about the same rate of speed Is that true?    11/5/86  How do you explain that seeming dichotomy?  You have rich friends [unintelligible]  Well, it was a $400,000 house Mr Guffey  Mr Angell  Governor Rice  Anybody else have any comments?  Let me just make a couple of comments about the international situation This was not stated when we were discussing Japan and Germany earlier So far as Japan is concerned, the most important point to make about their recent actions, particularly the discount rate change--which is good news, I guess--is that undoubtedly they acted because they are really worried about their business outlook now That's the bad news I don't think the Japanese economy has looked very good for some time, but the Bank of Japan seems to be convinced that it's not very good and that the growth prospects at the moment are not very satisfactory Mr Truman just gave me the announcement of German industrial production in September; the figures just came out this morning, I guess I don't know what to make of it; it's a big reduction when the August figure, which was initially 3, is revised down to -1 and then it's -17 in September That gives a rather sick cast to their industrial production They accompanied the announcement with a statement that they expect an upward revision of close to 2 percent I don't know what kind of statistics they have [when they realease a figure that is] down 17 and say they expect it to be revised upward by 2 percent So think of that what you would like to think Even with that upward revision it would not be very strong in the third quarter; it doesn't quite bear out these much happier GNP figures they have I thought that Governor Heller or Governor Angell might mention a little curiosity--I don't know whether it's literally true, but it's very    11/5/86  close to being true--that despite all of this agony in the farm sector, which is very real, we may have record net farm income this year It's a little odd to have all of this agony at the same time that you have record income, which will almost all be funded by government payments For whatever reason, there it is If you don't have any debts on the farm, I guess you are doing all right  They think the export orders are actually down  Volume is down year over year  Of course, that's what's affecting the domestic economy as we feared Besides that, they don't import much The big contrast between Japan and Germany is that in Germany imports, including imports from Japan, are going up rather sharply I don't think Japanese imports are going up much  Governor Johnson just mentioned this change in the dollar and so forth I have a better feeling for the moment; I don't know how long it will last In some sense it gives us a little more flexibility; we may not want to use it, but it removes one constraint on our fine tuning as we go along Right at the moment, I'm kind of on this [unintelligible] curve I can't refrain from saying that there are two things that bother me, looking at a longer-term prospective, that are particularly relevant to what we do now I am struck, particularly [by the comments of] the first people who were talking, that we are doing much better on wages Mr Prell  -24-    11/5/86  and other people tell us that it really has been quite remarkable Productivity in manufacturing, at least, seems to be pretty good They are keeping their costs under control and everybody says all of these manufacturers are sitting there champing at the bit to raise prices They can't do it, but at the first opportunity that comes along they are going to raise prices I just wonder about the consistency of these things and what they tell us about the psychology of the American business sector You have twenty years of inflation, that's normal; and if you can't raise prices that's not normal, even if you are making production gains and keeping your costs under control There seems to be something the matter there Then I hear about all of these capacity cutbacks--I don't want to generalize too far, maybe it's just in orders on steel--but if we are going to have these high exports in the future and we are going to have these restrained imports that we are talking about, presumably that means manufacturing activity does a lot better in the United States I would think some of that improvement in the trade balance has to come in the automobile industry And if that's true, what are we doing reducing plants by 6 or 12 or whatever it is [unintelligible] increasing them, may be [unintelligible] But it bothers me  You think in the context of at least maintaining production?  How much does that amount to?  One place I suppose we can make gains in that connection is that a lot of these foreign plants were established, I am sure, with the intention of importing almost all the components But if an American company can get in there and provide more of the components--which seems possible--you get a pickup almost invisibly this time    11/5/86  This forecast has pretty big increases in exports and no increases in imports And that surely is a change in trend, if it comes about  Why don't we hear from Mr Kohn and then have our break?  Okay, let's have a break  [Coffee break]  Let's get the show on the road Who would like to take an initiative?  I will take it that this affirmation of no change means no change in the borrowing and presumably in the numbers that we use, although there is a little question as to whether we should move those I don't think it makes any difference in the numbers if we move the time frame to the fourth quarter instead of from August I am indifferent, but it's somewhat more normal to use the fourth-quarter figure That would not make any difference in the    11/5/86  numbers; it just affects the words Forgetting about the nuances in the language at this point, is that what we are talking about? Okay The floor is open for nuances  Can we put on the table taking out at least--  That's right; make them both "mights" or shift the "would" to the easier reserves part  Well, what is the feeling about symmetry?  Well, it sounds like a consensus for symmetry Should these be "woulds" or "mights"?  I don't have any strong feeling either [way], but I'd suggest "might" as being slightly more [appropriate]; I don't hear anybody talking about wanting to change now in a very active sense Mr Kohn raised a question about whether we want to change "slightly" to "somewhat" Any preference between "slightly" and "somewhat"?  On the same theory you would make it "might" - -  What about these [proposed] changes that Mr Kohn made? On the first reading I don't see that they change anything change "exceptionally large increase" to "exceptional pace;" and "past" to "previous" What is--  Well, you see more of a difference between "previous" and "past" than I do Since I see no substantive difference between them, I guess it just raises the question of whether it's worth changing the language  [For] September to December I think it makes absolutely no difference, since we had it this way, with "exceptional" It would make just a slight substantive difference if we thought the higher end of this range in September [unintelligible] August to December means it includes August too  So the difference is whether you include September and September was toward the high side If the figures came in low you have a month of high [growth] that would be in the calculations  It's just a matter of presentation Usually in these mid-quarterly dates we talk about the quarter and not about a period longer than a quarter Before the quarter this time we did add August; as we sometimes do, we included an extra month What do you want to do?  Do you want to change to September?  -28-    11/5/86  Does anybody else have anything to say? It would read "In the implementation of policy the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of reserve restraint This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from September to December at annual rates of 7 to 9 percent While growth in Ml over the same period is expected to moderate from"--we'll take these refinements; that will produce a whole article in the Fed Fortnightly  Yes, we took out "respectively" It's 7 to 9 percent "While growth in M1 over the same period is expected to moderate from its exceptional pace during the previous several months, growth in this aggregates will continue to be judged in the light of the behavior of M2 and M3 and other factors Slightly greater reserve restraint might or slightly lesser reserve reserve might be acceptable" etc And we have 4 to 8 percent on the federal funds rate Any other comments?  If we are prepared, we can take a vote  We have a couple of housekeeping items I thought we might meet for two days in December [unintelligible] in the discussion of how we handle next year That, of course, raises not  -29-    11/5/86 -30-  exactly a new event but a considerable question about what we do about Ml in particular So if that's all right we will schedule the meeting to begin on Monday afternoon instead of on Tuesday Also, I think you have had a tentative schedule of next year's meetings The only question I am aware of that has arisen is that a couple of people raised a question about the meeting scheduled during Christmas week I would like to indicate that we work during [unintelligible]  END OF MEETING       We need to approve the minutes No objections Foreign currency operations  Any questions or comments?  With all this silence, we'll go to domestic open market operations  It's never impossible The Philippines are not actually asking for money--just refinancing  Let's go back to this swap question, just to avoid any misunderstanding I answered on behalf of the United States; The Federal Reserve hasn't done swaps with anybody except Mexico anyway The United States has, the Treasury also--it's kind of a division of labor  They have agreed to a lot of Mexican ones  We have reached that critical mass, but still haven't got the uncritical mass A lot of significant banks are not in  There are a lot of these LDC things coming together The Philippines has just been hanging there; that's just a refinancing Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, and Venezuela have all come together and the mood is not good It depends on how one interprets it Paying off some--  I think it is impossible to judge They ran into a very bad time The story of Brazil is they have to [unintelligible] for a while; instead of saying inflation went away, it was frozen out of the system They have had very rapid [inflation] growth this year Furthermore, there was a great loss of confidence in the weeks before the election People knew they were going to have a program They had capital flight and their trade position went to the devil, partly because of leads and lags and partly just because domestic growth was so bad They lost a lot of reserves over the    12/15-16/86  course of the month, or 6 to 8 weeks So when they finally took the measures--and I think they haven't lost any reserves since then and they probably have regained some--they were pretty well depleted, in the sense of what they think they need anyway So their confidence that they can get through next year without significant new monies from the banks has evaporated But how much they really need depends The IMF patted them on the back on their program; there is no formal way [unintelligible] Paris for rescheduling Rescheduling is fully anticipated but no money which is [unintelligible] Whether this new money is $2 billion or $4 billion--  They may have some [unintelligible] measures growing out of this program but they don't want to agree specifically to part of this rain dance--kabuki dance, I guess, is a more apt description--where they took these millions that they more or less thought would be approved by the international [unintelligible] It is quite a big program; it is very disturbing and it is mostly excise taxes, what little excise taxes apply You stick a 100 percent tax on automobiles, and I guess a 70 percent tax on some other items, so you get this tremendous price distortion  Well, a small devaluation They did a small devaluation to keep up with their own inflation, which is rising again They manipulated the price indices so that these things that are really whacked will not be so heavily weighted in the price index for poor people so they won't have to raise wages But it is a big program in terms of the budgetary impact, if they can carry it through--if people don't stop buying cars, which is one of the risks [given that] so much of the revenue comes from cars and other durables They really whacked these out of sight in terms of the taxes; other things they didn't tax at all and continue to subsidize Some internal distortions in the program [unintelligible] that just in sheer budgetary magnitude may be 4-1/2 percent of the GNP; I guess they already said 3-1/2 percent  Well, the big thing in this program, of course, was to pretty much get rid of it and then they took another step to try to get rid of the last debts And that is what they are back on, informally They took a massive step to get rid of it, so you wonder whether they will do some more backsliding That is right The actual backsliding compared to what they had is very small  I think you will find they put something back on  Mr Sternlight  Any questions?  SPEAKER(?) Peter, [do you see] any shift in the maturities that the Japanese in particular seem to be buying?  It depends upon what you are interested in controlling The rationale for CRR was to get a very [unintelligible] between M1 and reserves If you are interested in evenness in the federal funds rate and predictable nonborrowed reserves and predictable excess reserves, then it's [unintelligible]  SPEAKER(?) It is ironic that as soon as the Board approved CRR, its interest in Ml declined precipitously  [Unintelligible]    12/15-16/86  [Unintelligible] quick control over M1 No more questions on this? We will turn to Messrs Kichline and Truman, [but first we need to ratify the open market] transactions  No objections We will hear precise, careful, thoughtful estimates of the internal and external outlook  What is the latest OMB projection?  What do you make of the decline in unemployment insurance claims?    12/15-16/86  Not as much as in some earlier months, when unemployment claims didn't do anything, if I remember correctly  You'd make something of it?  Subject to your correction, you have about the lowest price forecast of any of these standard forecasts Would you explain why I should be so reassured?  [Unintelligible] remind us that we've all been too high [unintelligible]; next year we are in the clover, it seems  [Unintelligible]  I think we might call on Mr Kohn for comments about Mr Simpson's paper  I think the question we might devote a little time to--[not] this afternoon but tomorrow morning--in setting the stage for our next meeting is what targets we want to use, if any I have been assuming that we would have targets for M2 and M3 Ml looks a lot more doubtful to me I think we might go some distance in establishing a framework so that when we come to the next meeting we'll at least know what targets we are going to have, if any  I think you are right It is a matter of law; we've got to cook up some target That was a little too [unintelligible]; I don't want to [unintelligible] my view yet  [Unintelligible]  Let me summarize what I think I heard you saying As a central point, if one assumed no change in velocity with unchanged interest rates M1 would go up 55 percent If interest rates then moved up 2 percent we should have about a 14 percent increase in Ml; in a different environment, if they moved down by 2 percent we should have minus 3 percent  You multiplied by 2  When you say a one percent change in interest rates, you are talking about a one percentage--  Absolute change All you are talking about is a change in the funds rate from 5 percent to 6 percent or from 5 percent to whatever  [Unintelligible] the opportunity cost is between--  If the market rate that you use changes by one percentage point, what is the elasticity of M2 and M3?  [Unintelligible]    12/15-16/86  Suppose we had a situation where interest rates were rising, say, one percent or more and M1 was rising at the same time, say, at least faster than the nominal GNP Does that tell you anything?  What [velocity] increase do you get with, say--just to keep the arithmetic easy--a 6 percent increase in nominal GNP and no change in the discount rate?  Suppose there are no lagged effects in interest rates  You still have a trend?  You get interest rates back up to 21 percent again; you won't have any money supply at all    12/15-16/86  It seems to say that retail deposits are more volatile than--  It is hard for me to see the situation in which they would price those deposits more aggressively than the marginal deposits Mr Parry  The argument on the other side--just to put forth the argument--is that if it is going to be so volatile in  -19-    12/15-16/86  either direction, with relatively modest changes in interest rates, does that serve us well?  Damning with faint praise!  You get that kind of shifting; it is just once removed  With shifting into NOW accounts, as I recall, you get a higher reserve requirement relative to the base, all other things equal  You don't have to accommodate it but--  Does anybody else have anything burning to say? At this stage I just want to give you a little homework I was listening to this and I think we ought not come to any obviously final judgments; but it would be very helpful if we had a good sense of the framework in which we should approach the necessary numerology, recognizing that we can't get away from that Is there any sympathy for a new narrower aggregate?  Is there any sympathy for any new aggregate at all? Responses in the morning I even want a consensus in the morning, as nearly as we can get one Do we want to have a normal type target for Ml at all? And I would have a sub-question to that, which may be quite important In the absence of a normal target--which says to me that we have a target of X to Y and if we're outside it, we're outside it--is there anything that we would want to say about movements of M1 in relation to other things, such as things that would alarm us or reassure us? And finally, the question is Do we retain M2 and M3? If we answer all those questions with a "no" we don't have any targets So you have one constraint on your remarks tomorrow you can't answer no to all the questions  [Meeting recessed]    12/15-16/86  December 16, 1986--Morning Session  The appropriate time is [now]  It's in large part ex post rationale Do you have any studies of the elasticity of M1A as opposed to Ml, Mr Kohn?  Do we have any confidence, assuming that one was going to have a target for M1A, about where it should be?  Presumably submerged under this is how depository institutions price their services  What interest credit do [they] give?  Intellectually, I presume that if you want to go this way, the excuse would be that we have had all of the shift from demand deposits into NOW accounts that we are going to get and they are less substitutable at the margin for other types of liquid funds  MIA has somewhat peculiar characteristics to me It says we are very interested in business demand deposits and currency but we don't care what transactions balances individuals hold per se  Let me recognize Mrs Horn first  We are only talking now about what we are going to do regarding a [new] narrow--  We will rapidly get to the [Ml] question  We will return to the question a little later Mr Stern, do you have something [to say] about the new Ml?    12/15-16/86  I don't detect any strong enthusiasm for introducing a new narrow monetary aggregate as an actual target at this point  Let's return to that The next question I have is Do we want any new aggregate at all? I think Mr Morris proposed one  Do you push this with enthusiasm or with just a feeling that if people want to try that we--  L suffers from the grievous defect that the figures come in months late  Would the staff like to comment on L?  Does anybody else have any views on L or any other broad aggregate?  Any other comments? I do not detect any strong urge for adopting L as of--  Too radical! Let me just take my questions out of order Does everybody agree with what seems to be the implicit assumption of some people that we will have an M2 and M3 target in the traditional form?  I guess we have that assumption on M2 and M3 So the other question is what we do with Ml I think there is a question, clearly, as to whether we should have an M1 target, stated as either a target or monitoring range, in the form in which we have had but didn't initially [adopt in July] Do we want to say anything about Ml? We can obviously say some things that have been suggested about looking at various alternatives and studying these things  Mr Keehn  Mr Guffey  Mr Forrestal  Mr Corrigan  The M2 target?  Mr Parry  I am not sure you are agreeing with him Maybe you can be more explicit I am not sure whether you are or you aren't  That seems to be somewhat different Perhaps it's more nuances-- If I understood Mr Corrigan, he said don't present a range even as a monitoring range; present one as a footnote under certain assumptions  I have a little difficulty visualizing your paragraph as part of a box  Governor Johnson  Ms Seger  Let's come back to that Mr Morris  You don't want a range, I take it  Governor Angell  Mr Melzer  Mr Stern  Mr Boykin  Did you express yourself explicitly on this subject, Governor Heller?  Well, we have a range of opinion I don't see anybody saying we should have a target of the traditional type, as opposed to a monitoring range I will make a couple of observations I think I am repeating what other people said but--even setting forth a monitoring range the way we did [in July] or as we do for debt I don't think is very helpful, because we are likely to be either way above or, in some conditions, way below I would hate to be in a position where every indication was to tighten up and we've got all of these interest elasticity [unintelligible] I'm not particularly expecting that in the short run but, over time, we may want to tighten up and if we have great interest elasticity and M1 runs low people will say You are running below that 5 percent target, how can you possibly tighten up under those conditions? So I have a real concern in both directions about setting forth a target, even a monitoring range, just pure and simple  I share some of the concerns about promising too much from a study I would suggest that we say we are going to get back to it at midyear It seems likely that the study is going to show that almost anything we look at has a lot of interest elasticity and that gives us the problem that we are not going to be in any position-- Obviously, nobody can oppose a study It's just a matter of the way it's stated, as Mr Boehne just said However, I think we can say something that    12/15-16/86  would be useful And that probably would be something along the lines--I haven't quite visualized a box, but that's a subsidiary point--that we think we know something about Ml and how it behaves in a very broad way I think we probably could say something like under normal or specified conditions, we would think it would rise at a pace somewhat around nominal GNP and we think that a nominal GNP--I'm not sure I'd state it quite this way--of around 5-1/2 or 6 percent is appropriate And if interest rates weren't changing, that's what we would expect But if other things happened and interest rates went up, we would expect M1 to run low, and the public shouldn't be surprised by that; if interest rates were declining and the economy was soft, we would expect M1 to run high If inflation is down, we wouldn't be disturbed by a higher figure; if inflation is rising and interest rates are rising, we wouldn't be disturbed by a lower figure Everyone ought to understand that that's the way we will appraise Ml-- as a kind of supplementary device to the other targets, without putting it in the box, or setting a monitoring range per se We might footnote it or something I don't know how much one can say in a box It's a visual point, but I think we could have a useful discussion of M1 indicating the kinds of conditions under which we would be disturbed or not disturbed by a big slowdown or a greater increase That might be more useful than anything else  Page 16?  I think we could have a discussion of Ml Maybe we could mention studies and all of this other stuff I didn't look at it very carefully, but I think we could say that we are not ignoring it, but that we find ourselves unable just to give a simple range that encompasses all the significance of it [How we view] it would depend upon circumstances, and we can try to describe the circumstances The trouble is that this is getting too complicated, obviously The basic point that we would make is that we think M1 has a lot of interest elasticity and an increase or a decrease should not be a surprise if there are changes in interest rates that may be appropriate for other reasons  I think that is correct If you thought that was a great big possibility, unlike those nice little equations Mr Kohn has, the less you can say about it or the more vaguely you say anything--  I don't know what "exhume it if you need it" means If it really has a lot of interest elasticity, I am not sure what the exhumation means  Have three-dimensional graphs?  Well, implicit in what I am saying, anyway, is that we will continue to observe Ml I don't know exactly what the right wording is, but we would observe it within some analytic framework, if we could state it [Unintelligible], I'm afraid, unless Mr Kohn can give me a little more reassurance than he gave me yesterday  I sense we have gone about as far as we can go on this subject this morning I have a little work to do before the next meeting Does anybody want to express any views, in a very preliminary way, about the M2 and M3 targets that we settled on tentatively last time? What were they 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent [for both]? Does that still seem about right or does anybody have a strong view for something different than that? This would be very tentative at this point  Your projection [would be] that if we had a great crash and stock prices went down people would want to hold less liquidity then, if your argument is symmetrical  Does this lead you to the conclusion that the targets should be changed?  Well, you can argue the opposite on the basis of your knowledge  Mr Parry  Shave it more?  Keep it where we have it?  Mr Angell  You're coming perilously close to having no target at all Mr Keehn  Anybody else want to offer some comments on this subject? I will take silence as indicating at least that you are not more than 1/2 point away from the range in either direction I guess we have established a broad band  We will give Mr Kohn the last word Just refresh our collective minds, given your assumptions or Mr Kichline's assumptions What is the probable range in which M2 and M3 are likely to come in?  I think we can turn to what we have to decide this morning Before we do that I would open the floor for comments on the [economic] situation and outlook Mr Boehne  Mrs Horn  Mr Parry  Does that mean you get a high price for imports?  Import prices don't go up all that much What he is saying is that you get a big improvement  On that happy note we will hear from Mr Melzer  [The staff's forecast is] 28 percent, to be precise A few people were talking about housing starts; a housing starts figure came out this morning, which I am sure Mr Kichline can report to you  Mr Keehn  Are they investing more in Mexico?  We need a 95 percent depreciation in the Mexico peso!  Mr Forrestal  Mr Boykin  A little vignette in Texas is actually going  to try to export some steel to Japan That's a--  Mr Stern  Mr Black  Mr Guffey  Ms Seger  Who else wants to contribute to this?  [Unintelligible]  What does the staff have for the CPI?    12/15-16/86  And that's only assuming [an oil price] of $16; if it went to $18 it would be more  If you get that kind of a swing in energy isn't the implication, when you're talking about the consumer price index, that you must have other prices going lower relative to that?  Anybody else want to say anything? Let me ask a question If the nominal GNP were higher than you're projecting would you think that it's more likely to appear in prices or in real GNP? Before you answer that, I know what the models show that the prices will show up in 1990 and the real will show up right away I guess I'm really asking where the risks are and how confident you feel about this inflation forecast  And you're projecting, essentially, a few tenths per month average increase in the consumer price index with oil prices tilted slightly higher?  And the food price tilt--you've only got a 2 percent difference and maybe it should be bigger It probably will be, but I--  Your argument is that they go together?  Well, Mr Black raised an interesting question earlier about whether we should have an inflation target, more explicitly It's a big subject It's a nice question on how we can get the interest rate down Maybe we ought to reserve a little time next meeting for being a little more explicit in our discussion about what we really are satisfied with and what priority to give it Meanwhile, we will turn to Mr Kohn and then go to coffee  Given what you were talking about earlier regarding the various models for Ml and given the relative stability of interest rates--in fact there has been a very faint increase of an insignificant amount, but it has been stable for quite a long time-- why are you still showing a 12 percent rate of increase in Ml? Are the lags that long?  How long has it been since short-term rates--  And that's about the last time short-term rates went down  We haven't had a substantial increase in short-term market rates, since when--September?  And you're saying that the lag is more than six months?  I wonder what they are projecting for the first quarter?  What would they project for the second quarter, assuming unchanged interest rates?    12/15-16/86  Even then they don't get down to the [growth rate of] nominal GNP  A one-year lag?  We'll go and have a short lag for coffee  [Coffee break]  Well, after half of an afternoon and most of the morning we have to get to a decision Who would like to say something? We have a volunteer--Governor Johnson  Who would like to pitch in? Mr Parry  Mr Melzer  Mr Morris  Mr Forrestal  Mr Boehne  Mr Black  Mr Stern  Mr Keehn  -54-    12/15-16/86  Mr Guffey  You get to the heart of the matter Mr Angell  You want to be asymmetric?  Mrs Horn  Mr Corrigan  Mr Boykin  Governor Seger  You've got to break this pattern sometime!  Mr Heller you're last in line    12/15-16/86  "C" just for--  Well, we have unanimity for "B" Before we get to symmetries and asymmetries, let me see what that means I'm  happy with the language We certainly would say "maintain the existing degree of restraint This action is expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the period from November to March at" Well, I guess we have a choice we can say about 7 percent; we can say 6 to 7 percent; or I suppose we could say 6 to 8 percent What's your choice?  Is "about 7 percent" all right with people? "Respectively" is not needed if we say "at an annual rate of about 7 percent" I don't know what you want to do about this Ml statement It seems to me a bit vacuous to say the outlook for M1 remains subject to a great deal of uncertainty  However accurate It seems to me better that something be said in the [policy record] text rather than in the directive That's--  I have no objection to saying it at great length in the policy record or whatever we call it This is an operational directive  It's a matter of taste It just sounds odd to me to say in an operational directive that we have great uncertainty about Ml  Well, that's one thing to do just leave it out Or we could just say "growth in Ml will continue to be judged in the light of--  We could say "monitor" instead of "judge"  It seems to me a slightly more--I don't know--  "Viewed" or "appraised"?  "Appraised in the light of the behavior of M2 and the other factors mentioned below" Isn't that a little better maybe? Then we get to symmetric or asymmetric Let me try [unintelligible] greater support for the symmetric one I'm not sure I understand this comment about being released before the testimony and being symmetric What difference does that make?  Why is consistency a virtue in this case?  Precisely I think it will look good if the economy is a little soft or--  Oh, I agree that if the economy were weak this does reflect a little substance as to how quickly we would move It certainly is not a [big] difference If it turns out that we have moved by the time this is released, we'll look better if it's a little asymmetric  If we haven't, I am not sure it makes a lot of difference But I--  I'm a little bothered--I don't want to be too bothered--but if, in substance, we feel we want to be a little asymmetric I'm not sure I see any compelling reason not to say that if, in fact, we feel that way  While I think it's certainly true that nothing will have prevented us from doing it, I think this difference is not enormous It may just come down to a question that depends upon substantive views If we really think the [likely direction of policy] is significantly tilted I would think on general principle that we ought to say something in the interest of truth; and if it's not that clear then--  One thing that hasn't been mentioned--so let me just mention it for the record--is that in terms of flexibility of action I think the performance of the dollar makes it easier to ease slightly if otherwise we wanted to than if the dollar was not behaving Now, I'm not saying that dictates any action; I don't think it does But I think we ought to reflect that properly someplace in the record, though not with too much emphasis It could easily change, obviously, in many ways But at the moment it is one difficulty that is removed in making [an easing move] if we wanted to do so, as I say, for other reasons But I don't want to say this was too big a deal I would have some slight tendency, as I say, towards  -58-    12/15-16/86  easing language if we feel that way We have used asymmetric language lots of times to make this--  Well, I'll just give you my own reaction I don't think we need to talk about it theoretically because I would be very surprised if Germany reduced their discount rate any time during this relevant period I would say I don't see any need to, in your terms, "leap" If, in fact, the result was a significant strengthening in the dollar then I would think that might become a positive factor weighing in the balance toward some easing  I wouldn't put quite the same weight on the staff forecast It might move it in the direction that was counterproductive over time  All I'm saying is that it would put weight in that direction if the dollar actually moved It may not offset other things if it [unintelligible] but that's my own view on it  Subsidiary questions Well, you know this is not a federal case Gee, we've got a whole hour that we can--  Let me write it down here It took me some time to figure out how to spell it  I think a fair summary of the discussion-- I'm not talking about the directive now--would be that there was somewhat more emphasis on the risks of a shortfall in the early part of the year than the other Presumably, the directive will get interpreted in that light anyway, which [unintelligible] arguments It's no big deal if we put asymmetry in here so long as that's in the background discussion So I don't think this is a terribly great issue but we're pretty closely divided as to what to do  We could fool around with the "slightlys" and "somewhats" too We could have one "slightly" and the other "somewhat;" that would be a new way of doing it  Yes, that's what we usually do  We could say "slightly greater reserve restraint or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would"--  After all of this, is there any sense in saying "slightly greater reserve restraint or somewhat lesser reserve restraint might"? Either "might" or "would"--  I think "slightly" is better  That was an attempt at a compromise Do you have a better compromise?  But that's clearly symmetrical It's only the reservation in your mind that is in the first part of the sentence  I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but this testimony [issue] seems pretty irrelevant In the testimony I'll say whether we've changed policy or not  I didn't say we were going to change; I said we might In September we said we might tighten; in December we said we might ease  Oh, neither do I I only feel strongly that we've got to reach a conclusion next time And I would prefer a conclusion that satisfied the maximum number of people Does it appeal to anybody apart from Governor Johnson to say "slightly greater reserve restraint or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would"?  Could we just try it again? "Slightly greater reserve restraint or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would"  We could really make it asymmetric by leaving out the possibility of [greater reserve restraint], but that's probably too asymmetric  Well, is that acceptable?  Can I have a show of hands as to how acceptable "slightly greater or somewhat lesser would" is? There is    12/15-16/86  reluctance in some of those hands, but I see quite a few You need an expert to read that asymmetry  In the [policy record] discussion I think we can reflect the fact that there was more uncertainty on the down side and, given that, a little more possibility of easing  And we keep the 4 to 8 percent [range for the funds rate] There's nothing else that appears Does that capture things? It's maintain; about 7 percent; growth in M1 will continue to be appraised in the light of the behavior of M2 and M3 and the other factors cited below--which are the strength of the business expansion, developments in foreign exchange markets, progress against inflation, etc Okay? We will vote  MRBERNARD Chairman Volcker Yes Vice Chairman Corrigan Yes Governor Angell Yes President Guffey Yes Governor Heller Yes President Horn Yes Governor Johnson Yes President Melzer Yes President Morris Yes Governor Seger Yes  The meeting is concluded  END OF MEETING  -62-       [The minutes for the December meeting have been moved and seconded and are approved] without objection Now we will get our report on foreign currency operations out of the way  We ought to approve that and then go to the questions and answers  Without objection Now, let's turn to the discussion You recited all this and a lot of it sounded like ancient history History repeats itself about every 3 days  No other questions? There probably should be, because if we ever reach this great international understanding-- with or without a meeting--I presume there might be a lot more intervention  Meanwhile, the economy is doing less well  Closer, yes Close enough, I don't know Partly, I think, as a result of the election there is more pressure in Germany politically to do something Plus, the economy quite visibly is not doing so well seems very resistant to changing what the economy is doing in any short period of time; he is not exactly a fine tuner Nonetheless, he is bound to put somewhat more pressure on that side And I think the Japanese are more worried than they were These countries get really worried about their exchange rates but they sure don't move very fast to take what seem to be the necessary steps Actually, neither of them is going to do anything very dramatic What you hear talked about in both cases is    2/10-11/87  probably a tax reform program--fixing it up so there is some revenue loss over the next year  It depends upon what you think of the exchange rate anyway--whether there's a reasonable, potential equilibrium or not But obviously, it has implications for the conduct of monetary policy not just here but abroad  Three percent domestic demand is not much in terms of what we would like to see They'd have to get to five percent or something like that; four is better than three  They have all those great terms of trade in their favor That helps them to consume more, but they are not big consumers  Are there any more questions? If not, we will turn to the domestic report  Any questions?  I think we have institutionalized the borrowing number  There's some allowance for excess reserves when they are very abnormal, I suppose  If you look at it another way and measure it by the increase in the money supply it has been rather enormous  The funds rate has been where it has been because of a $27 billion increase in the money supply in three weeks  There were $2 billion of excess reserves that week  It puts us in a real dilemma How much do we think this demand for economic activity [unintelligible]? If we were under our old operating procedure, aiming for the money supply, the federal funds rate would have been 60 percent or 75 percent for a few days  How much can you identify this simple distribution of reserves that you have been talking about? We know the seasonal [unintelligible] Do you see appreciably less borrowing by banks under $1 billion or--?  Suppose you look at banks under $10 billion or so  Borrowing is less than it was a couple of years ago  Moreover, I wouldn't exaggerate the significance of this moving around one quarter of a percent or something like that    2/10-11/87  We are going to vote to ratify these transactions [Without objection] Mr Kichline  If anybody still remains wide awake, are there any questions? Or was the presentation so complete that no questions--?  Mr Parry  You are assuming a little increase in the saving rate in 1987  It's a difference between the annual average and--  Mr Forrestal  Mr Black  Governor Heller  Mr Keehn  Still, in those markets people will buy Do we have any more questions or comments? If not, I think we can go on to people discussing anything they want to lay out about the general view of the outlook and the potential risks therein [In the forecasts you submitted prior to this meeting] everybody is positive in a certain range, but there is considerable difference for some people Mr Parry isn't one of them; he agrees with the staff so his comments can be brief  Comment briefly on the outlook  It also has diminished some imports when you [unintelligible] to France The problem is your precise indication of the risks Let that be a model to others when they approach this thing  Just in terms of inflation, I meant to ask a question of you, [Mr Kichline] We have all of these GNP deflator projections; how much do you have to add to that, roughly, to get a consumer price index projection?  Mr Boehne  Mr Morris  Mr Melzer  If the relationship is the same as the staff's, your kind of price [forecast] would have to produce about a 5 percent CPI Mr Forrestal  Mr Stern  If I am right that an inflation rate of 4 percent in the GNP deflator means something close to 5 percent on the CPI--and that is the middle of the range--your number means the CPI could be over 5 percent  A turning point--  I wasn't saying it couldn't happen I just wanted to talk about it Mr Keehn  Mr Black  Not much of a risk Mr Corrigan  How are the Japanese talking now?  That is where the Germans are It's not very exciting  A terrible beating by Japanese standards  Mr Boykin  Well, Mr Angell, is going to tell us how good the inflation outlook is  Relatively worse  You are paid for worrying Mr Heller  -23-    2/10-11/87  Spoken like the private sector fellows  Ms Seger  Mr Guffey  Well, I got your name on a piece of paper and I will delete it if you don't want to say anything  -25-    2/10-11/87  I agree with you I am willing to explain something about the forecast--up to 39 percent When it gets above 4 percent, it may get a little difficult to explain  Governor Johnson, a benediction here  We will have somebody look into this over night  Well, I don't think we have to resolve this right now  If they can ever fill out their W-4 forms  That ends today's session  [Meeting recessed]  -27-    2/10-11/87  February 11, 1987--Morning Session  We can proceed with Mr Kohn this morning and discuss the long-run ranges  I think we probably ought to turn to M2 and M3 first and see whether we can resolve those But I have one question, just to isolate it, on M1 If I understand correctly, you're saying it's a matter of judgment but, for what it's worth, you're reluctant to say that growth would be less than 10 percent for M1; however, the model shows half of that  You just don't believe your models  Yes, but growth greatly exceeded what they said for last year Is that before or after the actual declines in interest rates that took place last year?  And that model shows what for next year?  We will return to M1, but it's more productive to look at M2 and M3 first as we did last time Does anybody want to say something about M2 and M3?  Governor Angell  Mr Boehne  Mr Forrestal  Mr Parry  Would you? Which way did you have this? The 5-1/2 percent would be for what?  -29-    2/10-11/87  M2 at 5 to 8  Let me just pin that down I read the opposite someplace--maybe you had it--that M3 would grow less than M2  This is between models and judgment Governor Heller  Mr Keehn  Mr Black  Mr Melzer  Mr Morris  You can still put money in an IRA for last year, can't you?  I don't see why it should affect this year much; it may affect 1988  Mr Boykin  Ms Seger  Mr Stern  Mr Guffey  Like M1  Mr Hendricks, do you have something to add from Cleveland?  Well, we seem to have great unanimity I, personally, could make a case for alternative III I thought the Bluebook set that out rather convincingly but I won't make the case Alternative II is obviously the easy thing to do; it's a nice compromise I interpret this to mean, without being very rigid about it, that we expect growth to be someplace in the middle of the range; this time it's a target set reasonably symmetrically around where growth should be  Let us turn to M1 with this caveat--that if we wanted something like variant I [in the Bluebook], which I think has some informational content, I'm not crazy about the particular language proposed I think it needs a little work, and I'm a little reluctant to rewrite it in detail right now rather than during the break I  -32-    2/10-11/87  haven't got another proposal to put in front of you, if we end up with that one I'm making an assumption that we're going to end up there, which may be wrong I think we ought to discuss it But if we think something like variant I is correct I would just defer final consideration until we get some possible modification to the language in front of us It would be along these lines, but not precisely this language I may be wrong about whether that's where we'll want to end up, but let's see We're open for discussion on M1  Well, after all--  That would be the part in the first bracket or something?  That's all you would say?  All what other stuff?  Yes, I have great doubts about that Mr Morris, we'll let you talk  In general, you like the kind of language that's in variant I?  Let me just make the case for this because, as I obviously indicated earlier, this is the way I'm leaning I think we ought to take M1 seriously in a sense--in a certain economic context that isn't fully predictable--and we ought to tell people that We can't be very precise about the numbers But I think it is saying something We could say If inflation is building up or the dollar is very weak we would expect M1 to be quite low and that would be appropriate In other circumstances, we would expect it to be quite high without getting worried about it That is saying something We ought to try to say something about it and if muddies the waters-- It seems to me that to suggest some normality over a very wide range doesn't mean much  Well, one way of putting it is that we would expect velocity to rise under certain circumstances or we might even force it to rise, in a sense, and that would be entirely appropriate What we really want to say is You shouldn't be surprised by a low M1 number; on the other hand, we wouldn't get concerned in certain circumstances about it remaining high I'm not sure what sticking a number in there that we don't know much about adds to that We end up with a range so wide that it's meaningless What we really want to say is that we think a low number would be appropriate under certain circumstances and we think a high number would be appropriate under other circumstances But we've got to describe the circumstances in which that would be true It gets complicated, and that's what makes writing the precise words difficult But I think that's the sense of what we ought to say  Well, I think we could say that more generally It's hard to put it in the directive I think we could put in a sentence later on I don't know what we would say because I have some sympathy for Mr Morris' point that if it's going to be very interest-rate sensitive we're always going to be saying that it's going to be high or low depending upon the trend in interest rates And I'm not sure what that's saying I guess the point we ought to make is--we can't put this all in the directive but we could put it in the other discussion--that we have a much more highly interest- sensitive aggregate here And the message we ought to be emphasizing is that, depending upon circumstances, M1 might vary widely into the extended future based upon what we know now  That is part of my concern We may well run into such a period whether it is this year or not But we're [not] going to want people jumping off wildly if M1 is very low for a while because it might be entirely the reflex of what we've had in the past and be entirely appropriate On the other hand, I don't want to give Mr Proxmire too many hostages--just to name one, that we think it's a disaster that it has been as high as it has been under the particular circumstances that have prevailed to date  That's the way I see it I just don't see that you add much by putting in a figure which could be exceeded in either direction from an already large range  I'm not arguing that the difference is huge This is an extreme example, but suppose we really thought the situation was such that inflationary forces were picking up, the economy was at the high end of all the ranges of projected growth, and the dollar was weak--we put in all these assumptions--and M1 really  -35-    2/10-11/87  came out very low for a few months, anyway I'm not sure I want people hollering at me that we have a range that is 4 to 9 percent or something and the middle of that is 6-1/2 percent and M1 is only coming in at 4 percent and saying oh my heavens [policy is] way too tight! Because I'm not sure it would be way too tight  Well, does somebody else want to add to this? Mr Melzer  Boy, 7 to 13 percent sounds to me--and this is part of the problem--wildly high in terms of sending out a message right now It may not turn out to be  That is precisely the trouble If we talk about a range that high I don't know what we can say We have a problem with what we say if we use something like variant I It could be misinterpreted; I have no doubt about that A lot depends upon what we say My own gut feeling is that, ideally, by putting it in a more realistic context we're putting more weight on M1 than by putting out a target like 7 to 13 percent and saying it may go below it or above it  But 7 to 13 percent doesn't give that message to me  That's my point  You have expressed my gut feeling I think that we send a better substantive message without a number--and we don't know what the number means anyway  Well, I don't interpret it that way Given all the difficulties of explaining this, that is not my feeling Unfortunately, the fact of the matter is that we are in a situation where we can't interpret M1 in terms of anything like an appropriate growth rate So we're going to be very vague anyway  We can't evaluate M1 without taking account of what's going on elsewhere, and that's what we ought to be telling people We want to take it into account but only in the context of specific economic circumstances And that's what we ought to be trying to tell them  Exactly  I think it's quite specific What I think we ought to be able to say when we are attacked [and accused of] being wildly expansionary now and building up inflationary pressures and all the rest, is Look, [we will act] if we see evidence that that's true, which we haven't seen heretofore with the weights, trends, and a lot of other things But we recognize all those dangers We agree with you that we couldn't keep feeding out M1 like this and we ought to be prepared, and you ought to be prepared, to see M1 level off rather abruptly under those circumstances We contemplate that under that particular set of circumstances On the other hand, if there are no inflationary pressures, and the economy is weak, and we haven't got any particular dollar problem, and we have not seen the dangers of this kind, and M2 and M3 are behaving all right, then we don't think your criticism that we're unduly easy is valid  Yes I think we have to be quite careful about how we put it in there--that's why I have some quibbles about this language here--but that's what I want to convey  Well, a lot depends upon the language that we use in the testimony and so forth I would see at least as much  -39-    2/10-11/87  danger there It will be delicate to write it I could easily write this in a way that locked us in more than we might want to be locked in to a lowering of M1 if we saw any sign of increasing inflationary pressures I don't want us to be locked in too much either  I think people have to be warned My principal concern is that we should warn them that under those circumstances, which may or may not eventually occur, we expect a pretty low Ml  Sure  I visualize, in just describing policy as the year progresses, that if we put in some range, we'd be stumbling all over ourselves to say there's a range but it doesn't mean anything under certain circumstances I don't think that does us any good  Yes, I don't think that would exclude that at all I haven't thought about that, but I think that's right--that in particular circumstances as the year progresses we might want to stick in an M1 target And I think we can even say that  I'm not saying that I can't anticipate the situation in which we would do that, but--  But I think we can certainly say that in certain circumstances we might, in the short run, name a target for M1  Operationally, I don't think it has to be interpreted that way  I don't think we're going to move to 20 percent, but I can visualize a circumstance--suppose M1 were rising rapidly and some of these were moderating at a time when we were increasingly worried about inflation and saw some signs of the economy doing pretty well and, say, we wanted to tighten up In that context I could well see a change in the particular arrangement we're doing  -41-    2/10-11/87  In the Committee's operating directive presumably we'd say we're putting more pressure on reserve positions and the Committee is looking toward a slowdown in the rate of growth of M1 I can quite see that  Well, we might want to say the Committee is looking toward a slowdown to no more than [unintelligible], if we felt strongly enough in a particular circumstance There's some variance between putting in 7 percent or 5 percent or something and saying we're looking for a clear slowdown And all those [options] are open to us  We welcome the slowdown in M1 under the circumstances  Does somebody else want to add to this discussion?  I think you're overstating it a bit In precise terms, I agree with you But I think we do have a sense that it's very interest sensitive  -42-    2/10-11/87  The trouble is there are too many "ifs" I agree, but I think all we can do is give some sense--  We're going to have at least three variables and, fortunately, they're not all likely to be moving in the same direction We have growth, inflation and inflation expectations, and the dollar And it leaves us open to all kinds of questions If growth is weak but inflation is strong and the dollar is mixed, what do you do? Those questions are just unanswerable  Let me say if we don't set a figure, presumably we will say, in some words, that we're not going to establish a range for the year as a whole at this time--which is what this says Probably some general language that we expect it to be lower this year than last year is appropriate And then we give some clear flavor about the conditions in which we would expect it to be either high or low without being definitive about it Those are the essentials we want to get in this paragraph  And at a particular time during the year, the implication is that we may specify a target Those four thoughts somehow we should get in the paragraph I know that's pretty vague We'll come back with [specific] language; I think it needs a little massaging Is that acceptable, generally?  Yes, that point would be made The context in which rapid or slow growth would be appropriate would depend upon the other aggregates  You can get but so many in the paragraph  I would say "should be" That's one of my language changes here not just passively "could" but "should"  Oh yes, I think that's clearly the case  Well, it has that flavor But, as I see it, it's more operational than setting out a target that we don't know whether we should exceed or undershoot In my view, I am trying to make it operational  That's right As I see it, we face just the mere fact of complexity here Now we look upon M1 differently depending upon what's happening That's what we have to try to describe And it is operational; it's not operational in a 2 percent range or something because we don't know that much about it But we're pretty clear that we want it low under certain conditions or high under certain other conditions If there are no violent objections to that, why don't we move on We have to try and write this in a way that's precisely acceptable But if we assume that that is the framework in which we will modify or fool around with this language a bit, we'll try to fool around with it That's better than sitting around the table doing it, in my opinion Somebody's got to be a draftsman, namely me I'll try to get something typed up and you can look at it after the break But why don't we pass on I will assume that the M2 and M3 targets are going to be those in alternative II with the surrounding language saying that we think these are reasonable targets and the midpoints are appropriate I think that temporarily closes the long-term ranges to which we will return Let's turn to the short-term ranges Mr Kohn, do you have something to say about the short term?  I will only comment that when I look at this, we are now in the middle of February and so little of what happens between November and March depends upon what we do now That raises a little question in my mind about whether it's appropriate and whether it's conveying much information to stress these objectives in terms of a November-to-March period that included all this very exceptional stuff at year-end Maybe we want to say something about M1, at least in terms of its direction, given that enormous bulge over the year-end With the completely neutral statement that we have in the directive now, in line with the conversation we just had, I don't think we can be very precise I don't know; it would be totally unconventional, but maybe this is the time we want to have a forward- looking range for M2 and M3 rather than one that encompasses almost 2- 1/2 or 3 months of history and only a month and a half that is forward looking  Or else even make it--  Yes  We could almost put it as the second- quarter objective or February to June or something I don't know  I don't know; the thought just occurred to me But, is it so bad saying the first half of the year? Obviously,  -45-    2/10-11/87  we can review that again, but right now that's what we're saying is consistent with our stated objectives for the year as a whole  Well, I've been sitting on the side of being against altering it in the past from a quarterly period, although we do that now infrequently We would do it this time if we--  Oh, no We could do it from January to April but that's unorthodox, too, in getting in the middle of a quarter  It's kind of unorthodox, but in some ways it makes more sense than using November as a base in this particular case  Let me approach it differently Let's discuss what we actually want to do in terms of reserve pressures  The other way?  Well, maybe we don't have to go around the table Is that the [consensus]?  I just want to be clear You started out by saying that you came into the meeting thinking maybe we ought to tighten up a little; it sounds to me like you are ending up there, too  The difference, I suspect, between what you say, which is very eloquent, and what others have said, by implication, is that right at this moment in time the short-run business situation is not all that clear It could turn south on us and [some feel that] we better wait a little while before  -48-    2/10-11/87  [tightening] You are quite persuasive; but it's a question of moving now or waiting for some more confirmation of the business situation over the next few weeks  Our asymmetric language  I am not sure that is going to make a lot of difference because in this particular instance I will be testifying  No But de facto I do, yes  Now, there may be a little confusion because they are being released on Friday and I don't testify until  -49-    2/10-11/87  next Thursday I don't think that's bad if, in fact, we decide not to change anything between now and the time I testify But the testimony--  I would guess, given where the funds rate is and so forth, that they will simply assume that we didn't do anything, which is correct And I would confirm that, but I would add some warning language about the future  Well, we have one point of view expressed And we have other points of view expressed Does anybody have any other point of view?  A more modest way of stating that is just that we don't lean over backwards simply to get the federal funds rate below 6 percent again, I'd say  I think where the funds rate goes will be dominated by the expectations in these very short-run circumstances If we got some weak business news and the expectations turned toward more easing, the federal funds rate could easily go below 6 percent If the markets don't have that expectation, then it probably wouldn't If they have the expectation that, if anything, we would tighten up, the federal funds rate probably would stay higher  Well, I think we are pretty close I think we ought to look at this If nobody else has anything to add to this discussion, why don't we turn to the language and how we want to phrase it I assume that the prevailing view is not to change the [stance] anyway, which will be reflected immediately in this first sentence, but to be asymmetric I am not saying there's unanimous agreement for that, but I sense that's where the central tendency is In that case, I presume that we would simply say maintain in the first sentence I am eliminating nuances now, which we can return to when we return to this question of how we express it What projection do you have for M2 and M3 if we began in January and went through April?  It would be 7 percent for both?  Well, that gives us one alternative--I am not sure that this is the way we want to say it--but if we wanted to say January to April, we would say we expected the growth of M2 and M3 over the period from January to April to be at annual rates of 6 to 7 percent  I don't think we ever make it wider than that  -51-    2/10-11/87  Well, it's unusual and I would resist it ordinarily on the basis that we normally use quarters, but that great distortion at year-end--  It looks like the only way we could really get rid of that distortion is to use February as the base, but I--  Well, you use one month  That's the argument for saying January to June or something  January to March gives you what kind of a number?  Those numbers were 6 percent and 6-1/2 percent?  What about February and March?  I am sorry what are you projecting for February and March?  It sounds like we say 6 to 7 percent, whatever months we pick  Well, I don't think it makes a lot of difference I guess somebody might argue that nothing we are going to do now is going to affect February or March anyway That's the argument for going through June, but I--  I don't think it makes a great deal of difference Do you want to say from January through March? The real choice, as I see it, is to say January through March or January through June We could say April, but there's a seasonal problem in April  The seasonal adjustment factors are supposed to take care of the seasonality, but I guess what you are saying is that it's very uncertain It could be high or low  April is just an uncertain month But the numbers are going to be the same anyway Do we want to say January to March, January to April, or January to June?  Through March  -53-    2/10-11/87  Is that what we want to say?  The preference is to say January to March, 6 to 7 percent? We don't need the "respectively;" the range covers both of them Now what do we say about M1? I think with respect to M1 we ought to say something It's very easy to say that in the current circumstances we expect it to slow from the extraordinary rates of recent months Maybe that's it simply say that growth in M1 should slow from the extraordinary rates of recent months--period  We expect it to slow appreciably from the high rate of recent months, or of earlier months Is there anything else anybody wants to say about M1? "Appreciably" or "substantially"? Decrease substantially from the rate of growth of 30 percent  Growth in M1 is [unintelligible] We probably should say "substantially," it's so high Does anybody have anything to add about M1? Then we fiddle around with--  "Somewhat greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might"? Does that do it?  "Somewhat greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable"  It's perfectly reasonable to discuss that I don't think we have ever done that Or have we?  The way I wrote this, the language has two asymmetrical words one is "somewhat" as opposed to "slightly;" and the other is "would" as opposed to "might"  Does anybody have any further comments? I take your silence as saying double nuance asymmetry is about right  Well, let me assume 4 to 8 percent down in the federal funds range clause Is there anything else in this language? It would then read In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from January through March at annual rates of about 6 to 7 percent Growth in M1 is expected to slow substantially from the high rate of earlier months Somewhat greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable depending on the behavior of the aggregates, taking into account, etc Then 4 to 8 percent [on the range for the federal funds rate] Any other comment? If not, we can vote on this one and adjourn while we work on the language of the other one When we turn to the long term, this is highly consistent with what we would be saying in the long run Ready to vote? If so, we will vote  Okay Let's [break and come] back on the [long-run]  [Coffee break]  Let me just describe the market today We won't discuss this but the federal funds rate is 6-5/16 percent and we anticipate 6-5/8 percent Oh! Now it is at 6-5/8 percent, not 6-5/16 percent, despite the fact that, according to the estimate, we are running $500 million or $600 million over target in providing reserves So we decided to do nothing Unless there is a wild reserves miss, we will end up way over target with a high federal funds rate, at least until the 7th  Well, if the federal funds rate doesn't come way down this afternoon there really is something screwy  Well, I think that's putting it in a more permanent or long-range context than he, or really his staff, would admit There is, obviously, discussion about some agreement You see something in the paper every day about his being more forthcoming about saying he is relatively content with the broad range [of exchange rates] currently prevailing and there ought to be a willingness to--I will say "defend" but that may be too strong a word --to engage in joint and reciprocal actions in the markets That obviously, as I mentioned yesterday, has implications beyond just what has been mentioned, if one really believed it [It would] demonstrate that we are altogether content with the broad present range of exchange rates depending upon reasonable satisfaction that the other countries will do something to grow  No, no But having taken that step, obviously it is consistent with and will be read by many, anyway, as a step toward something more permanent Whether they are called targets or some levels of resistance, the word would be "resistance" There won't be any formal expression of that kind but, obviously, there won't be a lot of speculation This is a step, at the very least, in that direction Indeed, I think it is a tentative step in that direction without any sense of commitment  Then there will be [unintelligible]! One of the problems, I think we ought to remind ourselves, is that there is a rather broad range--a much broader range than the currency markets will be probing for in the short run So there is lots of room for misunderstanding One of the problems is that without making a commitment--even to discourage a loose arrangement--it becomes more difficult in the short run because people want to make payments You get caught unless you're willing to make a full-blooded commitment The French might be willing to but I don't think anybody else is willing to [unintelligible]  I don't think they did right at first because they thought it was the Japanese But they do have the impression that we intervened [unintelligible] They assume that there was some  Oh, the Japanese said so! I forgot that  Well, that is the kind of thing they would look for, but the problem that I foresee is that that intervention took place well above where I would conceive the lower part of any broad range would be I am not saying there is anything the matter with it; I think it is fine But we don't want the market to think we are defending 152 yen per dollar, or something, with our life's blood if we are not, and then have market participants greatly disappointed when they see the exchange rate go above that In my mind it's a very tricky, psychological, thing I have no problems with what they are trying to do but it is a very tricky problem, operationally--that the market doesn't read much more into ranges or zones, whatever you call them, than anybody has in mind  The trouble is that we are in a range where that is debatable It is just a question of whether you say 150 is the limit, which implies that on the other side--assuming you retain the concept of a broad range--you probably wouldn't mind if it was at 170  Whether you wanted it that high [unintelligible] Personally, I think 150 is fine, but I don't want to make that the absolute low point, probably because I wouldn't want to see it go all the way to 170 But I don't want to get caught with 150 to 155 or something like that  -57-    2/10-11/87  That still seems to me to be pretty narrow I suppose substantively it may be all right But it is narrow and when people talk about these, even on [unintelligible] I don't want to get trapped into thinking something narrow  Even if there is a judgmental agreement to this kind of thing, it is still a good idea to argue about where the range should be set  I think it is very much a condition in Mr Baker's mind for both substantive and symbolic reasons But I think there is a real question as to what they would do, in fact, that would make much difference Our talking in terms of concerted action against the background that their economic outlook seems to be deteriorating--  It certainly would be in the context of this  I don't know what the Japanese did I think one of their problems before was [unintelligible] as much as they did, but their savings deposit rates are close to zero now I know they were close to zero before they reduced the discount rate last time I don't know what happened after they reduced it That's the big savings vehicle for Japanese citizens as opposed to people with access to the money markets They may be [unintelligible] but there are some very close to zero and some deposits may have--  I think they have a variety of rates  -58-    2/10-11/87  Just as a technical matter, where is this paragraph we are talking about inserting to be placed--before or after the discussion of the broader aggregates?  So you have this paragraph above stating that the FOMC seeks all these things  Then "In furtherance of these objectives the Committee established growth ranges of--" What are we talking about, 6-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent?  5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for both M2 and M3 Total nonfinancial debt was set at what?  8 to 11 percent, the same as for 1987 With respect to M1, why don't we take a minute to peruse this? I don't argue that it is a literary masterpiece  Why don't we just give everybody a chance [to read this] Have you all had a chance to get some flavor of it?  Obviously Oh, I--  -59-    2/10-11/87  Of course, that is the problem I was about to say that it is easier to list when all those things are going in the same direction than when you have some going in one direction and some going in another direction I was just going to summarize our discussion in terms of the broad message we are trying to give The message I would try to give is It is not that M1 is meaningless, but that it can only be evaluated in the context of the surrounding circumstances I can't read my own writing It is not meaningless; it can only be evaluated in the context of the surrounding circumstances That can't be a mechanical judgment but rather a qualitative judgment [Unintelligible] enter into the qualitative judgment We can [not] get a formula that can take all four of these factors and weigh one 20 percent and the other 32 percent  I don't think you can quite say "or" because we are not saying that any one of these factors is going to--  Now, what was this other suggestion rather than "or"?  Accumulating signs  Without repeating the words "in the context"  It was meant to encompass it, but this get's [complicated] Suppose we said "Much slower monetary growth will be appropriate in the context of continuing economic expansion accompanied by"  There is something the matter here as I see this; something is garbled "In that connection the Committee believes, particularly in light of the extraordinary expansion of etc, much slower monetary growth would be appropriate in the context of continuing economic expansion accompanied by signs of intensifying, strong growth in this aggregate in recent years" That doesn't belong there The whole thing is crazy  -61-    2/10-11/87  Maybe I have two different pages, because mine doesn't read right  I've got the wrong first page That's what's wrong "In that connection, the Committee believes etc Much slower monetary growth would be appropriate in the context of continuing economic expansion"  We can't cover every contingency here, but I can imagine that if the price pressures or some of the other things were bad enough we might have to tighten up even if the economic growth didn't look very satisfactory But it is just impossible to cover every combination of circumstances here  Oh, it limits you!  Say "continuing economic expansion" We've got a choice here If we just leave it "and" it seems to me we are giving a pretty clear unambiguous signal that we would tighten under all these circumstances If we begin saying "such as" or "or," which is better in some respects, it is also vaguer  Well, I put a "significant" in  I don't know that it is perfect now It reads "Much slower monetary growth would be appropriate in the context of continuing economic expansion accompanied by signs of intensifying price pressures, relatively strong growth in the broad monetary aggregates, and significant weakness of the dollar in exchange markets"  No, I said "and"  Another way of doing it is to say "signs of intensifying price pressures, perhaps related to significant weakness of the dollar in exchange markets and relatively strong growth in the broad monetary aggregates"  SPEAKER(?) That's how I would like it  SEVERAL Yes  "Perhaps related to" I didn't want to say that is the only source of--  Anybody want to focus on any other sentences?  It is a minor point, but why would you want "appropriate" in there? Let's have some sense of we are going to evaluate whether we are going to have a short-run target for M1, which implies some appropriateness  Yes, so I changed that to "the appropriateness of changes" I made just a couple of errors reading it; it reads a little more smoothly This is only changing clauses "With respect to M1 the Committee recognized that, based on experience, the behavior of that aggregate and appropriate growth must be judged in the light of other evidence with respect to economic activity and prices; fluctuations in M1 have become much more sensitive in recent years to changes in interest rates among other factors" Put "among other factors" at the end of the sentence Then start the next sentence by saying "During 1987 the Committee anticipates that growth in M1 should slow" [Unintelligible] in the next sentence We're just trying to avoid repetition  That makes it much more explicit I don't know if that is desirable or not since we always miss these short-term target ranges I mean to hint at that, but I don't know what the advantage is of being absolutely explicit I don't know if there is anything inconsistent with it--  Rule out M1 It has no role any more  It is not the appropriate role of M1; it would be the appropriate role of M1 in our decision-making  It does sound like what we been saying; I guess I put that on the other side of the ledger There is no difference in some respect from what we've said before Well, I am sure this isn't perfect but I am struck with the fact that it is cumbersome enough That last sentence is certainly repetitious but I don't know if it hurts anything, with the last sentence in the first paragraph We could use another word than evaluate, but I don't know what  [Unintelligible]  What he is saying, I guess, is that he doesn't want all that sizable an increase in M1, if we have some growth and the dollar is very weak  You can say "continuing sizable increases in M1 could be accommodated in circumstances characterized by sluggish business activity, maintenance of progress toward underlying price stability, and international stability," or something vague like that  And "progress toward international equilibrium" How about that?  That brings in the trade balance as well as the dollar  I am a little worried about the repetitiousness of these two sentences Maybe it doesn't hurt anything I suppose this implies that the Committee in reaching operational decisions during the year might target appropriate growth in--  We'll only know it in the light of the circumstances then prevailing Does that sound better to people?  SPEAKER(?) Yes  SPEAKER(?) It does to me  Maybe I better read the whole thing while we are having our last thoughts here This would follow the rather conventional paragraph, to say the least, regarding the 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for growth in M2 and M3 and 8 to 11 percent for the debt Then it goes on to say "With respect to M1 the Committee recognized that, based upon experience, the behavior of that aggregate and its appropriate growth must be judged in the light of other"-- I'm just stumbling here, and I wonder whether we need the behavior of that aggregate and its appropriate growth Why don't we just say "With respect to M1, the Committee recognized that, based on experience, the behavior of that aggregate must be judged in the light of other evidence with respect to economic activity and prices; fluctuations in M1 have become much more sensitive in recent years to changes in interest rates, among other factors During 1987 the Committee anticipates that growth in M1 should slow However, in the light of its sensitivity to a variety of influences, the Committee decided not to establish a precise target for its growth over the year as a whole at this time Instead, the appropriateness of changes in M1 during the course of the year will be evaluated in the light of the behavior of its velocity, developments in the economy and financial markets, and the nature of emerging price pressures" If I can make an editorial comment, I wrote this "the nature of emerging price pressures" rather than "emerging price pressures" because we all concede that there are likely to be some emerging price pressures that we have already taken into account "In that connection, the Committee believes that, particularly in the light of the extraordinary expansion of this aggregate in recent years, much slower monetary growth would be appropriate in the context of continuing economic expansion accompanied by signs of intensifying price pressures, perhaps related to significant weakness of the dollar in exchange markets, and relatively strong growth in the broad monetary aggregates Conversely, continuing sizable increases in M1 could be accommodated in circumstances surrounded by sluggish business activity, maintenance of progress toward underlying price stability, and progress toward international equilibrium As this implies, the  -66-    2/10-11/87  Committee in reaching operational decisions during the year, might target appropriate growth in M1 from time to time in the light of circumstances then prevailing, including the rate of growth of the broader aggregates"  I hope you people are satisfied on the other side there There is no other--we have a consensus on the other paragraph  Well, I am just thinking out loud--we might say, as you just noted, that we have had a fairly liberal monitoring range for this variable It has exceeded the range; this year we really expect it to be within this range that we are talking about and we would be increasingly disturbed--  I guess what we would do is tighten up  If you look at it on the basis of market values it doesn't look bad; if you look at it on the basis of balance sheets it looks pretty awful  I suppose nobody is saying that this is going to be our single judge, but I think it does lend some weight to our tightening I would be very happy if we said something like that  If we have exploding monetary aggregates  That is what we are doing anyway, in some sense It doesn't have any operational significance  But not by that much; the basic incentive is still there It is now less than it was  Yes, but you can't use that I have been carrying on that campaign in a not very effective way for some time But I suppose your concern about it is more the corporate debt; that is one area You have made your point I don't know how operational it is  If there are no other points to be raised, I guess we can vote  You can always send in revisions of your projections You are strongly encouraged, if you are so minded, to get them in and get them here in a hurry so they can be [incorporated in the group] projections  END OF MEETING  -69-       We have to elect officers first of all  We have a second Do we have any objections? If not, I won't commit any time We have a list [of proposed officers] I guess you want the names on the list Will somebody read it?  Do I have a motion to vote?  SPEAKER(?) I so move  SPEAKER(?) Second  Do I have objections? We have the question of the New York Bank as agent Nomination or objection?  If you would like to suggest it, yes You will take the burden of suggestion  We have two Managers, both of whom I think are so able bodied and sitting here Do we have a nomination?    3/31/87  Any objection? The Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations has been distributed to you Do we need to formally readopt this? Do I have a motion?  Do we have any objection? Next are the Foreign Currency Authorization, Foreign Currency Directive and Procedural Instructions Do you have a problem with these, Mr Cross, or what?  That doesn't appear anyplace in this  Well, if I understand it correctly, the only formal limit is that $10 billion limit  [Unintelligible] enough yen so that we are going to be comfortable within it, but I don't know about one-way [unintelligible] We were up to $9 billion, but now--  I myself don't see any problem if we want to raise them further, say, to $12 billion, and consider that informal We don't vote on it, I guess  $7 billion is what you are saying?  The issue we formally have to vote on is the overall limit, for which you are suggesting $11 billion Governor Angell, I guess, is suggesting $12 billion  Assumed under that would be an understanding that marks could go at least to $8 billion, if I may reword it that way, under that $12 billion Do you want to go to $12 billion? Does somebody want to make a motion to go to $12 billion?  If there are no objections to that, we will change the overall limit to $12 billion, with the informal understanding that mark balances could go to $8 billion What's the informal understanding on yen now? I realize that you are going in the other direction on yen now  Okay, returning to the agenda--  We have to approve the minutes Can I have a motion?  Any objections? Mr Cross' report  And it's almost like [unintelligible] a mistake  Not very well managed float  Well, we just approved the directive and I am a little hesitant to raise it, but I guess we can It has been a while since I looked at this, but I take comfort in that it says "shall be generally directed at countering disorderly monetary conditions" It talks about behavior consistent with Article IV  Well, I don't know whether it does or it doesn't I guess we are going to be hard pressed to make up other language Maybe somebody can look at it  I don't think we can do it sitting around this table right now I designate Mr Cross to look at this and see if he comes up with any better ideas  We still have about a billion dollars in current market value?  We together?  [Unintelligible]  Well, if there is no other discussion, we will turn to--  We have to approve the operations [Moved and approved]  Mr Sternlight  Comments or questions?  Mr Kichline  I forgot to ask you to ratify the domestic operations Would you like to ratify those?  If there's no objection, we can discuss the business outlook  SPEAKER(?) Jim, I have a question Inventory investment is clearly an important component of your forecast, especially in the first quarter of this year One thing that struck me in terms of your forecast is the forecast of negative changes in farming inventories over a 9-quarter period which is clearly unprecedented in the postwar period I wonder what you had in mind in assuming decumulation in the farm sector over that length of time  What is the automatic offset?  I understand that But suppose the external side did not improve because business was so weak abroad?  What products are we putting these tariffs on, presumably?  [I didn't] see the list; it sounded like a lot more than the $300 million they talk about  Two percent for Germany when you have--  Domestic demand doesn't look so bad compared to the GNP You couldn't call that great in absolute terms, considering what their potential is Are there other comments on the business scene here?  Of a more general nature  What is Kentucky windage?  That's all a very precise science; now I am really confused Mr Morris  Mr Parry  Mr Keehn  Mr Boehne  Mr Forrestal  Mr Melzer  Mr Guffey  Mr Stern  We will hasten to Mr Boykin  Mr Black  Mr Hendricks  Governor Heller  Governor Angell  Governor Johnson  Governor Seger  Mr Kohn, can you be fast?  I think we can proceed and decide what to do I don't think this is the simplest situation we have ever been in The course of action in one way seems pretty obvious But whether that is really satisfactory to the situation, the answer is probably no Things are not under our control I'd say our decision is easy in one sense It is a little hard for me to see, in listening  -29-    3/31/87  to what everybody has said, that we would want to move importantly in one direction or another from where we have been just in terms of the business outlook and ordinary domestic criteria I guess the question is Under what conditions would we want to move at all significantly? The aggregates are coming in low, which can't upset me after a year or 18 months of coming in high I don't see that as a strong reason for easing, for a fair amount of time anyway That leaves us with the question of the dollar and the international situation and all those related concerns that have been discussed, which are very difficult issues Obviously, they are by their nature a multilateral concern as well as our concern I would just note in that connection that the G-10 meets next week [Unintelligible] for all those numbers we ought to extract great wisdom out of the meetings next week I wouldn't count on that but there is an opportunity for a closer discussion with our major trading partners next week [We could provide] some sense of what we might think is useful in terms of entering into those discussions Who wants to say something?  I am beginning to worry about that when I look at this, too Let me just interject a comment As I said, I don't see any reasons to change strongly I am thinking about it in terms of borrowings right at the moment It was implicit in what I said that if the aggregates continue to come in below 6 percent--or 69 percent, or whatever the staff has here--I wouldn't see that as a strong signal for easing at this point I don't know whether those aggregates are too high or whether the staff always judges them absolutely correctly  Well, who knows what they are But I don't think that is the crucial variable for this period  Just for purposes of clarification If I understand you correctly, you are saying do nothing now but be prepared to raise borrowing if the exchange market comes under still more pressure  You're saying do nothing today, if I understand you correctly  I don't mean today; I mean on borrowing  Mr Black  Mr Melzer  For what it's worth, just to bring you up to date, Mr Kohn tells me that the March figure is likely to be a little lower than what's been indicated to you--by more than a percent, I guess, for M1  Mr Parry  Mr Guffey  Mr Forrestal  Governor Angell  3 to 7 percent range?  Okay You just made that up, I guess?  3 to 7 percent is what you're thinking of for M2 and M3?  M2 and M1?  Governor Heller  Mr Morris  Mr Stern  Mr Boykin  -36-    3/31/87  Mr Keehn  It has moved down, I guess So, before you make your case, the federal funds rate has come down since this morning  Still, I didn't know what you were referring to  Okay, I just wanted to make sure that you were--  Mr Boehne  Governor Johnson  So far it's getting weaker by the minute  Where is the exchange rate?  Just a little longer and we can get it down to 145  Mr Hendricks  We have exhausted my list Ms Seger  Well, let me raise a few questions about the directive I don't think we'll solve all these problems by the directive I'm not sure the traditional type of directive at all meets the current circumstances, but let me assume it does By saying "maintain the existing degree," that "maintain" may be for a very brief period of time in some people's views Suppose we really did something radical--I'm just thinking out loud here We write that first sentence, and then forget about this sentence that's stuck in there about foreign exchange markets, and go down to the sentence that says "somewhat" or "slightly" and "might" or "would", whatever it says I'll get radical here Suppose we make it totally asymmetrical and say "might be acceptable depending upon developments in foreign exchange markets"--put that first--then "and taking into account the strength of the business expansion, progress against inflation," and so forth Then go back and say "This action is expected to be consistent with growth in the aggregates" and so forth and so on  Let me repeat it and see whether we've got a basis for something here Maybe it ought to be tightened a bit because it's going to take a lot of changing "In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions" Then we say somewhat or slightly or whatever--let me come back to that "Somewhat (or slightly) greater reserve restraint would (or might) be acceptable depending upon developments in foreign exchange markets and taking into account the strength in the business expansion, progress against inflation, and conditions in domestic and international credit markets" That doesn't say anything about the aggregates We just say--  Just leave that in there "taking into account the behavior of the aggregates and the strength of the business expansion"  -41-    3/31/87  Let's leave out the aggregates then and go back to the other sentence We can say "This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from March through June at annual rates of ___ and ___ percent" Do we want to say anything about M1? "M1 is expected to remain substantially below its pace in 1986" Okay So, just reverse those and leave the wording Somebody get that typed and we can talk about substance I don't think there's any doubt, obviously, that if we move we would be much better off if the others moved also In fact, we might be better off if the others moved without our moving  Well, as they see it, they don't have much room to move  Well, let's assume all that It can take a lot of convincing; whether that's possible or not is another thing [The problem with] fooling around with the level of borrowings is that, essentially, that's a very loose steering wheel We could push for a higher level of borrowing for two weeks and before you know it the exchange market would be out there and not have any understanding that that was going on and the funds rate wouldn't move at all  We have other vehicles that are less precedent-setting  We can always raise the discount rate-- just to put another option on the table  We can more deliberately, as somebody suggested, try to push the federal funds rate a bit without worrying about precisely what level of borrowings it takes It might take very little if we did it in a certain way  -42-    3/31/87  That may be true, but it conflicts with no movement if that's what we want to do in terms of our present stance The in-between course, which we've been doing to a very small degree, is trying to avoid actions that might inadvertently ease the market in the sense that where the federal funds rate is on particular days when the dollar is declining [unintelligible] but we have not been anticipating reserve needs Somebody said--Mr Keehn, I think--that what we ought to be doing is erring on the high side If we keep the $300 million borrowing target that may capture what we ought to be doing at the moment I don't know how we reduce this to a formula So far as this consultation issue is concerned, I think if we were making a big step we would consult or if we were changing the discount rate a consultation would come about But I don't know if we want to consult every time we nudge slightly here or there, if we know what direction we are nudging in  Well, just for our own information I don't think we need a range in the directive Certainly, nobody is talking about moving above $500 million without a reconsideration of the decision We'd probably consult before we got there anyway, but as a deliberate matter, one never can tell where a particular week is coming in I have no problem at all if you really want to change that  I would be very cautious about how we do it The way I would interpret it is erring a bit on the high side I don't know what else we can say I can describe it We'll basically continue at the moment aiming at $300 million on borrowing I hear a lot of sensitivity about the exchange rate I hear very little sensitivity about coming in low on the aggregates side If anybody is very sensitive to that they better say so; I didn't hear anybody being very sensitive on that  We are not talking about forever, obviously When are we meeting again?  Well, there's no question that if the economy were going down the tank we would want it a little higher We would begin getting more sensitive to these aggregate figures  We are not predicting anything all that slow as I would read it  For the year as a whole, domestic final sales are what?  Private domestic final sales You haven't got government up much do you? There's probably not much difference for domestic final sales  A little lower  It's not a very good forecast [Unintelligible] that's precisely what you would like to see happen if we do not get the expansion from the foreign side  Well, I think what we're talking about is starting at something like $300 million, pursued cautiously so long as the exchange rate is so sensitive If the exchange rate really got weak we would contemplate moving up certainly to $400 million or so Much above that, we'd want to have a conference, anyway That would be the sense of it  Obviously, we would prefer to see the others come down; I'd prefer to see any distinct moves made in that direction We can talk about other moves if different situations arose but not decide that here We are putting a lot of weight on concern about the dollar--if it got too unstable--and we are somewhat less worried about the aggregates So, let's read this The first thing we have to do is decide, generally, this "somewhat" and "slightly" business  I would be inclined to say "might"--not because I think it's a weaker word, but because we are really talking about a conditional thing  "Somewhat greater reserve restraint might be acceptable depending on foreign exchange market developments, taking into account the strength of the business expansion This action is expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the period from March through June at annual rates"-- Now, we had this one suggestion on the table that we stick in a rather wide range That would be unusual but maybe it's what the doctor orders here in terms of capturing what people are talking about  3 to 7 percent The upper part of that range, actually, goes a bit above what the staff has on alternative B but, obviously, the midpoint is below it  -45-    3/31/87  If we put in something like that, the meaning is, if I understand it correctly, that we would get concerned if growth got below 3 percent That would become a factor saying we should ease regardless of what the rest of this says  [We would] move in that direction and vice-versa if it's above 7 percent  We can do that, but it puts less emphasis on the foreign exchange markets than I thought people wanted  It depends upon how much weight you want to put in here I would have read the Committee members as saying they want to put special weight on the dollar  SPEAKER(?) I think that's correct  I think we have to distinguish here It's not necessarily saying more in any fundamental sense It's saying that looking at the next seven weeks--or however long before we meet here again--we think the most likely factor that would make us be tighter is the dollar, not all these other things  SEVERAL That's right  It's not saying we would tighten It just says that we think the dollar is the critical or the most important variable for these seven weeks  That's what we traditionally say Governor Angell's formulation, I think, does add something With that wide a range, it's quite unlike what we usually say To go over that previous sentence again It says that the Committee is putting particular weight on the foreign exchange markets during this particular period of time In effect, it is saying that's the only reason why we are likely to tighten during this period It doesn't expect the business expansion and all of that other stuff to lead to some tightening It doesn't absolutely say it that way but it leans in that direction that this is the one factor that--  It doesn't say that we would tighten, but it doesn't say that we would ease I think we would have to change the directive if we were to ease Obviously, that can be done If the economy took a nose dive next week we would have a little consultation and say in light of the economy taking a nose dive we decide--  The way this is written, I would read it in terms of likelihoods that by all odds that's the most likely thing It doesn't exclude [the possibility] that we would tighten if the aggregates got much higher, or if the business expansion were stronger, or if inflation rose They are all mentioned here But the way it is written suggests that what we are really worried about is the dollar  Well, the choices are pretty simple It's just a matter of emphasis We can write a whole separate sentence about the dollar; Mr Kohn has one example We can do this in-between course Or we can take out the "taking into account," which is a small change from what we had before--so small that I think it's almost invisible But we are left with [unintelligible] directive  Well, I don't know if I do We can say conditions in the credit markets to avoid that  That's because that's the way we traditionally do it If you have any better wording--  Do you want to put that sentence back where it ordinarily is as the second sentence?    3/31/87  Mr Melzer would put it in after the taking into account, if I understand him right "would be acceptable depending on developments in foreign exchange markets, taking into account the behavior of the aggregates, the strength of the business expansion, progress" That's easy to do  We still have that sentence in here and we have to put something in there We have at least two proposals on the table We have Mr Angell's, which was 3 to 7 percent We have somebody else's, which was "around 6 percent" There is a substantive difference between those two  Why don't we go up to eight?  This is not too big a deal here I rather like the 3 to 7 percent because I think it reflects the flavor of what was said But whether or not 3 to 7 percent is precisely the right range--  -49-    3/31/87  It depends upon what you think of as tightening  If you are talking about the aggregates pure and simple, it's tightening If you are talking about borrowing as the measure [unintelligible]--  Alternative C says $500 million borrowing, which is not what people are focusing on  Look at what the first two sentences in the operational paragraph say First, there is no change at present The second sentence says there might be a tightening And the third sentence says we expect that all to be consistent with something between "B" and "C" That's right because that's what the operational language says  That is technically correct, but it attaches such precision to these estimates that are never that good  Does anybody support 4 to 7 percent, for which the average is 5-1/2 percent?  It's a half of a point difference  Let me talk you into 4 to 7 percent We just change these numbers You're putting too much weight on the staff's numbers What we say is that we want to be where we are now or maybe tighter under certain conditions  So, we say we expect that approach--I would say "approach" instead of "action"--to be consistent with a range using two numbers that allow for our normal one percentage point uncertainty around the projection plus another one percentage point down on the low side in case we do tighten Now, that ought to make it beautifully consistent with what the staff technically estimates We often put in something like a 5 to 7 percent range that is consistent with the 6 percent [expected]  We can say 6 percent or less but I guess the substantive question is whether we, in fact, would be concerned if the aggregates came in at 4 percent, let's say If they came in at 4 percent, all other things being equal, would that be a cause for easing?  -52-    3/31/87  We can say 4 to 6 percent, or we can say around 6 percent or less  There are no substantive differences  I don't think it would be interpreted as getting it down to zero  I will just transpose the question Do you understand the third sentence? The third sentence will then be that the aggregates might come in lower than that and that's fine It's all the same substance  Greater reserve restraint would take place because the reserve aggregates are high A comment about the behavior of the aggregates in that sentence might amount to the same thing  4 to 7 percent is the staff's projection  This allows for some change in reserve restraint, the possibility of some contingency Where this sentence is located, it encompasses the contingency as well I am going to have to look at what the staff puts down in these forecasts  I would change the word "action" to "approach," which encompasses the first two sentences  Well, that's fine, if you interpret that as saying that if that next sentence happens then we can get slower growth in the aggregates I think they are substantively the same thing, but I am not sure that's the way it would be interpreted Ordinarily, just as it is now, the second sentence is read to mean we will seek greater reserve restraint if the aggregates are exceeding what we say That is the ordinary construction of that sentence It starts out with the aggregates and it says we will take note of the change in that  It hits maybe what you are trying to get to  There is, but I don't think it's a very big one  Then I think you ought not worry about this language if you really don't think there is a policy difference, because I think it's saying what you are saying  What?  Clearly, without a consultation I think that is [true]  We can say an annual rate of 6 percent or somewhat less, or 4 to 7 percent, or 5 to 7 percent, but I think it doesn't make that much difference  There is nothing the matter with around 6 percent, depending upon what you think of it These forecasts are almost always wrong by several percentage points The substance here is Are we more concerned if it comes in at 3 percent or at 9 percent? That's the question As a practical matter, the staff is saying that they expect it to be somewhere between 3 and 9 percent and--  Would you get more excited if it came in at 9 percent than at 3 percent? I think that is the issue  It's the only thing we know about it We don't know about these other things If everything was as it is now and it came in at 9 percent, would you--  I think this is the substance If nothing else changed visibly, would you be more unhappy with 9 percent than with 3 percent? I am one who would be more unhappy with 9 percent  I don't know how interest sensitive they are All I would say is that after what happened last year, and given what's going on, if they come in at 9 percent I would be more unhappy  -56-    3/31/87  than if they came in at 3 percent I am not saying that it would be the end of the world  We have 4 to 7 percent, 6 percent or somewhat less, or around 6 percent Of the members of the Committee, who would prefer to say, of these three choices, "around 6 percent"?  Members of the Committee Do you want to say around 6 percent, rather than 6 percent or somewhat less?  Three alternatives 4 to 7 percent; around 6 percent or less; or around 6 percent  Who would prefer around 6 percent, period? That's unmodified, symmetrically around 6 percent Well, that's half the Committee already I suppose the others don't care whether it's 6 percent or less or 4 to 7 percent  Well, who prefers 6 percent or less? Then what do we get?  Let's take a new vote It's going to be around 6 percent and the vote will be on whether we add "or less" Who is in favor of adding "or less"? I changed the word "action" to "approach"  "Somewhat greater reserve restraint might be acceptable depending on developments in foreign exchange markets, taking into account the behavior of the aggregates, the strength of the business expansion, progress against inflation, and conditions in credit markets This approach is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from March to June at annual rates of around 6 percent or less Growth in M1 is expected to remain substantially below its pace in 1986" And I presume we still have 4 to 8 percent or whatever we had on the range for the federal funds rate We are ready to vote, so we will vote  Adjourn the meeting  END OF MEETING  -58-       Well, gentlemen and lady here--we only have one lady on the Committee, now  Obviously, there has been quite a lot of turmoil going on in markets recently, whatever market one looks at We have had problems with open market operations We have a number of policy issues, and I thought it was appropriate just to review where we are I think it's fair to say that pretty much since the last Open Market Committee meeting, pressures have developed on the dollar That occurred not long after that meeting And in accordance with the discussion at that meeting, we were playing things rather cautiously but not really changing the borrowing target in any overt or non-overt way We had our usual problems in sometimes meeting and sometimes missing targets; there was no change in the target but there was erring on the side of restraint--if that's the right word--in making any day-to-day judgments that may have been appropriate  In accordance with the discussion and given what was going on in the market, [our approach] changed a bit this week We assumed that under these circumstances we would aim overtly at a somewhat higher target, something around $400 million I think the market has that sense now--not about a number but a feeling that we probably have deliberately snugged, if that's the right word, this week Now, in fact, we have many fewer reserves out there than we intended because of technical problems, which I'll let Mr Sternlight and Mr Kohn discuss with you But what has happened, essentially, is that we were willing to aim slightly higher, and then all the reserve factors came in strongly adverse both yesterday and today We don't know whether that will continue to be the result We put in a lot of money both yesterday and today--as much money as the market would take--but we still have a little hole for ourselves just in terms of strict targeting Given the direction in which we're going, I'm not sure that that's any disaster from the standpoint of the market You will have observed that both the exchange market and the bond market--and I think those two phenomena are not unrelated--have considerably strengthened over the past couple of days, although they have had some intermeeting ups and downs Just as a matter of general background, the Board is going to have to keep the question of the appropriateness of a discount rate move under consideration All of this is somewhat dependent, at least ideally, on what goes on abroad There is at least some verbal indication that the Japanese would like to see rates ease a little in Tokyo markets They have a sharply declining bond market rate; that's just the opposite of what's been going on here It's a reflection both of expectational factors and actual shifts of purchases out of US bonds into Japanese bonds by Japanese investors, without necessarily at all connoting a change in monetary policy But they have told us that they would aim toward lower money market rates In fact, I was told this morning that they said that publicly in some    4/29/87  kind of press contact that the Governor has It didn't receive much attention here; I haven't seen it anyway  I don't think it was said It's very strange; the Japanese press generally picks it up and reverberates it They told me they said something publicly and I'm trying to get more details on that The only other thing I would add is that I have to testify tomorrow morning, not on monetary policy but on risk-based capital I'm sure this question [of current policy] will arise And I would think that I should confirm that we have had a small snugging or tightening, or whatever word seems appropriate at the time, in the light of the circumstances in the market I certainly would not try to get that out of perspective; I'd try to avoid further trouble That's about where we are at the moment Oh! I might just indicate, and the staff can describe it more fully, that while all this has been going on--and it's one of the reasons the reserve factors are moving so strongly against us--the money supply, or M1 at least, has ballooned very sharply over the middle of the month, presumably related to larger-than-expected tax payments But it hasn't washed out yet Peter, why don't you describe it?  Mr Kohn, do you want to say anything about anything?    4/29/87  Mr Cross may want to bring us up-to-date or give us a little flavor of what has been going on in the exchange markets in recent days  Yes  Well, as I suggested earlier, it's quite a turbulent period I think what's been going on in terms of open market operations is pretty much what the directive would have suggested during this period I don't think we have to do anything formal as a Committee, but I certainly would want to hear any comments or deal with any questions or any observations that any of you have  I think $400 million, notionally, would be the target at the moment  I think the federal funds rate will be more influenced by psychological factors within that band that you're talking about than anything you could measure by a $100 million change in the borrowing, given this turbulent atmosphere If that dissipates, the range will be down; if it doesn't, it won't  I think it might at some point, depending on what other things happen I would suspect if that happened that rates, in the first instance, would kind of move down by themselves for a while But we would have to look at the other things--the monetary aggregates, the business situation, inflation One question that I suppose enters into the approach now, as it always does, is the    4/29/87  question of whether we think the inflationary outlook has worsened in these past few months That seems to be the view in the market, and it's not unrelated to the exchange rate situation because the inflationary expectations are given in part by the exchange rate moves But I do think there has been some greater pessimism in the market about inflation, which has helped account for the long-term bond market performance, anyway  Well, we will have a lot to discuss in three weeks, I guess Are there any other comments? If not, I will bid you adieu No, adieu is too much Au revoir   We'll proceed with approval of the minutes  Without objection The Report of Examination of the System Open Market Account dated May 11, 1987 has been distributed to you Any comments or questions? If not, I would entertain a motion for approval  Without objection Mr Cross  Any questions or comments?  Oh, me! I thought you were talking to Mr Cross  Very limited I don't think either of them has the intention of doing anything, on their own initiative anyway, in monetary policy right now Their discount rates are well below the market rates They are both moving a little to lower their money market rates I understand what's going on It is going on [unintelligible] On the fiscal side, of course, the Japanese said they would do something They have had a bit of a political problem there getting the budget passed and all the rest They have said that they will do something and will do something, I suspect Whether it's going to be effective before fall, say, and just what it will be I think is questionable For the Germans on the fiscal side, I think some of them, including some people at the Bundesbank, are quite worried about the business outlook There was a lot of talk at the OECD meeting in Paris, and their representative there said well, of course, they would look over the situation again if things didn't develop in a favorable way in the next few months When he got back home Mr Stoltenberg said they have no intention of changing anything and they've done all that they can do So, I don't think the talk in Paris was indicative of any reason to sit at the edge of the seat for any move on the fiscal side I don't think it's terribly right but that's the--    5/19/87  I don't think it probably would make that much difference on the fiscal side But maybe if all the other forces move in the direction of embarrassing--is that the right word?--the Bank of Japan or the Bundesbank-- I wouldn't expect either of them to make a deal right at the moment or to respond immediately if we took any action I think it would improve the chances, but how much is beyond me It pretty clearly would set up a situation where the next step was up to them; they would have to recognize that  I think that's correct You're not talking about anything very relevant for 1987 at this point without a sudden massive change in mind by the Germans, which we don't expect Even if the law permitted them to act quite quickly on taxes and the circumstances arose to [warrant] triggering it, they don't appear to have any desire to trigger it  Well, they're going through this usual [routine]--it's almost an annual ritual now--of saying maybe we'll move the public works budget into the first part of the year and speed up construction and all that I don't think that amounts to much  Well, I don't know what you mean by ongoing discussions We have a certain amount of conversation with them but I don't sit on the edge of my seat, as I indicated, expecting that these ongoing conversations are certainly going to result in spurring them to new activities The Bundesbank itself is quite split about what they should do--about 50/50 There is a lot of worry within the Bundesbank about the economic outlook  Well, I could say that Germany kind of [represents] the rest of Europe, frankly, except for the British who are outside the EMS There the expansion is pretty good relative to other countries; it seems to be not a breakneck rate but a pretty good rate of expansion Among the others, I think a lot of them would like to do more but they feel they can't so long as Germany sits there They're worried about their exchange rate and so forth I don't know if any economy in the rest of Europe is really growing; they're    5/19/87  probably going backwards too Am I wrong about that, Mr Truman, in terms of the rate of growth slipping rather than the reverse?  Except for the British?  The French [economy] slowed down quite a while ago  So, it's not a very buoyant situation, wherever one looks The last time I talked to he seemed quite worried about the outlook, even more worried than before But he's been worried quite a lot [unintelligible] It's a tone of voice; [he seems] more worried than he has been  When you look at monetary policy in Japan in particular, these long-term rates have gone down primarily because of monetary policy--maybe because it has been relatively stricter This one bond issue that people follow got down toward 2-1/2 percent to get this [unintelligible]  It has been a long time since we've seen a long-term bond rate at 2-1/2 percent any place    5/19/87  [Unintelligible]  Of course, when we raise the question about what they're doing on fiscal policy they raise that question with us, too It's rather a symmetrical question Are there any other comments? We need to ratify the transactions  Without objection Mr Sternlight  They say that's enough Comments or questions?  Any other questions? We need to ratify those transactions  Without objection Mr Kichline    5/19/87  Questions?  Mr Boehne  You can insert a question  You have how big of an increase?  Mr Parry, you wanted to make more general comments, I hope  Mr Black  Mr Boykin  Mr Stern  Mr Keehn  Mr Forrestal  Mr Guffey  Ms Seger  Mr Hendricks  Mr Morris  Mr Corrigan  We seem to have disagreements about some facts and analysis What is going on in the consumer price index outside food and energy, Mr Kichline?  Mr Melzer  Mr Heller  Those are not real numbers Practically none of the trade imbalance would be eliminated in nominal terms  Governor Angell  Governor Johnson  Mr Kohn, maybe you can give us a brief analysis  Let me mention one thing that I was going to discuss later I will discuss it later, but some rumors are flying around the markets so I thought I should identify it now, anyway Citibank is making the great move this afternoon, unless the market forces them to announce it earlier They are making a reallocation of their capital accounts and are going to put $3 billion into reserves against general contingencies, which will get pretty precisely identified with LDC risk They say that is not their intention but the accountants are forcing them into it, looking for some explicit  -23-    5/19/87  excuse This will be a record loss for any bank, by some multiple, in a quarter, and a big loss for the year I am sure the idea they have in mind is that they will then show very favorable earnings in subsequent quarters; they won't have this quarter-by-quarter drag of large provisions and everything is going to look much better In fact, what's happening is that a couple of numbers on the balance sheet are changing It is going to raise a lot of questions, obviously, in the minds of a lot of people about other banks There are a lot of rumors about around the market We can discuss later what is going on in the market  The problem is that I don't know what you can tell them right now because we have inside [information] We have this problem with some banks; that is right I just don't know what you can tell them  SPEAKER(?) Not to go out to lunch, I think  You can talk to them if you want and see what they know, because they are obviously the other bank that will be very much affected by the psychology A lot of them will be but--  On our more immediate problem--I don't know, that problem could be pretty immediate in terms of the decision we have to make--it is obvious that one of the variables for the Federal Reserve as a whole, but not for the Open Market Committee, is a change in the discount rate A number of Federal Reserve Banks have made a proposal and we have had some discussion I don't know what I can say about that We could change it immediately; we could change it if the dollar seemed to require; or we could change it not at all I think those are the three options before the house I just think we have to have those in mind as possibilities; it may affect one's judgment about how to conduct open market operations For what it is worth--if I mention this there is a chance you will be overly influenced, but I suppose not these days--our latest M1 numbers look a little stronger than what we thought yesterday Instead of unchanged in May, M1 may be up a little  Who would like to say something? Mr Parry  You were just saying alternative C; I was looking at it literally to say either an increase in [the borrowing built into] the reserve path or an increase in the discount rate  Yes Mr Boykin  -25-    5/19/87  You would prefer the borrowing  Yes  I'm not sure I understand the question We were truly seeking what we were seeking before; we may not have made it When we say $600 million, or whatever, we shall truly seek it  I would submit that we've had two two-week periods, which is two-thirds of the time between the meetings, where we couldn't hit it  I tell you Let's defer those questions until we know what we want to do in concept Mr Keehn  Mr Forrestal  Mr Hendricks  Mr Morris    5/19/87  Ms Seger  "B" is where [unintelligible] drift Mr Stern  Mr Boehne  Mr Melzer  Mr Black  Governor Heller  Governor Johnson  I think the probability is zero now  It is "C"  Mr Guffey  Governor Angell  Mr Corrigan  That is what "C" says  All this perceived wisdom says that half the people would like to see the discount rate moved right away and half the people would not like to see it moved  That is correct I would interpret most people's comments as indicating that they are reasonably happy in a very general way with the way things are now How do we express that in detail? I guess it depends on what we do with the discount rate  -31-    5/19/87  I will look at the wording to see what wisdom that implies Very broadly, is the preference for variant I or II? A couple of people said they would like variant II and many didn't say anything I am not worried about the precise words in either one, but variant I clearly gives more prominence to the exchange rate Is that closer to the center of gravity or the reverse?  I think it is pretty close  I think the argument is straightforward; we can move up the inflationary pressures phrase I feel that a lot of comments suggested that maybe the timing of the discount rate ought to be primarily influenced by one thing or the other Whatever one concludes about the timing is a foreign market question And, if an inflation expectations question is really what we are talking about, then I am not so sure whether we're not better off putting inflation in with the exchange market in the first clause "developments in foreign exchange markets and indications of inflationary pressures"-- or vice versa--"taking into account" etc  "Depending on indications of inflationary pressures and developments in foreign exchange markets"  --developments in foreign exchange markets, taking into account the behavior of the aggregates," then why don't we just say "and the strength of the business expansion"?  -32-    5/19/87  I know, but does that add anything?  No "Taking into account the behavior of the aggregates and the strength of the business expansion" We can leave in credit market conditions; I am not sure what it is supposed to mean in this connection  I suppose that phrase is meant to say if conditions in the credit markets are too bad, we would get easier  Let's go back to the earlier part of that sentence  "This approach is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period at annual rates of 6 percent or less" is what we had  What is the projection explicitly?  Well, it's "the aggregates" If M2 runs low--  But the projection is about 6 percent for M3 and only 3-1/2 to 4 percent for M2 We can say "4 and 6 percent, respectively, or we can say "6 percent or less"  SEVERAL 6 percent or less  Just reading what we have here "Growth in Ml is expected to slow substantially over the balance of the second quarter"  That is a great daring statement it may be below 18 percent for the rest of the quarter!  We could say something even safer--below 18! We said it would be below 15; we now say below 18 Can we say something a bit more substantive maybe?  13 percent was the average?  What was it, say, December to March?  We can say below its pace in the first quarter, but there are two ways of looking at the first quarter It is--  It would to me  -34-    5/19/87  It was only 4-3/4 percent Say 10 percent or below That's a little--  Say 6 percent or less for the broader aggregates and growth in M1 is expected to be 10 percent or less  "Expected" is what we say about the others That worries me a little Does this mean that M1 has the same importance as M2 or M3?  We have already said we don't have a target for it We can have a target for it, but is that what we are doing?  End of March to the month of June  That's all terrific What language do you suggest?  "Growth in M1 is expected to remain well below" I was worried about "this approach is expected to be consistent with M2 and M3" Do we want a stronger phrase than that? We make this sound more like a target which it is supposed to be "Expected to be consistent"--the magic words Oh, forget about it We'll leave the funds range 4 to 8 percent Now the substantive issue is--to go back to the beginning of the first sentence--we don't have to make it fully asymmetrical, but last time we didn't leave in the clause about slightly lesser or somewhat lesser We just said the last time "somewhat greater reserve restraint might" One way to do it is "somewhat greater reserve restraint would and slightly lesser reserve restraint might"  We do? It's nice to know--we haven't gotten to the first sentence yet I think it probably should be not quite so asymmetrical as last time, which was fully asymmetrical If we keep this general structure we can say "Greater reserve restraint would and somewhat or slightly lesser reserve might" Or we can make them both "somewhat" and make one word a "might" Let's go back to the first sentence I think we can either say "maintain" or "increase" If we say increase, we will say "increase the degree of reserve pressures sought in recent weeks" and it will all be explained in the policy record Or we can say "maintain the existing"--  [Unintelligible]  It says increased Somebody thinks it ought to be "the degree of reserve pressure sought in recent weeks"  SPEAKER(?) You have to read it against the background of what we said in the policy record earlier  Presumably we could be very technical; the borrowing average in this two-week period will probably come out around $500 million  Reserves--  That is correct But it is not going to be $600 million  SPEAKER(?) We may get a lot of borrowings tomorrow  When is the last time we used this kind of formulation? You say we have used it several times?  When we have used it, I think we have had exactly this same problem There is a debate about whether we want to get public credit for tightening up We're actually tightening  4 to 8 percent is what we have been using  Yes I would think that is unlikely but it could conceivably happen It is a question of how we want it to read I think most of the time we have not moved the range when we are this far--and where we would anticipate being is this far--from the edge That is much more frequently [the case] than not We have not moved it until we get quite close to the edge  But it is all psychological Well, what do you want to say? "Seeks to increase somewhat the degree of reserve pressure sought in recent weeks"? One question is whether we want to say--which we have also done at times--"depending upon the level of the discount rate," or "taking into account any changes in the discount rate" In the directive of August 19, 1986, we said "In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to decrease slightly the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions, taking into account the possibility of a change in the discount rate"  I don't think we have to, but probably it will have to be mentioned in the text [of the policy record] that how we will conduct open market operations will depend on what the discount rate move is  I think that it has to be in the policy record anyway There is a more limited question here whether it has to be mentioned in the directive itself  We will interpret the degree of reserve pressure in the text to mean a composite of borrowings and discount rate, which is what we have done before I think that has been established many times So, presumably this degree of reserve pressure will be read as some combination of discount rate and borrowings, whether or not the discount rate is explicitly mentioned in this particular sentence I will declare that Still, it doesn't answer the question of whether it is better or not visually to put some mention of it in there It will be reasonably clear, I trust, in the last few paragraphs of the policy record leading up to the directive that the Committee very much had in mind that we might have a different level of borrowing depending upon what the discount rate is  I will get to that in a minute How many want the discount rate mentioned in this sentence?  We are going to be 5 to 5  Well, we have a number of indifferent ones  There are more votes to have it in, probably "In the implementation of policy, the Committee seeks to increase somewhat the degree of reserve pressure sought in recent weeks, taking account of the possibility of a change in the discount rate"  "In the implementation of policy, the Committee seeks to increase somewhat the degree of reserve pressure sought in recent weeks, taking into account the possibility of a change in the discount rate Somewhat greater reserve restraint would or somewhat lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable depending on indications of inflationary pressures and on developments in foreign exchange markets, taking into account the behavior of the aggregates and the strength of the business expansion This approach is expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the period at annual rates of 6 percent or less Growth in M1 is expected to be well below its pace during 1986" The 4 to 8 percent range How do we deal with [two] "taking into accounts?"  Now we've got two "depending ons"!  Well, we could do it that way, I guess "acceptable depending on indications of inflationary pressures and on developments in foreign exchange markets, as well as the behavior of the aggregates and the strength of the business expansion" I think clearly what we are saying, and this is too simple is If we change the discount rate in the next day or two, we would aim around $400 million or so and if we don't we would aim at $600 million What is more questionable is what happens if time passes and we go to--I doubt we're going to $600 million right off the bat--as a way to procrastinate, go to $500 million or so  Initially And leave open whether we go to $600 million on the borrowings or just change the discount rate  Let me try this out I think it could reasonably be $500 million or thereabouts now If we move the discount rate we could go on the light side of $500 million If we don't, it seems to me consistent with all this conversation that we might well go to $600 million, depending upon the exchange markets and the inflationary indications  Discount rate increase  I myself think it is a little hard to reverse by any sizable amount I am not talking about a shading That is why I prefer not to get very tight and then reverse anything I think it gives peculiar signals But, if we are around $500 million, we can shade it on the low side or the high side, depending upon what we do on the discount rate, and not be way off  The borrowing assumption would be around $400 million  If we don't do that, the borrowing assumption would be around $500 million  That depends upon exchange markets and inflationary pressures, and so forth  I would suggest something like $500 million now without a discount rate change--that assuming no discount rate change, there would be some predilection-- Something else would have to happen to go to $600 million, but we would be ready to do that without too much strain If we moved the discount rate, presumably we wouldn't go to $600 million and would shade the $500 million down If we moved the discount rate in the next couple of days, we'd never go to $500 million  I happen to think it is a good thing that nobody knows It could well be consistent with 6-3/4 percent, but how much money I would put on that--? I don't think it is necessary--  I guess what the staff says in the Bluebook is that it could even be below 6-3/4 percent  No I am talking about with the discount rate change With $500 million it might be a little less But $600 million borrowing or the change in the discount rate with $400 million on borrowing are more or less equivalent  I am assuming we are talking about a half point, but obviously--  Assuming the funds rate stays where it is  But you're against moving the discount rate  I think that is the argument about the discount rate Do you pre-empt or keep it in reserve?  Well, I will discuss that too I may save you $300  What we are talking about here is a kind of "modified C plus," or something--$500 million without a discount rate change, with the readiness, certainly, to go up to $600 million or so--  If the exchange markets and inflation or whatever seem to justify it, and the business expansion wasn't falling out of bed, and the aggregates were more or less as expected, we would be quite ready to do that But we wouldn't do that unless there were some reason for it We could raise the discount rate; and we could do that today or tomorrow, in which case we'll stick with borrowing of around $400 million or so with some possibility of going above that if we need help later If we start out at $500 million, we could shade it lower if we raise the discount rate later But if we raise the  -43-    5/19/87  discount rate later, under those circumstances, we'd probably have some reason for wanting to tighten up some or we wouldn't do it-- unless it was part of some international agreement [The likelihood of the latter] seems a little thin to me at this point, but in that case we might want to be totally neutral We have two ways of tightening up as we proceed if we don't move on the discount rate immediately either change the discount rate or change the borrowings a little, which is quite a normal situation On those understandings, can we proceed?  "In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to increase somewhat the degree of reserve pressure sought in recent weeks, taking into account the possibility of a change in the discount rate Somewhat greater reserve restraint would or somewhat lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable depending on indications of inflationary pressures and on developments in foreign exchange markets, as well as the behavior of the monetary aggregates and the strength of the business expansion" The rest of it is "6 percent or less," "below the pace during 1986," and "4 to 8 percent" Okay? What it means is that without changing the discount rate, the borrowing assumption is $500 million right now, the possibility of going up to $600 million is reasonably remote, and if we change the discount rate today or tomorrow the borrowing assumption is $400 million  Well, we can discuss that, because I disagree with that I think it is a positive benefit almost--not getting driven into--  SPEAKER(?) That is what gets you into interest rate targeting  That's the problem  Why do we want to buy bonds or sell bonds?  It is only unacceptable if you are very sensitive to where the federal funds rate is--that this might be a mistake That's what the argument is all about  If you are really sensitive to where the federal funds rate is, the most efficient thing that you can do is target the federal funds rate  Do you want to do that?  Even that always exists It is not unusual to miss these targets for several weeks We had great big misses around the end of the year Now people are more used to it around the end of the year, and they say Okay, they are way off Around the end of the year, we were way over a billion--  I think we are getting diverted by this argument I don't think we have voted yet, have we?  I think we better adopt a directive This is a continuing saga, but let's get this vote out of the way  It is a relevant question that comes up all the time, so maybe we should have a little paper on it for the next meeting  I don't know how big a discussion you want to have We can have a great big discussion on operating techniques, but maybe we'll start it off, anyway, with a rather small paper on precisely [unintelligible] [Laughter] We will see whether that leads us into much deeper water, which it is very likely to do I don't know if anybody is terribly happy about our current operating procedures In fact, the weak [unintelligible] the money supply  -46-    5/19/87 -47-   It's appropriate to say a word before we start about Arthur Burns' passing He sat at this table with many of us for a good many years He sat over there about where Bob Black is; the seating has been rearranged since then I don't know whether that had any implication for policy when the Chairman sat over in that area But he was a very forceful Chairman who had a great dedication to the Federal Reserve and to this Committee I think you have been notified that there is a memorial service on July 22 at 1130 in the morning at the Temple here in Northwest Washington If people can make that, I think it would be greatly appreciated With that, we can get started and approve the minutes  We have a second The minutes are approved May we have the report on foreign currency operations?  If I may interject before we discuss this I was so preoccupied with Arthur Burns that I forgot to welcome Mike Kelley to the table this morning Sitting there, you're almost [unintelligible] now as a governor; so, I say welcome The plan of attack this morning and tomorrow is that I will interject the discussion on this report on borrowing that you all have after Mr Sternlight gives his report and we have the discussion on the Desk's operations That's the logical place to do that We will break for lunch at about 100 pm and discuss extraneous matters informally, as we usually do, and then go back into session If we finish this afternoon, fine; if we don't, we will reconvene tomorrow morning And if the discussion proceeds beyond 1100 tomorrow morning, it will be without a Chairman, which may be an advantage for some of you Let's proceed to the questions or comments on Mr Cross' report  We just have one month of [data for] the second quarter right now  We have a lot on this in the presentation to be given later, I guess?  SPEAKER(?) Yes  I suggest we defer these general discussions of the balance of payments outlook on the dollar until later Are there any more operational comments or questions?  The Japanese long-term rates were going up in this period when they resumed their investment in the United States, presumably?  We need to ratify the transactions  Without objection Mr Sternlight  Questions or comments? If not, we will ratify the transactions; that is all we have to do here  Without objection Why don't you introduce this report on borrowing just very briefly, Mr Kohn?  Is that on a weekly-average basis?  Comments?  Relative to intended?  Well, the question remains--and you may not know the answer now--but the one period on this chart when borrowings were fairly high, which was in 1984, that bias didn't seem to exist Is that typical, in fact, of other periods when the target was $900 million, or $1 billion, or $1-1/2 billion?  If you equate policy with interest rates  [Unintelligible]  This question arose in the summer of '84, for instance We got a much higher funds rate at a given level of borrowings than we had anticipated  It sure is [unintelligible] when it has already been that for a while, that's--  To some degree this question arises at every meeting  What did you say? There's no seasonal in seasonal borrowing?  But isn't that because we're aiming at a total borrowing figure including the seasonal? Otherwise, we offset the seasonal in the seasonal  You say your relationship between the borrowing total and the funds rate doesn't change seasonally?  Even though the seasonal total itself is seasonal?  I forget How much does the seasonal borrowing swing in a normal year? Is that [unintelligible] or something?  I certainly don't think it makes much difference if the level of borrowings is $1 billion or something, but maybe if it is so low--  Did you do any study as to how sensitive, let's say, the federal funds rate is--that is, what kind of relationship you get with net borrowed reserves or free reserves instead of borrowings?  I guess if you're going to follow this general approach, it's better to target borrowings than free reserves  Mr Corrigan  Maybe I didn't read this carefully, but I came out with the opposite conclusion that the relationship is so loose that we're not doing that  Well, there are all kinds of interesting questions and implications toward operating techniques which I will declare after this discussion will not be acted on at this particular meeting  I assume that the operating techniques will remain the same, for this meeting anyway Let's turn to the economic situation I gaze down at the other end of the table and note that we have a few other changes You are aware that Mr Kichline will leave us in a couple of weeks He has been at that end of the table during my whole Chairmanship; I don't know how I'm going to get along without him but I see some able-bodied, capable people down there to lead me through this meeting anyway  Well, it was a comprehensive presentation, very complete in all senses It can now be attacked Are there any attackers? Mr Parry  Mr Boehne  Mr Forrestal  It's a very optimistic projection from one point of view That has to happen to release the resources for the improvement in the external account and produce some savings; it doesn't produce very much Mr Stern  Ms Seger  Mr Keehn  Mr Morris  Mr Melzer  Well, I could say something, but I think we'll get into this later in some more sophistication presumably than Mr Prell has indicated  I presume that Mr Kohn's presentation is going to revolve around those issues  Governor Johnson  How much is US production down in the past year or so?  Does anybody else have a question?  Mr Guffey  Does anybody else have any particular questions that are contrary on this presentation? If not, I would ask you to present your alternative scenarios, if any, that you think are important I don't want to interpret the group as all being in full agreement with the staff Mr Parry  I think Governor Heller will tell us the answer to that question  Mr Forrestal  Mr Corrigan  Mr Boykin  Mr Melzer  Mr Keehn  Mr Stern  Does anybody else feel compelled to say something? If not--you feel compelled to say something?  I don't want to--  Well, I'd rather eat lunch with everybody having talked on this subject before lunch so we don't return to it after lunch  Governor Johnson  You had a much lower deflator number for next year if this report is correct In fact, you have the lowest  Well, 26 percent it says here, but--  And you're way down at the bottom on the rate--  Along with Governor Angell  I don't know; I would like to believe that And if you look at just goods versus services it sounds right But if you look at goods, I wonder whether that is a likely result It cannot be resolved today, but if you look at it industry by industry where is the trade improvement likely to take place? Would you, in fact, find substantial amounts of slack? In some cases yes and in some cases no, I suspect But where does the balance lie?  You're not going to tell me right away  Okay, there is in some industries; paper, for instance, is a leading example In lumber I don't know--maybe there is and maybe there isn't  It has been damaged because some industries have contracted; and in some cases where it has been damaged it isn't going to recover The recovery is going to be in different industries than where some of the damage took place, I think But if we compromise--  Well, look at it How much capacity have you got on autos? I don't know  I would like to see an analysis after lunch Does anybody else have anything to say before lunch? If not, we'll go to lunch  [Lunch recess]  Just a technical question In 1987 what growth would be needed in M2 to hit the bottom of the current range for the year? Arithmetically, what does it take?  From June to December  7-1/2 percent brings it into a [unintelligible] 5-1/4 percent  5-1/4 percent Not just for December--  One historic question is bound to arise What is the record in changing these targets at midyear?  We have changed M1  Stated another way, we've changed the target that was the most operative  Why don't we concentrate mostly on 1987 now? Somebody commenting on 1987 might want to say something about 1988 but primarily concentrate on 1987 where the choices are more limited We are running within the debt range, so I presume that nobody is going to want to change the debt target There's some bias against changing these things Does anybody want to raise a big question about M3? I just want to see if I can narrow this [discussion] at all Now we might want to say something or leave open the issue of our willingness to fall short or overshoot, or where we'd like to be in the range, or whatever But so far as any formal change in the ranges, we are talking about M2 Who would like to say something? Mr Black  We can get back to M2 in 1988 in time Mr Parry  Mr Forrestal  Governor Angell  You confused me a bit Let me ask you a question I don't remember your exact words, but [the thrust was that] they are real targets and we don't change them but explain if we are going to miss them Are you really going to try to make it [into the range] by not changing them?  Not try for the 7-1/2 percent?  You don't really consider it a target in that sense I am just trying to clarify your view  You are not arguing to make 5-1/2 percent a minimum at this point  The whole issue is--and Mr Kohn, this is a question that you can answer--have we ever before said explicitly that we have this target but we expect to come in below it or above it?  We have often said the low end or the high end, or whatever I am asking have we ever said we expect to end up above or below the range  We simply said it was interest sensitive I don't remember the exact words, but we said something about particularly at the beginning of this year, which I just have no recollection of It bears upon this question of whether we would more readily or not change the target I ought to know; I don't recall  Then you would feel more compelled to try to meet the 4-1/2 which you may not want to meet  We have often said we expected it to be higher or lower within the target But I don't recall offhand our saying, though we might have--  Who else wants to talk about the substance? Mr Guffey  Is that correct?  With the current levels of interest rates?  Mr Boykin  Mr Boehne  Mr Stern  Governor Johnson  -35-    7/7/87  Mr Melzer  Governor Heller  Mr Morris  Mr Keehn  Governor Seger  Mr Corrigan  -36-    7/7/87  I am not sure I understand the signal argument I think it depends on what we say, not whether we change If we said nothing and didn't change the target the presumption in the market would have to be that we were going to ease  His best guess is that it's going to be in some range of outcome that is barely at the bottom of the target and that to be safe we would reduce the target  We have to decide what to say I would not say we are reducing the range because we expect interest rates to go up That would not be suitable In fact--  Over the year as a whole, given what has happened, given where we are, and so forth--  Well, why don't we return to this issue of what we say Let's look at the next issue, with a bigger range [of options] being displayed before us  You would be explicit You are saying alternative II is lower than-- No, we haven't set any tentative range  Mr Forrestal  Mr Boehne  Mr Boykin  -38-    7/7/87  Mr Parry  On our staff forecast, from February you would end up with alternative III if you take [unintelligible] as certain  Mr Keehn  Mr Stern  -40-    7/7/87  Mr Hendricks  Governor Seger  Mr Corrigan  Mr Kelley  Governor Heller  Is there anyone we haven't heard from here? Mr Morris, then Mr Guffey  Mr Black  There is one peculiarity about ending up with 5 to 8 percent [for 1988] if we say we are sticking with this present [1987] target which we expect, with a high degree of probability, to come in below Are we saying we expect 1988 to be higher than 1987? What is the implication of that?  -42-    7/7/87  Well, I'm going to make a little case I think these are too high What do we want to do? We have an outlook here which is always uncertain in real terms It is quite satisfactory; it's about the best you could hope for if you believe the staff analysis of a slow growth domestically and a pickup externally Nobody has discussed the point that Mr Prell made initially that we had quite slow--people like to call it sluggish-- growth and a decline of one half percentage point or more in the unemployment rate in the past year I am not sure we could stand vigorous growth and a decline of 2 percentage points in the unemployment rate in the next year I don't know how you resolve that little dilemma  It seems to me that it is perfectly evident that the forecast the staff has for prices--though I am not sure that it is right-- leaves us in a totally unsatisfactory position a year from now, with the inevitability of a sizable recession if we are going to have any chance of restoring price stability Once that gets built into the wage outlook, it is just a question of when; it is going to be messy I am not sure that is the outlook I find it a little difficult to think that the prices are going to be that high with the wages at the moment being as good as they are But certainly, the recent evidence is not very good in terms of what is happening in prices despite the performance on wages I would agree with what you said, Mike, that once it has broken the wages, you're dead And a lot of hard work will come unwound What can we do about it? We only have one tool For one thing, I would play for stability of the dollar, unlike the staff forecast And I would not take a further aggravation on the inflation rate or risk there and hope that a further decline in the dollar is not needed to produce the uncertain trade effect I would certainly work on the budget deficit There's not much we can do about it, but at least we get some protection on the growth of domestic consumption as well as on the financial side and interest rates I worry about minimum wages and all that stuff Now, when it comes to monetary policy, I would be cautious I think it would be a big mistake not to be cautious We have talked about a half percent here; it's imagery, but that is where I would come out I think it is very hard to present a suitably cautious outlook without changing the range this year I suppose we can decide that we will probably come in low and we are willing to But we are going to have a higher rate next year that encompasses a more or less satisfactory nominal GNP growth but assumes a totally unsatisfactory price level That is my speech for the afternoon  For 1987 it is so much a matter of the way we present it; I think it makes very little difference If we say we are not in the practice of changing the range--which isn't quite true when we are looking at M1--and we are going to keep the range but we really expect to come in low, Mr Proxmire will say "Why the heck didn't you change the range?" If I were testifying, I would be hard    7/7/87  pressed to answer that question I would mumble that the Committee didn't want to but nonetheless we think it is going to come in low and eventually we would go on to the next question I can survive that I think the way we're sending the message is more in the 1988 ranges than [unintelligible], providing that we say we are willing to come in low in 1987 If we are not going to come in low in 1987 then we are actually saying--these are going to get quite exaggerated--come hell or high water, we are going to get it up in the second half of the year with the implication that that takes a more aggressive easing stance for which we're going to vote  Barely less than 4 percent In GNP, I make an assumption, and maybe its wrong, that you cannot have the economy grow 3 percent from here on out through the next 18 months, just based upon recent experience The unemployment rate is going to be 4-1/2 to 5 percent, which I think is going [down] too fast on the unemployment rate in terms of the future stability of the economy Therefore, if it can't be 3 percent real and it is 6-1/2 percent nominal, we are going to see 3-1/2 percent on the GNP deflator and 4-1/2 percent on the consumer price index  I grant you that; I hope that is what happens We can get reasonable growth consistent with sufficiently less inflation than is in this forecast If we can't we're in trouble  That's one of the issues  For the next few months, I don't think this is an issue at all That we will get to in a minute  SPEAKER(?) Mr Chairman, one of the reasons I suggested alternative I was that I thought it would be easier for you to explain to the public You are saying to me that for 1987 alternative II, in your judgment, would be much easier to explain, I think  I think that is incidental It is easier to explain at first blush, but we can do either one for 1987 I think if we've got a real [unintelligible] what we say for 1987 It's one thing to say we are staying with the range, but we are perfectly prepared to come in below it if that is the way things work out Or we say we are sticking to the range and mean it  You're saying lower the range for this year? Or do you mean lower the range now for next year?  I don't know what the arithmetic is I am not arguing about it I don't much care whether it is lowered this year; it's a little awkward to explain If we didn't lower it this year, from now to the end of the year at what rate of speed would M2 have to grow to exceed the 7-1/2 percent?  11-1/2 I don't think it will exceed the upper end of the range, whatever we do  Most people said don't change this year; that is what everybody [who has a vote] said Now, what I don't  -45-    7/7/87  know--we have to return to what we mean by that What do we want the explanation to be? We are not changing it this year We think it is inappropriate to change in the middle of the year unless there is a very strong reason But, given what has happened in the first half of the year, we anticipate that it is quite likely that we could come in below the bottom of the range I think that is what I heard most people say  When you put it that way, the next question would be What is that level of prices that gives you that? I would be a little more vague  [Unintelligible]  What are we talking about--1987?  I think we need to reopen [unintelligible] 1987 I need to reopen what we say about it There was a considerable feeling ranging from extremely mild to strong that we shouldn't change the 1987 range That leaves open what we say about it Have people who didn't want to change it before changed their  -47-    7/7/87  mind or do I assume that we are going to keep the same 1987 range? I'm leaving open for right now what we are going to say about it  SEVERAL Keep the range  I don't hear anybody recanting Now what are we going to say about it? We are not going to say at the one extreme that we are really going to make it period Nobody is saying that  I think we've got to say something there It will be rather obvious if we say nothing and we are at whatever level we're at  What language did you use? I am not quite clear on what language we are supposed to use at this point Are we supposed to say passively that we "may be near" or "tolerate"? And if we say tolerate, under what conditions?  The velocity figure that we don't know until the quarter is over  I'm not even sure it is a dispute I haven't got it clear in my mind as to what should be said at this point  I am going to ask the staff Do they know what to say at this point?  Previously someone said that it is pretty clear, or we expected to come in around, about, below or whatever If that is what you want to say, that is fine  Put in some other qualifying words about what is happening in the real world I just want to be sure that is what you want to say  What you're really saying is--I just want to get this right--if it is going to come in around 5-1/2 percent, that means above or below 5-1/2 percent depending upon all these other things  All right Tentatively I think we [unintelligible] Where are we now on the big issue of next year? We have lots of people who want 5 to 8 percent for both M2 and M3 We have some who want 6 to 9 percent Are there any different thoughts  -50-    7/7/87  on these ranges? Anybody on one side or the other who wants to change their minds? Mine is closed Does anybody like Mr Corrigan's 4 to 8 percent?  Does anybody like this 4 to 8 percent?  SPEAKER(?) I think it is pretty good Yes  Much lower [unintelligible]  Next year, you're projecting what for M2?  Well, I don't know whether I can get a [consensus for] 4 to 8 percent Let's just have a show of hands of people who like this idea of 4 to 8 percent  It's a relatively small problem Why is the range so large? I am not so sure about velocity  Historically, the range has been 2 to 2-1/2 points; we got that up to 3 points It's a little embarrassing; if you believe in these targets, it is a pretty wide range I am not  -52-    7/7/87  sure it is wider than, in fact, the outlook has suggested it should be  We had a decline in velocity last year of what?  4 percent  Senator Proxmire would take that view I don't think the rest care  We could say we are making it 4 to 8 percent now, in July, but the Committee intends to try to narrow the range next February That is what we could say to respond to his question  I think we have three choices 4 to 8 percent is being proposed, if that appeals to anybody or most of you; we have alternative II as written, which has gotten quite a few votes; and we have alternative II as modified to 5 to 8 for both M2 and M3 Then there are further subdivisions We could adopt that last one and say we were going to look at it hard with the thought or reducing it, or that we would have some inclination to look at that possibility next February, to take Mr Angell's variant of that Let me just test the three pure ones and forget about defining the third How many prefer 4 to 8?  How many members? We haven't got a huge following for 4 to 8 percent five Alternative II as written? Alternative II with the 5 to 8 percent? Well, that seems to be where the Committee is; so let's assume that's where we are for the moment Let us turn to the short-term  Let's return to that after we consider all the rest I hear that you got all this new [unintelligible] For the short run, the critical variable will be [unintelligible]  -53-    7/7/87  Can I carry you one step further is [your preference] symmetrical on the language?  Mr Corrigan  Mr Boykin  Governor Johnson  Mr Keehn  Governor Kelley  This is very subtle analysis in terms of your--  contrary  SPEAKER(?) You've got them all worn out!  Governor Angell  Well, does anybody want to express a view?  Let us resolve the language Where is this language? Do you give any alternative here in the directive paragraph?  Well, we're going to say "seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions" Can we make it symmetric? "Somewhat greater reserve restraint would or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would" Do you want it in that order or reverse order?  Does the sentence otherwise look all right--to people who want it symmetrical anyway? I suppose we simply put in these numbers; we have faith in the staff Are we [unintelligible] now? What they say is 5 and 7-1/2--we sometimes try to avoid using those fractions If you believe the staff we've got to use different numbers this time; I don't know whether to believe them  Have we ever used a fraction here before? I guess we have  Shall we say 5 and 7-1/2?  This follows a very low [growth] period, let me say That's not very expansive  Well, 5 percent on M2 isn't going to be in the lower end of the target  7-1/2 percent for 6 months If it grew 5 percent for the next 3 months, what would you need for the final 3 months--11 percent or something--to reach the bottom end of the target?  Yes, it would be 10  Well, if the 7-1/2 percent is right forgetting about the compounding, which is limited, it is going to be 10 percent  Oh, but I think with the 7-1/2 percent for M2 that we get [unintelligible]  It would be a little more than 10 percent because that's a quarterly figure  We're going to find out it's going to be even 12 percent that this implies for the last quarter; I'm not sure  And for growth in M1, that's a vague enough statement Are we going to leave that the way it is? "Growth in M1, while picking up from recent levels" or something-- Do we want to put something like that in there?  March to June was low  Well, I don't think it makes much difference If we want to be reassuring to some of our monetarists, then we could say "growth in M1, while picking up from recent levels" --which would be May and June And that was negative?  "M1 is expected to remain well below its [pace]"--  "Growth during 1986," I think Do you want to put that phrase in there?  The word "pace" is kind of a funny word when I see it, but I know what it means It was 6 percent last time; I guess we'll leave it then and use growth rate We continue on with 4 to 8 percent Does anybody have any further comments? That's stating it symmetrically with no change, the numbers or the projection [provided by the staff], and "while picking up from recent levels" inserted Does anybody have any questions about that? Then we'll be turning to the other operational paragraphs We'll go back to page 20 What's the difference between these variants? All right You have nice language for us here; I might have read that before Variant II just has the reduction in the range Do people like Mr Kohn's language? It's going to save us some trouble  SPEAKER(?) Yes  SPEAKER(?) Yes It seems pretty good  The top of page 21  Well, "around the lower end of the range" I guess means that it could be below  Do you want to say aggregates or growth in M2--pin it down to one that's around the lower end of the range?  They "will be in the lower halves of their ranges, particularly M2" or something  That's all right  I think whether or not you put a period after "appropriate" the explanation you'd have to go on is incorporated in the bottom line of what's there  SPEAKER(?) Yes, I'd leave it  Is that satisfactory?  SPEAKER(?) Yes  Now, where are we? On page 22 Is this a bit of boiler plate at this point? Have we said this before?  I think the question is likely to come up regardless, since the issue has been raised We should have had a little discussion of what's the matter with M1A  I'm not crazy about this sentence that finishes with lower growth in M1; it says "the Committee anticipates" Shouldn't we say that "In the light of what happened last year the Committee welcomes substantially slower growth of M1 this year than last year"?  "In the context of continuing economic expansion given the intensification of price pressures,"--maybe just leave that there All this wording about "associated with substantial downward movement of the dollarand the abatement of the weakness in M1 velocity" is saying the same thing as the first part of the sentence  -59-    7/7/87  No, just the second half  For the second half of that "The Committee welcomes substantially slower growth of M1 in 1987 than in 1986 in the context of continuing economic expansion and intensification of price pressures" I'm not quite crazy about that "intensification" I don't like to admit that the intensification-  Say "the continuing economic expansion and a greater tendency for prices"--  "Some evidence of greater inflationary pressures" How about that?  Say greater--  This is a vague sentence  All this says is that substantially slower growth of M1 in 1987 than in 1986 with a [unintelligible] that ought to be--  Any preferences? I'm--  Is this exactly what we said earlier in the year?  -60-    7/7/87  I don't think we should  What we actually should do is this I'll make a more accurate sentence "The Committee in reaching operational decisions over the balance of the year will take account of growth in M1, and at some point in time, in the light of circumstances then prevailing if the Committee"--  "The Committee in reaching operational decisions over the balance of the year will take account of growth in M1 in the light of circumstances then prevailing," [unintelligible] and all that business The issue is if it's too low, we'll be a little easier than we otherwise would be Now we get to 1988 We have 5 to 8 percent as the Bluebook number for M2 and M3, right?  SPEAKER(?) Yes  Leave this sentence about M1 just in--  Well, this is awfully thin It says nothing about the targets Did we write this sentence in the past pattern? It says we established the ranges for M2 and M3 and doesn't say another word about them It goes on to a little baloney about M1  What I was wondering about is this discussion of M1 Why shouldn't it all be combined in that one paragraph on M1? So what would we change? With respect to M1 and so forth [as shown] Then, "because of its sensitivity the Committee decided not to [target it] over 1987 and has established no tentative range for 1988" And then start with "currently the appropriateness," and then add this last sentence saying "issues involved with establishing a target range for M1 will be carefully reappraised in the beginning of 1988" I would make M1 all one sentence I think it's a little more straightforward that way  This doesn't say we're going to establish a target range All it says is that we are thinking of it; it just says we're going to reexamine whether we want one at all I don't think it commits you to anything  Well, that just leaves it where we are  I agree with that  Let me just [review] Logically, I think this M1 sentence would come after both of them, then The M1 paragraph would be as it is with a small change in the middle of the paragraph "The Committee again decided not to establish a specific target for growth in M1 over the remainder of 1987 and no tentative range has been set for 1988 The appropriateness of changes in M1 this year will continue to be evaluated," etc Then right at the end bring up that other sentence "The issues involved for establishing a target range for M1 will be carefully reappraised at the beginning of 1988"  That would depend upon [unintelligible] Well, this leaves us one sentence for the long-term ranges for 1988 Is that all right? It says "the range is _ to _ percent;" it doesn't say anything about [unintelligible]  Oh yes We have a range on debt, which is what? Is debt 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent?  We start out with no change in the range this year but we agree that growth in the aggregates around the lower end of the ranges may be appropriate in light of developments with respect to velocity and signs of underlying inflationary pressures, provided that economic activity is expanding at an acceptable pace We will vote separately on these things That is the pattern, right?  Are we prepared to vote on 1987 ranges? Unchanged ranges with that sentence--  Now we move to 1988 We have two sentences one saying 5 to 8 percent and one saying 7-1/2 to 10 percent on the associated range for debt But we also have this sentence or paragraph on M1  All it says is "5 to 8 percent for M2 and M3 and 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 for the associated range for domestic nonfinancial debt" It's two sentences Then this paragraph on M1--  Well, I think we've got to say that in the explanation  We have 5 to 8 percent, 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent and the paragraph on M1 for the record Does anybody need that read to them? I will read it to you Are you ready?  Yes  Unchanged  Now we get down to the operational paragraph Just to remind you It is "maintain"; same language as last time, but totally symmetrical with "woulds"; 5 and 7-1/2 percent, respectively, for M2 and M3; growth in M1 while picking up from recent levels is expected to remain well below the pace in 1986; and 4 to 8 percent for the federal funds rate  Please call the roll  -65-    7/7/87  Anything else to discuss? We can just quit If any members have changes in their projections, Mr Prell would like to receive them by noon on Thursday  How do you know?  [Unintelligible] come back and bite you in August with another meeting where you could go off on your own "woulds" and "mights" and stuff I appreciate the cooperation of all, in these recent years in particular This is a wild and woolly venture sometimes, with so many people But it works and I trust it will continue with all your intelligent and forceful efforts Thank you  END OF MEETING  -66-
