2  I will be referring to the package labeled “Material for   Briefing on FOMC Participants’ Economic Projections”  On balance, the projections   you submitted for this meeting embody appreciably weaker real activity this year and   trace a somewhat more gradual economic recovery than you anticipated in June    Exhibit 1 shows the broad contours of your projections for 2010 through 2013 and   over the longer run  Nearly all of you see GDP growth, the top panel, picking up over   the next couple of years, while the unemployment rate, the second panel, moves down   slowly, and both headline and core inflation, shown in the bottom two panels, edge up   but remain subdued  Somewhat more than half of you indicated that these variables   would likely converge to their longer-run rates within about five or six years, but the   rest of you noted that unemployment may still be above or inflation below their   longer-run rates at the end of that period                                                     2 The materials used by Ms Weinbach are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   November 2–3, 2010 32 of 238             Exhibit 2 reports summary statistics regarding your projections for 2010  As   usual, your previous projections, collected in June, are shown in italics, and the memo   items note the staff’s Tealbook forecasts  The central tendency of your current   projections for real GDP growth this year, shown in the first column of the top panel,   is a narrow band from 24 to 25 percent, down from 3 to 3½ percent in June    Looking at the middle column, the BEA’s annual benchmark revisions and second-  quarter data that were published after you submitted your June projections showed   less rapid real GDP growth in the first half of 2010 than you or the staff had expected    As shown in the third column, you have lowered your implicit projections for growth   in the second half of this year quite a bit; they now exhibit a narrow central tendency   centered on 2¼ percent, down from about 3 to 3½ percent in June  And, as shown in   the second panel, the central tendency of your projections for the unemployment rate   in the current quarter moved up about ¼ percentage point                  Your expectations for overall and core inflation are shown in the bottom two   panels  The central tendency of your projections of overall inflation in the second   half of this year, given in the right-hand column of the third panel, are now somewhat   higher than in June, but your projections of core inflation, shown in the bottom panel,   have changed little   Exhibit 3 displays the central tendencies and ranges of your projections for 2011   to 2013 and over the longer run  Most of you see at least a modest pickup in the pace   of the recovery next year with real GDP expanding about 3 to 3½ percent, followed   by increases of 3½ to 4½ percent in 2012 and 2013  Nearly all of you retained your   assessments of the longer-run rate of GDP growth, leaving the central tendency   unchanged at 2½ to 2¾ percent   Regarding the unemployment rate, the second panel, you generally revised up   your projections  Most of you now expect the unemployment rate to be near   9 percent at the end of next year and to decline to about 7 to 7½ percent by the end of   2013  A number of you appear to attribute some of the increase in unemployment   over the projection period to long-lived structural factors  Indeed, more than one-  third of you raised your projection of the rate of unemployment in the longer run, and   the upper end of the central tendency of these projections rose from 53 percent to   60 percent  The bottom of the central tendency remained at 5 percent   Even though your outlook for both overall and core inflation, depicted in the   bottom two panels, has edged up since the June SEP, you generally continue to expect   inflation to stay subdued over the next several years  The central tendency of your   projections for total PCE inflation is about 1 to 1¾ percent in 2011 and 2012; it   moves up to 1¼ to 2 percent in 2013  However, most of you see a path for inflation   through 2013 that does not exceed your longer-run inflation projections, which now   exhibit a central tendency of 16 to 20 percent, a bit wider than in June   The staff’s outlook as presented in the Tealbook embodies rates of real GDP   growth that are at, or a bit above, the top end of the central tendencies of your   November 2–3, 2010 33 of 238             projections for the next few years, and rates of inflation that are at the low end of your   central tendencies  The staff’s projections of the unemployment rate are within the   central tendencies of your projections  Regarding your less optimistic outlook for   growth, some of you noted reasons that reflected  the view that further expansion of   the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet would provide relatively little stimulus to the   economy; anticipation of a substantial ongoing drag on growth from the housing   sector, perhaps stemming from mortgage documentation problems; and expectations   that lingering pessimism and risk aversion would continue to weigh on household   spending and business investment and hiring               Regarding your monetary policy assumptions, about a third of you—a somewhat   smaller fraction than in June—indicated that your assessment of appropriate monetary   policy involved less accommodation than assumed by staff, in the form of less   expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet going forward, a faster decline in   the size of the balance sheet in the future, or a federal funds rate that lifts off sooner   than in the staff’s baseline forecast  Only a couple of you thought that it would be   appropriate to implement a more accommodative policy stance than the staff assumes,   by expanding the balance sheet by more or by keeping the funds rate near zero for   longer   Turning to your final exhibit, the two left-hand panels show that most of you   continue to attach a relatively high degree of uncertainty to your projections of both   real GDP growth, the top set of bars, and PCE inflation, the bottom set  The two   right-hand panels summarize your characterization of the balance of risks around   these projections  A majority of you now judge the risks to your current forecast of   GDP growth to be balanced, although a significant number of you continue to view   the risks as weighted to the downside  Those seeing downside risks cited the fact that   monetary policy is constrained by the zero bound, the limited potential for further   fiscal stimulus to help address any future negative shocks to the economy, and   concerns that the anticipated recovery of the housing market may take much longer   than expected   The bottom right panel shows that most of you continue to judge the risks to your   projection of PCE inflation as being broadly balanced, although some of you think   that upside or downside risks predominate  On the downside, some of you were   concerned about the degree to which lingering resource slack could weigh on   inflation, or continued low readings on actual inflation might show through to   inflation expectations  Those of you who cited upside risks to inflation generally   noted uncertainty about the timing and efficacy of the Fed’s withdrawal of policy   accommodation, or a concern that the expanded Federal Reserve balance sheet could   undermine the stability of longer-term inflation expectations  Thank you  That   concludes our prepared remarks    I believe in the June set of projections, 12 had a different view  So it   has been a higher count at times, if I’m not mistaken    I see  I haven’t looked back at the history of those responses to see if   these are unusual
