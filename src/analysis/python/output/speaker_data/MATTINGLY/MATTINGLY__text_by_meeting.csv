3906,1989-10-03,MATTINGLY," That's all that you'd be doing, Governor  -16-    10/3/89  It's the same as the vote of directors of a bank ratifying loans made by the bank The loans are [already] made "
3983,1989-12-18,MATTINGLY," I think if you follow Robert's Rules of Order, it would be something that has to be recorded "
4011,1990-02-06,MATTINGLY," Well, it seems to me that if the Committee has taken a vote that that should be recorded in the minutes You can vote to rescind that vote  -41-    2/6-7/90  Yes sir "
4038,1990-03-27,MATTINGLY," Hopefully, it'll never get to a court But--  As you know, Governor Angell, the Board's General Counsel in 1962 issued an opinion with respect to the System's authority to resume foreign exchange operations  It was all three Warehousing was part of that opinion; there's no question about that That opinion justifies the warehousing of open market purchases of foreign exchange from the Treasury For that purpose the Treasury is in the--  I don't think so Again, that's been the Board's position for 28 years and the Congress has passed a statute which, in effect--I don't want to put too much emphasis on this-- sanctions the System's practice The statute authorizes the Federal Reserve to invest the proceeds of its foreign exchange operations in foreign government bonds and obligations It specifically enacted [this legislation at the] request the Federal Reserve for that purpose And it seems to me that that act by the Congress very much [strengthens] the System's position on this--  It has never been tested, no "
4290,1991-02-05,MATTINGLY, They would go off according to the terms Is there a term on them?  [Each] would roll off according to its terms; there would be no additional warehousing after the resolution 
4803,1992-11-17,MATTINGLY," This Committee is not subject to the Sunshine Act  Not subject to it at all  There are exemptions The FOMC is exempt  Yes  The Board of Governors is subject to the Sunshine Act; therefore, we have an obligation to open the meetings to the public unless we find some exemption  The discount rate is the responsibility of the Board of Governors and we have to go through the procedures of Government in the Sunshine, but we close the meeting  Financial speculation  I think the tape of this meeting is destroyed as soon as the--  Legally if someone asked for the tape before it's destroyed, we'd have to go through the tape and we could delete the recommendations and opinions We'd have to turn over the segregable facts  -63-    11/17/92  No question "
4839,1992-12-22,MATTINGLY, Right 
4974,1993-07-06,MATTINGLY," It's part of the FOMC's Regulations  Some of the information the FOMC has do violate those statues, but the directive does not; it violates the FOMC's rules "
5045,1993-10-05,MATTINGLY," I think you would get a request for that document and--  I think that's right, [though] my answer might have been a little more definitive yesterday than it is today But yesterday I would have felt very comfortable saying that the great bulk of that document could be withheld from the public on the grounds that it would--  I think that was one of the reasons that the Committee discontinued the Memorandum of Discussion in 1976; they couldn't be sure that some other judge or some other court wouldn't reach a decision different from that reached by the judge in the Merrill case "
5065,1993-10-15,MATTINGLY," Mr Chairman, I think you have it just about right The position prior to last week in the government was that these kinds of materials--transcripts that reflect deliberations of an agency--were exempt from disclosure They were privileged and need not be disclosed to the public Last week the Department of Justice and the President changed the government-wide policy Under the prior policy, the Justice Department would defend an agency's decision not to release those kinds of materials, if the non-release was authorized by law And, of course, the Freedom of Information Act does specifically authorize non-release of deliberative materials Last week the Justice Department and the President said that is no longer the policy of the country; we want to have a presumption in favor of disclosure And in the event an agency denies the public access to materials, we will review that on a case-by-case basis and make a determination whether the release would harm the agencies That is the new policy    10/15/93  So in order to prevail, you would have to show that the release of the information would somehow harm the agency or harm a public or private entity We've talked to the Department of Justice, and the new policy is aimed specifically at Exemption 5 The Justice Department's view is that agencies in this town have placed too much reliance on Exemption 5, which is the exemption for deliberative materials They've used it too much, and they've used it inappropriately; and that is exactly what this new policy is aimed at We asked them informally what their view would be regarding materials that we had that were notes and so forth that were used in the preparation of minutes They indicated that certainly with respect to meetings where the persons who attended the meeting were no longer at the agency, or where the issues were no longer in front of the agency, they felt the agency would have a very difficult time persuading them that those materials should be kept confidential That is the state of the policy as far as I understand it The policy was just changed last week  Well, I think this exemption that I'm talking about is designed to protect those kinds of materials also--drafts of documents and things like that that are prepared in the course of decisionmaking My understanding is that the Department's view is that the policy that I've outlined would be applied to those materials as well as to [transcripts]  Well, we have transcripts back to '76  Or the issue was no longer in front of the agency This is just the informal advice--  No, I don't think so No, I think that we would--  No, I don't think so, Governor I think we would have to go to the Justice Department This all presumes that someone asks for the transcript, we turn it down, and there's a lawsuit  If that arises, then the decision on the release of those documents is effectively taken from the FOMC and given into the hands of the Attorney General And what they have said is that this agency would have to prove to them that the release would harm this agency I think we could make a fairly respectable argument that certainly transcripts for the period of the last year, two years, three years, would have that effect  I don't know We can try to make the best argument that we can  Absolutely I think the Justice Department would think it was very reasonable for this agency to make the cut at three or four or five years, and say that anything older than that should be released  That would be a very good argument Now I want to add a footnote--  May I add footnote, Mr Chairman?  When I say ""release of the transcript,"" there are materials in that transcript that we could withhold because they would damage private corporations, for example, or would damage the ability of this agency to obtain information in the future One example is central bank information I think we could make a very good argument that names of specific companies and that kind of thing can be redacted because we can show harm there  Exactly But we all know that the bulk of the transcript basically is going to be debate back and forth--[that is], of a deliberative nature And that material, I think, would be subject to this new rule  That's correct The FOMC has taken the position, and the Supreme Court has agreed with it, that the FOMC-- whose records these are--is an agency subject to the Freedom of Information Act And that places the defense of this [type of] lawsuit squarely with the Justice Department In fact, they have defended the FOMC The Merrill case, the Melcher case, and the Riegle case all were cases against the FOMC  The Melcher case was against each individual [Reserve Bank] President  Whereas the Merrill Case was against the FOMC as an agency  I don't think so  The Reserve Banks can defend themselves A lawsuit against the Reserve Banks is defensible by the Reserve Banks themselves, not by the Justice Department In a lawsuit against the    10/15/93  Federal Reserve Board, the Justice Department has the right to defend the Board Most of the time they let the Board defend itself, but the final judgment is--  In FOIA it's the Justice Department  You'd have to ask Mr Kohn  Unfortunately, the decision is the Justice Department's That would be one of the arguments that we would strongly urge if the Committee decided not to release this information  Correct  Well, I don't know what the Justice Department would say, but my suspicion is that they would probably say that we are fully able to put a disclaimer on those transcripts saying that they are rough and unedited and they may or may not reflect what the person actually said  I think that if you got a request and you offered to make an edited transcript available, that would probably satisfy the requester and it would be deemed to be reasonable If you wanted to withhold the document on the grounds that you're unable to edit it--you're unable to verify whether what was transcribed accurately reflects what the individual said--that would be the argument that we would use with the Justice Department But their response would probably be that they can understand that for transcripts of recent meetings--whatever recent means--but why would anyone care for a meeting that was 20 years old, for example? Or the late ['70s] meetings--  Well, when the person spoke, the person knew that that meeting was being transcribed  Well, in 1977 Chairman Burns testified that it was the policy of the Committee to record those meetings  Yes  The way to answer that is--  The way that some of the Governors are answering that question is to say that the Chairman will describe the records that are maintained by the Secretariat  That accurately describes what Chairman Burns told the Congress  Well, in 1979 the Board agreed that it would support an edited transcript They didn't object to that, as long as it was edited in the fashion of the Congressional Record  I'd go along with the Chairman on that  As I said, the Justice Department will decide these things on a case-by-case basis and they haven't made any decision, obviously, with respect to the FOMC transcripts; and I haven't discussed that with them My discussions with them have been of a general nature So I think the FOMC would retain the ability to try to protect those raw transcripts for the reasons that the Chairman has outlined I think it enhances our case a lot if we're able to say that we have tried to edit those--if we make some sort of disclosure [that is] forthcoming in some respect, for example, by editing the transcripts to the extent that we're able to do that They might be  -10-    10/15/93  persuaded that that's a reasonable compromise position I think they will also be persuaded that the more recent meetings should be withheld So we're only talking about meetings-- There's no guarantee about anything that I say; it's all speculation on my part The Committee may very well be able to persuade the Justice Department to defend the past records entirely; but just based upon what [Justice officials] have said, that seems unlikely to me  That's an excellent point, President Parry The legislation that was considered in '79 and '84 had an explicit provision by statute saying that those documents couldn't be released for three to four years Without a statute we wouldn't have that kind of protection  No sir, it is the Federal Reserve Act  There would be a specific provision in the Federal Reserve Act that would mandate the Memorandum of Discussion and protect it for three to five years  Well, if I understand your question, [since] you're going to make an oral statement on Tuesday, you could say that the Chairman has described the recordkeeping practices of the Secretariat  Yes, he is  The Chairman--go ahead, Don "
5081,1993-10-22,MATTINGLY," That's correct  Yes sir, that's not a problem  They have, Governor Phillips But the question [arises because] a few weeks ago the Department changed its position Previously, those materials were, I think, pretty clearly exempt from public release A few weeks ago the Justice Department changed the policy and indicated that there's a presumption in favor of release They would only defend a lawsuit brought to get access to those documents if the agency could show harm to the agency And what we're asking for in this proposal is to go to the Justice Department, explain the documents that we have, and see how [that] policy would be applied to those documents  We're not [asking for that], I don't think What we're asking for today is just the Committee's preliminary views on this proposal, whether they think it has merit If the Committee thinks it has merit, we will explore its feasibility with Justice  Right In my opinion, it would enhance our chances of obtaining a favorable view from the Justice Department if we were to have this process  Mr Chairman, before the Committee decides to institute the MOD, I think it would be very important to talk to the Justice Department and make sure they would protect the transcripts [associated with] those MODs at least for a three-year period "
5097,1993-11-09,MATTINGLY," Mr Chairman, it might be premature to take the first vote You are not quite sure how much [they] want; it may be more than [$25] billion Isn't that right?  The vote will be then on a motion to authorize the Foreign Currency Subcommittee to increase the swap line from $700 million up to $3 billion  For 90 days And again at the Subcommittee's concurrence to draw on that line in view of-- "
5132,1993-11-16,MATTINGLY," I will, Mr Chairman Mr Chairman and members of the Committee, there are two federal statutes that bear on the issues before the Committee this morning of public access to the existing transcripts of FOMC meetings and to tapes, transcripts, or other types of records of future FOMC meetings, should those detailed records be prepared in the future These are the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the Federal Records Act (FRA) FOIA governs what information the FOMC must release to the public and when The FRA governs what records the FOMC must maintain As explained in the memo, I believe that under FOIA the Committee is entitled, but not required, to withhold from public disclosure most of the material in each of the existing transcripts as well as in memoranda of discussion (MOD) type documents, should they be prepared for future meetings There are two relevant provisions in FOIA Exemption (4) would protect confidential information from [foreign] central banks and from individual businesses I don't think there's any question about that Exemption (5) would protect the Committee's deliberations By that I mean the discussion and debate among the Committee members before they reach a decision on the directive or other monetary policy matters This would cover the recommendations by staff as well as views and recommendations of individual members leading up to the time of decision Factual portions of the transcripts would have to be released, however, where they could be reasonably segregated from the deliberative materials These types of factual materials would include the vote, the attendance, and material that was already public or non-confidential The view that public disclosure of the transcript is not required by FOIA is supported by the 1976 decision in the Merrill case against the FOMC There the lower court, the district court, held that the FOMC was required by FOIA to disclose only the reasonably separable factual portions of the two memoranda of discussion at issue in that case The great bulk of the material-- running as high as 85 to 90 percent of those documents--was in fact withheld under the deliberative exemption  I should note at this point that FOIA does not protect the transcripts or any information of the FOMC from Congress I'm only    11/16/93  talking at this point about release to the public While FOIA literally protects most of the transcripts, the Committee needs to consider the new FOIA policy recently announced by the President and the Attorney General That policy is designed to promote maximum disclosure of information within the Federal government Under the new policy the Justice Department has stated it will not defend an agency's decision to withhold information unless the agency reasonably foresees harm to important governmental or private interests protected by the exemption that is claimed by the agency In accordance with the Committee's instructions, Ernie Patrikis and I discussed the impact of this new policy on the transcripts with the Justice Department official responsible for administering the new policy We described to him the Committee's deliberative process and the Committee's view regarding the need to protect from premature release confidential information as well as information regarding its deliberations in order to maintain the high quality of monetary policy decisionmaking The Justice Department official's response was quite positive He stated that the new policy was intended to end automatic invocation of FOIA exemptions and instead require a careful, case-by- case consideration of the harm that might result from discretionary disclosure Based upon our description, the Department official stated that it appeared that the Committee could satisfy this new policy He also agreed that exemption (4) would cover the central bank information and that exemption (5) appeared to be relevant to cover the deliberative materials I judged from what he said that the Department would defend the nondisclosure by the Committee of transcripts or other records of its meetings, certainly meetings for the more recent years As the memo points out, there is an issue that at some point in time the sensitivity of deliberations in older transcripts might diminish to the point where the harm to the deliberative process of the Committee is outweighed by the benefits to scholars and other members of the public from access to these documents  If the Committee decides to prepare and release, with a time lag, MODs or edited transcripts for past or future meetings, the issue arises as to whether a tape or transcript used to prepare the final document must also be retained The Federal Records Act governs this issue The FRA states that an agency record may be discarded only with the approval of the Archivist of the United States To obtain that approval the agency must prepare and submit to the Archivist a schedule which the Archives is required to publish for public comment The staff has had several discussions with the Archivist's office--the last as late as yesterday--regarding whether transcripts or tapes need to be retained under the Federal Records Act if an edited transcript or MOD type document were prepared and retained Our discussions indicate that there is a different treatment for the past transcripts than for those that may be prepared for future meetings Based upon our discussions, it is likely that for future meetings, after an MOD type document is prepared and approved by the Committee on a fairly contemporaneous basis, the Archivist would find that the tapes and transcripts used to prepare the MOD were merely temporary working materials and could be dispensed with once a schedule was approved by the Archivist This advice was based on our description of the MOD as a near transcript-like document reflecting all of the substance of the deliberations of the Committee    11/16/93  With respect to the existing transcripts for the past 17 years, the Archivist's staff felt that they were the best historical record of the deliberations of those meetings The staff was not at all receptive to substituting for those raw transcripts an MOD type document because such documents would not have been contemporaneously prepared and then reviewed by the meeting participants Without contemporaneous review and approval, the Archivist's staff said that the accuracy of any edits could not be verified and that there could be no assurance that the MODs were truly reflective of the Committee's deliberations The Archivist's staff was also concerned about the temptation of participants or others reviewing transcripts well after the fact to rewrite history with the benefit of hindsight Based on these comments, our staff feels it is unlikely that the Archivist would approve the schedule allowing for the raw transcripts of the past 17 years to be discarded in favor of MODs The Archives staff suggested that rather than editing the raw transcripts the Committee could produce an annotated version in which the Secretariat would note potential or likely inaccuracies in the raw transcripts They did leave the door open to approval of a schedule to substitute a lightly edited transcript for the raw transcript, as long as nothing substantive was deleted And they would have to review that [lightly edited transcript] and compare the two documents to make sure that in fact nothing substantive was deleted I should note that these are the preliminary views of the Archives' staff and a final decision could be made only after a proposal was submitted and published for comment  Yes  Going forward we would have the participants immediately review what was said for accuracy  And we'd have the tape  Well, I'll try to answer your question The way the subpoena power works in the House is that the House has delegated to its committees the authority to issue subpoenas And in the House Banking Committee they haven't delegated it further Therefore, the Committee would need a majority vote to authorize a subpoena Once the subpoena was issued, in the House there's no procedure in the law to challenge that subpoena As I indicated, the exemptions under FOIA do not protect information from the Congress at all If a statute were passed that protected MODs or MOD information from public disclosure during the three- or five-year lag period, that would, of course, help immeasurably with the FOIA problem But it would not help technically with the Congress although, as I think Don Kohn pointed out, the enactment of such a statute would indicate Congressional agreement that this process was too important to be unnecessarily disrupted and the FOMC would get some at least moral support in your arguments to fend off a subpoena    11/16/93  Oh sure  My view of the most recent correspondence from Chairman Gonzalez is that he is asking this Committee to turn those documents over on a voluntary basis  I know, but that is the substance of what he's asking He may take issue with what I've said, but there are only two ways to get material He either asks for it [to be given] voluntarily or he uses the legal process, which is the subpoena  No I would point out [as an example] the B&L case where the Chairman refused to turn over the examination reports, which were replete with confidential information Chairman Gonzalez then obtained subpoena authority from [his] Committee and we were forced to turn over the examination reports  I don't know  That's correct  Well, that's correct But Chairman Gonzalez in the past has exercised care when he thought the materials were of a confidential nature He has not released, for example, examination reports  It would be his judgment, yes  Well, the annotated copy has the benefit of preserving the historical record, but in a marginal note the staff can indicate that this comment may [reflect a transcription] error or something because it's obviously not consistent with the rest of the discussion A note can be made like that In a lightly edited transcript, I'm not sure that the Archivist would allow us to change what was actually said [or what the transcriber thought was said] unless it was very obvious from the existing transcript that a mistake had been made  We could go through it--  That would be the issue  It would be likely that you would have waived your deliberative privilege and you'd have to turn over the raw transcripts That's an argument, of course  Right  No, I think they could delegate authority to issue a subpoena and it would [imply the need for an] investigation as to whether additional legislation is appropriate It doesn't imply that there has been wrongdoing  -15-    11/16/93  Well, again, I don't know that Conceivably one basis would be to determine whether the minutes that the Committee has released since 1976 accurately reflect what actions transpired during the meeting  Mr Chairman, just a point of clarification My understanding of your recommendation is that, going back or going forward, confidential central bank information and confidential business information would be redacted from the copy made available to the public    11/16/93  Absolutely  Yes  They are required to turn those transcripts over to the public unless they can claim--  Upon request  Well, there is a schedule whereby material is turned over to the Archives It has to be turned over in 30 years  Yes, but--  Correct  Well, once it's turned over to the Archives, you can still retain the confidential nature of the information if you can support that  I think that's right I can't give you any assurance that some judge--or not a judge so much as the Justice Department--might decide that a five-year lag would be too long under some circumstances The only sure protection is legislation  I can't make a comment on that The possibility certainly is higher than it is now But as I indicated in my comments, I think we have a very strong legal argument that this material is exempted And the FOIA statute doesn't have a time limit in it It says that if [the information] is deliberative, it's protected forever  Thirty years because of the statute  Chairman Gonzalez's letter says he wants to work out an agreement on that with this Committee  I think they would not until a lawsuit was filed That was what he said But I thought the Department of Justice official we spoke to--Ernie [Patrikis] can speak up--was very positive that they would defend this Committee on these materials, certainly the recent ones When I say ""recent"" I mean five years, or maybe even longer But he was very positive on that Now, that was based on our description of--  So I think our description is accurate  But that is more than I expected to get  As for the Archivist--Dave Lindsey can speak up--he was more forthcoming than I thought he was going to be about our ability to substitute an MOD for these raw transcripts going forward He was very positive on that and he was very positive on maintaining an historical record  They could if they invade personal privacy, things like that  If it was very obvious from the transcript that the ""not"" was an incorrect transcription you could take it out, yes In other words, if the transcriber typed ""adversary"" and the word really was ""emissary"" and it was clear that the speaker meant ""emissary,"" you could change it  As the Chairman said, yes "
5162,1993-12-21,MATTINGLY," Not that I'm aware of  [Not] after 1976  No, no we wouldn't have to do that at all That's all deliberative material  We would not have to disclose it, and I don't think that we waive that right when we make it available to the Oversight Committee  A lot of that October 15th tape was attorney/client material anyway  I don't think so, no  I've expressed it--  Well, I think--  Just because you grant him access to [the Secretariat's records of] the October 15 meeting doesn't mean you have to grant him access to other meetings of the FOMC, either the monetary policy part or something else  Yes, I think so I think the Committee has the right to maintain the confidentiality of its deliberations and also has the right to make an exception on occasion when it believes that is warranted And that's what we're doing here In the face of the allegations that have been levelled at the Committee, suppose you decide that in order to address those things and put them to rest it's best to grant access in these circumstances That does not mean that you have to grant access to all other conversations  I believe there is, yes  Yes, it can But you're giving up your right to keep all of that confidential when you let Henry Gonzalez look at it On this particular matter, you're correct  That's my view, yes "
5193,1994-02-03,MATTINGLY," If somebody asked, you would have to tell them In other words, it would be subject to disclosure  The Freedom of Information Act The legal issue is Why is it confidential? What's confidential about the vote?  Yes, but if you disclose the action-- "
5476,1995-01-31,MATTINGLY," No Once the edited transcript is approved by the participants, the tape can be dispensed with  The approved record would be the edited transcripts  That is legitimate We could keep from the public information that we get from another central bank or foreign government on the grounds that if we disclosed it after five years, we would no longer be able to get that information That source of information would dry up and that is legitimate grounds to redact the material  We would have to make that discussion public Our organization rules are public Now, if the Committee is talking about the appointment of a person to a particular position, the debate about that could be redacted There would be a possible invasion of personal privacy  A person can write a concurring statement  It is not included in the official record of the FOMC  No  Dissenting statements?  My position would be that the Committee can establish its own rules If the Committee votes not to allow a concurring statement, it would seem to be within the Committee's right  If I can help out?  It's pretty clear that these ESF operations are authorized I don't think there is a legal problem in terms of the authority The statute is very broadly worded in terms of words like ""credit""--it has covered things like the gold swaps--and it confers broad authority Counsel at the White House called the Treasury's General Counsel today and asked ""Are you sure?"" And the Treasury's General Counsel said ""I am sure"" Everyone is satisfied that a legal issue is not involved, if that helps  No, there is not If you look at the last paragraph, for example, that is part of the statute  The statute says that with the permission of the President they can make loans "
6227,1998-09-29,MATTINGLY," I do not know what has happened, but I suspect that fund has  gotten rid of everything over 5 percent  Nobody has told us, but I read in the paper that they have been  dumping equities, so I assume that they are trying to get down below 5 percent  Mr Chairman, some of the banks can take an equity position in  LTCM in satisfaction of a previously contracted debt, but some of the foreign banks may have  reached the 5 percent limit of the Bank Holding Company Act  They were anticipating that the market would move and that  they would lose their position The DPC exemption does not require an actual default The  exemption is also available in anticipation of a default "
6323,1999-02-02,MATTINGLY, Yes  
6464,1999-11-16,MATTINGLY," What is involved here is the fact that only the Committee can   direct a Federal Reserve Bank to take action What the Chairman’s authority derives from is the   ability to interpret that direction And that’s what this language is intended to address I don’t   think it’s possible for the Committee to give to the Chairman the authority to move monetary   policy on his own   The Working Group did change the draft wording to say the   New York Bank could adjust the rate but only with the approval of the Chairman, instead of after   consultation  "
6993,2002-01-29,MATTINGLY," There is a provision in FOIA that once an agency has disclosed a   particular kind of information then that information has to be made available to the public   immediately upon request   Yes, thereafter  The act cannot be used to put people through the   FOIA process for obtaining information when that information has already been determined to           January 29-30, 2002 Page 132 of 194  be public There is a specific provision that says that, once an agency has acted on a request for   a particular type of information, the agency has to make it available if there is reason to believe   that others would be interested in that or similar information   No We had the ability to prevail until the Committee changed its   practice with regard to the release of its policy decision  Once you release the decision you must   release the vote     Correct   Well, I don’t see how we could  We would have to show that to   release it before the minutes are released is going to cause the government financial harm     Right  The reason we didn’t have to release the directive before   1994 was that we argued, and prevailed, that we couldn’t release the directive before the Desk   fully implemented the FOMC’s decision because it would cause the government financial harm      January 29-30, 2002 Page 133 of 194  Whether that was right or wrong, that’s what we argued, and the Court agreed to it  In 1994,   when we initiated the practice of making the policy decision public, we abandoned that   argument; and once the decision is public, then the vote is public  Now, we could make anyone   who asks for the vote tally go through the process of filing a FOIA request; using the act that   way would get us ten days maybe before we would have to release the vote  But we would be   using the act in a way that it was not intended   If we have a request under the Freedom of Information Act, yes      Under the Committee’s current procedures, when the Committee   releases the minutes the reason for your dissent is in the minutes   He need not  But if he chooses to, of course—   The answer is “no”    You’re not required to release the argument   Correct     January 29-30, 2002 Page 141 of 194  I’d have to look at that  But there is a prescribed timetable; you   have ten or fifteen days in which you have to make a response to a FOIA request  So if you   could get the minutes out within that time period, technically you could follow that procedure     January 29-30, 2002 Page 147 of 194  No, technically—I’d have to look at this more closely—you can do   it for every vote at every meeting    "
7479,2004-01-27,MATTINGLY,  It’s not required  
7558,2004-06-29,MATTINGLY,  After one year!  [Laughter]  [Applause]
