  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Our view is a little less optimistic than  the Board's staff  We would estimate real GNP at about 3 percent, inflation close to 8, and  unemployment at about 6      Mr Chairman, we would agree with the prescription outlined by Mr  Mayo 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 on M1, which would put the midpoint at the upper end of the long-term  range; 6 to 10 on M2; and 7-3/4 to 8-1/4 on fed funds, moving immediately to 8 percent      Yes, Mr Chairman We would support an increase in the federal funds rate to 10-1/2 percent We also believe that there should be an adjustment upward in the discount rate by at least 1/2 percentage point on [the basis of the widening gap] but there are other good reasons to boost the discount rate as well   Mr Chairman, there is little that I can add to what has already been said Our position with respect to wage and price policy would be identical to what Bob Forrestal has enunciated  With respect to taxes we, too, think that a cut is inevitable and would prefer to see it come late in 1981 if possible On the long-run targets for 1980, our preference would be to maintain the existing [ranges] For 1981, we would favor some slight reduction   Kansas City agrees Mr Chairman, we had one question You mentioned a reduction in the ranges Does that mean on both the top and the bottom?  One would assume that it would imply both the top and the bottom   Mr Chairman, it is our view that alternative B might result in a more rapid run-up in interest rates than might be desirable On the other hand, alternative A would push M2 above the top of its range, which might not be desirable from a perception standpoint, particularly with all the attention being given lately to the ranges established by the Committee So for those reasons, we would tend to favor the ranges that were suggested by President Solomon, [about] 6 percent for M-1A, around 7-1/2 percent for M-1B, and about 9 percent for M2   No sir, the Tenth  I'll let you have that privilege, sir
