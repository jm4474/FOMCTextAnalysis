515,1977-10-17,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I agree very much with what President Morris  said  I would add this one thought  There seems to be a rather substantial difference of view in  the Committee as to what is most likely to jeopardize real economic activity  There is a cogent  concern that a further increase in interest rates will do that, and I think if you accept that point of  view, then the policy that falls from that is a perfect and natural consequence  We feel, and I  think it’s very much along the lines of what you mentioned in one of your points earlier, that it’s  the public’s uncertainty and concern for inflation that is responsible for the building up of money  balances, that is responsible for much of the concern that we see  And as a result, our feeling is  that almost the best way to guarantee a slower rate of growth in the economy than we would like  to see, a higher rate of unemployment than we would like to see, is to have the public feel that  we really aren’t going to control the aggregates and, therefore, inflation  As a result of that, I  would much prefer the aggregates numbers given under alternative C, although I am not sure that  I wouldn’t be happy with Frank’s suggestion for the federal funds rate, which would be 6-1/2 to  7 rather than 6-3/4 to 7-1/4  "
