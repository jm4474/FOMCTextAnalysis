3647,1989-03-28," Regionally, the labor markets in the Third District have continued to tighten The unemployment rate this quarter for the three states represented in the District is estimated to be the lowest it has been in 19 years We'd be happy to borrow some employees from whatever Districts seem to have some available Businesses are reporting a shortage of labor across an increasing number of categories and that includes skilled and unskilled workers And we're starting to hear about shortages in the professional area, including engineers Prices and wages continue to increase at levels above the national average We also see some early signs for our regional outlook of more moderate growth in the near term, but not a level moderate enough to reduce substantially the pressures on both labor markets and prices  On the national scene, we feel the staff estimates are relatively reasonable We probably see more risks on the up side, particularly for inflation That concludes my report   I probably come out where Vice Chairman Corrigan comes out, somewhere between ""B"" and ""C"" But I certainly would be able to live with ""B"" with an asymmetric guideline I am very sensitive to the points that President Melzer brought up about how we're going to get out of this cycle of reacting to each of the numbers that comes out One of the ways to get out of that is to be ahead of that; and that's why I'd probably prefer to be between ""B"" and ""C"" But, for all the reasons stated, I think there is some reason to pause at this point and to be a bit more conservative So, I could support ""B"" with an asymmetric guideline "
6386,2000-05-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Third District's economy is   continuing to grow, with accelerating employment growth and a declining unemployment   rate, which just brings us to about the national average  Recently we completed a series of   meetings with bankers and businesspeople throughout our District, and the message is the   same  They are all complaining about the difficulty of finding qualified workers    Manufacturing activity has continued to expand, based on our May business outlook survey,   which will not be publicly released until this Thursday  Although new orders and shipments   were not as strong as in the previous month, the levels reported in May remain solidly positive   and are not much different than earlier in the year   Retailers in our District reported moderate year-over-year gains in sales in March and   April and slightly lower gains than earlier in the year  Auto dealers continue to report rapid   sales, which they attribute to manufacturers’ incentives and higher consumer incomes    Residential housing activity has continued at quite a brisk pace overall even though some   builders are reporting a modest slowdown from the pace earlier this year  Bankers, however,   are expecting a slowdown in housing activity during the next six months  Nonresidential   construction is not as strong as it was a year ago, although it picked up somewhat in   Pennsylvania and Delaware in the first part of this year  Central Pennsylvania, for instance,   has had a significant increase in construction of materials handling and distribution facilities    Real estate contacts are still quite optimistic that nonresidential construction will remain fairly   strong   Turning to wages and prices in the District, many businesses report paying higher   wages because of the tight labor markets  The frequency of such reports has been rising over   time  Businesses also report paying higher import prices  Retailers are talking more about      50  cost pressures and a desire to raise prices than they were last year  And our business outlook   survey this month is again recording a very high index of prices paid by manufacturers  That   survey’s index of prices received by manufacturers, however, is noticeably lower this month   than it was in April, suggesting that our region’s manufacturers are still having difficulty   charging higher prices to their customers   In general, recent business sentiment is not as optimistic about the outlook as it was   a few months ago  Even though we continue to hear impressive anecdotal stories about   farmers and businesses coming up with innovative ideas to improve productivity, business   people now sound more cautious  They don't expect as much economic growth six months   from now and they are also expressing more concern about rising inflation   Turning to the national scene, aggregate demand is still growing faster than supply   despite impressive year-to-year gains in productivity  Consumer spending in particular has   shown little sign of slowing to a more sustainable pace  Although our staff’s outlook is not as   pessimistic as the Greenbook in terms of its inflation projections, we agree that it is unlikely   that demand will slow sufficiently to forestall further increases in inflationary pressures   without additional Committee action   Now, how much the Committee will ultimately need to move will depend on   whether or not we feel we are behind the curve  In that regard, I take some comfort from the   fact that so far there has been little upward movement in survey measures of long-term   expected inflation  Although expectations of inflation over the next year have generally risen   in recent months, expectations of longer-run inflation have not  For instance, our Reserve   Bank’s most recent survey of professional forecasters, which will be publicly released next   Monday, shows that the median of expected consumer price inflation over the next ten years      51  remained at 2-1/2 percent  That’s the same reading as in the first quarter and in fact about the   same reading as those over the past two years  Similarly, the Michigan survey’s measure of   expected inflation over the next five to ten years remains unchanged this past month at 28   percent  And Michigan's measure of expected long-run inflation has not changed a great deal   during the past year or so  The stability of these measures of long-run expected inflation   suggests that people expect the FOMC to keep inflation under control over the long run,   which leads me to conclude that we still have the opportunity to take action to prevent recent   higher monthly inflation numbers from becoming embedded in expectations  Thank you, Mr   Chairman      Mr Chairman, I support both parts of your recommendation  I   think a larger action by the Committee today will forestall any rise in longer-term      94  expectations of inflation  And in my view, not moving the funds rate up 50 basis points   probably would lead to long-term expectations of some increase in inflation        "
6410,2000-06-27,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Some signs of slower growth have begun   to emerge in the District’s economy since our last meeting, most notably in manufacturing  The   region’s manufacturing activity slowed sharply in June based on reports concerning both   shipments and new orders  Other sectors where modest signs of slowing have occurred include   retail, banking, and both residential and nonresidential construction  Employment growth has   also slowed recently  Nevertheless, the District’s economy overall continues to operate at a   high level and labor markets remain very tight  Unemployment rates in the District are now   slightly below the national average  Anecdotal evidence suggests that tight labor markets are   increasingly perceived by businesses as a constraint on growth  Our District’s ocean resort   areas, which normally rely on US students to fill summer job openings, have needed to bring   in foreign workers and to recruit senior citizens to offset the shortage of available students    Businesses continue to report upward pressure on wages  In addition, increases in health care   costs are often mentioned as an even greater concern  Manufacturers continue to report rising   input prices, but many still note the inability to pass on these rising costs because of competitive   pressures  Some manufacturers, however, have been able to put through what they call selected   moderate price increases and some have reported adding surcharges to their base prices based   on specific input cost increases  Other manufacturers have responded to higher input prices by   searching for lower cost suppliers, primarily through the use of the Internet, as a way to   maintain profit margins             51  Comments from business people around the District suggest that good economic   times have made people less wary about the riskiness of some business ventures  A principal   with a venture capital firm reported that there are still plenty of investors looking to put their   money at risk and plenty of entrepreneurs, primarily in technology, looking to take investors’   money  But, there is at least some greater attention being paid to how those ventures might   become profitable  Our contact said he believes the days of irrational exuberance are over and   now we just have exuberance  A banker noted that he believes the economy is near a turning   point based on his investment index  He observed that when one sees doctors and lawyers   investing in and opening new restaurants, a slowdown is usually around the corner  [Laughter]    Other bankers have noted that business borrowers are more frequently falling short of their   revenue targets and profit projections than they were a year ago  Despite these concerns about   risk-taking and despite recent signs of slower growth, most businesses are optimistic that the   region’s economy will continue to grow at a good pace during the rest of the year   Turning to the nation, our economic outlook for the remainder of the year and for   2001 is similar to the Greenbook’s in terms of real GDP growth and the unemployment rate    We are slightly more optimistic about core inflation but agree that monetary policy will have to   tighten further before we are through  The signs of slower growth in the recent monthly   economic data for the nation are encouraging but not conclusive  In past years in this expansion   we have seen signs of a slowdown and then the economy has rebounded and grown very   strongly again  So, it’s too early to say that the economy is definitely slowing to a sustainable   pace and that inflationary pressures are abating  Most measures of inflation over the past twelve   months are higher than they were a year ago, suggesting that we ought not be complacent that   inflation will not accelerate  What’s more, the most recent increases in oil and gasoline prices           52  will mean higher CPI and PPI inflation figures in the months ahead  In my view the risks of   greater inflationary pressures, potentially leading to expectations of increasing longer-run   inflation, remain our primary concern  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  Particularly in light   of the action taken at the last meeting and also because the forecast of long-run expected   inflation has remained stable, I think we have time to take a look at whether the economy is   truly slowing at this point  Thank you  "
7717,2006-03-27,"  No, I’m not a newcomer  [Laughter]     Thank you, Mr Chairman, and welcome back  And welcome to the new   Governors  First, I’d like to make a couple of comments on the region before I talk about the   national economy  The Third District didn’t see a fourth quarter as weak as the national economy,   nor is our first quarter as strong  But we’re seeing solid growth, which our indicators tell us will   continue at current rates for the foreseeable future   Payroll employment is a particular issue in our District  With the benchmark revisions that   were made, our employment growth has been stronger than we originally estimated  Our three-state   unemployment rate fell to 44 percent in January, and businesses report an increasingly difficult   time finding qualified workers  Indeed, more than half the respondents to a special question on our   manufacturing survey said that they were having trouble filling openings because of the lack of   qualified applicants  That’s an increase from 40 percent when we asked that question two years   ago  Firms report the greatest difficulty in finding production workers and computer-savvy   employees, but I would go on to point out that one of our directors, who heads a temporary   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 62 of 167       employment agency, has been reporting for the past two years a continuing difficulty in finding   workers with even limited skills to deploy   Manufacturing in our area continues to expand at a moderate pace  After a temporary dip in   January, the index in our survey has rebounded to the level consistent with last summer, and that   level is consistent with moderate expansion in activity   Retail sales in our District are rising only modestly, but retailers tell us that weaknesses in   February were weather-related and that they expect a pickup in April  Demand for nonresidential   office space in the District is growing, and that’s unusual for our market  The office market   absorption rate is rising in the Philadelphia metropolitan area, and the office vacancy rate is   declining in both the city and the suburbs  We had some office building in the last couple of years,   which is the first office building we’ve had in downtown Philadelphia in a decade  We are seeing a   few signs of modest slowdown in housing markets, with permits, home sales, and mortgage lending   softening in recent months   Finally, we have received some further welcome news of moderation in price pressures in   the District  Our manufacturers’ survey measures of prices received and prices paid have fallen   sharply over the past two months  Expectations of future price increases remain subdued, and   several respondents told us that, in their view, input price pressures have settled down and that their   inflation concerns have subsided   Turning to the national economy, our economic outlook is broadly consistent with the   Greenbook baseline  All signs point to a strong rebound of growth this quarter, after the temporary   weakness in the fourth quarter  Employment, business spending, and manufacturing remain strong,   and consumer spending continues to increase at a solid pace  There are emerging signs that the   housing market is beginning to cool off, but no signs of a sharp retrenchment at this point  The   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 63 of 167       economic fundamentals remain solid, and after the rebound this quarter, we expect growth to settle   down to a range of 3 percent to 3½ percent, near potential growth  The economy is expected to   remain near full employment, with labor markets tight  We expect hourly compensation growth to   accelerate somewhat over the forecast period, but not dramatically   Now, in my view, the risks to growth are roughly balanced  A sharper decline in the   housing market than that built into our forecast poses some downside risk, but it’s also possible that   housing will not turn down as much as or as soon as forecasted  The extent to which we see an   improvement or further deterioration in exports is another risk that could go either way  In fact,   there appears to be a considerable divergence of views on the path of net exports among private-  sector forecasters     In my view, the inflation risks are tilted somewhat to the upside  It’s true that the data on   core inflation and inflation expectations and our own recent decline in survey measures of prices   paid and received are encouraging  The acceleration of core inflation at the end of 2005 has been   reversed in the first months of 2006  So far, firms have had a remarkable ability to absorb cost   shocks via new-found productivity gains, and increased global competition has limited their pricing   power  Both have helped keep inflation in check  On the other hand, oil prices remain at high   levels and continue to be volatile  The ability of firms to maintain low pass-through in the presence   of continued higher costs is a question  With inflation running near the top of the range that I   consider consistent with price stability and with the economy operating at high levels of resource   utilization, there is a risk that strong inflation pressures could emerge  Several times in the past we   have seen core inflation quickly rise by a sizable amount when the economy was operating at high   levels of resource utilization following periods of accommodative monetary policy, even when oil   prices did not rise sharply  So in my view, the inflation risks remain at least moderately on the   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 64 of 167       upside, even though the recent data have been benign  That said, on the whole I think the economy   and the economic outlook are very positive  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support a ¼ point increase in the federal   funds rate  I think, as we said yesterday, the risks to growth are balanced  Risks to inflation are   moderately tilted to the upside, with core inflation near the top of the range that I feel   comfortable with  Any positive aggregate demand shock could send inflation higher than we’d   like  I think that the Committee is probably close to the end of a tightening cycle, whether it’s   25 basis points or 50 basis points away  In looking at those risks, I think that there is a greater   risk to ending hikes at a level that turns out to be too low than the risk of ending at a level that   turns out to be a little too high    I support the language in alternative B  I am a bit concerned about the interpretation   that may say that the expectations are for two more increases  I came in today supporting the   final language that came out in alternative B after the modifications  I now think it’s important   to keep the word “possible” in the language because, if we take that out, people may almost   certainly believe that we’re looking at greater concerns about inflation than I think we’ve   indicated in our discussion  So it’s important to keep the word “possible” in the discussions, and   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 122 of 167       I would keep the rest of the language the same  But certainly in the future the phrasing is going   to be very important, particularly at the May meeting  Thank you   "
7741,2006-05-10,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity in the Third District continues to   advance at a solid pace  Growth in our region has been steadier than in the nation over the past two   quarters  Payroll employment grew in each of the three states through March, and the three-state   unemployment rate is now 4½ percent  Our business contacts in the region report increased difficulty in   filling open positions  In addition, our employment diffusion index in the business outlook survey rose   sharply in April  Regional manufacturing activity continues to expand at a moderate pace  In response   to a special survey question in April, the majority of participants said that underlying demand for their   products was increasing   On the retail side, performance looks solid  Some of that is seasonal  On the auto side, sales   have picked up slightly, but we see some small dealerships actually going out of business  Our retailers   have expressed less concern than I’ve heard around the table about the impact of gasoline prices on their   sales going forward   While initial reports of nonresidential construction contracts in our region have declined in   recent months, demand for office and industrial space in the District continues to strengthen  The office   market absorption rate is rising in the Philadelphia metropolitan area, and vacancy rates are declining in   May 10, 2006 45 of 120    both the city and the suburbs  Results of the special survey conducted by the Reserve Bank suggest that   commercial construction activity is somewhat softer in our District than in the nation as a whole    Nonetheless, our contacts do see a stronger picture this year than they did last year  In the residential   sector, home sales have slowed since the winter  Inventories and time on the market have increased    Demand has fallen particularly for higher-priced homes, more so than for lower-priced homes, and   house-price appreciation is slowing in our region     Prices for industrial goods are rising, and construction firms are reporting some shortages of   structural materials  Some area builders are starting to stockpile copper, aluminum, and steel for   upcoming projects  Employers in a number of industries in our region report that they have paid higher   salaries for workers this year compared with hires in similar positions last year  At this time of the year,   we usually are traveling around the District and conferring with bankers and other businesses as we’re   doing our annual field meetings  Over the past week, we were in the typically most depressed areas of   our District—the far western part of our District—and for the first time in many years I was hearing   optimism about the future and reports of an actual substantial decline in the unemployment rates in those   areas   Turning to the national conditions, our economic outlook is broadly consistent with the   Greenbook baseline  However, we see somewhat more economic strength and somewhat higher   inflation going forward  We also note that many forecasters have also revised up their forecasts of the   second quarter based on the strength of incoming data  Business spending and manufacturing continue   to show strength  Notwithstanding the April unemployment report, which came in lower than expected,   employment remains strong  Monthly gains have accelerated to an average of 173,000 jobs this year,   compared with 165,000 last year  Employment growth will support consumer spending even as house-  price appreciation slows  The rising gasoline prices will have a damping effect but probably not a   May 10, 2006 46 of 120    dramatic one  There are no signs of a sharp retrenchment in housing  So far, the slowing has been   orderly  With the economy expected to remain at full employment and with labor markets tight, we   expect hourly compensation growth to accelerate over the forecast period, but not dramatically so   I recognize that higher oil prices and higher long-term interest rates pose a downside risk to   growth and that the downturn in housing and the monetary policy tightening already in the pipeline   could prove to be a bigger drag than anticipated  But in my view, given the underlying strength of the   economy, the risks to growth are roughly balanced or perhaps even tilted modestly to the upside   I have somewhat more concern about inflation over the intermeeting period  It’s true that we   haven’t seen an acceleration in core inflation measured year over year  But at shorter horizons, as has   been previously mentioned, we’ve seen a marked uptick in core inflation  In addition, inflation forecasts   have been revised up, reflecting the recent higher-than-expected inflation data and the view that higher   oil prices might add to inflationary pressures  Longer-run inflation expectations, as measured by the   TIPS and the Michigan survey, as reported earlier, are apparently up somewhat, which is troubling to   me  Higher productivity growth will help to keep inflation in check  With inflation running at the top of   the range that I consider consistent with price stability and with the economy operating at high levels of   resource utilization, there’s a risk that stronger inflation pressures could emerge  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Given that I see the risk to growth as reasonably   balanced and the risk to inflation as slightly more to the upside, I support raising the funds rate 25 basis   points  With resource utilization at high levels and core inflation near the top of the range I consider   consistent with price stability, any positive aggregate demand shock could result in inflation higher than   we would like  So I think that we should take some action today to lean against this possibility, and I   see that 25 basis points would do that  I don’t sense right now that we’re behind the curve and that we   need to do more   I think the funds rate is approaching the level that’s consistent with stable inflation and growth at   potential, but I’m not sure whether today’s move will be the last or when the next move will be required    That will depend on what the incoming data tell us about where the economy is headed and our   assessment of the risk to that forecast   There has been a perception by some, and it’s been discussed around the table, that the FOMC   often makes one or two moves too many  At the last meeting, I said I would rather accept the risk of   taking one or two moves too many than of coming up short  The risk associated with this would be   May 10, 2006 90 of 120    magnified if it proved difficult for the FOMC to reverse itself, should it perceive ex post that rates have   been raised too high  We recently did a study to look at our past behavior, and the staff analysis shows   that there have been numerous episodes in which the FOMC has paused and then continued along the   policy path and even paused and reversed course  So that gives me some comfort that we have the   flexibility to take the appropriate actions based on incoming data   Turning to the language, I had about three pages worth of material, most of which I can throw   away  I think alternative B comes very close to the language that I think appropriate  I have some   sympathy with President Lacker’s and President Moskow’s comments that leaving the phrase about   inflation expectations the way it was in the last meeting does not fairly represent the tenor of the   discussion today  Balancing that a little is the change in the language in row 4, which now addresses the   inflation issue more head-on and thus shows the change in the tenor of the discussion a bit  But we   certainly would not want the markets to perceive a lower policy path by reading that in the language,   and maybe the inflation expectations phrase might do that  That concludes my comments     Even though I said I certainly would think about it, I am satisfied from what I have   heard around the table about the balance between part 4 and part 3  The probability is of doing more harm   than good with changing that, and so even modest changes in the wording are probably not worth making  "
7768,2006-06-28,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity in the Third District is also   moderating in the second quarter  Our pattern is similar to that of the nation, but the District had   less acceleration in the first quarter and less deceleration in the second quarter     Payroll employment growth in our three states is slowing  The unemployment rate has   edged up slightly over the past several months, but the unemployment rate in most of the District’s   labor markets is still lower than a year ago  Our business contacts still report some difficulty in   filling open positions, and a quarter of the respondents to a special question in our Business Outlook   Survey of Manufacturers say that the increases in wage rates needed to attract new hires this year   are higher than they were last year    Regional manufacturing activity continues to expand at a moderate pace, but the indexes for   new orders and shipments were up noticeably after a one-month slump in May  Despite this   improvement, our manufacturers’ expectations about future activity have deteriorated  While they   still plan to add to payrolls and expand capacity over the next six months, they have moderated   these plans since the beginning of the year   At the last meeting, I reported that, in contrast to other Districts, retailers in our region did   not express much concern that higher gasoline prices would eat into their sales; that view has   changed  Conditions in our construction sector are similar to what I reported at our last meeting    Nonresidential construction continues to strengthen, but the acceleration doesn’t appear to be as   strong as elsewhere in the nation  In contrast, residential construction in our three states has been   flat this year, and home sales are down  Thus far the slowing in our region looks to be an orderly   process   Unfortunately, consumer prices in the Philadelphia region appear to be increasing at a faster   pace than those in the nation as a whole, primarily because of a larger increase in housing costs in   June 28-29, 2006 59 of 177    the Philadelphia metropolitan area than in the nation  In addition, our manufacturers report that   industrial price pressures have increased in recent months  Fortunately, we do not see a similar   acceleration in labor costs, although the increases we are seeing in the Northeast are somewhat   higher than in other parts in the country   In summary, current conditions and the outlook in our region continue to be positive, but the   rate of expansion is expected to be somewhat more modest than we’ve seen over the past year    Price pressures continue to be a concern in our region   Turning to the national front, I would characterize the outlook in a similar way  Our growth   forecast is similar to the Greenbook’s for 2006  We expect a significant slowing in activity in the   second quarter followed by a pickup during the second half of the year to a pace that is slightly   below potential  The slowdown in housing and high gasoline prices contribute to a slowdown in   consumer spending, and the lagged effects of rising short-term interest rates and higher oil prices   keep real growth slightly below potential   Our forecast for 2007 differs somewhat from the Greenbook  We see growth in 2007   slightly below that in 2006, whereas the Greenbook sees growth slowing appreciably  In our view,   there has been more underlying strength in the economy  For example, we attribute more of the   second-quarter slowdown to temporary factors  We are more optimistic than the Greenbook about   employment growth  We see nonfarm payroll growth averaging a good deal more than the   Greenbook forecast  We see unemployment rising to 51 percent by the fourth quarter of next year   Our inflation outlook is less optimistic than the Greenbook’s partly because we see less   slowing of aggregate demand  We do not see core PCE inflation decelerating next year  We think   the economy has been operating and will continue to operate slightly beyond full employment over   the next several quarters and that foreign price competition will ease as the dollar depreciates  So   June 28-29, 2006 60 of 177    despite our view that the indirect effects of the sharp rise in energy prices will wane in 2007, we   expect core inflation not to decelerate  We do see some deceleration in 2008, but that is because we   built in a slightly higher path for interest rates than that in the Greenbook forecast    Of course, there are risks to the forecast  Most of them have been mentioned; but in our   view, the risks to growth, even at our higher level of growth, are roughly balanced  In contrast, the   inflation risks are slightly to the upside  As people have noted, core inflation has accelerated in   recent months, and it is above the range I consider consistent with price stability  Should aggregate   demand moderate less than expected, there is a risk that strong inflation pressures could emerge  At   this point, I believe that longer-run inflation expectations remain anchored, and our forecast is   predicated on monetary policy ensuring that the recent high inflation readings do not raise   longer-term expectations   This is likely my last meeting, but for sure I’ll be watching carefully as we go forward  I   have confidence that the Committee, along with the new Philadelphia president, will do a good job   to make sure that inflation expectations remain anchored  I’d like to thank the Chairman, the   participants, and the rest of this staff for how well you have treated me over the past three meetings    I have to remember that I made the statement in June 2000 that it would be my last meeting, so I say   “in the foreseeable future” [laughter] it will be my last meeting  Thank you very much     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support raising the funds rate 25 basis points,   both on the merits and for our credibility  On the merits, I think that certainly, as we discussed   yesterday, the risks to growth are higher than they were at the May meeting but inflation risk and   the recent news on inflation are certainly tilted to the upside  So on the merits, I support an   increase  On the credibility side, the markets’ expectations are built as much on what we’ve said   as on what they read in the economic numbers, and we need to follow through on those   expectations  I think it would be a mistake not to    Now, as to the wording, I have to admit I’ve been torn  The simulations that the staff ran   were relatively sobering  There’s likely a greater probability of needing to raise rates further, but   I don’t think we’re ready to use the language in alternative C; it just doesn’t send the right   message at this point  I think there is an amount of uncertainty  I could spend a lot of time   tinkering with the language in alternative B, but I’m prepared to support the language in   alternative B the way it is  Thank you   "
