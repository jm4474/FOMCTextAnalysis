787,1989-03-28," Regionally, the labor markets in the Third District have continued to tighten The unemployment rate this quarter for the three states represented in the District is estimated to be the lowest it has been in 19 years We'd be happy to borrow some employees from whatever Districts seem to have some available Businesses are reporting a shortage of labor across an increasing number of categories and that includes skilled and unskilled workers And we're starting to hear about shortages in the professional area, including engineers Prices and wages continue to increase at levels above the national average We also see some early signs for our regional outlook of more moderate growth in the near term, but not a level moderate enough to reduce substantially the pressures on both labor markets and prices  On the national scene, we feel the staff estimates are relatively reasonable We probably see more risks on the up side, particularly for inflation That concludes my report "
788,1989-03-28," I probably come out where Vice Chairman Corrigan comes out, somewhere between ""B"" and ""C"" But I certainly would be able to live with ""B"" with an asymmetric guideline I am very sensitive to the points that President Melzer brought up about how we're going to get out of this cycle of reacting to each of the numbers that comes out One of the ways to get out of that is to be ahead of that; and that's why I'd probably prefer to be between ""B"" and ""C"" But, for all the reasons stated, I think there is some reason to pause at this point and to be a bit more conservative So, I could support ""B"" with an asymmetric guideline "
5903,2000-05-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Third District's economy is   continuing to grow, with accelerating employment growth and a declining unemployment   rate, which just brings us to about the national average  Recently we completed a series of   meetings with bankers and businesspeople throughout our District, and the message is the   same  They are all complaining about the difficulty of finding qualified workers    Manufacturing activity has continued to expand, based on our May business outlook survey,   which will not be publicly released until this Thursday  Although new orders and shipments   were not as strong as in the previous month, the levels reported in May remain solidly positive   and are not much different than earlier in the year   Retailers in our District reported moderate year-over-year gains in sales in March and   April and slightly lower gains than earlier in the year  Auto dealers continue to report rapid   sales, which they attribute to manufacturers’ incentives and higher consumer incomes    Residential housing activity has continued at quite a brisk pace overall even though some   builders are reporting a modest slowdown from the pace earlier this year  Bankers, however,   are expecting a slowdown in housing activity during the next six months  Nonresidential   construction is not as strong as it was a year ago, although it picked up somewhat in   Pennsylvania and Delaware in the first part of this year  Central Pennsylvania, for instance,   has had a significant increase in construction of materials handling and distribution facilities    Real estate contacts are still quite optimistic that nonresidential construction will remain fairly   strong   Turning to wages and prices in the District, many businesses report paying higher   wages because of the tight labor markets  The frequency of such reports has been rising over   time  Businesses also report paying higher import prices  Retailers are talking more about      50  cost pressures and a desire to raise prices than they were last year  And our business outlook   survey this month is again recording a very high index of prices paid by manufacturers  That   survey’s index of prices received by manufacturers, however, is noticeably lower this month   than it was in April, suggesting that our region’s manufacturers are still having difficulty   charging higher prices to their customers   In general, recent business sentiment is not as optimistic about the outlook as it was   a few months ago  Even though we continue to hear impressive anecdotal stories about   farmers and businesses coming up with innovative ideas to improve productivity, business   people now sound more cautious  They don't expect as much economic growth six months   from now and they are also expressing more concern about rising inflation   Turning to the national scene, aggregate demand is still growing faster than supply   despite impressive year-to-year gains in productivity  Consumer spending in particular has   shown little sign of slowing to a more sustainable pace  Although our staff’s outlook is not as   pessimistic as the Greenbook in terms of its inflation projections, we agree that it is unlikely   that demand will slow sufficiently to forestall further increases in inflationary pressures   without additional Committee action   Now, how much the Committee will ultimately need to move will depend on   whether or not we feel we are behind the curve  In that regard, I take some comfort from the   fact that so far there has been little upward movement in survey measures of long-term   expected inflation  Although expectations of inflation over the next year have generally risen   in recent months, expectations of longer-run inflation have not  For instance, our Reserve   Bank’s most recent survey of professional forecasters, which will be publicly released next   Monday, shows that the median of expected consumer price inflation over the next ten years      51  remained at 2-1/2 percent  That’s the same reading as in the first quarter and in fact about the   same reading as those over the past two years  Similarly, the Michigan survey’s measure of   expected inflation over the next five to ten years remains unchanged this past month at 28   percent  And Michigan's measure of expected long-run inflation has not changed a great deal   during the past year or so  The stability of these measures of long-run expected inflation   suggests that people expect the FOMC to keep inflation under control over the long run,   which leads me to conclude that we still have the opportunity to take action to prevent recent   higher monthly inflation numbers from becoming embedded in expectations  Thank you, Mr   Chairman  "
5904,2000-05-16,"   Mr Chairman, I support both parts of your recommendation  I   think a larger action by the Committee today will forestall any rise in longer-term      94  expectations of inflation  And in my view, not moving the funds rate up 50 basis points   probably would lead to long-term expectations of some increase in inflation        "
5956,2000-06-27,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Some signs of slower growth have begun   to emerge in the District’s economy since our last meeting, most notably in manufacturing  The   region’s manufacturing activity slowed sharply in June based on reports concerning both   shipments and new orders  Other sectors where modest signs of slowing have occurred include   retail, banking, and both residential and nonresidential construction  Employment growth has   also slowed recently  Nevertheless, the District’s economy overall continues to operate at a   high level and labor markets remain very tight  Unemployment rates in the District are now   slightly below the national average  Anecdotal evidence suggests that tight labor markets are   increasingly perceived by businesses as a constraint on growth  Our District’s ocean resort   areas, which normally rely on US students to fill summer job openings, have needed to bring   in foreign workers and to recruit senior citizens to offset the shortage of available students    Businesses continue to report upward pressure on wages  In addition, increases in health care   costs are often mentioned as an even greater concern  Manufacturers continue to report rising   input prices, but many still note the inability to pass on these rising costs because of competitive   pressures  Some manufacturers, however, have been able to put through what they call selected   moderate price increases and some have reported adding surcharges to their base prices based   on specific input cost increases  Other manufacturers have responded to higher input prices by   searching for lower cost suppliers, primarily through the use of the Internet, as a way to   maintain profit margins             51  Comments from business people around the District suggest that good economic   times have made people less wary about the riskiness of some business ventures  A principal   with a venture capital firm reported that there are still plenty of investors looking to put their   money at risk and plenty of entrepreneurs, primarily in technology, looking to take investors’   money  But, there is at least some greater attention being paid to how those ventures might   become profitable  Our contact said he believes the days of irrational exuberance are over and   now we just have exuberance  A banker noted that he believes the economy is near a turning   point based on his investment index  He observed that when one sees doctors and lawyers   investing in and opening new restaurants, a slowdown is usually around the corner  [Laughter]    Other bankers have noted that business borrowers are more frequently falling short of their   revenue targets and profit projections than they were a year ago  Despite these concerns about   risk-taking and despite recent signs of slower growth, most businesses are optimistic that the   region’s economy will continue to grow at a good pace during the rest of the year   Turning to the nation, our economic outlook for the remainder of the year and for   2001 is similar to the Greenbook’s in terms of real GDP growth and the unemployment rate    We are slightly more optimistic about core inflation but agree that monetary policy will have to   tighten further before we are through  The signs of slower growth in the recent monthly   economic data for the nation are encouraging but not conclusive  In past years in this expansion   we have seen signs of a slowdown and then the economy has rebounded and grown very   strongly again  So, it’s too early to say that the economy is definitely slowing to a sustainable   pace and that inflationary pressures are abating  Most measures of inflation over the past twelve   months are higher than they were a year ago, suggesting that we ought not be complacent that   inflation will not accelerate  What’s more, the most recent increases in oil and gasoline prices           52  will mean higher CPI and PPI inflation figures in the months ahead  In my view the risks of   greater inflationary pressures, potentially leading to expectations of increasing longer-run   inflation, remain our primary concern  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
5957,2000-06-27,"  Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  Particularly in light   of the action taken at the last meeting and also because the forecast of long-run expected   inflation has remained stable, I think we have time to take a look at whether the economy is   truly slowing at this point  Thank you  "
