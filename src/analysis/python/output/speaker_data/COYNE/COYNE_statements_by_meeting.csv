28,1976-04-20,  Ed Dale took a look at the 1965 [Memorandum of Discussion]  That’s the  only reporter I know that has ever come in to take a look at that     4/20/76 - 59 -             That’s correct  
462,1977-08-16,"  The request originally came from the New York financial desk  The  editors there thought it would be a good idea to find out what the status of the 1972 minutes was   He had in mind the article [that] appeared in Fortune  So he asked the Washington bureau [of  the New York Times]--that simple--to find out what the status of the minutes was  The reporter  that was assigned to it was Bob Hershey  He drafted the letter; first he called us to find out what  the procedures were  We told him what the procedure was, so he drafted the letter, which this  gentlemen, Herbers, signed only because of his position as an editor at the Washington bureau     The response went back  The request was denied originally  Hershey happened to be on  vacation at the time, and when he returned, he found the denial there  He, at the time, was  getting ready to transfer to London, where he is now  He was under pressure to do some kind of  a column for the Times; this last week he happened to run into [former Federal Reserve]  Governor Holland at church one Sunday and asked him about it, and then filed his appeal  He  subsequently wrote a column on the subject, which did appear in the Times about a month or so  ago, early July, and the Times seemed up to this point to have lost interest ever since that story     8/16/77 - 59 -           appeared  But as Mr O’Connell pointed out, although they indicated to me that they didn’t want  to pursue it any further, anything that happens could affect their decision  So it seemed to be just  a perfectly legitimate inquiry which was satisfied     Not at the moment  I think that Governor Coldwell’s letter has possibly  held everything in abeyance     I could be wrong, but I don’t think the Times will take any further action     Not likely     Hershey  "
914,1978-12-19,  We do give out the schedule; we have for the last couple of years     
1190,1979-10-05," Peter, this is Joe Coyne We Will be Saying  ""absolutely ridiculous  "
1889,1981-07-17, This week 
1982,1981-12-21, I think they will go completely unnoticed I would bet that you would not get one request   Even when we have announced-- 
2010,1982-02-01," Yes, they do "
2193,1982-11-16," To be brief, my understanding is that the policy record, of course, comes out the Friday after the following meeting, and what that means is that we do not talk about what happened at that [earlier] meeting until that time There are very, very, few exceptions to that We can say we had a meeting; we can give the starting time and the closing time, and the attendance And that's it That has been my understanding since the Committee adopted the rules   No, we do not mention telephone meetings until they are reported in the policy record That is only for our face-to- face meetings   This is to the outside world   Yes, anybody in the outside world   If I might, Mr Chairman--   About the points the Chairman made, a lot of reporters will do a round robin and call as many people as they can and compare answers   The Secretary of the Treasury's comments were on Wednesday morning  SPEAKER(?) Yes, they were "
2854,1985-10-01, I don't think they'll see any difference 
3507,1988-10-17, Yes 
3809,1989-12-18, That was recirculated to the Committee in May of 1988 
3919,1990-07-02, It's the 24th 
4102,1991-02-01, We can make it effective today if you want 
4296,1991-09-13, Seven 
4553,1992-07-02," Mr Chairman, typically we release each Reserve Bank's action as it comes in For example, if we got three or four    7/2/92  Reserve Banks in by 11 am, we'd release them separately "
4614,1992-11-17," It has been released to three reporters, one of whom used it   Market News Service used it last week; we had a few requests-- "
4779,1993-07-06, Yes   That's right; they are aware They call it [unintelligible] 
4872,1993-10-15, We sent it by pouch 
4989,1994-02-03," Oh, believe me, you will get asked! [Laughter]   I think it just takes a couple of minutes for the wires to get it on "
5171,1994-09-27," It will be something similar, I think, to what we did in July "
5273,1995-01-31," This goes back, I would say, 15 years when there was a lot of discussion in the press stemming from comments made by various members of the Committee both before and after an FOMC meeting Some of the papers liked to do a summary story immediately before the meeting They would do a round-robin, calling all 19 people They would compare answers and try to figure out what was going to happen We were asked to put together some informal guidelines These are not ""rules"" of the Committee They are simply guidelines that I have propagated to the Committee The purpose was to help the Committee deal with the press in sensitive periods One of the things we came up with, that the then-Chairman agreed with, was this blackout period People were not to talk to the press a week before and a week after a Committee meeting The purpose was to try to prevent all the speculation in the press and subsequently in the market about what the Committee would do Now, we still get that speculation, but we get it from commentators We do not get it from members of the Committee anymore It has worked to an extent It has not worked 100 percent But a lot of members of the Committee use the blackout period to avoid talking to the press during these sensitive periods   It has been very useful in my view If you are going to make the blackout period asymmetrical, I would say make it asymmetrical to the Friday following the meeting rather than for just two days If it is only two days, then everybody will jump on it after 48 hours, and we are still going to get a lot of different comments One of the problems is, if someone comments one way, as Mr Forrestal just said, somebody else is going to try to jump the other way Then we are going to get more and more people commenting   That is right   Someone asked whether it just covered monetary policy It was supposed to cover monetary policy and the economy--  -35-    1/31-2/1/95  things that the Committee discusses when it is formulating monetary policy   Fine   No, you did not "

5688,1997-02-04," 430 pm   Our current practice is to release them at 430 pm on a Friday   Yes, we could Some options markets stay open beyond 400 pm "
