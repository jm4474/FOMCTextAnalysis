 Exhibit 4 addresses the role of productivity in holding down  inflation in the 1990s In the long run, a faster rate of productivity growth implies  faster growth of real wages and has no implications for inflation  But in the short-to­ medium run, we find evidence that productivity does affect inflation  This occurs  because, in the equations we examine, hourly compensation responds only gradually  when productivity accelerates In our view, the slow reaction of compensation stems  in large part from the costs that firms and workers face in acquiring and processing  information relevant to setting wages, as well as from other institutional features that  lead to inertia in wages more generally Firms’ and workers’ decisions about wages  depend on perceptions about conditions throughout the economy, and it may take  quite a bit of time for a change in economywide productivity growth to work its way  fully into economic conditions                    June 25-26, 2002 24 of 179  The sluggish adjustment of compensation implies that unit labor costs rise less  rapidly and profit margins increase following an acceleration in productivity, thereby  helping to hold down price inflation Put differently, faster productivity growth  allows a lower unemployment rate to be consistent with stable inflation  Although  this effect may be quite long lived, it is not permanent  Eventually the faster pace of  productivity growth becomes fully embedded in wage-setting behavior, and  productivity has no further effect on inflation   The blue line in the middle panel shows an estimate of structural productivity  growth—that is, productivity growth abstracting from purely cyclical movements that  tend not to affect firms’ pricing behavior  The measure shown here is similar, but not  identical, to the staff estimate of structural productivity growth built into the  Greenbook forecast The red line shows our estimate of the effect this productivity  growth has on the increase in compensation per hour  For our analysis, the  fundamental observation is that, when productivity growth picks up, the associated  compensation increases lag behind  Thus, when productivity growth increased in the  1990s, it took time for this increase to become incorporated in wage setting, and  increases in unit labor costs slowed, as evidenced by the widening gap between the  blue and red lines When productivity growth was declining in the 1970s, this  process worked in the opposite direction   The lower left panel presents one way to describe the influence of these  productivity-driven movements in unit labor costs on price inflation  The measure  plotted in the exhibit is the deviation in the unemployment rate from the long-run  natural rate that would be needed to maintain stable inflation in the face of these  productivity effects According to these estimates, the slowdown in productivity  growth in the 1970s generated upward pressure on inflation that would have required  a higher unemployment rate to offset  By contrast, in the 1990s, the productivity  acceleration allowed a lower unemployment rate to be consistent with stable inflation   As we indicated earlier, we would expect this effect of faster productivity growth on  inflation to be temporary, and the chart suggests that it may have about played itself  out by now However, the staff has assumed that a recovery in capital formation  going forward will again boost structural productivity growth, in which case some  further beneficial effect may occur for a while longer, before eventually returning to  zero   Although the evidence in favor of these productivity effects is compelling enough  to persuade us of their importance, we do not want to overstate the strength of that  evidence The lower right panel lists some caveats  First, the speed with which  changes in productivity growth influence wages is very uncertain  Many different  adjustment speeds fit the compensation data about equally well yet have noticeably  different implications for the dynamics of inflation  Moreover, the adjustment speed  might not be constant and might have been affected by changing compensation  practices in recent years  The effect of uncertainty about this adjustment speed, as  well as uncertainty about the other relevant parameters in our equations, is shown by              June 25-26, 2002 25 of 179  the shaded area in the bottom left panel, which presents a 70 percent confidence  interval around our estimates As can be seen, this confidence range is rather wide   Furthermore, this confidence interval understates the full amount of uncertainty, as it  omits, among other things, the sensitivity of our results to the measure of structural  productivity used   In exhibit 5, we delineate a number of recent labor market developments and their  possible implications for the natural rate of unemployment  The top panel groups  these developments in terms of the direction of their likely effect on the natural rate in  recent years  While this list may be incomplete, it identifies many of the key issues  that researchers have explored  As noted in the middle column, some of the more  familiar factors that may have had important effects on the natural rate historically—  such as the minimum wage, unemployment insurance, and shifts in the demographic  composition of the labor force—have had roughly neutral effects in recent years   The left-hand side of the middle panels of the exhibit presents indicators for a  number of factors that may have pushed down the natural rate in recent years  Two  developments—the rise in the incarcerated population, shown as the green line, and  the increase in the share of the working-age population collecting disability insurance,  the blue line—both work to reduce the natural rate for similar reasons  Both  developments lead to the withdrawal from the labor force of individuals who would  otherwise have had above-average rates of unemployment  The rise in employment  at temporary-help-supply firms—the red line—may cut both ways in terms of its  effect on the natural rate of unemployment  On the one hand, the availability of jobs  with temporary-help firms may make it easier for some individuals who would  otherwise be unemployed to find work  On the other hand, some individuals who  might otherwise have had more-stable full-time jobs are now in the temporary-help  sector, where they may end up being unemployed between assignments  On balance,  the unemployment-lowering effects probably dominate, but the net effect is likely to  have been small  Worker insecurity may have played a role in holding down wage  increases in recent years, thereby allowing unemployment to be lower than it  otherwise would have been  The middle right panel shows one survey-based measure  of worker insecurity This measure rose to a high level in the mid-1990s  It fell back  in the booming labor market of the late 1990s but remained at an elevated level   Returning again to the top panel and its left column, the fifth factor we list as possibly  holding down the natural rate is the improved job-matching made possible by the  Internet  While the Internet has helped many workers find jobs—and helped many  firms find workers—we suspect that the effect on unemployment so far has been  small, at least in part because Internet use is highest among better-educated workers,  who are less likely to be unemployed   One factor that may have worked to raise the natural rate in recent years is  welfare reform  As shown in the bottom left panel, the number of families receiving  welfare has dropped substantially since the mid-1990s  While surveys indicate that a  large majority of former welfare recipients have found jobs, these surveys also                        June 25-26, 2002 26 of 179  suggest that former welfare recipients are somewhat more likely to be classified as  unemployed—that is, looking for work—than when they were collecting welfare   The bottom right panel summarizes the implications of these developments for the  natural rate of unemployment  Our assessment—based on some rough calculations  informed by the available research on these effects—is that, demographics aside,  these developments may have reduced the natural rate about ½ percentage point  compared with the mid-1980s  As with most of the other results we are presenting  today, there is a high degree of uncertainty around this calculation  And reasonable  alternative assumptions about the unemployment consequences of these individual  developments could imply anything from no change at all in the natural rate to a  reduction of as much as a percentage point  One reason we don’t believe the shift is  much larger than ½ percentage point is that we have not observed large, persistent  errors in models of hourly compensation in recent years  If the natural rate had fallen  more significantly, not only price inflation but also compensation inflation would  have been surprisingly low in recent years, and this has not been the case   Your last exhibit shows simulations of the price-and-wage sector of the FRB/US  model to quantify the amount by which the shift in the conduct of monetary policy, a  faster rate of structural productivity growth, and favorable labor market developments  have held down core consumer price inflation over recent years  The calculation  involves comparing the predictions for core inflation from two simulations, each of  which starts in 1995 and runs through the first quarter of this year  In the first  simulation, all three of the factors we have highlighted today are included  In this  case, as indicated by the red line in the figure at the top left, the simulation has  inflation falling from 1995 to the present by about as much as inflation, on net, in fact  declined  In the second exercise, the three factors are omitted  That is, the pickup in  productivity growth is assumed not to have occurred, the ½ percentage point  reduction in the natural rate is removed, and inflation expectations are generated in a  manner consistent with the way monetary policy was conducted prior to the 1980s   The green line in the figure shows the model’s prediction that inflation, rather than  falling, would have risen more than 2 percentage points    Additional simulations were run to calculate the contribution of each factor  separately to the 3 percentage point difference between the most recent points on the  green and red curves, which correspond to the first quarter of this year  As seen to  the right, almost two-thirds of the difference is due to the pickup in productivity  growth, about one-quarter to labor market developments that have lowered the natural  rate, and only a small amount to the shift in monetary policy regimes  Of course, we  have emphasized throughout this briefing the uncertain nature of our analysis, and  these estimates must be taken in that spirit   As noted in the middle panel, we believe that there are some clear connections  between our analysis and the apparent view of many firms that they lack “pricing  power” in the low-inflation economy  This perception may be a natural consequence  of the creative destruction that has accompanied the productivity acceleration                  June 25-26, 2002 27 of 179  Because the benefits of productivity innovations are not spread equally across firms,  innovations create winners (such as Wal-Mart) and losers (such as Kmart), and the  participants in the accompanying competition, especially the losers, may naturally  view themselves as lacking pricing power in this environment  Furthermore, in our  view, an acceleration in productivity is likely to be followed initially by a rising profit  share as productivity moves up ahead of compensation and then a declining profit  share as compensation catches up and widened profit margins are competed away   The latter phase especially, which the data suggest has been under way in the past few  years, may be perceived as a period of declining pricing power Finally, a lack of  pricing power itself could arguably have played a role in driving the acceleration of  productivity  Greater competition associated with globalization, deregulation, and  low inflation may have contributed to an environment in which firms have less  pricing power This reduced pricing power could be a factor that spurs firms to be  especially aggressive in seeking new productivity-enhancing technologies   Looking ahead, our analysis indicates that part of the explanation for the  economy’s recent ability to experience both low inflation and low unemployment is  likely to continue and part of it may not  If monetary policy remains aggressive, the  smaller sensitivity of inflation to unemployment should continue  However, this does  not lower the rate of unemployment that is consistent with stable inflation  Similarly,  in our view, an increase in the growth rate of productivity will not permanently  reduce the rate of unemployment consistent with stable inflation  The benefits for  inflation from productivity may persist a while longer, however, given the  expectation that capital deepening will pick up as investment rebounds  Moreover,  we do not yet know whether the acceleration of multifactor productivity has come to  an end Of the three elements that we have identified as having led to the low  inflation–low unemployment episode, the reduction in the natural rate associated with  various labor market developments is most likely to have a durable effect on the  inflation-unemployment nexus  Thank you   Those coefficients are estimated on data for the last thirty-five years   That’s correct   I’m not sure we have an explanation for that  One general point I could   make is that although the change in monetary policy is part of our story, there’s nothing that says   that the change in monetary policy—this speaks to President Parry’s question as well—was the   same across all countries  In some countries that had more of a history of inflation than the   United States, the change in monetary policy could have been more striking and thus had a larger   effect On the basis of the way heads are nodding, I think we all agree that taking a more   international approach would be very interesting  But not having done that, I’m not sure that we   have very many answers for you     I’d like to make one clarifying point about the productivity story that   relates both to what President Poole said and what you just said I don’t think it’s necessary in   explaining the productivity story to believe that workers are fooled and that they don’t know for   a long time what aggregate productivity growth is  I think most people don’t know what   aggregate productivity growth is What they do know is how they feel about their jobs, and they   may have some sense of what other jobs might be available if they were to look elsewhere    Mobility is a characteristic of the labor market  When productivity increases occur, they are   concentrated in certain firms and certain industries, and over time those firms raise their demand   for labor        June 25-26, 2002 42 of 179  So the job opportunity aspects are realized gradually   Indeed, on the productivity story per se, we have tried to emphasize the   uncertainty about the adjustment speed  But having said that, we believe we are probably   coming to the end of it fairly soon, if we have not already  As for the other factors we talked   about perhaps having more-durable effects on the natural rate, I don’t know  John, do you have   any comment on that?   But it probably will be small relative to what we’ve seen in the past   several years
