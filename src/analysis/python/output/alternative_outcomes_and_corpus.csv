The resulting 5 percent federal funds rate would imply a real rate of around 3 percent–assuming that inflation expectatio ns are in line with the staff forecast of core PCE p rices. Even if this places the real rate below its long-run equilibrium value, an undershoot may well be needed for a time to counter the effects of the declines in equity wealth, the apparent downward revision to expected near-term returns on capital, a possible
7
overhang of productive capacity, and lower business and consumer confidence. Although the cumulative reduction in the funds rate of 11⁄2 percentage points since the start of the year would represent a sharp and substantial change in the stance of
policy, aggregate demand and attitudes have deteriorated quickly. The relatively rapid lessening of pressures in labor markets now likely in train should counter any
tendency for inflation to move higher. If the Committee suspected that additional easing might be needed at some point, it might still prefer to move by no more than 50 basis points at this meeting so that it could better assess the initial response to its previo us acti ons, th e und erlying streng th of d eman d, and the ext ent of p rice pr essure s. In those circumstances, the Committee presumably would want to retain the current statement that the risks are weighted toward economic weakness. The Committee could also retain that statement ifit believed that 50 basis points could well be sufficient to achieve its objectives, but saw the risks to that outlook as skewed to the dow nside.
(9) Market participants evidently expect at least a 50 basis point cut in the target funds rate at this meeting, with federal funds futures rates suggesting high odds that the reduction will be 75 basis points. Participants also reportedly expect the Comm ittee to state that the b alance of risks rem ains weighted toward eco nomic weakness. Therefore, a 50 basis point move combined with such a statement likely would cause interest rates to back up. Price declines might be larger in equity markets, where investors seem to be hoping for especially aggressive Federal Reserve action. Further easings in the stance of monetary policy over time would continue to be anticipated, and current market expectations that the funds rate could be around 41⁄4 percent later this year might not be materially affected.]","[The Committee could decide to reduce the target federal funds rate even more at this meeting–choosing a 75 basis point decrease–if it saw the outcome in the staff forecast as plau sible and con sistent with its objec tives but subject to excessive downside risks. Sources of risk include the possibility of substantial further decreases in equity prices and tightening in credit conditions as profits continue to fall, and fragility in consumer and business confidence. In addition, recent profit and sales shortfalls in the technology sector could indicate a considerable overhang of high-tech capital throughout the economy or even a slower pace of structural productivity growth going forward. Either case would weaken investment spending for some time and probably necessitate significant monetary policy ease. Thus, a 75 basis point reduction in the funds rate at this time could be appropriate to provide some protection against the possibility of a prolonged period of econ omic weakness. Even if the Committee does not see inordinate downside risks to the staff forecast, it might view that forecast as involving unacceptably weak output and employment, justifying a greater easing than assumed by the staff. In the Greenbook, the unemployment rate rises noticeably above the level the staff judges to be consistent with stable inflation. Moreover, the Committee may see good odds that the economy can sustainably operate at a no ticeably lower lev el of unemp loyment tha n is embed ded in the staff forecast, and want to lean against appreciable increases in unemployment absent clearer evidence that such increases are necessary to contain inflation.
(11) A 75 basis point easing, if accompanied by a statement that the risks remain weighted toward economic weakness, would generate some price gains in both the fixed income and equity markets. But, given the skittishness in financial markets and the possibility that the stock adjustment process for capital and inventories may have a ways to run, the Committee might still see a preponderance of downside risks to the economy, even after the 75 basis point move and the likely reaction in asset mark ets.]","[In developing its forecast, the staff has placed considerable weight on the recent deterioration in consumer confidence and equity wealth. If, instead, the Committee put more emphasis on the relatively firm indicators on spending and employment of late, it might view the forecast of output in the Greenbook as too pessimistic. In that case, it might think that less easing is called for than assumed in the staff forecast and much less than is anticipated by the market, inclining it to favor a smaller, 25 basis point reduction in the target funds rate. Moreover, the disquieting readings on consumer prices for January might counsel caution in lowering the funds rate further. Given the sizable easing already undertaken this year, a more gradual approach to further reductions in the funds rate may now be appropriate, in part to allow time to gauge the effects of the policy actions in the pipeline. Market participants would be surprised by an easing of only 25 basis points, and debt and equity markets would sell off appreciably–and even more sharply if this action were combined with a shift to a statement of balanced risks. But if the Committee saw considerably more underlying strength in the real economy or greater inflation risks than did market participants, it might view as appropriate the resulting reassessment of the trajectory of expected policy and the consequent tightening of financial conditions.]",[nan]

While such a reduction would leave the real funds rate noticeably below the range of the estimates of its equilibrium value, an accommodative policy stance may be seen as needed for a time to counter temporary restraints on aggregate demand. In particular the Committee may be concerned about household spending in an environment of a weaken ing job market and abo ut business investment outlays in view of the drags from the previous slowdown in final demand andtheover-accumulationofcapitalinsomesectors. Inthesecircumstances,growth would remain sluggish for a time even after further policy easing, lessening pressures on resources and likely rolling back the recent upticks in inflation and inflation expectations. Indeed, the Committee may view the resource gap likely to open up under this scenario as sizable enough to imply a margin in which spending could snap back faster than expected without producing a deterioration in the inflation environment. Marketparticipantsalreadyexpectasubstantialreversalofpolicyin 2002, suggesting that they would be prompter than usual in bringing forward in time and increasing the size of the anticipated tightening if evidence of such a snap-ba ck emerged. As long as the Committee reinforced such sentiment with its words and actions, the resulting increase in real interest rates would work to stabilize the economy and constrain inflation.
(11) Investors are expecting a 50 basis point move at this meeting, along with a statement ind icating that the b alance of risks rem ains weighted toward eco nomic weakness, to be followed by an additional 25 basis point move by fall. Validating market expectations for this meeting would leave interest rates, equity prices, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar largely unchanged. The Committee may find this outcome especially attractive if it believes that the balance of risks is sufficiently tilted
10
toward weakness to make the added policy easing built into asset prices a reasonable possibility.]","[The Committee might choose a more modest 25 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate at this meeting if it views aggregate demand going forward as likely to be noticeably less weak than in the staff forecast, perhaps because it sees the large cumulative easing of policy since the start of the year as providing m ore support for demand than in that forecast. Among financial indicators, the rapid growth of money an d the steepness o f the yield curve m ay suggest that co nsiderable stim ulus is already in place. In these circumstances, with the real funds rate at the low end of the range of estimates of its equilibrium level, and with equity m arkets having risen appreciably over the intermeeting period, the Committee may believe that a more forceful policy action at this meeting would create unacceptable odds of a policy overshoot, with potentially adverse consequences for inflation. Concerns in this regard might be accentuated by the recent firmer tone of the inflation data and the increases in survey and market measures of expected inflation. Thus, even if the Committee suspects that additional easing might well be appropriate at some point, it might choose a smaller policy step at this meeting to allow time for more evidence to accumulate on whether the economy will be soft enough to contain inflation pressures and warrant additional easing.
(13) Market participants would be surprised by a 25 basis point easing. Even if such a policy move is accompanied by a statement that the balance of risks remains weighted toward economic weakness, short-term interest rates would rise as investors marked up their expectations for the path of the federal funds rate over coming months. Higher interest rates, together with a sense that monetary policy is less focused on fostering a return to robust economic growth, would lead to a fall in stock prices. If the drop in equity prices is quite substantial, longer-term interest rates also
11
might decline, reflecting the weaker outlook for the economy. These effects in financial markets would be attenuated if, in light of the statement accompanying the policy announcement, the Federal Reserve is seen more as stretching out the timing of its policy moves than as reducing the total amount of easing that will be forthcoming.]","[If the Com mittee believes th at the outlook for aggregate d emand is probably weaker than in the staff forecast, or that the risks around that forecast are skewed substantially to the downside, it might choose a 75 basis point reduction in the target federal funds rate. Such weakness could owe, for example, to a more protracted falloff in high-tech investment as businesses reconsider the profitability of these capital projects, which in turn would damp structural productivity growth and be reflected in a more pronounced decline in the equilibrium real funds rate. Even if the Committee agrees with the staff forecast of output and employment, it still may view their projected paths as unacceptably weak, justifying a larger cut in the federal funds rate than is assumed in that forecast. For example, the Committee may think that the unemployment rate does not need to rise as much or as quickly as in the staff forecast to keep inflation in check.
(15) A 75 basis point easing accompanied by a statement that the risks remain weighted toward economic weakness would lower the expected near-term path of policy, reducing other shorter-term interest rates and easing financial conditions more generally. The larger-than-expected policy move would presumably bolster

Such rates would tend to be pulled down by the change in near-term policy expectations and the associated decline in real interest rates, but that tendency could be more than offset by a rise in inflation premiums if market participants read the larger-than-expected policy move as increasing the odds of a significant pickup in inflation.]",[nan]

In the staff outlook, with an unchanged federal funds rate the effective NAIRU rises along with the unemployment rate over the forecast period, and therefore only a moderate amount of slack opens up in labor markets. The Committee may see that slack as needed to lean against the recent updrift in a number of measures of inflation, especially if it wishes to make further progress toward price stability over time. In the Greenbook forecast, the growth of real activity would already be drawing close to that of its potential and headed higher by the time an
easing at this meeting would begin to have a noticeable impact on the economy. Indeed, the Committee may be concerned that the recent behavior in financial markets suggests that investors could revise up their inflation expectations should growth revive especially rapidly. In light of the uncertainties about the response of the economy to the steep easing of po licy so far this year, a pause may be considered appropriate at present to assess better whether the previous policy actions are likely to induce a suitable rebound in economic activity. A decision to hold the funds rate unchanged at this meeting–even with a statement indicating that the Committee still saw risks weighted toward economic weakness–would take financial market participants by surprise. The extent of the surprise would depend in part on the data on durable goods orders, home sales, and consumer confidence that will be received just before the FOMC meeting, but judging from current futures market quotes, short-term rates would back up sharply, likely by more than 1⁄4 percentage point, as markets became uncertain about whether any additional easing would be forthcoming this year. The resulting upward pressure on long-term yields, though, would likely be offset somewhat by a decline in stock prices, which could be sharp.]","[Instead, the Committee may deem it appropriate to ease policy at this meeting. Aggregate demand again has proven weaker than anticipated and has yet to show con crete signs of firmin g, while declines in resource utilizatio n are likely to relieve pressures on prices. In these circumstances, the Committee may view the staff’s assessment of the economic outlook as reasonably likely and acceptable, but it may see the risk to that forecast as uncomfortably weighted to the downside. With the economy already soft for three quarters, the extent and further d uration of the forces acting to restrain spending still very unclear, and the degree of the countervailing stimulus from the easier monetary and fiscal policies quite uncertain, an additional easing of policy by 25 basis points would provide greater assurance of a satisfactory strengthening of economic activity. Moreover, a rate cut smaller than those earlier this year would be approp riate if the Com mittee saw p olicy as already reaso nably accommodative and therefore wished to proceed more cautiously on the thought that the easing cycle might need to be brought to a close before long. Braking the pace of easing would likely limit the tendency of market participants, observed after recent policy actions, to extrapolate further easing, which might otherwise lead to financial conditions that the Committee viewed as excessively stimulative.
(16) With market participants putting a little more than even odds on a 50 basis point move at this meeting, short-term interest rates would move up on an announcement of a 25 basis point easing, even if accompanied by a statement that the risks were still tilted toward weakness. Market participants are unlikely to revise up significantly their forec ast of the low p oint for the targe t funds rate, but th ey probably would push that point further into the future, implying that intermediate- and longer- term interest rates would only edge higher. With the Federal Reserve still expected to ease again, the negative reaction in stock markets could well be limited. However, if the smaller size of the action and the words o f the announcement fostered the b elief that the easing cycle had come to an end, a more pronounced reaction in markets would be likely.]","[Alternatively, the Committee may see aggregate demand or inflation pressures as likely to be noticeably weaker than in the staff forecast, arguing for a more forceful easing of 50 basis points. The near-term prospects for corporate earnings are bleak, raising the possibility of larger declines in equity prices than are built into the staff forecast. The resulting hit to household wealth, along with the more rapid rise in unemployment, could sap consumption spending considerably. Even if the staff has
14
judged the fundamentals of spending correctly, the Committee may view the inflation outlook to be more favorable than in the Greenbook. In particular, the Committee may interpret the good inflation perform ance of the past few years as resulting more from lasting changes in underlying labor market conditions and less from the temporary effects of the acceleration of productivity than is implicit in the staff forecast. Ifso,theequilibriumrealfundsratewouldalsobelowerthanisimplicitin the Greenbook, and more forceful policy ease could be seen as necessary to achieve the correct configuration of the actual and equilibrium real rates.
(18) If the Committee reduces the funds rate 50 basis points while retaining a statement of risks weighted toward econ omic weakness, short-term interest rates would likely fall, especially as markets build in further easing this year and defer some of the policy tightening now expected for 2002. Equity markets would be buoyed by the move, but the rally could prove transitory if subsequent earnings reports prove disappointing as is likely under the staff forecast. Real bond yields would likely fall as a consequence of the policy action, and–un less the initial equity market rally were particularly vigorous–nominal yields could decline some as well. Any increase in inflation expectations would be short-lived if, consistent with the Committee’s rationale for its action, the markets subsequently receive evidence of persisting weakness in economic activity and damped inflation.]",[nan]

After all, cumulative policy easing this year has put the real funds rate well below estimates of its equilibrium value (see box on page 13), and this policy stance presumably will, after some further delay, foster a reasonable revival in the growth of spending over time. In that regard, the rapid growth of M2 and other measures of household liquidity so far this year might be taken as a tentative indication that financial conditions are well positioned to support such a rebound. In these circumstances, the Committee may believe that further policy stimulus would carry too great a risk of an overshooting of aggregate demand that would lead to added pressures on inflation and a deterioration in inflation expectations that may prove stubborn to unwind. Indeed, the Committee may be of the view that the slow recovery of aggregate demand in the Greenbook forecast, and the associated easing of pressures in labor markets, is both necessary and desirable so as to provide better assurance that core inflation will be capped going forward, as it is in the staff forecast. The choice of an unchanged federal funds rate target would come as a surprise to financial markets that would be little tempered by an announcement of continued downside risks. Short-term interest rates would back up by a considerable amount and equity prices likely would decline, as the tighter-than-expected monetary policy stance more than offsets the perception that the Federal Reserve sees a stronger economy than previously thought by market participants. The policy surprise would tend to raise bond yields by pushing expected funds rates higher. The likely decline in equity prices, however, would lead investors to anticipate more restraint on consumption via the wealth effect, perhaps limiting the extent to which the expected path of the funds rates is ratcheted up and, accordingly, the pickup in longer-term yields.]","[The Committee may consider the Greenbook forecast to be both plausible and acceptable, even with the projected delay in the resumption of satisfactory output growth, but still choose to reduce the federal funds rate 25 basis points. In particular, the string of bad news on the econom y may heighten the sense that there are sizable odds on especially adverse outcomes for aggregate demand, particularly for capital spending. The Committee may be of the view that such downside risks to the real side could be countered by a slight further easing in the present situation with little ill effect, as inflation recently has been benign and is likely to remain contained. Given the scope for downside developments, the Committee may be especially averse to surprising markets, in that an unchanged policy stance could risk tightening financial conditions appreciably should market participants begin to question Federal Reserve intentions. Alternatively, the Committee may consider the staff’s outlook, especially the speed and the extent of the projected rise in the unemployment rate, to be unacceptable and to warrant another slight further policy easing as a countervailing move.The selection of a 25 basis point reduction in the funds rate, presumably accompanied by an assessment that the risks are still weighted toward economic weakness, would be almost as accommodative as the average expectation built into financial markets. Accordingly, bond yields likely would edge higher, while stock prices may come under some downward pressure. The recent downdraft of the dollar on foreign currency markets makes it more difficult to predict the probable course of exchange rates. While textbooks teach that policy ease that falls short of market expectations should lead to an appreciation of the currency, the recent market focus on relative spending prospects suggests that the dollar might come under some downward pressure.]","[Choice of a 50 basis point easing action might follow from the concern that more economic weakness could well be in train than projected in the Greenbook. Although consumption has held up remarkably well so far, an abrupt softening in consumer spending is not implausible given the prospect of a sharp rise in the unemployment rate and already relatively high debt burdens. Moreover, foreign economic activity could well disappoint for a variety of reasons, including deepening crises in certain emerging market economies or additional slowing in the pace of activity in some major industrial economies. Such eventualities would tend to prolong both the inventory liquidation and the decline in capital spending, which would translate into a decline in the equilibrium real funds rate. Although the level of the real funds rate implied by the 31⁄4 percent nominal funds rate of this alternative and prevailing inflation expectations would be appreciably below that which is sustainable in the long run, a rapid policy reversal along the lines of that currently embedded in futures market prices could be undertaken once information finally starts to signal convincingly that more solid economic growth has taken hold. The choice of a 50 basis point easing, combined with a statement continuing to point to downside risks, would be more forceful than markets have priced in for this meeting, though futures market participants seem to expect that a cumulative easing of this magnitude w ill be put in place by early next year. If investors come to believe that the Committee is more concerned about economic softening than previously thought as a result of the surprise component of the action, they would both move the anticipated easing forward in time and augment its cumulative extent. As an immediate consequence, short-term interest rates would move down. The unexpected size of the policy ease would probably prompt a decline in bond yields and the foreign exchange value of the dollar and some increase in equity values, although the magnitud e of these changes would imp ortantly be shaped by the wording of the statement announcing the action.]",[nan]

The Committee might be especially inclined to adopt this o ption if it had reaso n to suspect tha t aggregate demand would snap back relatively promptly. For example, the Committee may read the current political climate as indicating that a considerable degree of fiscal stimulus isintheoffing. OrtheCommitteemaybeoftheviewthatmuchoftheadverse effects of the terrorist attacks on confidence is likely to be short lived. In any case, the outlook for fiscal policy, the state of confidence, and the economy more generally is quite uncertain at this time, and the Committee may prefer to await further developments before committing to a larger policy action. If events turn more adverse than expected in coming weeks, an additional easing step could be taken even before the next meeting. In contrast, should aggregate demand prove resilient, this relatively modest ease would provide a b it more assurance of eventually bringing core inflation down. The announcem ent of a 25 basis point easing would surp rise market participants, likely prompting a rise in interest rates, particularly at the short end of the yield curve, as well as a decline in stock prices. While the market fully expects an announcement that the risks remain tilted toward weakness, a more explicit suggestion of the Committee’s readiness to consider further steps, even in the intermeeting period, would work to limit the market reaction to this policy choice.]","[If the Committee, like the staff, saw a high probability of protracted economic weakness ahead and, as a consequence, a substantial rise in the unemployment rate and a decline in core inflation, it presumably would ease policy further, as assumed in the Greenbook. The Committee may see the staff forecast as embodying an appreciable enough downward revision to the prospects for spending and inflation pressures to justify reducing the intended federal funds rate 50 basis points at this meeting. The equilibrium real federal funds rate, which summarizes the more persistent factors shaping spending and pressures on resources, is now estimated to be about a full percentage point lower than was thought at the time of the August meeting according to the measures based on the staff forecast as well as historical data (as discussed in the box). Even if the Committee did not think that the factors depressing spending were likely to be long lasting enough to lower the equilibrium real funds rate to that extent, those forces still might be seen as sufficiently persistent to warrant additional policy easing for a time. In addition, with household and business confidence possibly fragile, the Committee may consider it important to be seen as moving aggressively with another half percentage point easing. Indeed, given the prevailing expectation among market participants of such an action, the Committee might be concerned that a smaller-sized ease could trigger an inappropr iate tightening o f other financial co nditions that co uld prove esp ecially problematic given the remaining strains in the financial market infrastructure. Moreover, the Committee may believe that, if aggregate demand proves to be surprisingly stron g, the cost of havin g eased policy a little to o much a t this time wo uld be relatively small given that inflation expectations are likely to remain well contained. Investors have largely priced in a 1⁄2 percentage point easing at this meeting, along with a characterization of the balance o f risks as pointed toward economic weakness. Accordingly, financial market prices likely would be little changed if such expectations were realized. As always, the press release will be scrutinized for hints of the Comm ittee’s policy intention going forward, and any sense in the statement that there were higher-than-expected o dds of subsequent policy easing would trigger a downward adjustment of the expected path of the funds rate. In that circumstance, short- and intermediate-term interest rates would likely decline and equity prices increase.]",[nan],[nan]

Indeed, the Committee may be especially reluctant to ease policy if it thinks the equilibrium real funds rate is likely to rise in the future–as risk and equity premiums narrow, as is seemingly consistent with recent stock price gains, but also as the thrust of fiscal policy intensifies. With the budget package still working its way through the legislative process, considerable uncertainty surrounds the magnitude of the coming fiscal stimulus. Because this uncertainty should be resolved relatively promptly, the Committee may prefer to keep policy unchanged at this meeting so as to be able to calibrate better its policy action to the size and composition of what becomes law. If the Committee saw easing as a close call, with the federal funds rate as low as 2-1/2 percent, it might be argued that action should be deferred at this meeting so that the Committee would have more scope to respond to potential adverse shocks down the road. As described in the box on the zero bound to nominal interest rates on page 9, this tactic of “saving your ammunition” would follow from the judgment that policy action in a narrow window following an adverse shock would be more effective in bolstering activity over time than lowering rates more aggressively now so that any future shock falls on a stronger economy. Committee inaction at this meeting, even if combined with a statement reaffirming the assessment of predom inant downside risks, would surprise m arket participants. Considerable doubts would be created about whether the federal funds rate would go as low as 1-3/4 p ercent by the early months of next year as m arket participants currently expect. In consequence, other short-term interest rates would move noticeably higher. The likely upward movement of bond yields would be tempered by an immediate selloff of equities. To the extent that the outlook for spending and income turned gloomier, the exchange value of the dollar might fail to appreciate despite the tighter-than-anticipated policy stance.]","[The Committee may consider the staff forecast to be both probable and, under the circumstances, a satisfactory outcome, and it may judge that an immediate cut in the federal funds rate of 25 basis points is justified. With investors skittish and risks predominately skewed to the downside, the Committee may be reluctant to
adopt a policy stance that is appreciably tighter than financial markets expect, which could further adversely affect household and business sentiment. The small disappointment of market expectations implied by the adoption of this alternative might actually be viewed favorably by the Committee if it wished to slow the current pace of easing from its recent trajectory to help forestall financial markets from building in the expectation of considerably more easing than appropriate to achieve the Committee’s objectives. In effect, a modest disappointment now may pose less of a strain on markets than a more sizable one later on.]","[The Committee may judge that a 50 basis point policy move is warranted on the grounds that the path of output is likely to fall short of that in the staff forecast–either because the contraction will be greater or the subsequent pickup less robust. The Committee might anticipate the near-term outcomes for spending to be weaker than in the staff outlook if, for example, it suspected that the ongoing contraction of foreign economic activity and the stresses in financial markets of developing countries may portend greater-than-anticipated adverse feedbacks on U.S. production. The Committee may also have doubts that household and business spending will respond as vigorously to likely fiscal initiatives as embedded in the staff forecast. Even if the Committee viewed a 50 basis point move as a bit larger than necessary given its current assessment of the economic situation, the more substantial move might be favored if some weight were placed on the possibility of shocks that would be sufficiently adverse to make the zero bound to nominal interest rates a real constraint on the effectiveness of monetary policy at some point in the future. As already noted, market participants are about evenly split between expecting 1/4 percentage point and 1/2 percentage point of easing at this meeting. Thus, some portion of them would be disappointed by the choice of either action. Working to temper any reaction, though, would be the sense that it is more likely that the timing of the easing they are expecting–in the neighborhood of 3/4 percentage points over the next half year–had chang ed, not the cumulative amou nt. Market participants universally expect that the balance of risks will remain tilted toward economic weakness, so not much would be read in its retention. A 25 basis point easing would prompt some backup in short- and intermediate-term rates and a decline in equity prices. A half point ease, in contrast, would pull short-term rates lower and, unless countered by a clear sense in the statement that the Committee had viewed its action as likely bringing this easing phase to a close, would lead market participants to mark down the entire expected path of policy rates. The implied support to spending would likely bolster equity markets and offset to a considerable extent any downward pressure on the exchange value of the dollar directly emanating from lower interest rates.]",[nan]

If the Committee saw good prospects of a relatively strong rebound in the economy beginning in the next few quarters, it might leave the stance of monetary policy unchanged. The unexpected strength of several indicators of consum ption and in vestment cou ld be read as su pporting a v iew that econ omic weakness is abating and a turnaround in spending is in train. Indeed, the rise in equity prices and real in terest rates of late likely pro vides evidence th at market par ticipants
have become more optimistic on that score. Such a turnaround would be supported by the monetary stimulus pu t in place–a substantial portion of which has occu rred only recently–that has positioned the real federal funds rate well below the range of estimates of its equilibrium value (see Chart 4 and the tab le on the next page). In these circumstances, the Committee may wish to bide its time, awaiting data that will help it gauge the effects of policy actions to date as well as the resolution of uncertainty on the fiscal policy front. Because market prices appear to incorporate high odds on a 25 basis point easing of monetary policy at this meeting, leaving the target federal funds rate at 2 percent would prompt an appreciable increase in money market interest rates. Longer-term yields could rise somew hat as well; the extent of the backup, however, would probably be limited as long as the Committee, as expected by investors, reiterated its assessm ent that the balan ce of risks is weighte d toward e conomic weakness. However, long-term yields would likely rise by more, and the dollar could firm, if the Committee’s announcement suggested some optimism about economic prospects despite its formal assessment of the balance of risks and, especially, if the Committee shifted to a statement that the risks were balanced. Equity prices might drop initially, but, again, any sense conveyed in the announcement of good odds that the economy would begin to recover before long would probably limit the decline.]","[The Com mittee might choose to ease policy 25 basis po ints if it viewed the recent positive news on spending as quite tentative and not providing sufficient assurance that a rebound is in store before long. Moreover, the Committee might be worr ied ab out th e poss ibility o f specific shoc ks that could derail the rec overy . Consumer sentiment could decline further in the event of additional terrorist actions or if the current military conflict proves more difficult and protracted than expected. And, equity prices may be seen as embedding unrealistically high expectations for earnings as well as an unusually low equity risk premium. Should investor expectations be disappointed or the equity premium move back toward its historical norm, equity prices could reverse their recent gains, adding to the drag on household spending. In addition, the appearance of stalemate in the Congressional debate on a fiscal stimulus package may be seen as raising the odds that agreement will not be forthcoming. An alternative simulation in the Greenbook illustrated that, without additional fiscal stimulus, the economic recovery could be noticeably more anemic than envisioned in the baseline forecast. While these downside risks may not materialize, the Committee might view the cost of erring on the side of ease as low at this time given the degree of slack at present in resource utilization and the likelihood that inflation will remain subdued or drift down somewhat in the near term. Because investors expect the Committee to ease 25 basis points and to retain its assessment that the risks are weighted toward economic weakness, financial market prices would likely change little in response to such a policy decision. Market participants probably would perceive the 25 basis point move, following three larger steps, as an indication that the easing cycle could be drawing to a close. If the Committee wanted to underscore that perception in markets, it could indicate that the risks were now balanced. In that event, market interest rates could rise as investors moved forward their prevailing expectations of policy tightening, but stock prices and the foreign exchange value of the dollar would be supported if the Federal Reserve’s less pessimistic outlook led market participants to revise up their expectations for the rebound in economic activity.]","[The Committee might consider reducing the target federal funds rate 50 basis points at this meeting if it thought an unacceptably large opening of slack in the economy was likely. As discussed in the box “A ‘Perfect Foresight’ Policy” on page 11, a “perfect foresight” rule that uses all the information contained in the staff outlook to determine a path for the funds rate that minimizes squared output and inflation gaps over the entire forecast period calls for considerable additional near- term policy easing to counter the projected upward pressure on the unemployment rate. A further sizable easing may be justified not only on the grounds of generating better results than in the staff forecast, but also on the view that the forecast itself has overestimated effective policy stimulus or does not give sufficient weight to forces that will continue to hold back the economy. In particular, if inflation expectations are lower than is embedded in the baseline forecast, then the real short-term interest rate is higher and that will keep real long-term rates elevated and reduce inflation even further than in the staff forecast. Adjusting the nominal funds rate low er in response to the apparent drop in inflation expectations might be viewed as especially desirable if the Committee believed that substantial restraints to private domestic spending persist or that the downturn abroad is likely to be exacerbated by financial strains in certain foreign economies. Moreover, as discussed in a box in the November bluebook, the possibility that conventional monetary policy action ultimately could be constrained by the zero bound to nominal interest rates might incline the Committee to take prompter and more aggressive action now to stimulate economic activity. The Committee might also view the 1 percent core PCE inflation rate projected to prevail toward the end of the forecast interval as too low to p rovide a comfortable buffer against hitting the zero bound to nominal interest rates in the event of a substantial adverse shock to the economy in the future. A 50 basis point policy easing at this meeting would be larger than is embedded in financial market prices. Although short-term rates would decline sharply, the response of long-term yields, stock prices, and the dollar would depend in part on whether investors saw the extent of the move as suggesting, on the one hand, that the economy was considerably weaker than they had perceived or, on the other, that the Committee was intent on restoring strong growth more quickly and with more certainty than previously appreciated. In the first case, bond yields, equity prices, and the exchange value of the dollar all could drop significantly, while, in the second, the decline in bond yields would be significantly smaller and stock prices and the dollar could rally.]",[nan]

Last year’s implementation of monetary and fiscal stimulus should provide substantial support to spending going forward. Indeed, judging by the gap of the actual real funds rate below staff estimates of its equilibrium value, the stance of monetary policy is already quite stimulative (Chart 5 and table). The resurgence in consumer confidence and the recovery in stock prices over recent months suggest that household outlays will continue to trend higher. With that underlying support to sales and with technological change providing an incentive to buy new capital equipment, a recovery of business investment may be seen as only a matter of time. Under these conditions, the Committee may prefer to stand pat until incoming information sheds additional light on the possible need for a policy adjustment. As the forces restraining aggregate demand abate, at some point the Committee will need to move the funds rate up from its current low level to prevent excessive stimulus from taking hold. Addition al easing now would raise th e amplitud e of that ultima te policy adjustm ent, and put a gr eater premiu m on gettin g the timing o f that policy reversal a bout right, especially if aggregate demand turns out to be stronger than anticipated. Given the uncertainties of forecasting, such fine tuning may run the risk of accentuating the variab ility of a ggreg ate dem and an d asset prices . Given that financial markets place small odds on a reduction in the funds rate target at this meeting, the choice of no change, even with risks weighted toward economic weakness, would induce a slight increase in money market rates and a smaller rise in bond yields.]","[If the Committee perceived substantial remaining downside risks to the economic outlook, it instead might select a 25 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate target to 11⁄2 percent. While some recent indicators of capital spending have been encouraging, a sustained revival may be viewed as far from assured. If investors in stock and corporate bond markets came to question the long-term outlook for high-tech industries and the associated trends for economy-wide profit streams and productivity, the resulting downward adjustment in asset prices would set back the recovery of investment and consumption. Moreover, should the news on the labor market remain bad for a while longer, consumer attitudes may turn out to be morefragilethantheyhaveseemedoflate. Whileeasingpolicyanothernotchwould not appreciably reduce the risks of such adverse outcomes, it would at least put the economy on a slightly stronger footing should any of them eventuate. With an intensification of inflation unlikely to pose a threat in the next couple of years, the potential costs of such a policy action might be seen as small when compared with the cumulative shortfall of resource utilization in the staff forecast. Indeed, limiting disinflation at this point might be welcomed for strategic reasons: The risks associated with operating policy at very low nominal interest rates might incline the Committee toward slightly higher inflation than in the Greenbook forecast–as in the “inflation cushion” strategy described above–in order to be able to put in place low real interest rates if need be in the future. Another 1⁄4 percentage point reduction in the federal funds rate, along with a statement that the risks were weighted to the downside, would come as a surprise to market participants, perhaps prompting a sense that the economic outlook was a little weaker than previously perceived. As a result, some immediate reduction in long-term as well as short-term interest rates likely would occur. ]",[nan],[nan]

The recent spate of stronger-than-expected economic news might stem importantly from a reversal of the temporary depressing effects of the terrorist attacks on aggregate demand , with the pace of growth going forward quite possibly weaker. In the staff forecast, the abatement of the inventory runoff accounts for a considerable portion of the strength in GDP growth over the next few quarters, implying that growth of final demand is noticeably below that of GDP . The forecasted pickup in final demand over the second half of 2002 and in 2003 depends importantly on continued solid grow th in consumer spending–which leaves the personal saving rate at a level that is quite low by the standards of all but the past few years–and a turnaround in investment that is far from assured. Retention of a balance of risks weighted toward economic weakness would surprise many, and would probably pull interest rates modestly lower.]","[Concerns about the strength of final demand, coupled with the possibility that the economy might be able to operate at higher levels of labor utilization without engendering inflation pressures than assumed in the staff forecast, might be viewed as providing the Committee with ample scope to pursue a more accommodative policy. Indeed, such concerns may be sufficiently worrisome to justify easing 1/ 4 percentage point at this meeting (presumably while retaining the balance of risks tilted toward economic weakness). In this view, failing to ease may ultimately induce inflation that is viewed as too low to provide an adequate cushion to set negative real federal funds rates if needed in the future to counteract the effects of adverse demand shocks. But there is also a chance that investors could read the FOMC’s policy statement as presaging a weaker economy than they had anticipated. This possibility would be even more likely if the Committee caught market participants unawares by easing 1/4 percentage point. In either event, stock prices could fall and that decline, in turn, would tend to reinforce the initial decline in interest rates.]","[By contrast, the Committee might be inclined to hold the funds rate unchanged and adopt a neutral balance of risks at this meeting if it is more confident that the growth of output will be around its potential and sees inflation as contained. The especially adverse outcomes for the economy that the Committee was worried about at the prior few meetings may seem much less likely now. Indeed, in recent weeks, data surprises have nearly all run on the upside, supporting the view that risks are no longer skewed toward economic weakness. Unlike the outlook at the time of the January meeting, the Greenb ook forecast shows less overall slack in resource utilization, little upd rift in the unem ployment rate, and less of a do wntrend to inflation. To be sure, the real funds rate is unsustainably low, and if the nominal
funds rate were held at its current level for very long, inflation would begin to intensify. But as discussed in the box on the balance of risks, heightened uncertainty about the outlook could have the effect of making the horizon over which the Committee defines the foreseeable future relatively limited. And in that shorter run, at least according to the staff forecast, inflation is likely to drift lower and output growth w ill be a tad above that of its potential. The selection of a neutral balance of risks would be in line with the expectations of the majority of market participants, but some investors would still be surprised by the decision. The effects in financial markets in this case would likely be rather muted but might encompass a small increase in interest rates, a drop in stock prices, and a small rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar.]","[If the Committee reads the strength of recent economic indicators as signaling that lasting economic growth above potential is a distinct likelihood, it might wish to hold the funds rate unchanged and move the balance of risks toward heightened inflation pressures. With the economy seeming to have regained its footing, the Committee might view a balance toward inflation as especially appropriate in light of the un sustainably low level of the real fund s rate, the recent up tick in measures of inflation expectations based on Treasury inflation-indexed securities, and the possibility that sharp increases in oil prices could feed through to prices and wages more generally. Indeed, the surprising resilience exhibited by the economy of late raises the possibility that spending may snap back more rapidly than in the Greenbook. If the Committee were especially concerned that, if it did not move promptly to begin to restore the funds rate to more sustainable levels, inflation pressures could build over time to the point that they would be difficult to contain, it might even choose to implement a quarter-point increase in the target funds rate along with a balance of risks weighted toward inflation pressures. In particular, the apparent turnaround of demand in the high-tech sector, favorable news on productivity, accelerator effects stemming from the recent pickup in output growth, and the business tax incentives included in the fiscal stimulus package might be imparting an even more sizable impetus to investment spending than in the staff forecast. Forces such as these help to explain why some measures of the equilibrium real funds rate have been boosted as much as a half a percentage point over the intermeeting period (Chart 4). Such an increase in estimates of the equilibrium real funds rate im plies that just ma intaining the sam e degree of po licy stimulus w ould require increasing the nominal funds rate target. Market participants do not expect a move to a balance of risks toward inflation pressures at this meeting, much less one accompanied by a quarter-point increase in the target funds rate. As a result, either choice would push interest rates higher across the term structure while equities could come under heavy selling pressure. The extent of the market reaction could be sizable and, of course , would depend importantly on the wording of the annou ncement and the associated m arket perceptionsaboutthefuturecourseofpolicy. In particular, the reaction in markets could be attenuated if the wording of the announcement emphasized that the Committee viewed itself as merely unwinding some of the insurance it had taken out late last year at a time of unusual uncertainty, and that it intended to wait thereafter, rather than embark on a path that would promptly realign the real interest rate to a more normal level.]"

For example, the Committee may be concerned that the latest reports and commentary on corporate earnings, as well as the recent data on durable goods orders and shipments, suggest that recovery in the technology and telecommunications sectors could be weaker or delayed longer than in the staff forecast. In addition , the combination of lower stock prices and rising unemployment could be seen as weighing more on consumer sentiment and spending than assumed by the staff. Indeed, the recent sharp slowing in money growth, although partly explicable in terms of interest rates and other identifiable factors, might be viewed as suggesting some weakness in households’ income and spending plans. While the staff has revised up its assessment of past and prospective productivity growth, the Committee may put some weight on the possibility that the growth of potential supply has been even higher for, perhaps, a longer time, implying that economic slack is more sizable than assumed by the staff. In such a circumstance, there would be some risk of an unacceptable updrift of unemployment that may produce a decline in inflation, perhaps inclining the Committee to return to a statement that the risks are weighted toward economic weakness. Such an announcement would surprise market participants, because they generally expect the balance-of-risks statement to shift toward heightened inflation pressures before too long. Absent a surprisingly weak employment report tomorrow, the quick reversal of the adoption of a statement of balanced risks at the March FOMC meeting would probably confuse market participants and might be read as signaling a considerable deterioration in the Committee’s confidence in economic expansion. In that case, expectations for policy tightening would be pushed back, interest rates could fall substantially, and stock prices and the foreign exchange value of the dollar could decline.]","[In contrast, if the Committee believes that aggregate demand will be stronger than in the staff forecast and that, if policy were to remain unchanged, economic slack will erode fairly soon, then the risks would seem to be weighted toward increased inflation pressures. This more immediate emergence of pressure on resources might eventuate, for example, if economic growth abroad picks up more  quickly than projected by the staff. The Committee might also opt for such a statement if it were concerned about other sources of risks to the inflation outlook, including a widespread jump in health insurance costs, a substantial pass-through of the recent increases in oil prices to prices and wages more generally, and a continuation of the recent weakness in the foreign exchange value of the dollar. While a statement that the risks are weighted toward heightened inflation pressures is consistent with market participants’ expectations for the direction of policy, in light of the perceived tone of recent statements by Federal Reserve officials, such a selection likely would lead investors to move up the timing of their anticipated tightening of policy. As a result, interest rates would rise, especially at shorter maturities, stock prices would fall, and the dollar might appreciate.]","[If the Committee views aggregate demand going forward as likely to be more robust than in the staff forecast, then it might choose a 25 basis point increase in the target federal funds rate at this meeting. With the current real federal funds rate well below its likely equilibrium value, the Committee may believe that the time has come to start the process of moving back toward a more neutral stance in order to reduce the possibility of having to make very rapid adjustments later or risk having inflationpressuresmount.7 Indeed,theCommitteemightviewa25basispointrate hike as merely taking back a portion of the easing undertaken to support the economy in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks, and such a rate increase might be seen as justified since the economic fallout from the attacks has proven to be considerably smaller than had been feared. A 25 basis point move would probably be unlikely to balance the risks to the outlook on this view, and so the balance-of-risks statement would presumably point to risks weighted toward increased inflation pressures. The choice of a 25 basis point tightening move accompanied by a statement that the balance of risks is weighted toward increased inflation pressures would catch market participants off guard. Moreover, there is some evidence that market  expectations are particularly sensitive to policy moves that mark a change in thedirectionofpolicy. As a result , the tightening could have substantial effects on asset prices, as market participants move up the timing and perhaps increase the cumulative size of expected policy actions. Interest rates would likely rise, especially so on shorter-term instruments, equity markets sell off, and the dollar appreciate on foreign exchange markets.]",[nan]

If the Committee agrees with this assessment and finds the associated outcome for inflation to be acceptable, it could elect to leave its policy stance unchanged and retain a statement of balanced risks. Given the current degree of slack in the economy, the Committee can wait until it sees more evidence that sustained strong growth is in train before beginning to remove the current degree of monetary policy ease. The Committee might hold rates unchanged, even if it saw a distinct possibility of a stronger outlook for economic activity than in the Greenbook, if it also viewed the inflation rate as quite unlikely to move higher for a considerable time or to be already at a level members viewed as on the low side of a working definition of price stability. While market participants seem a bit more glum about the economic outlook of late, they probably had outsized expectations to begin with, perhaps inclining the Committee to view the recent deterioration in market prices as a move toward more appropriate valuations rather than as a harbinger of an unacceptably weak economy that would merit a policy response.]","[The Committee could view the incoming data on slowing final demand and the increased skittishness of investors in U.S. financial markets as indicating that at the current funds rate the risks to the Committee’s objective of sustainable economic growth had again begun to outweigh the risks to its goal of maintaining long-run price stability, suggesting that it opt to state that the risks were weighted toward economic weakness while keeping its policy stance on hold. Capital spending has yet to show convincing evidence of a sustained upturn, and recent news on retail sales and consumer confidence has been on the soft side. Indeed, the Committee may sense an increased risk of a severe deterioration in consumer and business confidence that could stem from terrorist attacks or international conflicts or from further news of accounting and corporate governance irregularities. In that same vein, the Committee may be concerned that substantially weaker equity prices may be in the cards, perhaps along the lines of the scenario discussed previously. Appreciably softer real growth than in the Greenbook would augment any tendency for the core inflation rate to decline, a tendency that would be accentuated if the Committee believed that the natural rate of unemployment was significantly lower than estimated by the staff. If the Committee views these arguments as applying with considerable force, it may want to consider easing policy 1/4 percentage point at this meeting. Market participants, however, do not put any weight on this possibility, raising the risk of an outsized, potentially counterproductive, reaction to such a move. Choice of risks weighted mainly toward economic weakness would cause market participants to push back in time the advent of policy tightening and possibly lower the slope of the subsequent trajectory of the funds rate as well.]","[Although the economic expansion has slowed in the second quarter, it has not stalled, and final demand appears to be growing at about the rate the staff expected at the May meeting. Production and employment are advancing, and the incoming data have pointed to a nascent turnaround in business spending on capital equipment and software, which the Committee viewed as essential for a robust recovery. As a consequence, with both monetary and fiscal policy quite stimulative, the Committee may see reasonably strong growth in the second half of the year as now somewhat more assured and view its concerns about the foreseeable future beginning to center more on the long-run inflation risks inherent in its policy stance. Under these circumstances, the Committee could choose to keep policy unchanged but move to a balance of risks tilted toward inflation. Although the Committee may not see an immediate policy adjustment as needed, it might anticipate having to start tightening its policy stance fairly soon and may want to convey that sense to market participants. The current real federal funds rate is much lower than staff estimates of its equilibrium value (as discussed in the box, “Estimates of the Equilibrium Federal Funds Rate,” on the next page). At some point, the prevailing real funds rate would set in motion an excessively robust economic boom that, if sustained, would lead inevitably to higher inflation. If the Committee thought the foreign exchange value of the dollar was now firmly on a downward trend, price pressures might be expected to mount as higher import prices give domestic producers the “pricing power” they have thus far been lacking. In such a case, the Committee might conclude that an immediate tightening of 25 basis points is warranted to start heading off inflationary momentum. Conversely, a switch to a preponderance of risks weighted toward heightened inflation pressures would advance the market’s expectation of the timing of policy firming and possibly increase the extent of anticipated additional tightening as well.]",[nan]

However, the Committee might still view the projected near-term weakness as unlikely to be ameliorated by policy action at this meeting and the prospect for output growth next year to run only a bit in excess of that of aggregate supply as desirable. In the staff outlook, the removal of the expectation of policy tightening in coming quarters has already fostered lower long-term rates that help to offset some of the consequences for spending of recent bad news. If the Committee believes that this configuration of financial market conditions is likely to be supportive of sustainable economic expansion, it might decide to leave the funds rate unchanged and to retain the current statement of balanced risks. The Committee may also favor this policy if it suspects that the staff forecast of aggregate demand is somewhat pessimistic. In that regard, the recent strength in auto purchases and soaring mortgage applications may suggest that household spending will once again outpace expectations, buoyed by a real federal funds rate that is close to zero and still noticeably below estimates of its equilibrium rate. Moreover, as noted in the discussion of alternative simulations in the Greenbook, some measures of the equity premium are now high by historical standards, perhaps raising the odds that equity prices could rebound substantially more than in the baseline and bolster aggregate demand. Market participants would tend to infer from the announcement of an unchanged policy and retention of balanced risks that the FOMC is confident that the expansion is on a sustainable track. Because market participants place some odds on easing at this meeting, they would likely raise the path expected for the funds rate going forward, and short-term yields would edge up. Bond yields would probably tick higher, and, unless this set of actions and the wording of the associated announcement were to give investors more confidence about the durability of the expansion, equity prices would soften. However, greater disappointment by investors-and a more sizable negative reaction in equity markets-cannot be ruled out, in which case bond yields might decline in response.]","[The Committee could find the staffs assessment of underlying economic trends to be plausible but also be concerned that market skittishness, increased
caution in domestic credit markets, and worsening prospects for many emerging financial markets raise the odds of especially adverse economic outcomes. If the Committee does not see these risks as palpable enough to justify policy ease at this time, it may wish to convey to market participants its intent to follow developments especially carefully and its willingness to ease in response to a further dimming in the outlook. In this case, it could choose to keep the federal funds rate unchanged and shift the assessment of the balance of risks toward economic weakness,
while crafting the announcement accordingly. In these circumstances, money market rates would likely decline some, as most market participants would see the likelihood of a near-term ease as having grown. While bond yields might edge off, equity prices could firm to the degree this decision were seen to confirm a vigilant posture against the potential for a downturn.]","[In the current Greenbook, the staff has both raised the path expected for the unemployment rate this year and next and lowered its assessment of the degree of labor market slack consistent with unchanged inflation. While policy action at this meeting is unlikely to leave much of an imprint on economic activity over the balance of this year, the Committee might desire to promote faster economic growth next year than in the Greenbook forecast in order to make more distinct progress in reducing resource slack over time-especially if it believed that inflation would likely remain in a zone near price stability. In that case, the Committee might choose to reduce the federal funds rate 25 basis points. Indeed, as discussed in the box below, the simulation exercise of the FRB/US model dubbed ""perfect foresight"" policy indicates that lowering the funds rate to a bit below 1-1/2 percent would minimize deviations of the unemployment rate from its natural rate and inflation from an  assumed goal that was as low as 1 percent over the extended Greenbook period. That result, of course, depends on a long list of assumptions-including that the staff's assessment of near-term weakness in demand is correct and that the structure of FRB/US is a complete and certain representation of the economy. Alternatively, the Committee might believe that heightened economic uncertainty may restrain household and business spending more than is factored into the Greenbook forecast so as to warrant a quarter-point reduction in the funds rate at this time. Moreover,  the Committee may believe that any additional disinflation could put economic activity and prices uncomfortably close to the point at which the zero nominal bound on short-term interest rates would constrain future policy. Given prevailing market expectations, short-term rates would fall if the Committee were to ease policy at this meeting, but the extent of the drop would depend importantly on the characterization of the balance of risks and the wording of the announcement. If market participants were convinced that the Federal Reserve would ensure that the recovery was not faltering, equity prices would rise and risk spreads fall, while Treasury bond rates would edge higher. However, there is some
chance that market participants might view the easing as implying that the Federal Reserve sees much weaker demand and the economy slipping back into recession. Such an interpretation could put downward pressure on equity prices and bond yields and upward pressure on risk spreads.]",[nan]

Two important hurdles–the August 14 deadline for certifying financial statements and the first anniversary of September 11–passed uneventfully, perhaps suggesting that the Committee’s assessment of the uncertainties surrounding its forecast has narrowed. In addition, the Committee may be concerned that a zero real funds rate will soon pose the risk of imparting excessive stimulus if the forces currently holding down the equilibrium real funds rate lift more quickly than is implicit in the staff forecast, perhaps along the lines of the alternative simulation in the Greenbook. With some measures of the equity premium at their highest levels since the early 1990s, the Committee may see good odds that the stock market and, hence, aggregate demand will rebound more than projected in the Greenbook, especially given the apparent ebbing of investors’ concerns about corporate governance. Announcement of a Committee decision to shift back to balance in its risk assessment, with no change in the funds rate, would likely induce market participants to reevaluate their expectations for policy. Short-term interest rates would rise as the probabilities of policy easings by early next year were lowered. Stock prices would likely fall somewhat initially, while long-term interest rates would be subjected to the cross-currents of higher short-term interest rates but chances of a weaker economy in the intermediate run.]","[If the Committee views the downside risk of economic weakness to be substantial at the current setting of the federal funds rate, especially when compared with the seemingly low odds of a pickup in inflation, it probably would wish to retain a balance-of-risks assessment tilted toward economic weakness. The elevated threat of terrorist attack and concerns about the potential for military action in Iraq may seem to pose significant adverse risks. Even absent such developments, the Committee may consider a sustained expansion of aggregate demand as by no means assured, particularly given continuing questions about businesses’ willingness to hire and spend and the fragility of key emerging markets. Market participants appear to share such qualms in that equity prices are still quite volatile and lower on balance, and corporate risk spreads remain wide. At this juncture, with financial markets quite skittish, the Committee may find it more difficult than usual to predict the market response if policy action does not match prevailing expectations. Futures market quotes indicate that investors on average place just a small probability on a policy easing at this meeting, although they appear to expect at least a quarter point cut in the funds rate by early next year. A policy decision of no change in the funds rate and a balance of risks still pointing toward economic weakness therefore would probably represent only a minor disappointment to market participants and induce just a slight backup in interest rates at shorter maturities and perhaps a modest decline in stock prices. As always, the wording of the announcement will prove important in shaping that market reaction.]","[The Committee may desire to ease policy at this meeting to provide more assurance that economic growth would move up to an acceptable pace. In particular, if the Committee shares the staff’s assessment that the unemployment rate will decline only modestly by 2004, it might see little risk that additional policy ease will revive inflation and a particular benefit in absorbing slack more quickly. Judging by the path of the funds rate in the “policymaker perfect foresight” simulations, a 25 or 50 basis point policy easing at this meeting could be consistent with stable or even declining inflation given the staff’s assessment of longer-term trends and the relationships embedded in the FRB/US model (see box and chart). The Committee may also favor policy easing at this time in light of the possibility that the lack of such a policy adjustment could risk economic weakness and further disinflation. Although household spending and a swing in inventory investment have carried economic activity along to date, the extent of the pickup in capital spending–and therefore sustainable economic expansion–remains uncertain. Indeed, declines in equity prices over the intermeeting period and reductions in longer-term interest rates may well indicate that market participants have become more doubtful on that score as well. Market participants place only small odds on a policy move at this meeting, and domestic bond and stock markets would therefore likely rally if the Committee chose to ease, particularly if the move were 50 basis points. The extent of the rally would also depend on whether market participants interpret the action as an earlier-than-expected completion of the easing already built into market prices or as a harbinger of further easings. That assessment, of course, will depend importantly on the Committee’s judgment on the balance of risks and the wording of its announcement.]",[nan]

Such an outcome may be seen as broadly consistent with the Greenbook forecast, in which output growth slowly builds momentum. The Committee may be particularly drawn to this policy approach if it views the current degree of slack in resource use to be less pronounced than does the staff and hence sees less scope for further disinflation than is embodied in the staff forecast. In addition, while estimates of the equilibrium real short-term interest rate have moved lower over the past year–and some have been revised down ex post–the actual real rate has been below the lower bound of the range of estimates since mid-2001. Even with the narrowing in that gap projected for the current quarter, the Committee may be of the view that sufficient monetary stimulus is already in the pipeline given the lagsinthetransmissionofpolicy. Indeed,theCommitteemaybelievethat the Greenbook forecast, which is somewhat below the consensus outlook, is overly pessimistic regarding prospects for aggregate demand. As noted in the box on page 8, while the staff projection for the next two years shows lower inflation and a higher unemployment rate than in the prior few Greenbooks, the recent realizations of those variables have moved the other way. In the current quarter, higher energy prices have boosted inflation and gains in estimates of household employment have been associated with a lower unemployment rate than was thought likely a couple of months ago. The Committee might be inclined to keep policy on hold if it put more weight on those outcomes than on forecast revisions. Market prices appear to embody significant odds that the Committee will ease policy at this meeting. Accordingly, a decision to leave policy unchanged, presumably accompanied by the assessment expected in the markets that the risks remain tilted toward economic weakness, is likely to have a noticeable effect on asset prices. Interest rates could move up, particularly at the short end of the yield curve, and equity prices would probably fall. The balance-of-risks statement, the wording of the rest of the announcement, and the vote tally will influence the odds investors
place on policy easing going forward and thus affect the response of financial markets.]","[The Committee instead might ease policy 25 basis points if, in view of signs of slowing aggregate demand growth, it now sees the likely degree of economic slack several quarters ahead with an unchanged stance of policy as unacceptable, especially given subdued readings on inflation expectations and the prospects for further disinflation. The incoming data suggest that spending by both households and businesses has been weaker than expected by the staff, and the Committee might be concerned that economic growth could turn out slower than in the Greenbook outlook. Also, whether financial conditions will prove to be as supportive of growth as the staff expects is open to question: Credit spreads and liquidity conditions in segments of the corporate bond market have deteriorated, and banks have continued to firm terms and standards on business loans, albeit in fewer numbers than earlier in the year. With some large financial intermediaries themselves encountering market resistance, their ability to make markets and intermediate credit flows could be crimped to a greater degree than anticipated by the staff, potentially contributing to some diminution in market liquidity and credit availability. In these circumstances, the Committee may believe the time has come to bolster spending by easing policy. Presumably, the Committee would see a relatively small policy adjustment of 25 basis points as not likely to put the risks back into balance, particularly in view of the apparent weakening in the economic outlook since the last meeting. A 25-basis-point reduction in the target federal funds rate, coupled with a statement that the risks remained weighted toward economic weakness, likely would provide a small boost to financial markets, lowering yields and raising stock prices, although the magnitude of these influences could be affected considerably by the content of the Committee’s statement.]","[The Committee might view the signs of softening growth that have become apparent over the past six weeks as especially troubling in association with historically low inflation and nominal interest rates as well as the significant downside risks already envisioned by the Committee since August. In these circumstances, the Committee might wish to move aggressively to shore up aggregate demand through a 50-basis-point easing of policy and might see little cost to doing so in terms of a need to reverse course anytime soon. Indeed, the policymaker perfect foresight simulations that employ a judgmental extension of the Greenbook assumptions and are depicted in chart 7 entail a substantial near-term easing of monetary policy, even with an inflation target as low as 1 percent. Moreover, while those simulations by definition assume no uncertainty in forecasting economic relationships, the Committee might be concerned that weaker spending propensities or more favorable inflation-output tradeoffs could well result in still lower inflation rates. The possibility of significant further disinflation might be viewed as unduly heightening the risk that the ability to lower real interest rates could be constrained by the zero bound to nominal rates. Although the Committee might be reluctant to claim that a 25-basis- point easing would balance the risks to the economy and inflation, a move of 50 basis points might more plausibly do so. A 50-basis-point cut in the funds rate target, even if accompanied by a statement that the risks to the outlook were seen as balanced, likely would prompt sizable drops in yields across the maturity and credit spectrums, although the fall in long-term Treasury yields could be limited if equity markets rally strongly.]",[nan]

Standard relationships suggest that, given the lags in the effects of monetary policy, last year’s easings are still supporting growth in aggregate demand, and November’s action, which moved the real federal funds rate more distinctly into negative territory, created a larger gap below the band of estimated equilibrium real rates (chart 3). In view of the stimulus that is already in place, the Committee may wish to await the arrival of more information, possibly including the economic implications of any military conflict, before adjusting its policy stance. The Committee may believe that, given the current stance of policy, the low odds but high costs of marked further disinflation (or even outright deflation) and the economic weakness that presumably would attend such a development roughly balance the arguably higher odds but lower costs of increased inflation and an unsustainable pace of growth. Thus, the Committee may believe that retaining the current degree of policy accommodation would be consistent with an assessment of balanced risks. Given that market participants see little chance of a shift in either the funds rate target or the assessment of risks at this meeting, a choice that matches this expectation should not have any appreciable effect on market prices. ]","[If the Committee sees a need for additional insurance against excessive disinflation and economic weakness, it may want to implement a further 25 basis point reduction in its funds rate target at this meeting while maintaining an assessment of balanced risks. The available evidence suggests only a small increase in real GDP this quarter, and the recovery in GDP growth from the current “soft spot” is still largely a forecast, so that a much weaker outcome cannot be ruled out. Some combination of anemic real growth and a more favorable inflation-output tradeoff could cause the inflation rate over the next couple of years to run noticeably below the staff projection, potentially constraining the Committee’s ability to lower real interest rates if the need were to arise. Even abstracting from uncertainties, the Committee might concur with the Greenbook’s revised projections for output and resource use under the policy assumption of that forecast but still regard them to be unacceptably weak and to warrant further stimulus, as in the policymaker perfect foresight simulations portrayed in chart 4. Should the further policy easing eventually prove to have been unnecessary, the likely persistence of some economic slack for at least the next several quarters suggests that the move could probably be reversed before any damage was done to the Committee’s longer-run inflation objectives. An easing of 25 basis points, however, would surprise investors, and the resulting fall in short-term interest rates could carry over in part to bond yields. Stock prices could rise as prospective earnings are discounted at lower interest rates and, perhaps, as investors revise up their outlook for earnings. The value of the dollar might move lower in line with the reduction in fixed-income yields. However, if equity markets rally strongly, these effects on bond yields and the dollar could well be reversed.]",[nan],[nan]

Given the lags in monetary policy, the Committee may view the near-term increase in economic slack as inevitable and be satisfied that the existing policy stance will help to return economic growth to a pace above that of its potential by the second half of this year. Indeed, with private yields lower and the dollar weaker than in December, the Committee may be more convinced that the existing financial stimulus will be adequate to achieve satisfactory economic growth with low inflation, especially given the odds of more substantial fiscal impetus. While considerable uncertainty surrounds estimates of equilibrium interest rates (as addressed in the box below), the current real funds rate is negative and below nearly all current estimates of its equilibrium level. Even though economic slack persists through 2004, the Committee may place slim odds on the possibility that disinflation would cumulate to the point that core inflation becomes unacceptably low. To date, inflation expectations have remained stable, and the response of inflation to resource slack has been very sluggish. Moreover, the Committee may view the staff’s estimates of the natural rate of unemployment or of the trend of structural productivity as too optimistic. In that regard, the Committee may now see upside risks (perhaps in the form of a sharp revival of private spending, greater-than- expected fiscal stimulus, or a steeper dollar depreciation than is built into the staff forecast) as well balanced with downside risks (including the failure of business confidence to recover or more protracted tensions around the globe). According to futures markets and surveys, market participants see only very slim odds of an easing of policy at this meeting and only a few expect a change in the balance-of-risks statement. Market prices would therefore likely react little to a Committee decision that confirmed those expectations, absent a change in the tone of the announcement.]","[Alternatively, the Committee may choose to ease policy 25 basis points at this meeting to make faster progress than in the Greenbook baseline in reducing economic slack, which runs along a higher path than in the prior forecast. For example, the policymaker perfect foresight simulations indicate that near-term easing would bring the unemployment rate more quickly to its natural rate, even with a
1 percent core PCE inflation target and an element of interest-rate smoothing (see chart). The case for easing would be strengthened if the Committee believes that current inflation is already at the lower end of its desirable range so that the further disinflation in the Greenbook should be avoided. Moreover, the Committee might be concerned that inflation could well fall short of the path in the Greenbook absent an easing, producing a firming in the real short-term interest rate. The Committee might put particular weight on that possibility if it believes that, owing to the global threats, continued capital overhangs, and lingering business pessimism, the chance of further sluggish investment and hiring remains unacceptably high. In such a circumstance, the Committee may see additional stimulus as needed to support overall spending until business confidence can recover. In addition, while the staff has read the continuing weakness in the labor market as signaling higher structural productivity, the Committee may place sizable odds on the view that the same data augur more sluggish economic activity than in the Greenbook forecast. ]",[nan],[nan]

To be sure, global tensions have escalated in recent weeks, and the uncertainties associated with developments in Iraq and the attendant rise in oil prices seem to be weighing heavily on financial markets and restraining economic activity. But the Committee may believe that a significant portion of these fundamental uncertainties will be resolved before long and–as was the case following the onset of the Gulf War in 1991–lead to a notable improvement in financial market conditions (Chart 5). Moreover, although many observers have worried that higher oil prices may continue to depress spending, as discussed in the Greenbook, it is persistent increases in oil prices that have materially adverse implications for activity. In fact, futures and options data suggest that market participants do not expect the currently elevated level and uncertainty about oil prices to persist (Chart 6). Moreover, while the nominal price of oil has approached historical highs, the recent spike does not appear outsized in real terms. Even if the Committee is concerned that the pace of economic growth could remain subpar once some of the current uncertainties have been resolved, it still may see a considerable advantage to deferring policy action at this time in order to await more information about geopolitical developments. Indeed, inaction at this meeting might seem especially attractive if the Committee wants to preserve the option of easing forcefully if events turn unexpectedly adverse in coming weeks. Moreover, in the current environment, the response of the economy to policy action at this meeting might be viewed as quite uncertain, and models of optimal monetary policy under uncertainty would counsel gradualism in adjusting policy.]","[The Committee might interpret some of the recent data, particularly the February employment report, as pointing to a weaker trend in economic activity than it previously thought–and one that might well persist even if global tensions were to diminish markedly in the weeks ahead. Against this backdrop, the Committee might conclude that a policy easing at this meeting is appropriate. Indeed, the current setting of the real federal funds rate no longer lies below the lower bound of the range of staff estimates of equilibrium real rates (Chart 7). As a result, members might conclude that a cut in the nominal funds rate would be necessary just to maintain the effective stance of policy established at the November meeting. The Committee might consider a quarter-point policy easing as a measured response to a projected shortfall of economic growth below that of potential this year.  As noted, market prices can be interpreted as incorporating some odds on a policy move at this meeting, but a quarter-point easing is far from fully priced in. As a result, either a quarter-point or half-point easing at this meeting would have a substantial element of surprise.]","[However, the Committee might instead favor a more aggressive half-point policy easing if the possibility of especially adverse shocks and the constraints on policy posed by the zero bound to nominal interest rates loomed large in its thinking. The apparent stability of inflation expectations in the face of higher oil prices and a weaker dollar along with the Greenbook projection for further declines in core inflation from already low levels might be viewed as arguing for the more aggressive policy action, inasmuch as its potential cost in terms of higher risks of inflation pressures would appear to be minimal. Indeed, the Committee might even welcome a small uptick in projected inflation. Moreover, the market response to a successful prosecution of war in Iraq is not entirely clear.]",[nan]

The projected pickup in the growth of activity, albeit gradual, does suggest that maintaining the current stance of policy would be consistent with a narrowing of the output gap by the end of next year. Indeed, the Committee might anticipate that economic slack will be worked down more quickly, and downward pressures on inflation diminished correspondingly sooner, than in the Greenbook. In particular, the Committee might see substantial odds that aggregate demand will grow more vigorously than portrayed in the Greenbook. With the war concluded, business confidence could rebound sharply and, combined with the improvement in consumer sentiment and financial market conditions already seen, prove more supportive of growth than projected by the staff. In addition, the forthcoming degree of fiscal stimulus, which currently is being debated in the Congress, could well turn out to be greater than assumed in the Greenbook. Even if the Committee expects aggregate demand growth about in line with that of the staff forecast, it might still expect the output gap to shrink more quickly if it is less optimistic about productivity growth. If so, the Committee may regard the further disinflation projected by the staff as less likely, despite the recent subdued price data, a view that might be reinforced by the observation that core PCE inflation shows no discernable trend over the past few years and other readings on inflation show mixed changes.]","[If the Committee instead found the Greenbook projection of only sluggish progress in closing the output gap over the next six quarters with a PCE inflation rate of 1 percent at the end of the projection period to be credible but undesirable, it might choose to ease monetary policy at this meeting. In particular, concerns about a protracted output gap may be especially pressing in the current circumstances of surprisingly low inflation. Indeed, as shown in Chart 6, the real short-term federal funds rate does not differ much from the level prevailing before the Committee’s November 6th policy easing. Cutting the nominal funds rate at this meeting may be appropriate to reestablish the previously sought spread of the actual real funds rate below its estimated equilibrium. Going forward, a further decline in inflation from its already low level, by limiting the scope for reductions in short-term interest rates, could inordinately constrain the ability of monetary policy to provide stimulus in response to an adverse shock to spending at some later date. Even if the Committee saw the risks surrounding the projected paths of aggregate demand and inflation in the Greenbook as symmetric, it might view the costs of falling unexpectedly short of either of those paths in coming quarters as larger than the costs of an overage. In that case, the regret associated with easing policy and subsequently discovering that it was unnecessary would presumably be small relative to that of holding the funds rate at 11⁄4 percent and eventually learning that a lower level would have been appropriate. An easing of policy would come as some surprise to financial markets, and short-term yields would fall substantially. Bond yields likely would drop as well, and equity prices should increase. ]",[nan],[nan]

Such a policy move, by preserving much of the recent rally in financial markets, would provide support to aggregate demand, thereby helping to counter any tendency toward further substantial disinflation, which the Committee announced would be unwelcome in its statement after the May meeting. This benefit to the economy may be seen as coming at a low cost, in that an unwanted upsurge in inflation may be viewed as unlikely in an environment in which the level of output lies well below that of its estimated potential and inflation expectations remain subdued. Indeed, inflation expectations may have ticked lower of late, necessitating a moderate downward adjustment of the nominal rate to keep the real interest rate from rising. Should the action prove to be unnecessary, it could readily be unwound before any material harm is done. And even if inflation picked up a bit, the Committee might see that rise as desirable to increase the size of the cushion against the possibility of having to approach the zero bound on the nominal federal funds rate. Indeed, the alternative long-run scenarios suggest that the Committee may be able to hold the nominal funds rate near 1 percent for a considerable period of time without putting significant upward pressure on inflation.]","[Alternatively, the Committee may find the case for a 50 basis point cut in the funds rate to a level of 75 basis points to be persuasive. The Committee may wish to push harder against the persistent substantial output gap, which the staff has recently revised upward slightly to an estimated 23⁄4 percentage points of GDP in the second quarter. As seen in Chart 7, with the real federal funds rate edging higher and some estimates of its equilibrium level moving lower, a 50 basis point easing may be seen as necessary merely to restore the degree of stimulus in place late last year. If the Committee thinks that the Greenbook is too optimistic about spending–perhaps because the effects of higher oil prices of late are underplayed–then it may be especiallyconcernedaboutthechanceoffurtherdisinflationaswell.4 Evenifthe Committee agrees with the Greenbook assessment of the economy, it may believe that the projected inflation rate would be uncomfortably low given the problems likely to emerge if the economy were to experience adverse shocks and the zero bound were to become an important constraint on policy. In this regard, the Committee may believe that a 50 basis point cut in the funds rate could be taken back later, if need be, at less cost to the economy than that potentially incurred by not moving now and increasing the difficulty of countering future economic weakness because the zero floor to the nominal funds rate became a binding constraint.]","[If the Committee is reasonably confident that underlying economic growth will turn out at least as strong as projected by the staff, it may view the consequences of an unchanged funds rate as the best that are feasible, given the lags with which monetary policy works. In fact, because the staff would forecast rapid GDP expansion over the next six quarters even with an unchanged funds rate, the Committee may view any policy easing at this meeting as risking excessive pressures on resources, exacerbating existing imbalances, or feeding an overshooting in financial markets. This concern could be especially pronounced if the Committee thinks that additional easing would probably induce faster economic growth or a lower unemployment rate than the staff foresees. Especially with the mounting fiscal stimulus evidently in train, the Committee may anticipate that a reduction in monetary accommodation will be called for in the not-too-distant future, and another ease at this meeting would make such a tightening action more sizable than otherwise. Instead, the Committee may wish to continue to await more readings on the economy collected after the Iraq war before reconsidering the need for any further easing action.]",[nan]

Such an outlook may prompt the Committee to keep policy unchanged at this meeting. Even if policymakers would prefer faster progress in boosting rates of resource utilization in the near term, they might believe that, given the usual lags in the effects of policy, an easing now would not significantly affect the economy until a brisk expansion likely was already underway. Thus, the Committee might anticipate that, with a flat federal funds rate, the projected outcomes for real activity, resource use, and inflation are about the best that can be achieved. Moreover, Committee members might view the backup in longer-term interest rates over the past few weeks in part as signaling that the economy could be even stronger than forecast by the staff, reflecting a recent fundamental improvement in business confidence and spending propensities (see the box entitled “Changes in Yields and Revisions to Market Expectations for Economic Activity”). The Committee might also continue to consider substantial further disinflation to be unlikely. Core PCE inflation in the Greenbook moves down only a little next year and, judging by the central tendencies of the inflation projections reported in July, policymakers foresee even less disinflationary pressure than the staff. With the risk of deflation apparently remote and the zero bound on the funds rate still a full percentage point away, policymakers may prefer to keep policy on hold for a time while assessing inflation trends and the strength of the pickup in economic activity, including the response of spending to the additional tax cuts that have just begun to show up in disposable income. Market participants apparently see almost no chance of a policy move or shift in the FOMC’s assessment of risks at this meeting. Financial markets therefore would tend to react little to a Committee decision that confirmed those expectations, although the wording of the announcement could have a noticeable.]","[Even if the Committee believes that a pickup in economic growth is in train, as in the staff forecast, it may prefer to take action to reduce resource slack more quickly than in that outlook, and in the process diminish the risk of substantial further disinflation, by easing 25 basis points at this meeting. The Committee might view the downward revision to projected growth next year resulting from the jump in bond rates as unacceptable and as warranting a prompt policy response. Also, the Committee might believe that the trajectory of inflation in the Greenbook is too low to provide a sufficient buffer against the zero bound on nominal interest rates in coming years and might wish to foster a slightly higher path for inflation by easing policy further. Alternatively, policymakers may anticipate that firms and households will be more cautious about spending than the staff expects, perhaps along the lines of the “prolonged subpar investment” or “weaker fiscal response” alternative simulations in the Greenbook. Even apart from concerns about continued sluggishness in aggregate demand, Committee members may have revised down their inflation projections over the intermeeting period because of supply-side considerations, such as productivity growth that has persistently come in on the high side of expectations. In addition, short-term inflation expectations, as measured by the Michigan survey, have edged lower of late, as have measures of actual core consumer price inflation that sometimes are used as proxies for anticipated inflation, and expectations seem likely to edge down further as actual inflation drifts lower. A policy easing might be seen as desirable to prevent a rise in the real funds rate and, perhaps, to move it back below the range of estimated equilibrium values (Chart 5). A 25-basis-point cut in the funds rate accompanied by maintenance of the current risk assessment would surprise markets and likely induce a comparable decline in short-term interest rates. To the extent that the move was seen as a reaffirmation of an intent to keep the federal funds rate low for a considerable period and, more particularly, as a reaction to the backup in longer-term yields, bond and stock markets also might rally considerably.]",[nan],[nan]

If so, the Committee might elect to leave the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting. Indeed , the Committee might find both plausible and attractive the Greenbook projection that inflation remains fairly stable at around 1 percent, which may be seen as consistent with a working definition of price stability. Alternatively, the Committee might be concerned about risks that inflation could move higher either because it sees the current stance of policy as likely to foster a more substantial pickup in spending or because it views the outlook for structural productivity or for the sustainable level of resource utilization as less favorable than does the staff. Financial market quotes, which appear to be conditioned on an expectation of no further policy easing and some unwinding of current policy accommodation next year, might be read as indicating that investors expect the output gap to close rapidly. In these circumstances, the Committee might feel most comfortable assessing incoming data to determine whether further adjustments in fact will be necessary to return aggregate production to its potential at an acceptable pace.]","[Should the Committee, by contrast, find the Greenbook assessment plausible but wish to make more rapid progress against economic slack or harbor concerns that 1 percent inflation is already too low, it might choose to ease policy by 25 basis points at this meeting. The Committee might be especially troubled that persistence of the already-protracted sluggishness in the labor market could undermine household confidence and spending and call into question the sustainability of the expansion. Although further easing would affect the economy only with a lag, such action would almost certainly help to boost aggregate demand and employment next year. Along those lines, a policy easing might be warranted to bring the actual real federal funds rate closer to, or even below, the lower end of the estimated range of its equilibrium values, as it was in late 2001 and much of 2002 (Chart 4). Even if the pace of output growth forecast in the Greenbook were seen not only as most likely but also as generally acceptable, the Committee might view the cost of erring on the side of policy accommodation as small at this time given that inflation is low and inflation expectations are well anchored. If Committee members viewed the prevailing inflation rate as already close to the lower end of their preferred range, somewhat stronger economic expansion than in the staff forecast might even be seen as desirable to limit the risk of disinflation and possibly even to foster a higher inflation rate.]",[nan],[nan]

The recent strength in spending may have led the Committee to trim its assessment of the possibility of a significant decline in inflation and, perhaps, the risk of adverse feedback to aggregate demand should such a decline eventuate. Moreover, financial conditions would now seem to be providing more support for spending than at the time of the September meeting, and possibly enough to lead the Committee to see more robust growth in aggregate demand going forward than the staff projects. Indeed, current estimates place the real federal funds rate below the range of equilibrium values derived from variousstaffmodels(Chart5).7 EveniftheCommitteeisconcernedthateconomic slack could persist for a substantial time, it might think that any additional easing undertaken at this meeting would not–given the lags with which policy affects spending–have a noticeable impact until the economic expansion was far enough along to make additional stimulus undesirable. Alternatively, Committee members–like many private forecasters–may expect inflation pressures to emerge faster than in the staff projection. For instance, relative to the Greenbook, the Committee may see less resource slack currently or be more worried that very rapid output growth could put pressure on prices even as some slack in resources remained. Given these possibilities, the Committee may feel that it is best to await additional information on aggregate demand and supply before adjusting policy further.]","[If, however, the Committee is concerned that growth may not remain rapid enough to return output to its potential reasonably promptly and so limit any
further decline in inflation, then it might choose to cut the target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at this meeting. While the Committee may be convinced that the economy has been growing robustly and will continue to do so over the remainder of this year, it may fear that the expansion could sputter in 2004. In particular, firms may remain cautious in their spending, hiring, and inventory control, implying continued restraint on aggregate demand growth as the impetus from this summer’s tax cuts ebbs. Even if the Committee thinks that the most likely outcome is one in which output growth is sufficient to reduce resource slack at an acceptable pace, it might want to err on the side of more accommodative policy given that inflation is low, inflation expectations are apparently well anchored, and the costs of a further decline in inflation likely outweigh those of a modest increase. Indeed, Committee members may see the current level of inflation as near the bottom of the range that they would like to achieve in the longer term, given the asymmetries caused by the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates and other possible nominal rigidities.]",[nan],[nan]

The Committee might see the recent strength in overall spending and the apparent waning of business caution evidenced by the upturn in hiring and pickup in investment as signs that a more robust expansion is now under way and that the threat of a significant decline in inflation has receded. Even if the Committee is somewhat concerned that growth could still falter, it might see that risk as being balanced by the possibility that the expansion could outpace expectations, particularly in view of recent data. And, alternatively, even if the Committee believes that the next policy move will probably be toward tightening in view of recent strong growth and the relatively low real federal funds rate (chart 4), it might also believe that the tightening process need not begin any time soon in light of the current low level of inflation and substantial degree of resource slack.]","[If, however, the Committee is especially concerned that economic growth may not remain rapid enough to return output to its potential reasonably promptly and that resource slack may contribute to a significant further decline in inflation, then it might choose to cut the target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at this meeting. Though most incoming data of late have pointed to a strengthening in economic activity, the Committee might see this surge in demand as likely to be only temporary, perhaps along the lines of the “weaker household spending” simulation in the Greenbook. Evidence that might be taken as supporting this view could include the apparent substantial deceleration in personal consumption expenditures in the current quarter, the contraction in the broad monetary aggregates and bank credit, continued tepid growth in business debt, and a moderation in household borrowing. In such circumstances, a quarter-point easing at this meeting might be seen as desirable to foster a continuation of brisk growth in output and an acceptably rapid closing of the output gap. Furthermore, members may regard the prevailing rate of inflation as near the bottom of a range that they view as desirable over the longer run and may wish to implement a policy stance that reduces downside risks to growth while increasing the scope for inflation to move up somewhat over time.]",[nan],[nan]

The Committee might interpret the recent strength in private spending, and particularly the rebound in manufacturing, as signs that a more robust expansion is under way and that the threat of a pernicious decline in inflation has receded further. Although the Committee may continue to see sizable odds on inflation edging lower, it may assign only modest cost to such an outcome if associated with faster-than-expected productivity growth rather than with unanticipated and potentially self-feeding weakness in aggregate demand. With economic growth rebounding and substantial monetary stimulus still in place, the Committee may even view disinflation risks as about offset by the probability that inflation pressures will be stronger than in the Greenbook. But even if the Committee believes that the next policy move will likely be a tightening, it might also judge that the process need not begin at this meeting because of the current low inflation rate and persistent resource slack. In particular, it may still see the costs of an accommodative policy stance as low in the current environment when weighed against the benefits of possibly countering an unexpected weakening in the expansion of private spending.]","[ By contrast, if the Committee is concerned, in light of recent unexpectedly soft inflation readings and weakness in the labor market, that economic growth may not remain rapid enough to remove resource slack before inflation declines significantly further, then it might choose to cut the target federal funds rate 25 basis points at this meeting. Though incoming data have pointed to a strengthening in private spending, the economic expansion may fail to gain traction if business confidence is set back or consumer demand is eroded by continued sluggish employment growth. The lackluster demand for funds by businesses, continuing contraction of M2 and bank credit, and higher energy prices may add to such concerns. Even if the economy expands as rapidly as predicted in the Greenbook, the slowdown in actual productivity growth projected by the staff may fail to materialize, implying further disinflation that, while not of the pernicious variety, may be unwelcome. Indeed, members may regard the prevailing rate of inflation as near the bottom of a range that they view as desirable over the longer run and may wish to implement a policy setting that reduces downside risks to growth while increasing the scope for inflation to move up somewhat over time, such as depicted in the longer- run scenario of Chart 5 in which the inflation goal is assumed to be 1-1/2 percent.]","[Abstracting from the current stance of its communications with the public, the Committee might wish to consider a possible tightening of policy that would begin to remove some of the prevailing substantial degree of monetary ease. The economy now seems to be growing robustly, and over the last two years the real funds rate has been about zero, roughly around the lower edge of a range of estimated equilibrium values of this rate (Chart 8). Moreover, the Committee may put a high probability on the emergence of stronger inflation pressures, similar to that envisioned in many private sector forecasts. Indeed, an early tightening could help restrain inflation expectations, which remain above the current inflation rate. Given the Committee’s stated commitment to keep policy accommodative for a considerable period, a tightening at this meeting may not be in the cards. However, concerns that inflation pressures could arise more quickly than generally expected might induce the Committee to adjust its communications to better reflect its weighing of such expectations for policy.]",[nan]

backed securities .', ' the committee may wish to give the stimulus produced by the combination of all these policies a chance to show its effects , while at the same time leaving open the possibility of a further reduction in the target rate and the implementation of more unconventional policy actions should macroeconomic conditions fail to improve .', ' a reduction in the target rate to ½ percent that is matched by a comparable reduction in the interest rate on excess reserves would likely cause federal funds to trade below the new target .', ' even so , the committee may still want to set a target of ½ percent to signal where it would want federal funds to trade once financial conditions begin to improve , some federal reserve programs are unwound , and the amount of excess reserves in the system returns to a more normal level .', ' as a third motivation for favoring alternative c , members may view a decision to reduce the target rate by 50 basis points as an intermediate step towards reaching a level of rates closer to the zero bound at a later date .', ' such an approach would be consistent with the staff ’s assumption in the greenbook projection , the prescriptions of a number of policy rules , and the optimal control simulations with an inflation target of either 1½ or 2 percent described in the monetary policy strategies section of this bluebook .', ' even if members are not concerned that a sustained environment of very low interest rates will be particularly harmful to certain financial markets and institutions , they may still believe that making the move toward the zero bound in two steps would be preferable on the grounds that it would allow market participants more time to adjust to a world of near - zero interest rates .', ' in addition , the committee may feel that such a gradual approach would not be overly costly in terms of its macroeconomic objectives since further monetary stimulus could be provided through additional unconventional policy measures .', ' finally , an inclination to ease policy 50 basis points at this meeting might be reinforced by the fact that most market participants appear to expect a 50 basis point reduction in the target rate , and committee members might be reluctant to inject further uncertainty into financial markets at a time when markets remain extremely fragile .', '-- ( 41 ) the rationale section of the statement accompanying alternative c begins by acknowledging that economic activity is contracting in the fourth quarter and by pointing to deterioration in labor markets , household and business spending , and class', '-- the language on inflation remains unchanged from the october meeting , and the last paragraph acknowledges , as in alternative c , that federal funds may continue to trade below the target for some time .']","['-- i fomc -
